11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,359
be honest I think we've just been doing

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,239
our respective things but nevertheless

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,738

14
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,718

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,560
our uh usual awards for the year

26
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,658
including strain of the Year breeder of

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,299
the Year hottest new breeder on the

28
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,359
Block we've got some hall of fames some

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,340
shout outs and uh maybe some final

30
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,040
thoughts at the end hopefully that

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,780
sounds pretty good to everyone

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:27,659
uh so the first award we'll do this year

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,219
we might do uh the strain of the year or

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,740
clone of the year we've sort of combined

35
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,118
them together you know it's uh it's if

36
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,978
you want to call it a strain of the year

37
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,438
and it comes from seeds no problem but

38
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,819
we'll also count clones in this category

39
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,739
so

40
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,798
gosh I'm trying to remind myself now

41
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:46,500
what won it last year

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,020
the year before that it was Mac we

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,359
definitely did like runs we're ahead of

44
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:54,000
the curve on runs and then runs one and

45
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,399
then oh yeah yeah last year ice cream

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,060
cake and what a [ __ ] good pick that

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,939
was man yeah now that if you've seen

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,759
that show at that TV show

49
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:09,060
all right cool so I mean let's think I

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,818
gotta be honest I saw a lot of Oreos

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,819
this past year this past uh what we say

52
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:17,399
15 months or so

53
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:22,019
and I was considering that for a bit but

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,900
I also saw a large sort of group of

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,300
disparaging comments saying that um you

56
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,159
know all look no substance I haven't had

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,840
it myself so I can't comment on that but

58
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,239
that was definitely one I had in the mix

59
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,539
was there anything you sort of had in

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,340
the mix before we revealed the winner

61
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,799
oh I don't know what your winner is yeah

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,920
you don't you know I I wasn't leaked the

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,140
list uh but uh

64
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,479
well I just I I know what I know what I

65
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,399
think is gonna flood the the West Coast

66
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,500
Market

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,599
what's that

68
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,400
jealousy

69
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,199
I'm not sure if that's your take that's

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,500
a pretty good pick

71
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,839
I said I I saw I must have seen if I saw

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,759
if I saw one I saw a thousand and one

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,759
Cuts flying out of the animal cut for

74
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,399
sure like no question uh that will be

75
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,959
grown and that's the situation with the

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,060
Clone is that you have the same thing

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,319
that everybody else has unfortunately

78
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,360
um with a c you're guaranteed something

79
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,098
unique of course I'm pushing seeds but

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,599
you know

81
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:25,018
that's going to be in every Greenhouse

82
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,339
by the thousand and I guarantee in six

83
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,900
months we're gonna look back and we're

84
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,939
gonna say man I can get jealousy for ten

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,819
bucks a grand you know cheap as hell out

86
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,318
there so I would say that one or I don't

87
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:36,958
know if you're extended there's this one

88
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,299
but the Gary Payton

89
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,060
that's a pretty good guess as well I

90
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,980
definitely had those two in my top

91
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,780
selections didn't actually get the

92
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,699
winner though so that's cool because we

93
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,000
sort of sort of collectively covered

94
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,339
them all I guess for this last one this

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,919
last year I should say that

96
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,680
the thing that I considered was both

97
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,859
what I saw in flower but also what I saw

98
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,319
a lot of breeders incorporating into

99
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,959
their repertoire so

100
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:11,658
really popular among some of the more

101
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:14,400
heady breeders in my book so the

102
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:16,978
2021-2022 strain of the Year clone of

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,819
the year goes to none other than Lumpy's

104
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,819
apple fritter

105
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,980
[Music]

106
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,259
on that one uh definitely uh with

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,139
jealousy it's gonna be everywhere apple

108
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,580
fritter is a more tightly held cotton

109
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,259
that you know a certain group of

110
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,060
breeders definitely got their hands on a

111
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,040
great strain has been used definitely

112
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,899
everybody's kind of used it I've seen a

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,900
lot of different crosses with it

114
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,939
um no it's a yeah like that's it like

115
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,198
Skittles ugly plant but breeds true you

116
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,939
know have a fairly decision great plant

117
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,439
so I definitely interested to use a

118
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,939
bunch and yeah

119
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,978
for sure

120
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,959
yeah it's one of those ones that's sort

121
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:56,459
of been gaining momentum for a few years

122
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,079
now but I've definitely seen a lot of

123
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:00,359
really killer crosses coming out with it

124
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,399
in it and I also think it's good you

125
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,800
know like shout out to lump status a guy

126
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,620
who's contributed a lot of really cool

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,360
clones to the scene

128
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,300
um a part of that original crew with

129
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,879
like you know ABF Frost boss nor Cali

130
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,460
c-mag those guys from the Bay Area just

131
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,639
putting in work over the past 15 years

132
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:22,379
or so so yeah congrats apple fritter

133
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,780
it's everywhere

134
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,620
um notably I've seen some sick hybrids

135
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:31,019
skunk VA posts some they look cool I've

136
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,899
also been iron off Bloom's done an Apple

137
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:35,459
Fritter hybrid that's cool as well

138
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:36,899
um yeah a lot of cool ones in the

139
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,538
Woodworks

140
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:43,439
and so the next category we're going to

141
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:46,019
take a look see at will actually be

142
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,959
let's do the Hall of Fame let's get that

143
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,879
one out of the way

144
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:53,219
it's uh the Hall of Fame for us is

145
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,779
actually always a strain not a person so

146
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,840
we're thinking about what strains have

147
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:00,179
contributed significantly over the years

148
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,159
recent or Years Gone by that have really

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,259
sort of guided the way paved the

150
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,600
landscape for future strains to roll on

151
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,120
through uh so we're always sort of

152
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,919
looking back in this category and I

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,699
think there's a lot of really good

154
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,620
contenders so after considering all the

155
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,300
things I just mentioned I'm thinking

156
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,199
that this year we're going to actually

157
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,139
go with blueberry from DJ Short

158
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,080
it's uh really a body of work that's

159
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,379
hard to ignore both in terms of its own

160
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,418
Merit standing individually as a strain

161
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:36,240
the uh the F1 hybrids that come off it

162
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:38,818
in DJ's Arsenal or that have lineage and

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,538
commonality with it uh such as you know

164
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:44,580
things like the f-13 and the trueberry

165
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:46,680
all of these strains tried and tested

166
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:49,500
but I think one of the other Testaments

167
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,860
to the blueberry family is that there is

168
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,959
a huge arguably bigger body of work that

169
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,379
exists from what others have done with

170
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,538
it outside of What DJ has done so you

171
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,939
know the the list of clones is literally

172
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:05,639
endless I could name a few you know even

173
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,399
obvious one you know Blue Dream haha but

174
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,220
like even if we get even more into it

175
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,818
like I've had strains like um Blue

176
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,120
Diamond I've had a whole range of really

177
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:20,039
cool blueberry crosses from AK Bean

178
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,139
brains because he's done some cool work

179
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,719
with it likewise my favorite stream

180
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,660
remain in seed form the blue Magoo comes

181
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,639
from the blueberry it's it's really you

182
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,439
can't overstate how much of an impact

183
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,120
this work has had and I think there's a

184
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,579
famous quote that's been said that

185
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,199
something like 40 of all the plans

186
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,899
tested at philos or something had

187
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,819
commonalities with blueberry and I think

188
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,978
there has been some healthy and robust

189
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,340
discussion around that but if nothing

190
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:49,318
else it really does point to the fact

191
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:52,978
that this strain has had such an immense

192
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,740
influence on the the genetics that have

193
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:58,079
come there after and it's it's so tried

194
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,060
and tested it's really one of the only

195
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,180
strains you can say that is on that

196
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:06,180
level that a we still have active seed

197
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,038
stock for and B is not a clone only we

198
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,519
we you know DJ's still around he's doing

199
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,519
his thing

200
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,259
yeah no I think I I you know his son

201
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,839
uses the F4 male uh quite a bit and and

202
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,979
the strain has had such a huge impact in

203
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,839
history there's there's you know the

204
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:25,038
humans from blue dream blue dot I mean

205
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:27,179
we could lose ourselves in the face here

206
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,300
for sure

207
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,198
um and and yeah it was you know uh just

208
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,198
a short flower indica

209
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:39,000
just a great a great plant

210
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,559
yeah a really special plant and the more

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,120
you dig into it the more it sort of

212
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,539
actually becomes really interesting

213
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,659
because it's like it doesn't have

214
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,579
uh The Afghani in it that's in a lot of

215
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:52,139
other Afghani genetics it's almost like

216
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,200
you know it doesn't have Afghani one in

217
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,299
it it doesn't have the same Afghani many

218
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,778
other people have worked with it's got

219
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,219
the uh the the Oregon purple tie in it

220
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,919
which is just such a mythical strain in

221
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,399
its own right it's all of the individual

222
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:11,099
pieces are so interesting and again it's

223
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,139
so so tried and true it's really a

224
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,839
strain that has continued to involve

225
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,179
over time as DJ and his son have both

226
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,620
continue to work it

227
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,359
but again I think one of the biggest

228
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,299
values of it is that we still have

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,839
access to males and females

230
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:29,699
um you know notably DJs selections of

231
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,220
females are out there in circulation

232
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,879
maybe not necessarily easy to get but

233
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,860
they are out there and uh likewise his

234
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,679
breeding parents are still around which

235
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,459
is really a unique consideration for a

236
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,799
strain that has this uh body of Legacy

237
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,379
associated with it

238
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,719
yeah and and as he puts it the finished

239
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,220
product has a very fruity Aroma and

240
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,019
taste of blueberries producing a notable

241
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,639
and pleasantly euphoric High the highest

242
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,620
quality it's very long lasting

243
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,019
resistable tolerance buildup always

244
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,700
enjoyable everybody has a long shelf

245
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,320
life store as well over extended periods

246
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,240
a long cure enhancing the flavors in

247
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,500
effect winter of course in the 2000 High

248
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,778
time standard step

249
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,399
uh we sell this [ __ ] at it and it's one

250
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:13,320
of the most ripped off strains as well

251
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,839
like um you know there's other people

252
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,760
that will sell other banks that sell

253
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,339
blueberry and they don't claim it to be

254
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,338
shorts blueberry or they explain it as a

255
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,600
tiny earthy strain which is exactly the

256
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,459
opposite of it

257
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,839
um and then like you mentioned so not

258
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,359
only is the most ripped off strand of

259
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,220
all times but uh it's also probably most

260
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,440
used you know other people have used it

261
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,940
in their process over everything you

262
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,700
know you go through my catalog and just

263
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,899
you know looking at like you said if you

264
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,778
know whatever the catalog and throw it

265
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,700
in an induction real quick yeah a lot of

266
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,799
that stuff is going to come back because

267
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,079
it's been around since the 70s so it's

268
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,120
it's been there and it's you know when

269
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,899
canvas was a lot different than it is

270
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,299
today

271
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,700
Yeah a hundred percent and there's so

272
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,139
many little various facets of it that

273
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,600
we're just going to fail to even do

274
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:03,120
justice in discussion wise like I've got

275
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,399
to meet in the UK who always reminds me

276
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,078
that because I I frequently say on the

277
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,419
show you know they love cheese in the UK

278
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,819
he goes bro we don't grow cheese here

279
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:14,639
anymore we grow blue cheese it's like

280
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,040
cheese in seed form but better and and

281
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,559
so you'll see as you reference blue

282
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,319
cheese one of the most knocked off

283
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,179
recreated cheese um all the Femme seeds

284
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
out there in general you know every sort

285
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:29,278
of Spain feminized country uh company is

286
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,759
going to offer a blue cheese because

287
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,799
it's just synonymous so uh with skunk so

288
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,240
yeah it's it's like the more you look

289
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,359
into it the more you start to get to

290
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,159
Surprise by where you see it popping up

291
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,959
and and you've nailed them all you're

292
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,100
right right you're like okay that was a

293
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,419
big one so you know you name another one

294
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,339
like oh [ __ ] I forgot about that one too

295
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,319
I mean it's just it's it really has been

296
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,360
used I guess once again it's been it's

297
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,940
it's been a home run since since the 70s

298
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,220
I mean Kim 91 91 TK we're putting that

299
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,740
around the 90s as well so this has been

300
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,720
one of those older strains that

301
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,399
um you know and and also you gotta

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,740
approach to to the breeder and whatnot

303
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,039
but people back then weren't they didn't

304
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,940
have these giant facilities like exotic

305
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,458
or like

306
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,140
you know uh they'd be easy they don't

307
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,458
have they can't grow a thousand or five

308
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,958
thousand plants out and then pick that

309
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,539
one you know some of these guys were

310
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,399
using tents you know if they if they

311
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:22,078
grew more than 20 they were drawing some

312
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,578
heat for sure and for them to grow it

313
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,139
for seed production they could be

314
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:26,879
growing it for weed production and

315
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,078
getting paid that was you know even

316
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,399
something even crazier what do you mean

317
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,559
you're going to plant for seeds that's

318
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,419
nuts but if you wanted The Preserve it

319
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,039
if you wanted to use next year well then

320
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,719
you made them this year

321
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,939
that's what you know like I said that

322
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,339
from what it took them so yeah great

323
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,260
strain great addition and definitely uh

324
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,100
you know definitely has a place in in

325
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,100
that you know

326
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:52,039
fantastic well

327
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:54,359
congrats DJ Short killer strain love it

328
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:56,219
blueberry tubes definitely up there for

329
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,200
me it's one of the best

330
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,480
oh it's and yeah it's just it's just

331
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,100
it's just a really great strain and

332
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,100
it's it's in literally everything

333
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,479
alrighty so moving on to our next

334
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:12,719
category we have the most anticipated

335
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,700
seed drop of the year so in terms of the

336
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,740
most anticipated sea drop number of

337
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,240
candidates this year and I think one

338
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,519
that definitely sort of caught my eye

339
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,339
was it's sort of like a joint one it's

340
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,578
the the nl5 reproductions so there's

341
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,860
notably inspector and Matt riots nl5

342
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:31,259
reproduction that's been done by csir

343
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,740
inspector and then there was also the

344
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:37,860
Todd McCormick NL reproduction uh both

345
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,000
using seed stock that came from Greg so

346
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,740
I know there's been a bit of

347
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,839
anticipation around those ones so that

348
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,180
was definitely a contender in my mind

349
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,590
and for people who don't know who radios

350
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,099
bread is

351
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,540
[Music]

352
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,480
McAllister the guy I know of to be

353
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,939
created with the NL and the nl5 and the

354
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,519
the entire line of an else and when he

355
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,320
was when he first came to me uh we spoke

356
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,360
and he told me he was responsible for

357
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,000
the NLS and the nl5 and

358
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,639
that's women here I said so you should

359
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,600
tell me that you you did this that I

360
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,399
mean I said most people are telling me

361
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,480
that they're using a cut of this and I

362
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,980
have to vet them that they're using the

363
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,860
cut you're telling me that you're

364
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,079
responsible for these uh oh sure you are

365
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,459
sure yeah let's smoke some more uh

366
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:22,679
because then I'm like how do I vet this

367
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,299
guy who who's going to ask us man I'm

368
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,578
done because everybody knows Adam that

369
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:28,019
he has no clue who Adam that is but if

370
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:29,939
we think about it he was doing [ __ ] in

371
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,320
the 70s he wouldn't know who Adam Dunn

372
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,480
is I'm done didn't come around until the

373
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,040
90s this guy was doing [ __ ] like in 72

374
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,680
when he came back from the war

375
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,000
and so who do you vet him through who

376
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,919
you got this pretty he'll do tell him he

377
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,179
made the ship but the guy who made this

378
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,240
[ __ ] is probably going to be this crazy

379
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,519
old dude so I'm thinking I'm thinking

380
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,440
thinking operation green Merchant we'll

381
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,959
see though [ __ ] farmer in this guy

382
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,760
guy who used to write Cincinnati tips

383
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,319
and so uh call Wolf you guys involved

384
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,899
this guy tells me he can spend anything

385
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,820
else he's like oh Greg I said that's his

386
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,458
name he's like yep yeah that's who did

387
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,920
it uh I I was right with him and he did

388
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,659
that in 72 when I was around the island

389
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,338
there and I was like really I said well

390
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,679
he's contacted me he's like oh yeah I

391
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,120
told him to I was like oh [ __ ] well he

392
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,099
has and so yeah so that's so that's

393
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,360
great so sorry so I guess Greg from the

394
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,800
phone I wasn't aware of it until after

395
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,199
it happened but I guess that Greg gave

396
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:23,219
Riot and those guys some seeds is that

397
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:25,198
what you're telling me yeah I believe so

398
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,820
yeah I was I wasn't familiar I wasn't

399
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,919
aware that he had given them uh since

400
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,240
I'd heard that he had possibly had but

401
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,799
um so David so how does it become an

402
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,639
inspector in Riot thing

403
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:37,198
I think I mean I I think that he so he

404
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,940
definitely gave some to Todd because you

405
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,979
know their mates and they chat and I

406
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,019
believe that likewise he's friends with

407
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,019
Matt and he gave Matt some of the seeds

408
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:48,959
and I think Matt passed them on to uh

409
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,120
Caleb CSI because uh you know inspectors

410
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:54,299
so well known for his ability to

411
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,919
reproduce old strains that uh yeah it

412
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:57,849
just ended up becoming the two of them

413
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,928
doing it

414
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,928
[Music]

415
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,360
when his stock comes in and flies out

416
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,979
he's a great dude

417
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,778
um so so yeah so no definitely

418
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,278
anticipate because who doesn't love the

419
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,539
NLS I mean those were you know and I

420
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:13,379
guess the story behind him you know

421
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,778
because that's the first thing Donald

422
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,220
asked him was why why the numbers he

423
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:19,980
said only he named him one through

424
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,240
eleven based on size you know the one

425
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,379
was the shortest one the eleven was the

426
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,698
tallest one the five would be in the

427
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,500
middle would you think about if you're

428
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:26,578
breeding and you're using that stuff the

429
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,860
one in the middle is probably going to

430
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:32,458
be the one that gets used the most

431
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,759
yeah interesting stuff well you know a

432
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:38,638
hot Contender for the the winner but I

433
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,620
think that to be honest the winner for

434
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,198
me and for a lot of people who I've been

435
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,320
talking to is it's a bit of a uh a

436
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,599
washout a blowout to be honest because I

437
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,500
haven't seen the amount of momentum this

438
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,500
drop got for a very long time and so I'm

439
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,799
very happy to say that the winner of the

440
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:02,039
most anticipated sea drop award for the

441
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:04,259
2021-22 period Goes To None other than

442
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:07,438
crickets and cicada with their puck back

443
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:10,558
cross one line up absolutely destroying

444
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,660
it including the bx2 as well as a

445
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:16,318
variety of other crosses to things like

446
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:19,199
Scentsy star hash plant 13 which was

447
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:22,619
actually I'm gonna do a mad plug here uh

448
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,579
Mr Bob and Hannah ball just so

449
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:29,699
incredibly generous donated 30 packs of

450
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,558
their seeds to our patreon just just to

451
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,298
give to our patreon supporters because

452
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,759
they're like we love the show we want to

453
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,139
support the listeners so we gave out 30

454
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,259
packs to our listeners of their

455
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:43,200
unreleased hash plant 13 across to the

456
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:46,440
back cross one male they did hash Planet

457
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,919
13 being an incredibly rare clone Top

458
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,140
Dog and uh both Mr Bob talked very

459
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,419
highly of it but you know this drop in

460
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,538
general had some bangers in it including

461
00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:00,059
the uh the rare red red Lebanese hash

462
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:02,519
plant crossed to the park the Scentsy

463
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:04,740
Star Killer and uh if you've been

464
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,619
following Mr Bob's Instagram he's been

465
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,779
posting up some absolute bangers with uh

466
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:13,379
this Northern Lights female he's been

467
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:15,720
using so I believe there might be a part

468
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,880
two to this drop coming featuring some

469
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,919
additional strains or at least I'm

470
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,440
secretly wishing they'll be

471
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,940
but uh they've just crushed it all

472
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,940
around

473
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,759
so I completely slept on this one uh

474
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,900
when when my guy Rob was doing the

475
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,038
ordering

476
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,759
um it it was you know uh

477
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,759
the [ __ ] back prices

478
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:44,099
uh Skelly has plant crossed with nl1

479
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,019
and those strands are out there right

480
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:47,759
like it's not it's not that trendy it's

481
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:48,980
not nothing hype [ __ ] it's not you know

482
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,240
it's

483
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,640
[Music]

484
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,700
but man I smoke some I I'm not with him

485
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,000
he gave me some that [ __ ] is good it is

486
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,840
heavy it looks amazing it is it's it's

487
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,519
it's

488
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,139
nugular it's the kind that makes that

489
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,019
that don't sound like you're cutting in

490
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,080
Turkey trays don't you know

491
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:12,240
it's uh it's just uh and and I think he

492
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,220
had four or five different uh different

493
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,279
the crosses there when we've been smoked

494
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,720
with him and uh there were there wasn't

495
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,178
one that outshined the other they were

496
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,798
all just massively great it wasn't like

497
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:25,140
just some nugs were big they were called

498
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,460
awesome stuff oh good stuff and

499
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,860
everybody that smoking I smoke a fair

500
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,019
amount of weed uh it definitely knocked

501
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,418
my dick in the beard it's it's old I

502
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:35,579
mean it's two old strings right but it's

503
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,080
two old strands done damn well and from

504
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,240
the guy who would have the quality of

505
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,099
those old strains from the librarian so

506
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,319
um and then like I said I was blessed

507
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:46,918
enough to attempt to smoke some and

508
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,500

509
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,320
you got me

510
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,960

00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:58,139
stuff so shout out to crickets and

512
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,880
cicada Mr Bob Hemphill and Hannah bolt

513
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,820
crushing it as always

514
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,500
onto our next award being hottest

515
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:08,460
breeder on the Block

516
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,660
this is a prize that historically just

517
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,880
to clear up any misconceptions

518
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,740
historically it doesn't go to someone

519
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,200
who's like in their first year of

520
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,720
breeding it's it's often people who have

521
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,940
been around for a while but have really

522
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,400
sort of started to get a bit of momentum

523
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,340
maybe even caused a bit of a splash with

524
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,440
a seed drop or two so this is for people

525
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:30,720
who are really you know starting to get

526
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,279
to the levels of where maybe we think

527
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,839
they should be because they're they're

528
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,960
often really good breeders maybe a

529
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:39,418
little under recognized but often some

530
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,120
exciting names in the mix I know that

531
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:46,020
last year I believe the winner was Soul

532
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:48,119
fire and heck we killed it with that

533
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:51,179
pick he's gone on to do that Bahama Mama

534
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,538
cross which just looks insane

535
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,120
then if you want [ __ ] that washes uh his

536
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:59,460
his stuff is insaneous Frost as hell uh

537
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,558
great stuff it's flies out we the mama

538
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,259
mama crosses were awesome

539
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,819
um it's just it's a nice plant uh it

540
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:07,798
puts in a lot of work a lot of hard work

541
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,439
and definitely well deserved and um it

542
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,538
definitely is is one of my top 12 for

543
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,120
sure a great great guy

544
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:17,700
yeah definitely and years prior to that

545
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,439
we've even had in years prior to that

546
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,480
we've even had none other than our

547
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,880
friend on the final frontier AK Bean

548
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,519
brain sweep this award so definitely

549
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,340
some big hitters in the prior winners of

550
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:32,339
this award and there was a few names

551
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:34,639
that sort of came to mind when I was

552
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:37,500
thinking about the newcomers of the year

553
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,100
I definitely want to give a shout out

554
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,019
Max yields the guy who created Oreos and

555
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,779
collab with Thug pug to make Pure

556
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:47,460
Michigan you can't deny we've all seen

557
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,859
those strains popping up here and there

558
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,120
they're doing pretty well so kudos to

559
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,418
you Max heels you've been doing some

560
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,339
good stuff however for me there's

561
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,780
there's another name I've got in mind

562
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:01,339
but I'd love to hear did you have any

563
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,339
honorable mentions Mr Bean

564
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,859
you know of course all my guys everybody

565
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,839
they picked up in the last year I think

566
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,699
is enough of a newcomer I'll try to

567
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,019
check them out and I can't if I mention

568
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,419
one I'm gonna have to mention 10 of them

569
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,400
so I can't I can do one in particular uh

570
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,140
there's like your favorite child right

571
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,120
um I will say the one the year picked

572
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,860
before that has done very well uh we've

573
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,079
always been well in our picks uh I think

574
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:28,079
you've got a good one that you're about

575
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,819
to about to name but uh yeah I would

576
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,500
just uh kind of I think I think the one

577
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,839
that we both have in common is the one

578
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,380
I've done yeah other than that I can't

579
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,538
pick more than one favorite child

580
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,220
that's the way it is yeah you'll end up

581
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:43,079
stealing the Thunder from me that's okay

582
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,298
that's all right

583
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,980
um well let's get on to it I think that

584
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:50,879
the the hottest new breeder on the Block

585
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:55,380
award goes to none other than Bloom

586
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,200
seeds Mr Harry Palms who has just done a

587
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,000
momentous job crushing it over the past

588
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
few years in fact but it's good to see

589
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,619
that he's starting to get some

590
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,740
recognition from the masses his work as

591
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:10,199
well has really surprised me in how

592
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,019
Frosty it is the consistently high

593
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,240
quality I've seen some mates grow it out

594
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:18,000
and they're all blown away they're I

595
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,500
even know one guy he's like disciple of

596
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,839
the Church of Bloom he won't touch

597
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,159
anything except Bloom so you've got to

598
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,980
be doing some right if you can get

599
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,500
people to have that level of passion for

600
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,700
your brand and you know he's got some um

601
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,558
some notable history behind himself

602
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,298
um having formally been a part of Oni

603
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,240
having been a part of the Trump picana

604
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:41,639
cookies creation this is a guy who's

605
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,579
been around for a while and has really

606
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,559
put in his due diligence and it's great

607
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:48,298
to see that bloom seeds is really

608
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,519
starting to take off with the masses and

609
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:52,740
seeing some cool strains come out of

610
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:56,579
their stable such as the grape cream

611
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:59,339
cake I've also seen that his garlic sour

612
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:02,099
cookies are sick I've also seen him do

613
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:04,019
some other cool stuff with uh what is it

614
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,819
purple full stack that looks dope as

615
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:07,740
well

616
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:09,599
purple ice water shines that thing's

617
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,179
gray sticky grapes

618
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,099
um you know the Batman bar the big back

619
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,179
big bad cushman's Cross of course we

620
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:17,178
live with the cream cake

621
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,038
like you said it's kind of really a lot

622
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,600
of prostitutes and unstable a lot of

623
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,240
frosted takes

624
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:30,719
yeah I think Bloom has got a reputation

625
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,038
for being like super terpy super resony

626
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,798
that's what I think when I think of

627
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:37,200
Bloom so yeah concentrate guys this is

628
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,119
the one for you for sure but again you

629
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,819
know great to see someone like Harry

630
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,459
who's been around for a while really

631
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,359
starting to get momentum two years in a

632
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,860
row now we're going towards you

633
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,139
concentrate guys

634
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:51,359
yeah look that that might be the trend

635
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,820
and that plays into the general sort of

636
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,959
uh macro politics and movement of the

637
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:58,500
scene you know we're seeing bigger

638
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,840
facilities and uh bigger facilities can

639
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,720
do have the capacity to do big volumes

640
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,879
of concentrates and as a result strains

641
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,220
that are concentrate orientated more

642
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,500
likely to get run there's also just a

643
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,380
growing uh

644
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,659
group of enthusiasts who are really into

645
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,100
the concentrates you know like I think I

646
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,100
think people are still growing you know

647
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:22,798
we definitely haven't reached our Peak

648
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:24,418
concentrate Enthusiast uh curve yet

649
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,639
before we start swinging back to flower

650
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,380
I think we're still on the up and up

651
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,820
well I think I think there because

652
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,220
there's a science behind it right

653
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,599
there's different ways to do it now and

654
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,000
we can all go in our backyards and blow

655
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,278
some blow some you know some some butane

656
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,159
and try to explode our house and get a

657
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:43,558
little a little yeah a concentrate but

658
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:46,440
to take that process and refine it and

659
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,599
make it such an intricate specialty deal

660
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,919
that it is today and and then by using

661
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:50,939
different because you know what to put

662
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,380
inwards and what you're going to get out

663
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,419
you know I've always said these

664
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,820
concentrate guys that make that make

665
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,259
this constraints were great because the

666
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:01,379
you know a Frenchie started with

667
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:03,960
aficionados gear right Cuban was using

668
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,000
the Exotics gear Cuban's great but he

669
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,440
had an exotic steer and so if you know

670
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,619
what you start with is what you can

671
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,840
pronounce so you know a lot I see bloom

672
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:15,119
in a lot of a lot of concentrates so

673
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,259
um that and the now that we have like

674
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,879
you were saying the ability to run five

675
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,900
thousands because if we rewind the clock

676
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,640
which I work with a lot of older

677
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,400
breeders these guys were growing in

678
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,380
their tents and they had 10 12 15 to

679
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,059
work with and and for them to have chose

680
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,278
what they chosen for us to give away is

681
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:31,500
excellent for that but now we're talking

682
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,778
facilities of five thousand and you can

683
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,400
really sort out that one that's

684
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:36,659
different I mean all these are plants

685
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,278
and they're all marijuana plants down

686
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,559
and they're all this planet like that

687
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,538
but there's that one that's just

688
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,700
different than all the others and that's

689
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:46,740
how I've heard it told when you go into

690
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,298
a room is that you'll just

691
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,460
it's just different and you're like well

692
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:52,558
what does that means

693
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,940
you just see it let me see it and so and

694
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,019
to have that ability to run those

695
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,640
numbers and then just get rid of the

696
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:57,900
others either if you're putting in the

697
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,799
flower on your shelf or whatever it may

698
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,919
be

699
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,079
um you know that's why these guys that

700
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,659
we've nominated to be best growers in

701
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,980
the year uh of the year in the past

702
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,120
um because they're working with the

703
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,200
giant phenol hunts because that's what

704
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,418
it comes down to if you want something

705
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,038
in their bill test then then you grab a

706
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,020
club if you want something that's yours

707
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:19,980
you can grab a pack of six

708
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:22,200
that's it that's it plant more seeds but

709
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,900
uh shout out to bloom you know doing

710
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,900
some good work as always for sure for

711
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:31,559
sure so on to our next category

712
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:34,380
we're gonna give a quick little detour

713
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:36,899
being that it's been you know I think

714
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,840
probably 16 months now since our last

715
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,240
episode unfortunately we have had a few

716
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:46,019
Veterans of the scene bid us farewell

717
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,839
and and so we bid farewell to a true

718
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:52,200
Pioneer of concentrate and notably the

719
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:55,019
hashish scene Frenchie cannoli who

720
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,860
unfortunately passed away early last

721
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,099
year

722
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:01,500
and Frenchie was a pivotal man in the

723
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:05,158
scene in really reigniting the fire

724
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,859
under the artisanal hash and concentrate

725
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,220
scene him and his wife held numerous

726
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:14,099
workshops were affiliated with various

727
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,079
Crews such as Aficionado as well as many

728
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:19,678
others who really tried to push the

729
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:22,859
limits and to raise greater awareness in

730
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,440
the consumer's mind around not just the

731
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:28,500
quality of artisanally produced products

732
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,259
but also to pay homage and respect the

733
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,659
traditional practices that have produced

734
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:35,579
them over the years and the way in which

735
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:38,460
the application of these sort of

736
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:41,278
indigenous knowledges can be tailored to

737
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,440
each product to really bring its merits

738
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,319
and qualities to the Forefront

739
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,558
so it is with a heavy heart that we say

740
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:52,740
valet Frenchy canoli

741
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:55,319
yeah Frenchie um I was lucky enough to

742
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,720
uh work with them to have dinner with

743
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:59,278
him do known him through mening to and

744
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,679
come to parties with them

745
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,960
um he he was he was the one gentleman

746
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,100
when he started talking everybody shut

747
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,620
up

748
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:10,740
because for one he talked really

749
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:13,319
quietly and Purdue of course his name

750
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,960
implies zebra's friendship and so

751
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:17,700
you looked up you know and you do this

752
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,079
and you do this and you do this and

753
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,220
everybody would just shut up I mean he

754
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:21,658
was like entire restaurant should be

755
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,159
quiet whenever he talked because you you

756
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,720
want to hear what he said you want to

757
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,820
get that information out of him and and

758
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,259
so it was I mean I've seen him quiet

759
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:30,418
many of the crowds just practice by

760
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:33,058
talking and so that's uh not only is

761
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:34,559
that is that just kind of a gentleman

762
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:37,678
that commanded the space around him and

763
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,418
humbly so like was was not of that I'm

764
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,120
the coolest person was just you know

765
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,278
happy to be where I was and uh so I

766
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:47,459
remember he he lost a one gram triple

767
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:50,579
ball and a party I had before a High

768
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,558
Times event we had a free party and uh

769
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,778
the rumor is he left the one one gram

770
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,558
Temple ball somewhere in the house left

771
00:29:54,778 --> 00:30:00,898
we never found it so that's a fun story

772
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,579
but um you know he he I I knew him

773
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:04,739
through his work with Aficionado with uh

774
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:06,480
Evan Bruce with Leo and

775
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,259
uh the awards they won and perhaps they

776
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
won

777
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:12,898
um dinners we'd have after August and

778
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,940
stuff so you know I was very uh lost a

779
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:16,500
good one and they all go to her early

780
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,659
you know we all wish we had more time

781
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,558
the French is definitely one of the ones

782
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:21,840
that she shouldn't you know his last

783
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:23,700
artification workshops

784
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,519
a lot of people attended them

785
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,919
um I think that maybe that's where your

786
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,000
legacy lives is in teaching people

787
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,000
knowledge

788
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,980
and people remember like bog like people

789
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,079
that we've had in the past you know sub

790
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,940
from different videos several always go

791
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,278
down because how many people I can't

792
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,500
tell you I can tell you how many people

793
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,960
tell me that they watched Subs read nerd

794
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,240
videos like and whether it's submute or

795
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,860
Not by him doing those videos he created

796
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,500
a cult that people were able to watch

797
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:54,658
when when YouTube was cool and so

798
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,919
passive knowledge John Wayne I think the

799
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,559
three guys we've had in the Hall of Fame

800
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,899
are the four guys that have all been our

801
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,000
uh oh sorry I guess the you know the

802
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:06,119
three guys that we've lost recently

803
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,440
um bog sub and Frenchie were one thing

804
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,298
they all had in common is they were all

805
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,860
great teachers they took their knowledge

806
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:12,658
and shared it with people

807
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:14,519
so you know I'm sure we've lost others

808
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:15,778
but maybe maybe that's what we take from

809
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,398
this is that it's cool to know

810
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:19,019
everything but to take that knowledge

811
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:20,538
and share with other people that's what

812
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:23,579
makes you remembered

813
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:26,038
yeah definitely a very altruistic and

814
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:28,379
selfless sort of act to be a teacher and

815
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:32,278
as you said one that will certainly

816
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,380
leave you in high regards and in warm

817
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:38,759
favor with people

818
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:41,580
so moving on to our final Award of the

819
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:43,859
year the breeder of the year the big one

820
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:45,720
the Big Bopper

821
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:48,959
this year there's there's a number of

822
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,538
people who are in contention and I think

823
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,120
that it's important to note that this

824
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:56,519
award goes to people for a variety of

825
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,339
fact as it goes for you know like how

826
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:02,099
popular they are uh how good the work is

827
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:03,839
not just like you know otherwise uh

828
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:05,398
bloody Candy Rain would have won that

829
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,959
year right it's not just about like how

830
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:08,819
interested people are it's also about

831
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,140
how good the work is and does it

832
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:13,379
germinate

833
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,600
um it's also about a variety of like

834
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,539
logistical and technical things you know

835
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:21,719
is this unique stock uh so it's it's a

836
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:24,419
very multi-faceted sort of award and so

837
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,399
I think that some of the people who will

838
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:30,538
get the sort of honorable shout outs or

839
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:32,519
the top mentions in my books we'll go to

840
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:34,259
Chris of compound genetics I wanted to

841
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,298
give an honorable mention to him he's

842
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:38,700
done some cool work with the apples and

843
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:41,220
bananas as well as some of his other

844
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,620
crosses he's done I think that we've

845
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,538
seen a lot of derivative work from other

846
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:47,579
people people and that's not to say I'm

847
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:51,419
not interested in it but it certainly

848
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:54,058
has amassed a wide following and has

849
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,919
even had other people sort of doing

850
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:58,379
similar crosses utilizing those cuts

851
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,020
when they've got access to them likewise

852
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,520
I think that given that Chris of

853
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,740
compound has worked with cookies you

854
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,119
know you can't can't argue that's going

855
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,120
to help with the old reputation

856
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:14,278
yeah uh definitely compounds uh the

857
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,159
apples and banana is has been it's

858
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:19,740
definitely been released so that it was

859
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,120
in a lot of gear surprisingly I

860
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,620
certainly used a lot a lot of reading

861
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,479
projects yet it would release it you

862
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:26,219
know Chris of course had a great Booth

863
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,620
you know an emerald cap on as part of

864
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,058
his nft he was one of the first beers I

865
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,879
knew that was actually pushing nfts I

866
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:33,440
got an ft to his pre-party

867
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,940
[Music]

868
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,580
good good stuff and he's been doing you

869
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,298
know good stuff in the past as well and

870
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:43,980
um

871
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:46,319
you know definitely uh uh a bit almost

872
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,200
first a bit almost first

873
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,538
yeah he he's very much up there he's

874
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,538
been doing some huge waves and I think

875
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:56,278
this year is the year that he really did

876
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:59,220
come to the Forefront in terms of being

877
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:01,140
a really close front runner

878
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,240
um just to give some other sort of

879
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,740

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,720

bought out some outdoor specific lines

912
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:23,460
which is really cool to see breeders

913

914

like hey you know do what you want with

917
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,900
outdoors and he's also released some

918
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,460
interesting genetics that are not

919
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,260
related to some of the other work he's

920
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,139
done so really injecting some fresh

921
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,420
blood into his stable and notably I'm

922
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:45,719
excited for some of the Pink Champagne

923
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,838
S1 hybrids he's done he found a nice

924
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:50,338

00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,420
them as as I think that guy pops a five

933
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,220
gallon bucket of seeds every year like I

934
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,599
really really do because once again

935
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:14,039
we've gone back to funeral hunting we're

936
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,500
going back to finding that that

937
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:17,880
different thing and Gene's a great guy

938
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,019
I've worked in a lot of fundraising

939
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,780
things

940
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:25,320
um his he has he has a home run with

941
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:28,500
root beer I mean the marketing behind it

942
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,180
uh the it's just it's a great strain but

943
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,159
it's so great and he's done such good

944
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:33,598
things with it that he can that he can't

945
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,858
sell it now right because he's done such

946
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,960
good things that he's done he's donated

947
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:39,299
so much and so you know that's a guy

948
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,800
who's unselfishly taken a home run and

949
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,579
and donating it back to the community if

950
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,039
you will

951
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,839
um he's always on different panels and

952
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:47,699

953
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,858
breeder like if uh

954
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:52,139

organic seminars he tried he gave me

986

some of their bud and it was the most

987
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,140
memorable weed I've tried in a very long

988
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,880
time

989
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:14,879

history with Coastal seeds

996
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,619
um I was lucky enough to met with him uh

997
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:31,139
earlier this year uh in March uh he gave

998
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,760
me uh selections of of the uh of the

999
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:33,659
current Prospect because of that

1000
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,520
Crossing

1001
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:37,618
um you know he he's a librarian for sure

1002
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,119
and and you mentioned anabot which is

1003
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,680
his wife

1004
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,079
um and she does a lot of the work you

1005
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:44,639
know I asked to ask Duke I was like what

1006
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,560
what should I get him he was like

1007
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,319
Sharpies

1008
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,940
sounds like Sharpies what do you mean

1009
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,800
well a guy that does Cuts in those

1010
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,240
clones and has a library might need

1011
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,220
Sharpies because he writes and writes on

1012
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,139
Solo cups right it's only like Sharpies

1013
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:59,819
and of course and you know he's known as

1014
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:01,980
Librarians he's got you know almost 100

1015
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,660
different females or whatnot plan to use

1016
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,639
just keeping and uh because he doesn't

1017
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:06,779
want to lose them to the to the to the

1018
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:08,578
period of time you know and then we

1019
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,140
everybody has him and he's he has he has

1020
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,519
things he doesn't even like he's keeping

1021
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,279
just because he doesn't want them lost

1022
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,559
and to keep a library like that

1023
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,940
and he's not a job facility and sort of

1024
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,039
keep a library like that you know I'm

1025
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,800
not wasted in a room but not earning it

1026
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,719
to keep in a room is is a benefit for

1027
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,539
anybody that needs to use it and one of

1028
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,759
the coolest things that

1029
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:31,380
uh that that I really noticed when I met

1030
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,180
with him this last time is that he

1031
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,380
stressed to me he wanted people to use

1032
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:35,940
his product

1033
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,858
like he wanted people to breathe his

1034
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,539
gear and I was like wait a minute

1035
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,598
a lot of people don't want that they

1036
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:44,099
don't want to he's like no no I'm I'm

1037
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,019
preservationist like like the pressure

1038
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,700
Pakistan you spoke of that was an open

1039
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:49,559
pollination that he did because he wants

1040
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:51,118
to reserve that line he wants to make it

1041
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,980
that available so you're not losing it

1042
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,440
doesn't get tainted and so and he wants

1043
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,179
you and his his starting stock for new

1044
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,159
breeders or new guys coming in the scene

1045
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:00,358
that want starting stock to breed with I

1046
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:02,819
think you you couldn't go wrong with

1047
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,098
with anything from his lines I mean it's

1048
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,420
just it's older stock and older crosses

1049
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,180
but they're done right from the guy who

1050
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,079
should have them I mean no question

1051
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:13,019
um

1052
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,000
so much so that I know that earlier we

1053
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:17,280
discussed uh

1054
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,179
save this before here uh earlier we

1055
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,300
discussed the NL Series right uh I

1056
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:28,259
didn't know that Greg had sent Pax 2.

1057
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:31,200
McCormick and uh Ryan

1058
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,720
I also you know Greg obviously I also

1059
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,279
got a pack of seeds about that same time

1060
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:37,439
which gray got married because I didn't

1061
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,240
think because Greg I told you I didn't

1062
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,740
know they were kind of acting like an

1063
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,299
old schooler so I didn't know that they

1064
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:44,219
were I wasn't there I didn't get them

1065
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,300
but thank you now I know what they are I

1066
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:47,699
found a

1067
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,019
since I found them of course I want to

1068
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:50,759
grow them because

1069
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:53,579
if they went there say they are then

1070
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,920
well I would want them but the person

1071
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,480
that needs to have them would be to me

1072
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,700
this guy

1073
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,380
would be [ __ ] Mr Bob heffield so I

1074
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:04,259
gave him the packs that were given to me

1075
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:08,338
by Greg McAllister so he has now the

1076
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,079
same packs that uh Riot and McCormick

1077
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:11,460
got so we'll see what he does with that

1078
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,200
little empty ones but I figured you know

1079
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,880
you know the crucial to who should have

1080
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:16,919
these than a librarian I won't I will

1081
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,300
you know he he knows so much about

1082
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,559
playing she's a talk to him he can tell

1083
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,579
you the difference what what this shows

1084
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:22,199
and what that shows and what the

1085
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:25,940
Lebanese shows and what that shows and

1086
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:30,480
he's just he's really he's not the most

1087
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:32,039
excited uh Amplified guy but it doesn't

1088
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,139
really get excited over much things but

1089
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:37,079
but man his weed just [ __ ] gets me

1090
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:38,759
high I tell you what good stuff uh yeah

1091
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,079
and there's teamwork on that one for two

1092
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,520
like I said you're keeping around 100

1093
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,680
mothers right we're not talking about

1094

1095

00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,820

over the years preserving and creating

1113

1114
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,179

very much appreciated

1123
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:52,260
look I feel like I would not be the

1124
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:53,699
first to say that this has like been a

1125
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,280
long time coming I think there's a lot

1126
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:57,838
of heads in the scene who know that you

1127
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,420
guys have been putting in a lot of work

1128
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,400
over the years and like myself are

1129
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,980
really really grateful to see the The

1130
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,900
Wider Community really embracing it it's

1131
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,579
it's killer to see did you ever expect

1132
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,160
that you would get this sort of

1133
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:13,680
reception to the puck crosses

1134
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:15,659
I had no idea that um there would be

1135
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:20,098
this many people interested in the

1136
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:22,318
project and honestly I had uh

1137
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:25,260
you know no expectations of it turning

1138
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,599
out as well as it did it's just a you

1139
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,180
know amazing thing

1140
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,240
yeah look it it really caught me by

1141
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:34,618
surprise because of the fact that you

1142
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:36,598
know the scaly hash plant it's been

1143
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:38,700
around for a while and I think there

1144
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,940
have been a small number of crosses done

1145
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:44,519
with it but I'm not sure if the demand

1146
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,900
for those crosses really reflected what

1147
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:48,300
you got here I guess you're the best

1148
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,059
person to ask do you think I mean I know

1149
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,400
that puck yeah was quite popular but do

1150
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:55,139
you think that other Puck crosses really

1151
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,619
sort of gave you any idea of how this

1152
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:57,618
was going to go

1153
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:02,338
you know I I think people really got

1154
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,039
excited about the fact that it's really

1155
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:07,318
inbred uh good breeding stock and you

1156
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:10,559
know to get something that uh

1157
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,599
is you know inbred and and bread to be

1158
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,539
potent um

1159
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:18,960
just appealed to people

1160
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:21,779
yeah hugely hugely I also have been

1161
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,940
thinking that I think it's sort of a bit

1162
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:27,060
unfortunate but I think since Neville's

1163
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:29,159
past people have sort of re-examined a

1164
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,679
lot of the older work with like a

1165
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:33,358
microscope and a like hey this is

1166
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:34,739
actually like really good stuff and

1167
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,078
there's like a more General sort of

1168
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:38,699
awareness would you say that you've seen

1169
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,220
any of that at all I guess I'll also

1170
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:42,899
just quickly add in like in relation to

1171
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:45,299
Park Shore but I've also seen people you

1172
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,099
know quite keen on the NLS and the nl5s

1173
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,500
and stuff do you think people are more

1174
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:52,019
keen on the older work at the moment

1175
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,059
you know it that always happens with an

1176
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:55,139
artist when they pass people appreciate

1177
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:57,420
their work

1178
00:44:55,139 --> 00:45:00,539
um but to be honest you know he's been

1179
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,079
an inspiration to me since the 90s and

1180
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:02,880
um

1181
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,359
always looked at him as the greatest

1182
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,760
cannabis breeder of all time and um

1183
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:10,799
you know since the 90s I've been trying

1184
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,780
to collect as many clones from him as

1185
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,480
possible and you know there's not many

1186
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:18,060
of them left but any of them that stayed

1187
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,338
around this long or truly as good as any

1188
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:22,139
new hype strain there is

1189
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:25,259
so

1190
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:27,598
um you know the the puck project is just

1191
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,579
continuing his work um I didn't add

1192
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,318
anything else in there that he didn't

1193
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:34,560
add and

1194
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:37,500
um you know I just kept getting better

1195
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,420
with the end breeding so

1196
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,980
um you know taking out their his style

1197
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,900
of breeding

1198
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,300
um really paid off

1199
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,720
oh yeah I can only imagine we're gonna

1200
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:51,119
see some people sort of uh recreate the

1201
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:53,639
breeding steps you've taken to do this

1202
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,099
but maybe with some other clones I'd be

1203
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,960
interested to hear are there any other

1204
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:00,300
old school lines that you're sort of

1205
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,280
keen to work with now that you've seen

1206
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,380
with you know the Skelly that this is

1207
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,880
like a viable sort of commercial path

1208
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,160
where people are keen on this sort of

1209
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,220
work anything new on the horizon

1210
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,858
well you know um the goal is to get a

1211
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:16,259
bunch of old clones in the seed form I'm

1212
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:17,159
working on the Master Kush project right

1213
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,500
now

1214
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,539
um pollen is flying right now to make

1215
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,579
that back cross one

1216
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:26,338
off the Clone I've been holding for 20

1217
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:29,519
years and um

1218
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:31,440
then uh purple into Kush working that

1219
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,599
one and uh

1220
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,519
there's a whole bunch more but those are

1221
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,740
uh some of the ones that that and

1222
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,619
sensory store the Scentsy Stars Luna I

1223
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:42,419
have I also have that at vx1

1224
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:45,300
right now

1225
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:48,000
oh wow what Mao did you use for the

1226
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:52,380
initial cross on the senses

1227
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,880
The Brood X oh God what a good pairing

1228
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,900
yeah

1229
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:01,019
um I also made some f2s off a few select

1230
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:03,539
brood X females and um really excited

1231
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:05,579
about you know digging into the f2s and

1232
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:08,759
you know the back cross

1233
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:11,880
I'm gonna take that and um

1234
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,339
make a bx2 and that's where I'll

1235
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,400
hopefully make it available if it passes

1236
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:20,519
testing and I'll take the bx1 and

1237
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,858
cross it to the census star cut

1238
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,920
um Wick gave me and a bunch of other

1239
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:28,139
good clones too a bunch of old school

1240
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,019
stock

1241
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:33,480
yeah that sounds killer and I mean you

1242
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:35,460
just mentioned Wick I I have to be

1243
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,920
honest he's been posting some cool stuff

1244
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,838
any chance we might ever see you guys

1245
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,280
collaborating together or do you sort of

1246
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,739
feel like it's already happening because

1247
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,079
you guys share a lot of cuts

1248
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:49,559
you know it definitely is already

1249
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,900
happening and um he has

1250
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:53,639
you know and Mother collection he's been

1251
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,160
holding as long as I've been holding

1252
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:56,940
mine and he's been putting in work and

1253
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,098
um

1254
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,599
he really you know loves the plan he's

1255
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:03,180
one of the people that does it for the

1256
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,700
right reasons so um

1257
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:08,098
you know if you're really into crazy

1258
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:09,960
sativas that's a really good place to

1259
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:11,880
look right there he's

1260
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,079
um making some really cool things right

1261
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,059
now

1262
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,619
hell yeah but you know what this

1263
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,299
interview is about you and I think

1264
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:20,338
you've been making some really cool

1265
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,039
things right now so let's talk about it

1266
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:25,440
I seen you posted the uh the Tom Hill

1267
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,300
Hayes cross and pollination you did tell

1268
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:31,440
me a little bit more about that

1269
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:34,079
well the Tom Health Chase I made um an

1270
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,700
open pollination years ago with the

1271
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,400
um original Three original packs from

1272
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:40,858
him and then um when I did that open

1273
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,940
pollination I stuck in some old timers

1274
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:47,400
days female so I made Tom Hill's f2s and

1275
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:50,880
then f1s of the Old Timers and the Tom

1276
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,700
Hill's Haze I just got into refreshing

1277
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:57,838
my seed stock and I made f3s of the Tom

1278
00:48:53,699 --> 00:49:01,078
Hills Haze that's positronics F4

1279
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:03,539
really excited I'm gonna let a few of

1280
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,700
those out just so the line stays alive

1281
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:08,219
there's not many people that have kept

1282
00:49:05,699 --> 00:49:11,818
that line alive and um

1283
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:15,299
also right now I'm working on making f2s

1284
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:17,159
of the Old Timers by the Tom Hills Hayes

1285
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,619
and I also um

1286
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:23,159
have some Tom hails Hayes crossed to

1287
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:26,700
original Haze in there too also some

1288
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:29,578
pure original Haze to you know hopefully

1289
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:34,078
add what um genetic diversity is left

1290
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:36,180
into the pure Haze population and um you

1291
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,660
know honestly I'm just gonna treat this

1292
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:41,818
Haze like open pollination land race

1293
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:44,219
work and I'm gonna put it out there and

1294
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:46,739
I'm gonna help hope that some breeders

1295
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:47,399
are gonna take it and work it Forward

1296
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:49,259
um

1297
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,780
because it really needs to be looked

1298
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:55,460
through at large populations at that

1299
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:58,920
point and selecting the best for making

1300
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:01,318
f2s and outcrosses I think it'll be some

1301
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,559
amazing breeding stock

1302
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:06,960
yeah certainly I know that there's been

1303
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,400
um some other Haze releases and some

1304
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,679
people have enjoyed them some people

1305
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,720
have sort of said oh not quite what they

1306
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,879
wanted so maybe this will be more of a

1307
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,459
successful route for them just as a

1308
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,920
quick follow-up did you notice much uh

1309
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,139
discrepancies between the like you know

1310
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,579
the positronics haze and uh the

1311
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:24,719
old-timers Haze or were they fairly

1312
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:27,599
similar

1313
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,759
no um you know I've done as much

1314
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,220
research as I can about the old timers

1315
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,359
and it's really you know who knows what

1316
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:36,419
it is

1317
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:39,480
um it's very similar to Hayes it might

1318
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:41,940
be a haze outcross or some of the same

1319
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,579
Colombians that made Hayes

1320
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,760
um it was slightly different than the

1321
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:49,800
Tom Hill's positronics phase when I grew

1322
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,200
them out together

1323
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:55,680
there's you know more sativa I would say

1324
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:57,719
that that that old-timer one Hayes is

1325
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,358
more sativa um

1326
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,439
Tom Hill's Hayes is very sativa in

1327
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:04,558
itself

1328
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,358
um I think condos is the best out of

1329
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,400
what I've seen from

1330
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:11,098
um samples of original Haze and what I

1331
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,980
saw of old timer one Hayes and um I

1332
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:16,500
think Tom health is the best

1333
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,838
wow that's really exciting and I guess

1334
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,818
one of the first thoughts that jumped to

1335
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:23,578
mind to people who follow you on

1336
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:27,000
Instagram where are we ever gonna see

1337
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:30,420
you recreate like an nl5 Haze

1338
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,940
you know I put um the nl2 cut from Jim

1339
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:36,960
Ortega in with the Tom Hills Crews open

1340
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:39,780
pollination and I also put in uh nl1 cut

1341
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,079
from AK Bean Brands and

1342
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,880
so I do have seeds of those and so yeah

1343
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,300
we're going to get some of those tested

1344
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,039
and um we'll see how nice they turn out

1345
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,880
fingers are crust

1346
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,440
yeah out of curiosity I mean I like I

1347
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,380
don't have a ton of experience with the

1348
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,119
nl2 for example but would you just if

1349
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,880
you had to use your imagination expect

1350
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,920
that those seeds would come out similar

1351
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,019
to the nl5 haze but maybe like a bit

1352
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,300
less sort of stretchy or what do you

1353
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:12,000
imagine they'll come out like

1354
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:14,640
man if they come out anything as good as

1355
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,940
uh what Neville did with that nl5 case

1356
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:19,679
you know I'll be extremely happy I think

1357
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,619
that's one of the best readings in

1358
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:26,039
history the nl5 phase you look at how

1359
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:28,318
many clones of nl5 haze are still around

1360
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:31,199
in their pure form and they're just

1361
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:34,139
extremely potent and then uh you look

1362
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:38,699
what JJ did from Top Dog he took that NL

1363
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:41,159
Haze and made the Nigerian has so you

1364
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:43,500
know it's amazing breeding stock and you

1365
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:46,199
know the cuts up stood the time as good

1366
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:49,260
as anything ever created in history

1367
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:52,558
yeah definitely some Mammoth stock for

1368
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:56,160
sure so a lot of people had messaged me

1369
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,980
and asked it looks like there might be a

1370
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,539
part two of the puck drop happening

1371
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,980
because you've been posting some sort of

1372
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:04,440
newer crosses that weren't in the first

1373
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:07,318
part is that what the fans can expect or

1374
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:10,559
is that more just some personal r d

1375
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:13,858
no 100 I'm gonna um bring more of the

1376
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,359
puck the puck bx3

1377
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:18,058
um I'm gonna bring that to the public

1378
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:21,119
after testing fingers crossed and then

1379
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:22,980
I'm hitting a bunch of clones and um the

1380
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,539
same ones that really clicked well and

1381
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,960
then a bunch of other ones that I think

1382
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:32,279
will click well you know like 398 Bubba

1383
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:34,980
the Scentsy star from WIC Shoreline

1384
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,040
you know some really I think stuff that

1385
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:41,159
I have a high hopes for old skunk one

1386
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:44,338
clone that also came from Wick

1387
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:46,980
yeah wow I remember I grew out of

1388
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:48,239
Shoreline S1 like 10 years ago when I

1389
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,000
first started growing I think it came

1390
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,799
from uh Devil's hardest Devil's Harvest

1391
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,559
crew and I think they're legit even

1392
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,240
though maybe a checkered past but I

1393
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:00,119
remember that was a very unique plan

1394
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,919
even in my very newbiness at growing I

1395
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:03,780
could tell it smelled totally unlike

1396
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,760
anything else is that what the

1397
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,460
shoreline's like as the original clone

1398
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,260
or did I just get lucky with that S1

1399
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,599
man it

1400
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,460
it reminds me of that old school 90s

1401
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:16,559
smell you know like that really good

1402
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:20,300
stuff and most everything in the 90s was

1403
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,300
uh from Neville you know

1404
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:25,800
I just assume it's some NL skunk type

1405
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,619
I've heard rumors of it being skunk and

1406
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,900
then NL skunk so um it's looking like

1407
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:33,599
it's got some NL in there

1408
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,519
so you know and I'll skunk by the puck

1409
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,140
should I got my fingers crossed that

1410
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,358
should be really good

1411
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:40,139
hell yeah hell yeah I'm Keen for that

1412
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,598
one

1413
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:44,578
uh another question I'd had a lot of

1414
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,019
people interested in was I think we

1415
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,940
might have touched on it briefly in the

1416
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:49,858
past but just to cover it again because

1417
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,139
people seem to be very interested do you

1418
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:54,420
have much of a backstory on The Nepalese

1419
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:56,219
hash plant you use in the puck crosses I

1420
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,838
think people see the photos of that and

1421
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:59,699
they're really blown away and they're

1422
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:00,779
like wow what is this Nepalese hash

1423
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:04,618
plant

1424
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:07,260
man that thing is really really unique

1425
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:09,539
um Kevin Jordan's sourced it out of uh

1426
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,800
Grass Valley and he's you know brought

1427
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:13,440
it over to Humboldt you know with

1428
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:16,260
Wonderland nursery and shared it out to

1429
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,139
a bunch of people and um

1430
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:21,359
it's just amazing old school stock you

1431
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:23,159
know and when you cross it to something

1432
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,199
like the puck you get you know

1433
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:26,759
Throwbacks that are old school [ __ ] that

1434
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,759
you're not really going to see anywhere

1435
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,579
that breeding just clicked most of the

1436
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,079
puck crosses uh produced really huge

1437
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,480
buds but

1438
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,900
the way those uh Napoli's were just

1439
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,800
covered in calyxes and uh just like next

1440
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,318
level

1441
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,880
so that one's definitely gonna meet the

1442
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:48,119
BX too

1443
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,800
yeah wow and just to clarify I think I

1444
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:52,318
already know the answer but again a lot

1445
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,140
of fans are interested it's not the uh

1446
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:58,558
The Nepalese variety that uh Bodhi used

1447
00:55:55,139 --> 00:56:01,199
in Goji OG is it no there was a rumor

1448
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,300
recently going around that uh you know

1449
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:06,598
people not Bodhi but people other people

1450
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:09,420
just assuming it was and um I showed

1451
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:11,640
Bodhi samples of it like five years ago

1452
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,380
now when I first got the cut and he was

1453
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:17,219
like wow that's an amazing bug but

1454
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:19,980
that's not the Nepalese that he used

1455
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:21,899
yeah I think like when I spoke to him at

1456
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,420
his house one day I think he said that

1457
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,579
he suspected what he used was like

1458
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,260
misnamed that it was actually like an OG

1459
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:31,019
or something but it just got called that

1460
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,819
but there you go now we know well it's

1461
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:35,099
not the same cut you know who knows what

1462
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:38,099
you use so

1463
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:40,079
interesting stuff nonetheless so uh just

1464
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:43,260
to our final question or two before I

1465
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,960
let you get back to it a lot of fans

1466
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:49,140
very keen to hear probably Mr James been

1467
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,358
also very keen to hear any chance we'll

1468
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:53,098
ever see any feminized work coming out

1469
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:56,039
of crickets and cicada

1470
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:58,200
only if one of my really close old

1471
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:01,019
school friends wants to do the work you

1472
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:04,078
know there has been Talk Amongst a few

1473
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:06,000
of them that they would do the work

1474
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:09,240
you know obviously people would love to

1475
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,338
see the red Lebanese and Cuts Like That

1476
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:12,838
feminized and released in their pure

1477
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:15,358
form and um

1478
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:17,219
if I had somebody really you know old

1479
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:20,279
school trustworthy friend that you know

1480
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:22,259
needed a something to do that might

1481
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,540
happen but it's never going to be what

1482
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,520
I'm going to be doing I'm going to be

1483
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:29,039
focused on getting them in the

1484
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:32,338
pure seed form

1485
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:33,838
um regulars you know I think

1486
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:35,940
you know if the people want it or not

1487
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,159
that's just where my heart is and you

1488
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,800
know that's where uh I feel good about

1489
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:42,779
what I'm doing and especially since I'm

1490
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,900
trying to get these old clones in the

1491
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,400
seed form is you know close as possible

1492
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,039
um choosing the males to the original

1493
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:52,079
clone try to preserve the qualities as

1494
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,539
much as possible I feel like that's

1495
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,640
where I should be going and you know

1496
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:59,460
with the people's interest in the puck

1497
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:01,379
that only reinforces that so that's you

1498
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:04,980
know where I'm going to be going

1499
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:07,318
yeah 100 that's that's awesome to hear I

1500
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,838
I wish I lived closer so that I could do

1501
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:11,519
that Femme project for you but even if

1502
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:13,679
it doesn't happen we're uh we're

1503
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:16,380
incredibly blessed to have access to

1504
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,659
your work in general I think that's just

1505
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,858
about everything I wanted to ask for a

1506
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:21,598
little segment here were there any

1507
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:22,318
comments or shout outs you wanted to

1508
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,920

1509
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:28,858

1516
00:58:43,139 --> 00:58:47,519
someone who's seen the uh the inner

1517
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,859
workings of crickets and cicada I can

1518
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:52,798
definitely vouch that Hannah boat does a

1519
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:54,838
lot of work has the eye helps out so I

1520
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,818
always try to make sure we give props to

1521
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:59,039
her as well she's fundamental in it all

1522
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:01,079
and I also just wanted to give you guys

1523
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,298
another shout out props for the award

1524
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:05,339
you know a killer year so far not just

1525
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:07,500
the puck back cross even The Brood X

1526
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:09,358
which it's crazy because I guess it's

1527
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,159
sort of maybe for some people feels like

1528
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:13,380
it got a little overshadowed by the puck

1529
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:15,420
releases but that in its own right was

1530
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,760
like Contender for really up there with

1531
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,260
strains of the Year sort of thing so I

1532
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,819
think that's why collectively it was

1533
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,040
obvious that you guys were the choice

1534
00:59:20,818 --> 00:59:24,719
for breeder of the year and I also just

1535
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,219
had a lot of patreon members who are

1536
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,199
like you know the hardcore listeners

1537
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:30,118
message me and just say you know like

1538
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:32,460
they feel really good that you guys want

1539
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:34,140
it you got the right Vibe and a lot of

1540
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,420
people really relate to how you've got

1541
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:38,519
this organic approach and just people in

1542
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,318
general just uh expressing that they're

1543
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:41,759

1544
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:43,798

1545
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,260
deserved it a long time coming well you

1546
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:48,900

1549
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:53,519
foreign

1550
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:02,400
y I think that just about brings us to

1551
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:05,039
the end of it for the past 15 16 months

1552
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,539
any comments any notable shout outs you

1553
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,940
want to give for people who maybe didn't

1554
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:10,199
make the list but uh near and dear to

1555
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,298
your heart and let me save you the

1556
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:14,039
effort I know everyone you stock is

1557
01:00:12,298 --> 01:00:17,159
phenomenal they're all your children

1558
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:20,480
you're a loving Papa you've got you've

1559
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:20,480
got a shout out for all of them

1560
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,200
and go through the list and they're like

1561
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,539
I represent all these guys because

1562
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:29,879
because if I don't I'll feel bad so

1563
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:31,079
um it really is because it also comes

1564
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,579
down to if

1565
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:33,839
they're all individual they're all

1566
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:35,640
unique that's the fun thing about Siege

1567
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,199
if they were all doing the same thing I

1568
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:38,940
wouldn't need 60 of them I wouldn't want

1569
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,039
60 of them I just steal a couple of them

1570
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,179
right because it's like sometimes we

1571
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:43,558
need to deal with them I have to tell

1572
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:45,358
them people are dealing with you know we

1573
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:47,040
deal with Stoners on the phone right I

1574
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,598
deal with super Stoners when I talk with

1575
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:52,858
breeders those are guys who are trying

1576
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:55,200
to get higher and so uh so sometimes you

1577
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:56,159
know you get the uh the bumps in the

1578
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:57,960
road that come with the deal with

1579
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:59,578
superstars but um but they're all but

1580
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,599
they all do different things and so you

1581
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:01,980
know when I pick up a breeder I pick

1582
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:03,119
them up for a reason and for what he's

1583
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,500
doing what he's working with and so free

1584
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,180
to pick one over the others it depends

1585
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,500
on what you're looking for right each

1586
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:08,219
breeders can do something different for

1587
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,798
you

1588
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:13,558
um if if you if you're growing uh you

1589
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:15,780
know High Frosty THC stuff I might tell

1590
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,280
you get it back to snow height go with

1591
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,380
some land race go some crazy Off the

1592
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,400
Wall stuff that you haven't grown before

1593
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,780
um that you might see different things

1594
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,579
you'll see some original characteristics

1595
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:25,859
of what they used to be before they were

1596
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:28,140
so heavily worked you know if you're if

1597
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:30,179
you're big into you you know exotic

1598
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:32,460
genetics I might tell you it go go try a

1599
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:35,279
pack of 420 faster you know fast buds

1600
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,838
Tracy monoflowers why why not you got

1601
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,280
two pots in the plant try them and say I

1602
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:39,539
always talk [ __ ] about them well other

1603
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,859
plants have revolved check out how

1604
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:42,420
autoflowers are involved give them a

1605
01:01:40,858 --> 01:01:44,098
shot it doesn't cost you anything one

1606
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,000
plant gives you keeps you excited to go

1607
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:46,920
out to the girl I know when I was

1608
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,358
growing my my whole room was the same

1609
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,400
thing I can't get bored because I saw

1610
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:52,920
the same thing that I'd grown for the

1611
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,720
fifth time and so if I kept like one or

1612
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,680
two plants at the front there might see

1613
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:57,058
different things it would give you

1614
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:58,618
motivated to go out to the garage and

1615
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:01,019
you definitely want to keep your your 90

1616
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:02,400
of your canopy paying the bills but do

1617
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:03,539
the five to ten percent you can play you

1618
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,880

my Vault and over the past 12 years I've

1647
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:56,099
been working with breeders and I always

1648
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:59,338
keep two of every pack

1649
01:02:56,099 --> 01:03:01,859
we keep uh say I get 10 packs in and I

1650
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:03,719
keep two of them as my own as is my own

1651
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:04,798
stock I buy those two put those involved

1652
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:06,239
you know that way if there's any

1653
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:07,739
situation down the road you're gonna

1654
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,118
have to replace the pack I've got that

1655
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:09,779
pack and I can fix it for you to make it

1656
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,579
right

1657
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:14,099
um well over the years those packs that

1658
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:15,780
never had any situations with them ended

1659
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:18,240
up staying in the vault so they're kind

1660
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:20,880
of trying through packs and those packs

1661
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:23,399
I'm not growing I because I run a cement

1662
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,700
I can't I shouldn't go in my garage like

1663
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,798
I used to so uh those we auction those

1664
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:30,298
packs off and uh there's all kinds of

1665
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:31,920
good stuff in there it's everything I've

1666
01:03:30,298 --> 01:03:33,179
had over the past 12 years that's coming

1667
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,980
up so it's kind of it's kind of cool

1668
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:37,318
just to look at it as a library of the

1669
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,940
packs that used to be right and they're

1670
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:40,440
my packs and so they've been in a bank

1671
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,740
storage Vault like in an actual bank

1672
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,940
that has an actual security guard uh all

1673
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:48,298

1674
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:50,280
