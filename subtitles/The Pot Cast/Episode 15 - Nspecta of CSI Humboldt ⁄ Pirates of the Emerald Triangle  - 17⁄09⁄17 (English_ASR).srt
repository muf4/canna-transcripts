triangle thanks so much for coming on

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,829
it's good to be here so the first

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,460
question I like to ask all breeders what

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:06,659
was your introduction to cannabis I'm

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:12,090
definitely a second generation you know

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:16,799
grower breeder etc etc my dad you know

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:20,820
started way back in the 70s he was

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,670
growing indoors in the late 70s and you

26
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,978
know he he showed me his grow rooms back

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,478
when I was a little kid you know was

28
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:31,140
smoking my face when I was a little bit

29
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,349
young you know I don't remember that but

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,368
you know pass me the joint when I was

31
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:40,349
911 you know and you know I was

32
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:43,828
definitely a water in plants by the time

33
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:46,469
I was 8 years old for my uncle

34
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:50,429
not so much my dad on that on that one

35
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:51,868
but yeah I started pretty young awesome

36
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,299
and so you do you remember any of the

37
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:55,739
strains that were let you know when you

38
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,460
can first kind of remember things

39
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,048
because obviously you're not gonna

40
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,699
remember 8 but you know like maybe when

41
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,259
you were 14 15 German what they were

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,270
growing well when I was 18 the very

43
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,360
first cutting my dad gave me was

44
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:11,128
Northern Lights that he had got from

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
some of his buddies who I think brought

46
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:17,909
it down from the Seattle area

47
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,069
but before that he had the strain

48
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:24,569
I'm not strained but he had this cutting

49
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:27,419
that had come from either the Portland

50
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,459
OR Seattle area back in the early 80s

51
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:34,169
I'm thinking like somewhere between 82

52
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:38,700
and 84 and a man he swears to this day

53
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:41,039
that it's the best stuff ever but I I

54
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,669
remember when I was I don't know how I

55
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,969
was pretty young

56
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:47,280
some some time between 8 and 10 he

57
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:50,009
opened up his hidden grow room and I

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:56,550
mean it was it was the most gorgeous

59
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:58,799
just 16 cush plants in this 6 foot by 6

60
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:04,469
foot room under a thousand watt metal

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,450
halide and I mean to this day you know

62
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:09,449
I'm looking for something that looks as

63
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:13,469
gorgeous as that you know definitely

64
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:18,239
something cush and that he received as a

65
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:20,669
no-name plant from you know the Portland

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:26,610
Seattle area but he was told it was bred

67
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:29,789
for 80 degrees and 80% humidity now this

68
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,500
is where it gets a little weird but he

69
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:36,870
always harvested it at 28 days flower

70
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,180
okay right

71
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:44,670
but outdoors it wasn't even ready until

72
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:48,360
like mid-november you know but anyways

73
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:52,979
uh so you know with that said it was a

74
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,770
no-name strain but roughly about 1989 I

75
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:58,469
think he got this other cutting after

76
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,090
he'd lost that first one from the cave

77
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,919
junction area in Southern Oregon and

78
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,550
this plant kind of looked halfway

79
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:10,319
between an OG Kush and above Akash and

80
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:16,230
this this cutting was called Uriah he

81
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:18,779
gave me that plant in the mid-90s and I

82
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,720
held it along with you know cousins and

83
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:25,619
family and friends up until the early

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,310
2000s but uh you know that's another one

85
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,000
of those ones

86
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:33,329
just got lost a time but it it smelled

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,939
and tasted exactly how weed is supposed

88
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:38,069
to smell and anytime something anything

89
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,469
comes even close to it it's like oh

90
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:43,800
that's a keeper the ones that have come

91
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:48,200
closer like my bus one bomb threat

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:51,090
I rain like a phenotype of purple dog

93
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,509
purple dog blood which is a Oracle x

94
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:57,839
chem 91 and even some of the like

95
00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:00,990
triangle cush times or khals they they

96
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,629
hit that you know just that is what weed

97
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,790
is supposed to be I don't know just just

98
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,439
from my earliest memories anyway yes

99
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,760
that's so interesting you just touched

100
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,540
on so many points we'll have to dive

101
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,129
into first one do you think that that

102
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,020
strain which you know you kind of hold

103
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,060
is the benchmark do you think that was a

104
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,139
predecessor to you know the Bubba's and

105
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,668
the Urkel's and all that or do you think

106
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,120
it was the other way around like it had

107
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:26,029
already been blended together oh it was

108
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,209
definitely I wouldn't say it was a

109
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:34,849
predecessor but I would say that you

110
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:37,769
know possibly some of the oh geez and

111
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:42,479
bubbles and stuff maybe just share

112
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:46,529
certain you know lineages you know yeah

113
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,240
okay pop and so this might be wrong but

114
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,038
when if we just go back to how you

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,538
mentioned I think you said at 18 you got

116
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:53,969
to see the grow room and you saw you

117
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:56,009
know the 16 cush plants was that the

118
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:00,270
defining moment for you where you kind

119
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:05,490
of were like this is for me mm-hmm

120
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:12,930
that's a good question I don't know if

121
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:16,110
it was a defining moment but you know I

122
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:19,379
think I was casual I was honestly I was

123
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:23,069
casual into the growing from the time I

124
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:26,699
was 18 until the time I was about 20 I

125
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:30,959
guess 21 and then I kind of had to make

126
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:35,038
a decision you know pursue you know a

127
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:39,469
real-world job like I was doing or you

128
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:43,579
know go full-time growing and well

129
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,560
Danette awesome and so what was the

130
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:51,289
first strain you bred and what caused

131
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:54,800
you to decide to breathe well I mean you

132
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:57,410
know grown between 94 and the early

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,220
2000s you know there was definitely you

134
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,930
know accidental things and we you know

135
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,430
me and friends and family started the

136
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:12,620
seeds and everything but then around

137
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:14,780
2002 I had kind of a a little mutant

138
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,050
activity going on with the purple

139
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:22,759
article I had this 12,000 watt room and

140
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:26,540
I had roughly I think nine oh maybe it

141
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,860
was a hundred and 108 plants of Oracle

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:34,480
and a couple other things in the room

143
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,480
and one of the purple Oracle's branches

144
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:41,509
basically turned full Mail okay right

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,820
yeah I mean you got over a hundred

146
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,339
plants and they're all females except

147
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:50,029
for this one branch and a turn totally

148
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:51,918
male and so I took that male branch and

149
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:55,129
I pollinated a bunch of stuff with it I

150
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:58,310
pollinator comb a dark glass ones made

151
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:02,750
trainwreck articles and a handful of

152
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,699
other Furcal hybrids and I grew a me and

153
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,519
my cousin and you know some other folks

154
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:09,139
grew a bunch of those seeds out and I

155
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,569
there was killed her stuff in those

156
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:14,478
seeds you know and that was about two

157
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:18,019
years before I got on online I came

158
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:20,449
online in 2004 and then I really started

159
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:23,269
you know learning like you know oh wait

160
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:26,689
hmm you can turn them into males you

161
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:29,449
know so it sounds like things were

162
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:30,709
fairly self-directed well with that

163
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:32,269
being said though were there any

164
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,588
breeders you were keeping your eye on at

165
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:37,668
that point and thought like oh I like

166
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:42,169
the stuff these guys are doing before

167
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:44,360
2004 I mean I'm just a emerald turtle

168
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,769
kid living in the backwoods of Humboldt

169
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,240
in Trinity County

170
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:49,860
[Music]

171
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,080
yeah we didn't have in I didn't have

172
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,159
internet myself until roughly around

173
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,310
2004 yeah you know so I didn't even know

174
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,049
what a breeder was no okay so did you

175
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,889
just you just work with your own stock

176
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:04,799
from year to year

177
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:08,669
oh yeah yeah all the stuff I inherited

178
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:13,169
from my dad and his friends and other

179
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:18,449
friends yeah so awesome and so if we

180
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:22,409
fast forward I think it was in mid 2000s

181
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:25,379
you decided to start CSI or was it even

182
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:28,949
after that in like 2010 maybe I I

183
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:30,629
started CSI three years ago yeah that's

184
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,600
what I thought I was like was it 2014 I

185
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:37,139
thought I read yeah I mean I

186
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,060
I'm breeding a lot of the same stuff you

187
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:44,699
know I Brett over 10 years ago

188
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:47,099
I'm skinny I didn't yeah I didn't start

189
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,560
the company and start retailing until

190
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,909
three years ago yes so I mean I guess

191
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,399
the question some people might be

192
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:56,959
wondering is why did it kind of take you

193
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:03,179
so long to get into the commercial game

194
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:07,560
I mean honestly I was I was just grown

195
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:12,569
my outdoor crops and just occupations

196
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:15,359
and having fun for a good bit and also

197
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,430
you know every time I checked into it um

198
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,629
I looked into doing the whole seed thing

199
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:24,239
and every time was just like you gotta

200
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:30,509
sell them overseas and UK or Spain or

201
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:34,649
something and then even legally getting

202
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:39,269
the money you know for um it was yeah it

203
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:41,549
wasn't easy so I was just like nah too

204
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:44,879
risky for me at the time anyway yeah

205
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:47,009
okay and then I guess just to have a

206
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,480
distinction what was the reason for

207
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,669
starting parts of the Emerald triangle

208
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,080
like why did you want to have the two

209
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:53,879
separate brands for people who are aware

210
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,530
ones for the feminized line ones for the

211
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,539
regular line but did you just kind of

212
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,459
get the idea that oh the feeling that

213
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,329
like they wouldn't gel together as a

214
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,800
brand so just

215
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:07,740
oh so to be honest I always wanted to do

216
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,990
pirates of the Emerald triangle that was

217
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,289
kind of you know the name of you know my

218
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:17,070
buddies and me and you know just what we

219
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:23,339
did around Humboldt and Trinity in

220
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:27,660
Mendocino even but when I started up a

221
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:33,269
seed company like my closest friends and

222
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:35,069
my ex they liked CSI humble / pirates

223
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,439
they didn't think pirates was marketable

224
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:43,830
I was like okay I'll just go with

225
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:46,260
pirates or CSI sorry and then you know

226
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:51,120
as time went on I was like well I still

227
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:54,509
kind of want to you know do my original

228
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,810
you know idea of pirates so I just kind

229
00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:00,450
of segregated them yeah you know and so

230
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:02,609
if we just kind of jump back to a while

231
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:05,310
ago you mentioned the bomb threat Bubba

232
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:09,120
this is interesting you know archive

233
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:10,529
also uses this one as a mother how long

234
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,029
has that one been around for I actually

235
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,579
was under the impression I'm probably

236
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:19,860
wrong but I thought Fletch popped that

237
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:21,540
one but it was you oh yeah I sprouted it

238
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,279
wasn't even a large seed pop I sprouted

239
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:30,509
a 20 of my bubba kush s1 seeds back in

240
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:33,029
2006 the basically from the same

241
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:35,549
breeding that obama cush came from and

242
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,379
that my buddy popularized up in a

243
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:45,740
Portland Seattle and everything but uh

244
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:48,149
yeah I popped 20 seeds and it was my it

245
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,720
weirdly enough it was my favorite

246
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,669
commercial plant of the bunch a had kind

247
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,040
of like a lemon-lime you know type of

248
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:59,519
thing my favorite plant out of that

249
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:03,329
bunch was this lemon heads candy above

250
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,870
s1 number 12 but nobody could grow it

251
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,810
after the first seed run I mean it was

252
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:13,110
just a horrible plant to grow and so

253
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:14,129
everybody who I gave it to lost it real

254
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,190
quick

255
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:20,189
the bomb threat though it ended up

256
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,440
sticking around and people liked it hmm

257
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,060
I didn't even keep it for a long time so

258
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,920
I probably didn't have it for two or

259
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,929
three years and then I realized

260
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,049
everybody had given it to still had it

261
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:35,008
and absolutely loved it and then I got

262
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:39,088
it back and you know but yeah the reason

263
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:45,000
a lot of people think archive sprouted

264
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:48,930
it is because I entered I entered bombs

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,639
left bomb threat flowers that I grew and

266
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:57,679
I think 2013 through archive seedbank

267
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:02,339
through you know

268
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:04,198
Fletcher's company and then it won third

269
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:07,589
place at the High Times show that it was

270
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:09,508
entered at so you know even though I

271
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:10,410
grew it you know he got kind of the

272
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:15,139
credit for it

273
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:18,719
you know bum oh well I mean oh so good

274
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:20,068
nowhere is there awesome so I mean in

275
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,660
terms of the Bubba if you want to dive a

276
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:24,750
little deeper into a question I always

277
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:26,429
get asked is like comparing the Bubba to

278
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,720
the Oregon Afghani I'm not sure if

279
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:30,359
you're familiar with it

280
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,339
but a lot of people who like hint that

281
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,990
maybe Bubba comes from not Oregon

282
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,550
Afghani but I always got the impression

283
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,318
it was the other way around

284
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:41,399
do you have any kind of opinions on that

285
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:47,519
one I would probably agree with you I

286
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:49,740
honestly think more than likely the

287
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,480
Oregon Afghani comes from Bubba but then

288
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:56,698
on the flip side you know the organ a

289
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,319
fee could be its own thing because there

290
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:03,479
are a lot of plants around the mo of

291
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:08,490
triangle that have that similar you know

292
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:11,670
look and it's just old Afghani type

293
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,250
plant you know yeah and so do you know

294
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:17,039
much about the history of Bubba before

295
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,149
you know Matt or you know if that is the

296
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,990
truth are you kind of going on at this

297
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:26,610
point I I tend to believe the story as

298
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,289
far as a Matt and Josh Josh the yeah and

299
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,720
so if we

300
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:33,019
that is a bit of a segue I got told the

301
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,790
other day that someone was like ah the

302
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,110
og that Josh brought to the scene was

303
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:37,879
ghost og and I was like no I thought

304
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,199
that was triangle and they said oh yeah

305
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,909
they're the same thing and I was like I

306
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,059
thought they were different what do you

307
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:47,000
think on that well it's a little bit

308
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:52,609
calm complicated but the way I read it

309
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,809
is there what would what Matt brought

310
00:15:52,610 --> 00:16:00,769
from Florida is a bagsied I would assume

311
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:03,409
most likely from triangle cush so

312
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:07,459
imagine a triangle cush s1 that they

313
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:11,419
brought you know over to the Southern

314
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:14,028
California area and then the ghost is

315
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:17,240
basically just the cut that you know

316
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:21,139
Josh or them you know their people sold

317
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,810
to Oregon kid who sold to ghost which

318
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:27,139
it's weird calling it ghost even though

319
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:30,349
it's really just the Josh D cut you know

320
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:33,589
or the Matt Burd Matt Berger's cut you

321
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:38,540
know so so it's not the s1 you don't

322
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:43,459
think or it may be as far as like s1 of

323
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:46,639
TK or of TK sorry yeah I would mention

324
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:49,338
it's s1 because that's the way the story

325
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,528
uh you know plays out as far as Matt

326
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,779
Berger saying you know they got some

327
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:56,870
seeds in the back you know and I've met

328
00:16:53,778 --> 00:17:00,588
a lot of people who you know grew or

329
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:04,308
bought triangle cush back in Florida

330
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:08,209
around the whole Orlando area and the

331
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:11,509
greater Florida area you know back in

332
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:15,048
the mid early 90s yeah so it definitely

333
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:17,990
was was there yeah and I mean that seems

334
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:20,509
to make sense to me because the the

335
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:23,419
triangle to me it doesn't have really

336
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:25,789
any hints of lemon in it and and the

337
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:28,880
ghost is quite similar in my opinion but

338
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:30,859
how did we make that jump from there to

339
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,950
the you know like the real heavy lemon

340
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:36,349
pie no geez we have now like commonly I

341
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,240
hear the idea that it was s ones led to

342
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:40,129
that and I can totally believe that but

343
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,089
I the one thing I struggle to grasp is

344
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,190
where did all that lemon

345
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:45,470
come from I just struggled to believe it

346
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,110
was recessive Lee in the TK is I think

347
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,909
maybe some kind of lemon male came into

348
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:53,240
the story for example maybe to make like

349
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:56,480
sfv or something along those lines right

350
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,839
well kind of take it like this I mean

351
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,759
when is one Bubba I mean you know you

352
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,339
you don't hear anybody saying Bubba

353
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,919
tastes like lemon lime or you know lemon

354
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:09,500
heads candy and yet just out of a simple

355
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,380
20 pack you know I pulled both those

356
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,538
types out other my buddy grew out 35

357
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,419
just a couple years ago of my fresh

358
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:20,720
batch and he found you know a lemon-lime

359
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:23,750
one and he also found one that was just

360
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,690
super fruity just like you know berries

361
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,960
and such you know yeah so there's a lot

362
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,269
of stuff hiding and s ones you know or

363
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,100
even s twos that you know come out you

364
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:38,679
know when you grow out you know the

365
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:41,839
seeds okay it's not it s ones are never

366
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:45,200
replicas of the mother cup you know

367
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:47,240
so just as a general question I was

368
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,149
thinking about it last night and I was

369
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,179
kind of struggling to find a clear

370
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:56,298
example of where there was an S one that

371
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,429
was better than the original plan and I

372
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:59,720
was wondering do you can you think of

373
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,070
anything that jumps to mind whether it's

374
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,960
an S one that's clearly better than the

375
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:08,000
parent I honestly most people who smoke

376
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,350
bomb threat think it's better than its

377
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,278
parent

378
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:14,980
I've got Mendocino Purple's s ones that

379
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:19,009
are definitely better than the parent

380
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:22,759
I've grown Arkell s ones that are better

381
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:24,379
than the herbal so most most lines so

382
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,619
far that I've done you know definitely

383
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,620
have individuals that are easily better

384
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:33,079
than you know the parent tissue okay so

385
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:34,939
and do you think that comes down to the

386
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:37,038
quality of the breeding like does good

387
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,788
feminizing practices affect the end

388
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:45,950
quality of the seed you know I was

389
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:49,190
actually just listening to your podcast

390
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:53,179
with them at riot yeah on some of my

391
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,259
stuff and I I'm one of the firm

392
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:55,730
believers that

393
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,129
I do not think you can change the

394
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,289
genetics no matter how the feminised

395
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,290
seeds are created I think if it's

396
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:05,569
accidental I think if it's you know on

397
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:08,420
purpose you know STS clear little silver

398
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:10,939
you know gibberellic acid I think you're

399
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,700
always gonna create the same exact seeds

400
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:17,450
no matter what you you really can't

401
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,840
change base DNA genetics I don't think

402
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:24,350
but okay you know I look I live in the

403
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:26,059
backwoods so you know and so like I mean

404
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:28,490
with that being said do you think then

405
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:31,099
that we should try to avoid the stigma

406
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,019
around like her me seed so to speak

407
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:36,439
because something I I've always noticed

408
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:38,269
is people will call like let's say bag

409
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,850
seat you know so it's like unintentional

410
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:44,150
male flowers on a female causing seeds

411
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:45,709
so people will call bags it's s1 but

412
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,600
then they'll also call like a properly

413
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,000
made feminized seed and that's one I

414
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,319
always thought you know should should we

415
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,880
call them the same or call them

416
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,960
different I guess in your mind they're

417
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,170
the same thing right there's just no

418
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:02,090
difference the only thing with bag seeds

419
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:03,980
that throws a shadow of doubt is there

420
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:07,579
there's always - two or three

421
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:11,690
opportunity you know options really they

422
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:14,089
could be s ones they could be feminized

423
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,539
hybrids you know one plant harmed on to

424
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:20,209
another or they could be random stray

425
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:22,129
pollen from a male plant so you really

426
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,350
don't know with backseat a hundred

427
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,320
percent unless you really know your

428
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:29,719
plants well you know and you're

429
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,720
responsible for those bag seats if it's

430
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:36,079
from some random bag you never know yeah

431
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,549
you know okay so are there any clones

432
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,990
that you've worked with that you would

433
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:40,609
consider to be like really highly

434
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,160
recessive and maybe not ideal for

435
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:45,349
feminizing in that they might make some

436
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,970
or is ones and the quality of the S

437
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:48,649
bonds is really good but as soon as you

438
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:53,000
put that pollen onto another plant it

439
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:55,090
just the results aren't as good that's a

440
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,819
good question

441
00:21:55,089 --> 00:22:06,369
you know I don't know if I even ever

442
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:06,369
thought about that before oh

443
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:13,769
a lot of times I don't even point people

444
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:17,189
to s ones particularly because most s

445
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:19,339
ones in my experience you know tend to

446
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,558
have like forty or fifty percent like

447
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:26,459
recessive genetics themselves and with

448
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,500
the s ones you end up with generally

449
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,639
close to 50% of the population just

450
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,679
being weak and inbred you you definitely

451
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:37,619
get some strong you know good quality

452
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:41,309
plants but it's all with just pure s

453
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:43,378
ones it's almost like a throwaway so a

454
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:45,720
lot of times feminized hybrids work

455
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:48,480
better with an out Cross than they do

456
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,950
with an a swan so I don't know that's

457
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,730
not exactly the question but um you know

458
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,950
no that's awesome

459
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,960
and so I kind of like the follow up to

460
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,659
that is a lot of people will often kind

461
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,340
of say that the plant that's being

462
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,740
turned into the donat the pollen donor

463
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,538
will tend to be more dominant in the

464
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,009
cross as a rule of thumb do you find

465
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:09,658
that's the case or it's still just down

466
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:11,700
to the individual plan if it's like a

467
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:15,230
dominant plant in crosses and it kind of

468
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:19,649
regardless of if it's the donor pollen

469
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:21,750
it definitely varies and this is

470
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:25,500
something I definitely want to work on

471
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:29,339
more myself because I've I've done a lot

472
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,798
of opposite crosses like where you take

473
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:35,939
say you reverse bubba kush and you

474
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:37,950
pollinate purple Arkell and other times

475
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,700
you reverse or coal and you pollinate

476
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:45,649
bubba kush you know a lot of the

477
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:49,139
breeders like say sam skunk man you know

478
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:56,548
he'll say you know um they come out the

479
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:58,589
same but or kill avoid the question but

480
00:23:56,548 --> 00:24:00,690
honestly i don't know you know i mean i

481
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:02,730
really want to run out like large

482
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,909
hundred or thousand lots of these seeds

483
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,589
of these reverse crosses because even on

484
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:10,139
the small level i've done them

485
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:12,209
you know it almost seems like they

486
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:17,339
produce different results depending on

487
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:19,170
the pollen donor so it's it's definitely

488
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,209
variable that

489
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,289
I don't know if I can fully answer that

490
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,630
question for sure

491
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:27,149
ya know I definitely would have to

492
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,860
disagree with the Sam on that one for a

493
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,230
few reasons I mean I'm pretty sure DJ's

494
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,779
short throughout the idea that he said I

495
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,120
always prefer the more sativa of the two

496
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,619
plants in Mike Ross to be the female so

497
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,329
straight away like he's agreeing that

498
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:41,219
there is something to that idea and it's

499
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:42,509
not just irrelevant and then more so I

500
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,039
was thinking about that myself because

501
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:45,930
I've kind of toyed with that idea myself

502
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,399
with just some kind of pollen and I

503
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,410
found that I definitely got better

504
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,170
results doing it one way than the other

505
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:53,580
so then it got me thinking well was it

506
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,350
the case that you know the way that

507
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:57,299
worked well was the way that's better or

508
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:59,939
was it just the case that when I did it

509
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:02,490
and I got good results I just did a

510
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,160
better male selection that run and so

511
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,109
the results came out better right

512
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,509
there's a lot of variables so it's it's

513
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:12,929
I think there definitely needs to be

514
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:16,619
some more scientific you know they're

515
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:19,320
regimens to you know say yeah now and

516
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,879
that question for sure okay and so I

517
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,649
mean if we just kind of jump to a bit of

518
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,630
a different topic for a moment we were

519
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,370
talking about the air-cool before the

520
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,780
pit for some people at least the Urkel

521
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:29,759
was like the oldest cut they have in

522
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,649
their library when did you get the Urkel

523
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,279
and as a follow-up what's the oldest cut

524
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:40,769
you've got in your library I got Oracle

525
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:45,210
around 2001 and pretty much the whole

526
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:49,019
family and everybody everybody I knew

527
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:52,019
had this Oracle you know around that

528
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:56,750
time it was the number one most popular

529
00:25:52,019 --> 00:26:02,269
strain in California and beyond you know

530
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:08,640
for a good five five plus years their

531
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:12,960
oldest cut I still have the Humboldt

532
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:18,480
snow or the snow I got that back in I

533
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:23,519
think 99 I had a bunch of older cuts but

534
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:26,360
I lost all of those in 2002 so I think

535
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,910
the snow is the oldest one I still have

536
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:32,039
so I think I read a part from you I mean

537
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,220
you've already made the snow hybrids and

538
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,990
there

539
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,370
about to be released soon but I remember

540
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,509
like when you very first started doing

541
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:38,009
it you were like oh yeah I'm making

542
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:39,569
these hybrids I don't think people will

543
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:41,490
be so interested in them but I'm just

544
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:42,869
doing them for me mostly why do you

545
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,609
think people really interested in the

546
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:46,319
snow like do you think it's like not

547
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:50,788
really desirable compared to today's

548
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:52,798
stuff or it's just not fancy you know it

549
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:55,259
ain't no purple punted ain't no you know

550
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:58,019
gelato or you know wedding cake you know

551
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:00,210
it's it's not all these designer you

552
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,158
know hyped up things it's just old

553
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,230
school you know there's stuff that you

554
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,510
take one to hit too many back in the

555
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,269
late 90s and you're puking and the

556
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:10,859
gutter so how would you describe it for

557
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:13,168
someone like me for example who's never

558
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:15,359
had purists no I like is it kind of like

559
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:19,470
a sweet strain looks pretty frosty on

560
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,329
your Instagram yeah it's it's a frosty I

561
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:26,100
just described as like a frosty hash

562
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:32,058
plant a little bit piney skunky hashey

563
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:32,058
um just kind of old-school flavors and

564
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:41,400
originally the snow actually uh I guess

565
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:45,349
came from the Eugene area you know I've

566
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:49,038
even heard it potentially being related

567
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:53,819
possibly like a sister cut to Trinity

568
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:56,038
and then you know both of those possibly

569
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:58,288
related to four-way but that's just you

570
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:01,890
know things that I'd like to iron out

571
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:05,099
with some folks and actually see if any

572
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:06,390
of that pans out Trinity's an

573
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,918
interesting one I don't think we've ever

574
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,288
really spoken about it on the show but

575
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,538
the thing which caught my eyes besides

576
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:15,538
you know like the ambiguity of the

577
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:17,038
genetics and the name or whatever it a

578
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:19,710
lot of people comment like it's gone

579
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:23,190
downhill over the years it's sometimes

580
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,538
it throws manners apparently and some

581
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,909
people say the flavors not quite what it

582
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,740
used to be I'm always interested in cuts

583
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:31,919
that have degraded verses cuts that

584
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,720
haven't would you consider it to be one

585
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,390
that's really degraded and would you

586
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,269
still work with it I guess

587
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:42,570
you know I've never floured out the pure

588
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:45,900
serenity I've recently been given a cut

589
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:50,308
of Trinity that may or may not be

590
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,860
the original I seem to you know it

591
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:58,470
definitely looks like what I know of as

592
00:28:52,859 --> 00:29:01,049
the original so it's definitely one that

593
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:04,170
has potential for you know s ones but

594
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:06,690
then again if it if it actually came

595
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:10,980
from far away then four-way might

596
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:14,460
actually be a better bet to you know dig

597
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,769
into and see what's in the genetics yeah

598
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,240
interesting interesting and so if we

599
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:20,308
just jump back to the oka we were

600
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,799
talking about in a moment do you have

601
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:25,109
any ideas about what the genetics may be

602
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,019
we've heard mad farmers speculate that

603
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:30,808
on the father's side it was maybe a

604
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:32,220
predecessor to Northern Lights - do you

605
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:35,339
know anything along those lines or

606
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:38,100
anything in general you know I've always

607
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:41,308
heard since early on after I got it

608
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:44,219
there was a couple things I was told

609
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:46,740
when I got it one that came off a bell

610
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,558
Springs Road and Bell Springs Road is

611
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,609
basically a back road between humble

612
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:58,920
Humboldt County Garberville and

613
00:29:52,609 --> 00:30:01,558
Mendocino County and you know I honestly

614
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,160
I want to dig up Tom Hill one of these

615
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:10,109
days if he's still alive I'm pretty sure

616
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:11,730
he is but you know because a lot of his

617
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,269
genetics came from this cat named the

618
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,970
chemist

619
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:18,629
and I kind of almost wonder if this

620
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:20,370
chemist isn't responsible for merkel or

621
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:23,160
isn't you know once or twice removed

622
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:29,119
from somebody who's responsible for this

623
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:33,058
Urkel because people people said that it

624
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:36,379
was a Pakistani time skunk number one

625
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:39,420
and that was kind of like you know

626
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,660
almost called common knowledge you know

627
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,410
around southern humble you know so could

628
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:48,240
be true

629
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:50,480
you never know but I'm I'm running out a

630
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,400
bunch of pine tar pushes right now and

631
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:58,069
there are definitely a lot of plants

632
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:01,610
that resemble Merkel s worms so yeah

633
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:03,200
what can you tell us about Tom hill in

634
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,689
general I mean I don't know if you're

635
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,910
aware Mean Gene last episode said that

636
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,558
the chemist is Tom Hill's dad I don't

637
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,840
know if you knew that I didn't so I

638
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:14,750
thought that's cool and the other cool

639
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,798
thing too that is his arm anyway what

640
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,240
can you tell us about the pine tar

641
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:19,490
project there's some photos on your

642
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,589
Instagram it's a hard one to come across

643
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,298
I had a few packs of x18 and they didn't

644
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:26,089
germ so I was mighty impressed when you

645
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:28,789
got I think you said 230 out of 300 or

646
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:30,139
so yeah yeah so what's the goal with the

647
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:34,129
pine tar and what can you tell us about

648
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:38,330
Tom Miller in general well just just to

649
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:41,330
recap on the the pine tar cush so last

650
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:42,949
time I actually saw Tom in person was a

651
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:47,689
couple of years ago at the golden tarp

652
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:49,640
Awards and he promised me he he had a

653
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,130
thousand seeds left at the pine Turkish

654
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,320
and I told him you know the work I was

655
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,840
doing at the time and he's like oh well

656
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,899
you know I'll give you my last thousand

657
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:03,798
and you can do a big open pollination

658
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:07,640
and since then everybody I know and you

659
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:09,650
know who knows Tom including myself he's

660
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:15,320
pretty much dropped off you know that

661
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:17,240
the we'd grown planet so I you know I

662
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,789
was I was left to basically round up

663
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,990
just a bunch of pine tar cush seeds from

664
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:27,889
you know the community essentially you

665
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:31,099
know yeah but uh wait did I lose the

666
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:33,259
question no no and then what do you hope

667
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:38,469
to ultimately get out of the ptk project

668
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:42,048
I just think it's a quality pure pure

669
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,610
indica line so I mean the thing I've

670
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:47,150
been doing for the last few years at

671
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:50,089
least is just preserving and reproducing

672
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:54,380
all these you know just pure lines I've

673
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:56,589
done you know Colombians Burmese the

674
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,620
Pakistanis trawls

675
00:32:56,589 --> 00:33:06,109
you know the pine tar is now a handful

676
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:08,178
of others so it's for future work okay

677
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,289
and how do you think and compares to

678
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:11,250
these other strains we've had a few

679
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:14,339
people say that

680
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,140
they've heard the pine tar pretty much

681
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,529
blows most of his other work out of the

682
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,120
water

683
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:19,529
especially the deep chunk which is

684
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,789
interesting because it you know it's got

685
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:22,680
such a cult following because it looks

686
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:26,460
so cool and it's pretty interesting but

687
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:29,070
at the same time it's pretty bland right

688
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,460
deep chunk by itself is definitely

689
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:34,710
boring I think there's good qualities

690
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,650
too deep chunk III reproduced that one

691
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:42,690
as well from some of his old 2003 stock

692
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:45,150
but the the pine tar yeah definitely is

693
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:49,110
one of the the ones out of his lines

694
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:51,300
that you know has definitely been one I

695
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:52,559
wanna I've been wanting to preserve for

696
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:56,009
a long time

697
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,679
the x.18 as well I've grown a little bit

698
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:00,960
of that out a couple times and every

699
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,960
time it produces some really nice just

700
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,180
you know landrace style plants so

701
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,820
nothing that you know people really want

702
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:12,360
these days you know yeah but you know

703
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:15,120
stuff to build on okay and so I remember

704
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:17,789
watching you interview with Kevin Joe

705
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,679
tree and you mentioned that the ogk

706
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:22,918
beefy no comes out in aerica less ones

707
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,590
about ten percent of the time so with

708
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:27,929
that being said do you feel like there's

709
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:32,179
a bit of Urkel energy KB or just a

710
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:37,050
common lineage between the two oh I I

711
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:40,710
definitely think that some part of if

712
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:43,200
they're telling the truth and everything

713
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:48,210
the cookies family I definitely think

714
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:51,658
there's some Arkell in the Durbin f1 you

715
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:54,360
know okay and so so do you think that

716
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,128
that is the case like do you think they

717
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:01,079
really know what they've got I get the

718
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:04,980
feeling they probably don't and day yeah

719
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:08,909
that's a tough one they might or they

720
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:11,159
might not you know I've got buddies down

721
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:14,699
in mindo who known them since they were

722
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:18,739
kids and most of those guys think they

723
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:21,569
don't know exactly 100% what they have

724
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:23,309
what they're working with yeah okay well

725
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,760
I mean maybe a more underlying question

726
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:26,079
do you think

727
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,460
they may not know what it is do you

728
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,380
think they were the ones we're like

729
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,750
operating the room where the seed was

730
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,910
originally conceived or the alternative

731
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,760
stories they got bags of it and they

732
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:39,809
were just the ones who popped it yeah I

733
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:44,320
think they're probably responsible for

734
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:46,570
but that's more more you know folks like

735
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,430
me and Jane you know downer Mendo would

736
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:51,280
definitely know more about that then you

737
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:53,949
know you know where where I was up in

738
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,810
Humboldt okay you know the back Trinity

739
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:58,659
well the other little popular idea at

740
00:35:55,809 --> 00:36:00,549
the moment is that some common ancestor

741
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:02,559
of the cookies or possibly even just the

742
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,570
straight parent and it it's an s1 is the

743
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,639
cherry pie cush I'm not sure if you've

744
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,710
heard of it do you have any opinions on

745
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:14,589
that one whether it is possibly in the

746
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:17,019
you know the bloodline you know it could

747
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:20,230
be and and cherry pie is supposed to be

748
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:21,909
a granddaddy purple times Durbin f1 or

749
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,980
something to that effect right yeah I

750
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:25,389
think the one that is kind of getting

751
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,280
tatted at the moment is actually

752
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:29,079
apparently different to just straight

753
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,030
cherry pie and they call it cherry pie

754
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,739
coach even though I'm short a pie gets

755
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,780
called a pike wish by accident but

756
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:37,209
apparently it's different and the story

757
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,840
that's going around especially from the

758
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:42,820
gauge green crew is that you know Girl

759
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,140
Scout cookies is just an s-1 from this

760
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,760
plan and apparently if you grow this

761
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:47,759
plan it's a little bit self evident

762
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:55,689
interesting well yeah I know the plant

763
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:59,649
it was the one Tim Blake was growing

764
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:04,539
yeah and the other psi crew yeah yeah

765
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:07,019
yeah and then of course Alan I forget

766
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:12,690
your name Pattinson oh but how do some

767
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:20,590
yeah yeah I mean I've heard his story um

768
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:22,840
yeah I don't know yeah I was gonna say

769
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:25,960
with that being said just to go back to

770
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,640
oh gee KB do you think ogk B is like an

771
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,530
S one of Girl Scout cookies or do you

772
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:31,509
think it's maybe one of the original

773
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,510
seeds from the original stock which is

774
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,640
kind of the other story that goes around

775
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,840
yeah you know I've always thought you

776
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:43,299
know

777
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:46,390
was just s1 or whatever whatever but I

778
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,590
met this fellow a few weeks back up in

779
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,199
Portland

780
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:53,340
his is uh he went by the handle oh gee

781
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:57,279
cush breath yeah right you know and he

782
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:01,059
he's the guy that you know he's the

783
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,269
source of the OG kv clone and he swears

784
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:07,809
up and down it's the original sentiment

785
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:09,579
so I don't know yeah I've read a story

786
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:12,969
for him saying in his way as he popped

787
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:14,170
the seed and so there's like okay but

788
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:15,939
yeah I think that's maybe where that

789
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,340
that second story I mentioned got

790
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:22,570
traction because if he did pop the seed

791
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:24,220
well then yeah who knows anyway just

792
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,559
maybe a last little question on the

793
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:28,839
cookies thing will you ever consider

794
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,610
doing like a cookies s1 project and the

795
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,039
reason why I bring this up is because um

796
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,809
you know you got to give it credit it's

797
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,820
been around long enough that you kind of

798
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:38,110
have to consider it like a really elite

799
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,990
clone like it stood the test of time

800
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:44,289
it's still around right so you know will

801
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:45,989
you ever do that okay so this is a

802
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:49,750
little bit embarrassing

803
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:53,529
alright so I kind of took a break from

804
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:58,840
the internet for about three years from

805
00:38:53,530 --> 00:39:01,420
2008 to 2011 and I stayed out of you

806
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,610
know any you know weed this that or the

807
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,550
other I enjoyed a little break and then

808
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:09,160
I'm when I came back it was like cookies

809
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,970
cookies cookies cookies like what the

810
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:15,069
[ __ ] is this cookies yeah like what

811
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:19,029
happened you know I mean everything was

812
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:22,090
cool when I left so I come back and

813
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:24,160
there was all this hype and I was just

814
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:27,430
like oh hell with this you know this

815
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:30,219
stuff you know I I got a cut of the

816
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:34,690
forum the forum cut of cookies grew it

817
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:36,659
out you know it was nothing special then

818
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,889
I grew it out a couple more times and

819
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:41,469
probably the third time I grew it out it

820
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:45,339
was just like damn this is some really

821
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:47,379
fricking good weed and honestly it's

822
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,600
taken me a few years to you know wrap my

823
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,309
head around it but I'm like if there

824
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,139
wasn't all this hype

825
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:55,179
around the cookies I would honestly

826
00:39:53,139 --> 00:40:00,849
think it is some of the best weed I've

827
00:39:55,179 --> 00:40:02,409
ever you know grown and smoked so I kind

828
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:04,360
of wrap my head around that just this

829
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:07,480
last summer and I was like you know what

830
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:11,800
I don't care who I'm doing for I'm doing

831
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,019
it for me so actually right now I the

832
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,090
the form cut which is actually you know

833
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:18,460
my favorite one that I've grown so far

834
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:21,940
and I'm just making me a bunch of you

835
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,530
know 4ms ones and then hybrids just you

836
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:27,010
know because every single Girl Scout

837
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:29,140
cookie hi where I grow has really good

838
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,700
stuff in it even though you know you

839
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:33,309
definitely have to weed through you know

840
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:35,549
all the unstable ones out of the bunch

841
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:38,949
but you know once you're through that

842
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:42,760
there's really good quality plants out

843
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:45,219
of all the ones I've grown so yeah yeah

844
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,970
you know fantastic and so what type of

845
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:49,059
female

846
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:51,429
would you consider ideal to be like the

847
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:53,079
receiving end of the pollen from the

848
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:54,609
girls get you know what's the type of

849
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:57,880
plant that you think pairs well with the

850
00:40:54,610 --> 00:41:00,820
Girl Scout you you know right now I

851
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,910
don't know because I haven't I I

852
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:07,990
probably have I don't know four or five

853
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:11,859
at most I think something that is kind

854
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:16,449
of similar to like the stature of

855
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:18,579
cookies like an OG Kush or kind of a

856
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:22,210
like the old family Purple's the Urkel

857
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:24,190
oh geez that I have some of those I

858
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,199
think would blend really well and kind

859
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,630
of keep that structure up and that

860
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:32,230
popcorn look because my favorite plants

861
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:33,220
are always popcorn plants which just you

862
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,760
know gaint

863
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:39,309
nuggets you know along the stems I don't

864
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,800
know yeah it's how though that's how the

865
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:44,380
old ones I grew up with work so how do

866
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,760
you think they got so small sounds like

867
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,940
a bit of a weird question like the

868
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,500
nuggets but like I look at all the

869
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,240
predecessors that are thrown out there

870
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:55,420
as possible Girl Scout cookie parents

871
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,129
and you know for example og cush you

872
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,539
know similar structure a small little

873
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:01,090
golf ball he knows but it's like they

874
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:03,429
took a markedly step smaller in the Girl

875
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:05,140
Scout cookies and it's like I don't know

876
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:06,429
it just seems like an odd tray like it's

877
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:08,500
which is recessive genetics or whatever

878
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:10,838
but yeah it just seems odd that they got

879
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,518
so small but so potent like do you have

880
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:14,949
any ideas about how that happened like -

881
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:20,009
selection or lottery ticket combination

882
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:23,199
type thing or yeah it could just be a

883
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:25,569
well then again you know who's to say

884
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,429
because you know the form cut which is

885
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:32,259
probably the most widespread one has a

886
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:33,788
small little popcorn I guess but the og

887
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,710
KB and The Thin Mints I don't think

888
00:42:33,789 --> 00:42:38,890
whether they're the same or different

889
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:44,318
they're not as small as as the Forum

890
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:46,480
right yeah so just some form of you know

891
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,608
recessive recombinations you know

892
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,608
especially if you think maybe it's a you

893
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:53,469
know an s-1 or possibly s2 whatever and

894
00:42:51,608 --> 00:42:56,199
so that's an interesting point you just

895
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:58,118
mentioned s2 we've seen more breeders

896
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:59,199
come out using s wands as mothers but

897
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,230
we've even actually started to see

898
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,509
people use s twos as mothers do you feel

899
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:06,278
there is a risk in doing this or do you

900
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,769
feel like maybe if you choose to do it

901
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:10,420
you just need to test the progeny harder

902
00:43:08,768 --> 00:43:12,129
as a breeder if your doing so like what

903
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,920
would be your recommendations as a buyer

904
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:21,400
would you be like buyer beware or no go

905
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:24,970
for it you you definitely get more

906
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:31,028
uniform results using s2 s or breeding

907
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:35,009
with s ones you know so III think the

908
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:39,239
further you get like s1 s2 maybe even s3

909
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:43,809
you're gonna get tighter and tighter

910
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:46,298
phenotypic you know variation I've seen

911
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:49,450
it myself when you know I I do a

912
00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:51,369
feminized hybrid with just the mother

913
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:54,639
plant and then I do a feminized hybrid

914
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:57,519
with s1 s1 selection the phenotypes are

915
00:43:54,639 --> 00:44:00,848
a lot tighter and you know some of these

916
00:43:57,518 --> 00:44:02,229
guys like good old Sam skunk man you

917
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:03,789
know they're they're not gonna be

918
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,769
advertising all over the place but

919
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:08,710
they've said it you know I mean those

920
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:11,679
guys are you know breeding stuff - s1 s2

921
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:14,798
s3 s4 s5 and that's how they're you know

922
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:17,048
isolating exactly what they want out of

923
00:44:14,798 --> 00:44:18,489
the plants you know but then you got all

924
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:20,739
these people who are running around

925
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:23,889
like a hoe feminize is bad and it's like

926
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:29,049
why is that you know guys who have you

927
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:31,659
know the broadest you know experience in

928
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:35,289
the game you know being like this is the

929
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:38,679
way you do it you know yeah okay

930
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:41,349
and so I guess with that in mind do you

931
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:43,149
agree with the idea that there is an

932
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:47,949
increased risk of hemorrhage with

933
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:50,619
feminized seeds you know that that's a

934
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:55,899
tough one because pretty much every

935
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:59,559
single land race I've ever run it has

936
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:02,980
plenty of hermaphrodites I mean even Tom

937
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:05,529
Hills pine tars X 18s deep chunk you

938
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,369
bring those inside all of those have you

939
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:11,680
know a good percentage of hermaphrodites

940
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:13,720
you run out any regular seed

941
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,250
oh gee cush chem dog this that or the

942
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:17,799
other you give them a certain level of

943
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:22,119
stress they all have hermaphrodites you

944
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:25,000
know the the feminized seeds definitely

945
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:28,269
have their share it definitely gets

946
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,880
worse if you take extreme her Aphrodite

947
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:32,590
like say something that breeds strong

948
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,500
hermaphrodites like Girl Scout cookies

949
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:37,869
and cross it to another extreme

950
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,730
hermaphrodite you know like Girl Scout

951
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:42,309
cookies x Sour Diesel I mean I see

952
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,630
companies every day selling seeds just

953
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:46,989
like this I'm like how are they not

954
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:49,539
getting 110% hermaphrodites you know but

955
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:52,059
people still under certain circumstances

956
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:53,920
are getting you know great plants that

957
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:57,070
don't have the herm problems out of them

958
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,590
even off the worst hybrids yeah you know

959
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,059
and so maybe this one you may not know

960
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,269
the answer to because it's kind of a bit

961
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:06,099
abstract I guess but in terms of the

962
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:08,980
Girl Scout cookies where do you

963
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:10,599
attribute the hermaphrodite traits back

964
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,329
to you do you think it comes from like a

965
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:16,679
possible OG side and then it's just been

966
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:19,679
kind of aggravated in this situation

967
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:23,349
there's definitely a strong

968
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:26,279
hermaphroditic trait in OG Kush and it's

969
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:29,529
not even so much that the og cush itself

970
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:32,480
because I run tons of different OG Kush

971
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:34,880
clones and I've never really ever

972
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,460
had some problems out of them but when

973
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,559
you breed it you always get you know

974
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,659
anywhere from ten to twenty percent and

975
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:43,279
if you have a you know a little tent

976
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:45,670
with you know a bunch of light leaks or

977
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,070
hit them with you know extreme you know

978
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:51,200
doses of fertility you know you're gonna

979
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:55,010
end up with even more than that you know

980
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:57,439
yeah so the og is definitely a one

981
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,510
proponent but Girl Scouts seems like it

982
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,760
might have a couple a couple things in

983
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:08,660
it you you know how the the general

984
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:12,320
recipe Durbin f1 times Flo Rida og is

985
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:15,170
supposed to be Girl Scout cookies well I

986
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:18,859
bought a I bought a little sack of a

987
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:22,670
Durbin f1 off of Cookie Monster down in

988
00:47:18,858 --> 00:47:25,400
LA earlier this year and man that he

989
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:30,680
pulled it out of this bag and I ain't

990
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:36,500
seen more bananas in a bag it was like

991
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:39,079
whoa that's one harm strain so I don't

992
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,090
know you know it's like there's so many

993
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:44,210
people who are like apart or

994
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:46,220
peripherally a part of cookie fam that

995
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,829
to me it's almost hard to know who's

996
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:50,959
what you know like there's there's the

997
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:52,819
people who you would consider the main

998
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,199
you know like burner and his crew but

999
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:56,119
now it's almost like no no no they're

1000
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:58,549
not cook you fam it's like it's the

1001
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,769
sizzurp guy and you know these are the

1002
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:02,390
Cookie Monster and all that and so to me

1003
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:05,179
it's almost just like man it's almost

1004
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:08,509
like just so muddy it's hard it's hard

1005
00:48:05,179 --> 00:48:13,009
to know what's up you know right I think

1006
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:18,140
the core fan was like s flux capacitor

1007
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:20,450
[ __ ] and then and then burner of course

1008
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:21,858
as hype man yeah I mean like what

1009
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:22,549
happened to PI go out for exampie a

1010
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:26,599
still there

1011
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:28,070
I don't you know in the original stories

1012
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:32,230
they were saying like hey he's the one

1013
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:32,230
who knows the genetics blah blah blah oh

1014
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:40,039
I tried to stay out of it for so long

1015
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:43,369
but you know Dragon you I do I know I

1016
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:45,349
have curiosities myself you know so you

1017
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:47,809
know I've got some experiments I've

1018
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:51,499
to be running hopefully this winter if

1019
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:53,749
things work out yeah well the thing I

1020
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:56,959
always thought to myself is why doesn't

1021
00:48:53,748 --> 00:49:00,318
someone like just them just regular

1022
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,179
Durbin - Oh JEE cush and see what comes

1023
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:05,058
out because the you know that must give

1024
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:07,308
you some hints right because if the f1

1025
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:09,499
part of that Durbin f1 is really a

1026
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:12,140
mystery will may be doing that cross

1027
00:49:09,498 --> 00:49:18,139
would maybe help a lude or I don't know

1028
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:22,578
I mean I I run this German for a long

1029
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:24,588
time and man I have a hard time maybe I

1030
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:28,220
just need to run the og KB and the Thin

1031
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:30,920
Mints but I have a hard time seeing a

1032
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:33,889
lot of Durbin at all in Girl Scout

1033
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,318
cookies I mean Durbin is extremely high

1034
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:39,170
enter paneling and that's the smell you

1035
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:43,068
get out of train wreck Jack Herer you

1036
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:46,039
know that kind of stuff so that doesn't

1037
00:49:43,068 --> 00:49:49,369
seem to be a strong component to Girl

1038
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:51,019
Scouts in general yeah this may be gonna

1039
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:53,568
be a bit of an unpopular opinion but I

1040
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:56,118
always fan Girl Scout cookies to have

1041
00:49:53,568 --> 00:49:57,619
like a certain licorice and a seed

1042
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,950
component to it but then when I got to

1043
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:02,719
smell the Colorado turbine I was like

1044
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:04,038
this doesn't smell like aniseed at all

1045
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:05,869
to me it just smells like really sweet

1046
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:07,670
and like that's it like you're not

1047
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:09,469
getting any licorice don't get nothing

1048
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,119
and if I just smelt that I would have

1049
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:15,229
been like I don't think this is a part

1050
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:17,960
of cookies right right and that's the

1051
00:50:15,228 --> 00:50:20,689
thing - the most popular clone of Durbin

1052
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,389
going around the u.s. is that one in

1053
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:25,969
Colorado it it's actually everywhere

1054
00:50:23,389 --> 00:50:28,548
it's kind of weird I've gotten multiple

1055
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:31,909
cuts of it it's the same thing you know

1056
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:34,159
it's it's just high turpentine

1057
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:37,818
I mean it's extremely high at tests it

1058
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:41,088
like between 4 and 5% tor panel yeah

1059
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:43,369
well and just that one toast yeah yeah

1060
00:50:41,088 --> 00:50:44,328
most strains don't even test at 1% for

1061
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:47,599
all their terpenes

1062
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:50,329
yeah yeah yeah it's a pungent it's

1063
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,729
really really pungent right so a

1064
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:53,719
question I was interested in probably

1065
00:50:52,728 --> 00:50:55,159
should have asked her back at the air

1066
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:56,900
hole part I might even cut it back in

1067
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:59,420
there

1068
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:03,170
for me I was really surprised by how

1069
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:04,730
thin leaf coal is and I guess just in my

1070
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,889
mind I was expecting it to be a bit more

1071
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,838
akin to like a barber because of you

1072
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:10,400
know like the real indica medicinal side

1073
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:12,018
of it do you think that this indicates

1074
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,180
there's a lot to be said about thin leaf

1075
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:18,048
indicas and you know like where are they

1076
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:21,498
now type thing well I mean that's a

1077
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:23,150
really good question so back to the you

1078
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:26,778
know the the pine tar pushes that I'm

1079
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:29,240
running out right now pack and and even

1080
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:31,969
to go into like the Pakistani Street

1081
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:35,118
rolls that I work with and work with you

1082
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:37,518
know via canna Biogen these are all you

1083
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:40,099
know Pakistani indicas you know whether

1084
00:51:37,518 --> 00:51:42,949
it's pine tar you know the [ __ ] rolls or

1085
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:45,859
X eighteens or whatever but all of these

1086
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:48,949
are more thin leaf to indicas they're

1087
00:51:45,858 --> 00:51:54,940
not that broad you know hash plant leaf

1088
00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:58,219
or that deep chunk leaf I've got a male

1089
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:01,700
pine tar right now that looks almost

1090
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:05,078
identical to herbal and then I've got

1091
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:09,828
another male that smells just like Urkel

1092
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:12,410
so I'm like ooh you know future projects

1093
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:14,059
we'll see yeah interesting and then

1094
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:17,358
would you ever consider maybe trying to

1095
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:20,298
like recreate like local for example in

1096
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:22,068
the sense of using a few strains which

1097
00:52:20,298 --> 00:52:23,809
you saw different characteristics in it

1098
00:52:22,068 --> 00:52:25,818
but not ones that you thought were

1099
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:30,319
specifically a part of the oak or make

1100
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:33,920
up almost like a rock star thing yeah no

1101
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:35,679
absolutely I mean it you know hearsay

1102
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,318
has it that you know Arkell is a

1103
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:42,528
Pakistani times a skunk number one right

1104
00:52:39,318 --> 00:52:46,788
so I mean I've had UK cheese since oh

1105
00:52:42,528 --> 00:52:48,318
five you know I'm like well why don't I

1106
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:51,319
just take one of these select you know

1107
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:53,480
pine tar pushes and cross it to UK

1108
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:57,288
cheese and see what pops out you know

1109
00:52:53,480 --> 00:53:00,559
yeah that'll be really cool right you

1110
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:02,989
know and that falls exactly ended a lot

1111
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,019
of stuff that you know really kind of

1112
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:08,179
entertains me is I like to recreate

1113
00:53:06,018 --> 00:53:10,789
things and see you know how things

1114
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:13,759
combine and blah blah blah so yeah

1115
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:16,190
awesome and so last kind of question on

1116
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,780
the air call what is the difference

1117
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:23,300
between the Urkel and the men dope herbs

1118
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:25,670
there are extremely different the men

1119
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:28,400
dough perps comes from my buddy down

1120
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:32,599
there in Mendocino he sprouted the seed

1121
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:36,910
back in 1998 you I'm I'm sure you know

1122
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:40,849
his handle on IG not so dawg

1123
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:44,118
but uh it came from he got the seed from

1124
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:48,019
this old man out of Colo sprout the seed

1125
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:53,358
and you know it is a very unique plant

1126
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:56,030
to me it looks like kind of a an Afghani

1127
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,759
type it has that kind of Afghani broad

1128
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:01,670
leafed look to it

1129
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:05,210
I've s one day I grew s ones you know

1130
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:09,349
back in 204 grew a bunch of s worms a

1131
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:11,960
few years ago of it and it doesn't seem

1132
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:15,858
like there's really any sativa in it um

1133
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:18,829
as far as the S ones go but there's just

1134
00:54:15,858 --> 00:54:21,170
a lot of unique terpenes just you know

1135
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:25,670
stuff I haven't seen in any other plants

1136
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:28,608
you know um yeah okay but uh and so it

1137
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:30,289
is it's not going well it's very

1138
00:54:28,608 --> 00:54:33,440
different than herckel oracle tends to

1139
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:34,849
be a cold dependent like it needs a

1140
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,150
little cold a little bit of cold

1141
00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:41,809
temperatures too purple up whereas the

1142
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:44,660
Mendo purple it has more of a natural

1143
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:48,469
purple to it but the s ones of them and

1144
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:50,480
no purple have an extreme a percentage

1145
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:53,389
of those have an extreme natural purple

1146
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,369
almost a black just from the start of

1147
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:56,960
flower now a fantastic I think I've

1148
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:58,400
actually spotted a few photos of that

1149
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,909
one on your feed

1150
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,579
yeah really dark if we just gonna jump

1151
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:06,349
topics for a moment I wanted to ask you

1152
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:08,358
about all the pure cush is going around

1153
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:10,579
right now it seems like they've gained a

1154
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:13,940
bit of traction recently there's there's

1155
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:16,340
like the should cut the LA pew are the

1156
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:19,340
top hangar I don't know how to say it's

1157
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:20,539
a suburb in Cali I'm sure yeah there's

1158
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:22,608
all those different ones I've heard from

1159
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:24,619
a few people there similar slash the

1160
00:55:22,608 --> 00:55:26,360
same what's the differences and

1161
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:29,480
and what is it when they say pure cush

1162
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,880
like to me it brings like TK to mind you

1163
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,380
know like like no lemon just cush is

1164
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,340
that kind of what it's like or not

1165
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:41,780
really yeah you know I'm with you on the

1166
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:45,320
whole pure crush thing my buddy got this

1167
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:48,370
pure Kush clone back in 2005 and gave it

1168
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:50,860
to me it came from Orange County

1169
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:53,929
some big warehouse grower had paid

1170
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:56,539
$5,000 for the cut and I've had it ever

1171
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:58,549
since and it's just an OG Kush it's it's

1172
00:55:56,539 --> 00:56:01,489
a good og cush it's more of a earthy

1173
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:04,760
Hashi OG Kush no lemon or you know all

1174
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:08,959
that no pints all but a lot of people

1175
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:11,360
really like it but it's no relation to

1176
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:15,730
the Bubba s type plant that Suge Knight

1177
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:18,530
you know has his or hat as pure Kush and

1178
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:22,039
then on top of that there's a bunch of

1179
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:25,550
clubs out of like Malibu or whatever to

1180
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:27,710
paint Topanga Canyon pure pushes that

1181
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:29,539
aren't even the same cut as the one I

1182
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:32,690
got back in Oh five and these didn't

1183
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:38,449
even pop up for another what five plus

1184
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:41,539
years after that hmm so I mean it's one

1185
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:43,599
of those things where you know you could

1186
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:48,110
try to figure it out or you could just

1187
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:50,539
yeah just maybe right just to quickly

1188
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:53,269
clarify something do you think it like

1189
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:54,980
is it the case that the the sugar cut is

1190
00:56:53,269 --> 00:56:56,829
actually from Suge Knight I just thought

1191
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:03,460
it was just like named after motive oh

1192
00:56:56,829 --> 00:57:08,000
um okay so back in 405 um there was this

1193
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:09,349
there was this guy on canvas world not

1194
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,469
sure if he was on overdrove but he was

1195
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:16,460
he was having on a canvas world and he

1196
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:18,199
he he got this cut that was originally

1197
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:21,920
labeled pk

1198
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:23,419
and he actually called it uh maybe it

1199
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,369
didn't even have a label because he

1200
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:29,240
actually called it bubba kush at first

1201
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:33,349
but then he found out it was a PK and he

1202
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:35,059
was calling it purple kush and then he

1203
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:37,118
was like no it's not purple kush then

1204
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:38,619
you're real able to piss cush

1205
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,210
and then he was like no that's not it

1206
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:42,490
and he was like okay it's pure crush

1207
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:44,079
they told me now it's pure Kush he did

1208
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:46,778
some breeding with it and blah blah blah

1209
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:51,640
and sold seeds on a cannabis world you

1210
00:57:46,778 --> 00:57:54,548
know by a heaven stairway so it was just

1211
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:58,420
a dude who used the handle Suge Knight

1212
00:57:54,548 --> 00:58:00,670
okay nothing to do with ya yeah I think

1213
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:06,068
he's too caught up with his [ __ ] with

1214
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:07,568
biggie to be brief yeah yeah but you

1215
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:09,849
know there's there's still some cats I

1216
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:13,239
think who talked with them you know cats

1217
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:17,740
like cats like rude boy and you know

1218
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:19,899
grow hard but a rusher if he's too much

1219
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:21,669
in the game anymore though yeah it's

1220
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,619
interesting how so many people have

1221
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:25,240
almost ducked out when it would seem

1222
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:29,920
like it's the right time to put your

1223
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:32,588
head up right right yeah so a bit of a

1224
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,889
maybe a controversial question what's

1225
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:37,748
the deal with purple punch winning at

1226
00:58:35,889 --> 00:58:40,088
chalice which is a little bit of a while

1227
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:42,098
ago admittedly but everyone I've spoken

1228
00:58:40,088 --> 00:58:44,828
to says that strain has no potency it

1229
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:46,420
looks great sure but [ __ ] and then

1230
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:47,859
it like it's winning cut like jungle

1231
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,108
boys or winning cups with it and stuff

1232
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,969
like how does that work for you do you

1233
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:55,838
do you write it better than what other

1234
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:59,108
people do like okay so all purple punch

1235
00:58:55,838 --> 00:59:02,679
is is um you know you you forget some of

1236
00:58:59,108 --> 00:59:04,690
the names on them right all it is is oh

1237
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:09,669
gee Kush terms are essentially yeah

1238
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:12,309
right you know and I just grew out you

1239
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:13,869
know well over a hundred aji cush times

1240
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:15,400
herbals you know that all the oh geez

1241
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:18,608
had different names but all the Urkel

1242
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:21,099
was just the same I had purple punch

1243
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:24,759
phenotypes in there and what those those

1244
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:27,970
plants are is they're extremely frosty

1245
00:59:24,759 --> 00:59:30,969
and extremely pretty and just gorgeous

1246
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:35,230
plants with you know decent smells and

1247
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:40,238
everything but yeah they don't exactly

1248
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:41,889
you know have the punch a lot of times

1249
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:45,730
when you have a lot of entries into a

1250
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:47,588
cup and people are having to smoke all

1251
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:50,619
those entries you know just one after

1252
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:53,650
another you know bag appeal

1253
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:55,660
and you know that kind of thing is gonna

1254
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:59,740
really weigh out a lot on that

1255
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:01,808
competition yeah you know and so and so

1256
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:04,268
do you think that there's almost an

1257
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:05,920
inherent flaw in the way that cup

1258
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,909
judging is done these days in that you

1259
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,829
know that's just like the judges are

1260
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:10,210
just overload like for example we're

1261
01:00:08,829 --> 01:00:11,650
trying to run a little cup in Australia

1262
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:13,329
at the moment and one of the rules we're

1263
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,130
having it's all online but one of the

1264
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:17,170
rules we're having is that the judges

1265
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:19,990
are only only allowed to try one sample

1266
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:23,079
each day and so people have been like

1267
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:24,489
that's such a good rule oh and it's like

1268
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:25,869
and it just doesn't seem to make sense

1269
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:27,248
why they wouldn't do it in the States

1270
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:28,599
it's like is it is it that poorly

1271
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,518
organized that they can't get the

1272
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:32,259
samples out early enough or like what's

1273
01:00:30,518 --> 01:00:35,439
the deal just to commercialize and they

1274
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:37,539
don't care about it or too many entries

1275
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,519
a lot of the time and yeah really

1276
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:42,910
honestly you got it right there they

1277
01:00:39,518 --> 01:00:46,118
they don't care I mean I love the

1278
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:50,230
emerald-cut you already know yep but how

1279
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:54,519
can anyone judge 400 500 600 entries in

1280
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:56,498
one month you know the media I mean you

1281
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:59,078
you can kind of break that down unto you

1282
01:00:56,498 --> 01:01:01,149
know there's a lot of stuff just not

1283
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:04,660
even getting tried yeah you have to

1284
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:07,269
assume right right right it seems though

1285
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:13,808
like whatever's like hit number eight or

1286
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:16,508
nine if the day is just a blur so I mean

1287
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:17,829
in general though do you get concerned

1288
01:01:16,509 --> 01:01:19,630
about that because I brought this up in

1289
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:22,269
a previous interview given like seed

1290
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:23,769
sales are affected by if Australian wins

1291
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:25,868
a cup is that not a little bit of

1292
01:01:23,768 --> 01:01:27,338
concern to you given that things which

1293
01:01:25,869 --> 01:01:29,499
maybe shouldn't be winning are winning

1294
01:01:27,338 --> 01:01:31,690
and likewise things which you know

1295
01:01:29,498 --> 01:01:33,998
you've made which I may be really

1296
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:38,999
phenomenal like they just get they slip

1297
01:01:33,998 --> 01:01:42,639
through the net type thing right right I

1298
01:01:38,998 --> 01:01:48,248
think eventually the real quality stuff

1299
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:50,318
will kind of you know rise up and you

1300
01:01:48,248 --> 01:01:53,469
know it just might take a little bit

1301
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:55,150
longer you know you know kind of a

1302
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:58,268
word-of-mouth style versus you know

1303
01:01:55,150 --> 01:02:00,480
everybody you know just oh it won a cup

1304
01:01:58,268 --> 01:02:03,969
let's go get it you know yeah I mean

1305
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,480
stuff like Irene horrible bag appeal you

1306
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:07,899
know

1307
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:10,240
um you know nothing to look at all but

1308
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:14,289
everybody who smokes it she's like you

1309
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:15,939
know we you know yeah that's what I

1310
01:02:14,289 --> 01:02:18,670
wanted to ask you back because the Irene

1311
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:21,519
has got a lot of traction recently I'm

1312
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:23,980
again archived he done a few hybrids

1313
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:25,659
with it I believe you have as well it's

1314
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:28,269
it's one of the two the other one was

1315
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:29,920
the FCAT of OG I noticed that the F cut

1316
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:32,380
in the Irene are quite unique you work

1317
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,599
with both of them what do you like about

1318
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:38,108
them and why do you think we don't see

1319
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:43,779
them so much in other people's work well

1320
01:02:38,108 --> 01:02:45,190
Irene for example as extreme at least

1321
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:52,060
for a long time she was extremely

1322
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:55,210
hoarded and a handful of years ago I got

1323
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:58,449
her from you know you know by a couple

1324
01:02:55,210 --> 01:03:03,789
friends from Rudeboy

1325
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:05,379
and I just I didn't even think nothing

1326
01:03:03,789 --> 01:03:08,858
over you know I was just like whatever

1327
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:12,700
and I threw out in my yard you know in a

1328
01:03:08,858 --> 01:03:14,500
200-gallon bed and grew out and it

1329
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:17,799
wasn't even till you know late in the

1330
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:20,949
fall about mid-september when I was like

1331
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:23,170
ooh what's this you know because she was

1332
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:24,759
just smelling something fantastic she

1333
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:28,000
didn't look like nothing special all the

1334
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:31,060
way up until there but then you know I

1335
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,358
gave it to you know obviously I gave it

1336
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:36,519
to you know doctor from archive and a

1337
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:38,949
couple other people with rude boys you

1338
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:41,050
know permissions of course and that's

1339
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:44,079
where you know they started making the

1340
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:47,859
hybrids with it and you know a little

1341
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:50,650
while after I followed suit but uh she's

1342
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:53,858
just a really really good quality smoke

1343
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:56,108
I mean she's nothing to look at

1344
01:03:53,858 --> 01:04:00,549
whatsoever and she has this weird mutant

1345
01:03:56,108 --> 01:04:04,239
trait where she rose nuggets on her stem

1346
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:05,980
P deals so you try trimming it and it's

1347
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:08,618
like all the nuts all fall off with the

1348
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:11,559
stems when he clipped from Hawks and it

1349
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:13,720
is it is terrible she's she does have a

1350
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:16,420
lot her prose in those departments but

1351
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:17,309
man she is some good smoke you know so

1352
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:21,659
and what

1353
01:04:17,309 --> 01:04:27,360
the F card the folks there the FCAT I

1354
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:32,940
mean III i-i've called it fo G Kush you

1355
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:34,950
know FA you X you know but uh early

1356
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:39,570
early on that came from daintiest og

1357
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:42,539
from icy mag and you know they they they

1358
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:44,280
called it some of my buddies named it

1359
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:48,800
the FCAT because they were like oh it's

1360
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:51,720
just a fake Oh G so f stood for fake and

1361
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:53,250
it was just a quality cut I mean the

1362
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:55,109
first time I smelled it I was like ooh

1363
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:57,960
this is some of the best smellin you

1364
01:04:55,110 --> 01:05:02,990
know og I've ever smelled and it was you

1365
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:06,360
know grown grown by daintiest himself

1366
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:08,519
when I first smelled it but uh it

1367
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,769
definitely breeds a little bit different

1368
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:14,250
than some of the oh jeez a lot of the oh

1369
01:05:10,769 --> 01:05:16,829
geez kind of be tall and lanky just like

1370
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:21,150
a normal og whereas this one it breeds

1371
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:24,360
kind of smaller and shorter so okay I

1372
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:27,030
don't know squat yeah yeah so what og

1373
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,860
cut in your opinion is kind of the most

1374
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:30,930
underrated one you know like what you I

1375
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:33,690
person I love Larry and I feel like it

1376
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:37,589
doesn't get enough credit at times right

1377
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:43,530
I've never tried the Larry myself I've

1378
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:45,690
kind of wanted to but I mean I tend to

1379
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:47,970
mostly stick with the triangle cush just

1380
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:50,340
because that's the one I believe is you

1381
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:52,919
know the one that started it all and I

1382
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,829
figure if you can you know reverse that

1383
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:59,460
one you should be able to pull out all

1384
01:05:55,829 --> 01:06:03,090
the other Oh G pushes out of it you know

1385
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:05,630
I'm just s one style so you know and

1386
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:09,269
when I breed with the the triangle cush

1387
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:14,070
compared to the others I tend to get you

1388
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:16,110
know the broadest spectrum of you know

1389
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:18,240
phenotypes whereas with a lot of these

1390
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:21,900
others it's like a lot narrower and

1391
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:25,169
tighter yeah so and so yeah I don't know

1392
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:26,760
if you're sorry going I'm just gonna say

1393
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:28,530
I don't know if it's you know underrated

1394
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,550
at all it's just you know my preference

1395
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:32,670
for for The O'Jays yeah

1396
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:36,550
okay and so what do you think

1397
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:39,250
predecessors the triangle you know what

1398
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:43,870
was that strain that Matt and Josh got

1399
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:47,739
the bag of weed oh well the triangle

1400
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:53,109
cash that I have came came from big

1401
01:06:47,739 --> 01:06:56,799
Ricky he gave it to you no doctor from

1402
01:06:53,110 --> 01:07:01,750
archive and then doc gave it to me but

1403
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:03,789
that that cut a big Ricky cornbread

1404
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:07,510
Ricky he claims you know he's had that

1405
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:11,500
since 1992 and that predates you know

1406
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:14,080
Matt Matt and Joshes you know oh gee and

1407
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:18,369
he claims he got it as a cut you know

1408
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:21,130
yeah um so I mean he's essentially the

1409
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:22,839
one to talk to but you know some of

1410
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:25,030
those stories get a little hazy a little

1411
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,860
bit yeah okay and I mean but if you had

1412
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:29,590
to speculate what do you think the

1413
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:31,240
parents of the the triangle would have

1414
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:33,190
been I've heard that you know just like

1415
01:07:31,239 --> 01:07:34,839
some land race possibly like where how

1416
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,789
do you think Knights a bit more refined

1417
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,710
than that

1418
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:42,099
it very well could be just like a

1419
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:44,170
Pakistani sativa hybrid I don't even

1420
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:46,779
want to get into the whole sativa thing

1421
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:49,480
because you know I'm no sativa expert I

1422
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:51,630
like them but I don't have the time to

1423
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:56,619
post something like takes 24 weeks yet

1424
01:07:51,630 --> 01:08:01,210
but uh I'm definitely uh definitely like

1425
01:07:56,619 --> 01:08:03,069
a Pakistani a sativa you know and so if

1426
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:05,110
we just take a jump now from kind of the

1427
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:06,760
ephemeral Femina has chat over to the

1428
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:08,769
regular stuff you know it's dive into

1429
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,560
the emerald parts of the Emerald

1430
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:13,509
triangle stuff what is the next project

1431
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:14,590
you're looking to do under that line you

1432
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:17,949
know what's the next Mauer you're

1433
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:19,088
looking to work with oh that's a that's

1434
01:08:17,949 --> 01:08:21,369
a good one

1435
01:08:19,088 --> 01:08:24,010
I've been trying a few different things

1436
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:26,680
I definitely want to toy around with

1437
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:28,480
some pine tar pine tar kushai bridge for

1438
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,730
sure you know be and then I'm you're

1439
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:33,068
spending the time to you know grow out a

1440
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:35,439
huge lot of them and then I'm gonna be

1441
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:38,530
directionally from from this you know

1442
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:42,969
this lot but you know we'll see where

1443
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:43,689
that goes I might toy around with a some

1444
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:46,690
orange

1445
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:49,629
orange type stuff I've been talking to

1446
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:53,429
some buddies and we're looking to put

1447
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:59,560
together a nice old-school orange

1448
01:08:53,430 --> 01:09:06,190
cornucopia so to speak so you know but

1449
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:07,539
uh no I haven't made any long-term plans

1450
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:10,059
quite yet okay

1451
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:12,399
and so that orange one you just

1452
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:14,770
referenced I've kind of noticed citrus

1453
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:17,349
in general is like orange citrus

1454
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:19,779
especially is very on the up-and-up even

1455
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:23,949
beyond just tangi we're still seeing

1456
01:09:19,779 --> 01:09:26,259
things like Clementine being used quite

1457
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:28,088
regularly in modern crosses with that in

1458
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:30,238
mind do you think there's something

1459
01:09:28,088 --> 01:09:32,170
about the citrus terpenes which

1460
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:35,468
specifically the orange ones which

1461
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:37,298
allows it to kind of work as a flavor of

1462
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:39,640
the month more so than other things and

1463
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:42,369
what I kind of get by that is is I find

1464
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:45,190
that like let's just take typical tangi

1465
01:09:42,369 --> 01:09:47,649
slash Caleo type turbans I find that

1466
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:48,909
they're sharp like a sword like they cut

1467
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:51,068
through things and it's like if you had

1468
01:09:48,909 --> 01:09:52,689
a bag and it's grown well you can have

1469
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:53,859
just one but of you know that type of

1470
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,269
stuff in there with a whole bunch of

1471
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:57,880
other stuff and it just it cuts through

1472
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:59,890
the rest and so in that regard I kind of

1473
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,480
think like it's good that like you know

1474
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:03,010
it's a good flavor of the month because

1475
01:10:01,479 --> 01:10:04,629
it's got these characteristics which

1476
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:06,250
suit being flavor of the month you know

1477
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:08,590
it's really loud and obnoxious and

1478
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:11,289
people get a big blast out of it

1479
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:13,719
you know do you think that that will

1480
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:15,969
persist on beyond this fad because it's

1481
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:17,649
kind of like Caleo was around then it

1482
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:19,448
died out and then tangi came back it's

1483
01:10:17,649 --> 01:10:20,859
kind of revitalized it do you think will

1484
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:24,729
fall off again or it'll stay more

1485
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:27,880
present this time I think things kind of

1486
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:30,039
move in circles right um so you know

1487
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,810
like the purple cush is and the purples

1488
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:33,640
and the grapes you know they had their

1489
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,960
heyday and then they fell off and then

1490
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:39,460
they had another heyday and then they

1491
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:41,289
fell off and I think it's probably you

1492
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:43,210
know the same with the oranges and the

1493
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:44,350
bananas and this and that that's and

1494
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:47,500
others

1495
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:51,370
me personally I I would like to have all

1496
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:53,890
the flavors in a seed form so that you

1497
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:55,569
know it doesn't matter you know what's

1498
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:57,460
popular today or tomorrow or the next

1499
01:10:55,569 --> 01:11:00,429
day you know I can always just be

1500
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:03,670
oh well pop you know hundred of those or

1501
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:05,890
a hundred of these you know so you know

1502
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:07,869
on one side I definitely breed for the

1503
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:10,719
public but on the other side I'm always

1504
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:12,969
breeding for myself okay you know and so

1505
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,279
what type of genetic base would you want

1506
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:21,000
to use to kind of get those orange

1507
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:25,960
fibers into across as far as like the

1508
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:29,800
well for one there there's a good three

1509
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:32,230
or four clones that circulate some of

1510
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:34,840
them probably held pretty tight that are

1511
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:37,000
all just extremely orangey old-school

1512
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,069
clones have been around for twenty

1513
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,550
thirty forty years well I've already

1514
01:11:39,069 --> 01:11:45,069
played around a little bit with the

1515
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:49,060
80-77 Caleo cologne which dates back to

1516
01:11:45,069 --> 01:11:52,509
roughly about 1980 and then there's some

1517
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:55,210
other ones that some of some of my

1518
01:11:52,510 --> 01:12:03,880
buddies hold that are definitely strong

1519
01:11:55,210 --> 01:12:06,340
orange types and I'm working with some

1520
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:13,359
other cats who have some old-school I

1521
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:16,150
guess you know orange Caleo seeds so I

1522
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:19,119
might you know just try starting there

1523
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:21,339
and see where that leads me do you find

1524
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:24,988
some of the current modern orange

1525
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:30,130
hybrids are a little lacking in potency

1526
01:12:24,988 --> 01:12:33,218
you know most of the orange strains seem

1527
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:36,550
to be a little lower you know on the

1528
01:12:33,219 --> 01:12:40,050
potency tip for sure I honestly don't

1529
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:42,909
think I've come across anything just

1530
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:45,430
super orangey and super potent at the

1531
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:47,409
same time so yeah interesting

1532
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:49,780
interesting and so if we just jump back

1533
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:52,840
to the work you're gonna do with the

1534
01:12:49,779 --> 01:12:55,109
males do you want to specifically look

1535
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:57,819
to just breed with heirloom males

1536
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:59,500
because that's already a trend you know

1537
01:12:57,819 --> 01:13:01,269
if we look at the previous Pakistani

1538
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,399
released you did maybe I should Morris

1539
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:06,250
you have a bit of a thing for Pakistanis

1540
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:08,859
you know who got the PT K and then your

1541
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:10,600
original releases can we expect more

1542
01:13:08,859 --> 01:13:11,079
Pakistanis or maybe different land races

1543
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:15,340
or

1544
01:13:11,079 --> 01:13:18,489
just modern males even I definitely like

1545
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:24,010
to lean towards the heirloom land races

1546
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:26,590
but uh you know quality inbred you know

1547
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:32,610
older lines are definitely a potential

1548
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:37,600
as well one thing I think even just a

1549
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:40,809
like a Redux or something uh I I almost

1550
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:46,260
think that if you take a strong trip in

1551
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:48,940
Moline mail like I found in the the

1552
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:52,480
Pakistani Street Rawls and if you cross

1553
01:13:48,939 --> 01:13:56,199
that with you know some type of Caleo um

1554
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:58,389
I think that Turpin alene added to the

1555
01:13:56,199 --> 01:14:02,319
orange actually is one of the

1556
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:05,020
ingredients to kind of almost spike that

1557
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:07,840
orange pungency you know through the

1558
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:09,850
roof okay they're not interesting yeah I

1559
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,770
had a feeling the terpenes definitely

1560
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:13,900
played some role in that especially if

1561
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:16,720
you consider like if we just both agreed

1562
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:18,429
that orange terpene weeds Gentoo tend to

1563
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,829
be a bit lower well that may be a good

1564
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:23,590
indication that terpenes play some

1565
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:24,789
bigger role in that all a follow-up

1566
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:26,730
question to the previous one I wanted to

1567
01:14:24,789 --> 01:14:29,260
ask though is did you ever get like

1568
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:31,989
weird questions or funny looks from

1569
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:33,400
people giving you called it like for

1570
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:36,489
example you'd be like oh this is the cam

1571
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:38,349
dog f1 the purple local f1 because while

1572
01:14:36,489 --> 01:14:40,659
it is correct in the naming sense it is

1573
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:42,490
a little bit ambiguous for what today's

1574
01:14:40,659 --> 01:14:43,869
buyers are used to and while someone

1575
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:45,429
who's more experienced probably wouldn't

1576
01:14:43,869 --> 01:14:47,739
have an issue with it I think some

1577
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:49,060
people were probably like is just Buick

1578
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:51,210
M dog or like you know something like

1579
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:51,210
that

1580
01:14:51,609 --> 01:14:59,769
you know I mean I get tired of the name

1581
01:14:55,090 --> 01:15:03,730
game I like a lot of us do and yeah for

1582
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:06,850
those I almost just wanted to breed them

1583
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:09,250
for myself and start from a starting

1584
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:13,560
point where I can just call them f1 f2

1585
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:18,069
f3 is that fours back cross ones etc etc

1586
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:20,770
and I figured you know if people already

1587
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:23,529
are gonna name their keeper cuts

1588
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:24,610
whatever they want you know which is

1589
01:15:23,529 --> 01:15:27,939
kind of commonplace

1590
01:15:24,609 --> 01:15:30,339
his days so I was just like I'm just

1591
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:33,339
gonna get lazy on this and just f1 just

1592
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:35,020
calm all F ones and you know the the

1593
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:39,480
lineage is right there on the package so

1594
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:42,070
it's you know no no dispute what it is

1595
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:44,319
but yeah yeah I definitely there

1596
01:15:42,069 --> 01:15:46,750
there was a small handful of nit pickers

1597
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:50,769
being like oh how can you call another

1598
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:52,539
clone f1 I'm like you know come up with

1599
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:55,960
your own name yeah I don't care what the

1600
01:15:52,539 --> 01:15:57,310
name is it's an it you see what it is so

1601
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,840
that's an interesting point you just

1602
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:01,030
mentioned about people naming their

1603
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,489
favorite clones I'm certainly guilty of

1604
01:16:01,029 --> 01:16:05,710
that myself but I think the one little

1605
01:16:03,488 --> 01:16:08,319
caveat I place on myself is I only do it

1606
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:10,210
if I feel the clone is not only a keeper

1607
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,279
but also quite unique from what you

1608
01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:14,230
would typically get from that stock so

1609
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:17,349
it's almost like a little bit of its own

1610
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:18,908
thing in a certain regard right and but

1611
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:20,320
but like it's still muddies the waters

1612
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:22,719
because you've got someone like me who's

1613
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:24,158
like fanatic about making sure things

1614
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,689
are listed correctly and all that

1615
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:27,339
because I'm you know I deal with how

1616
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:29,529
muddy that gets firsthand all the time

1617
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,909
but at the same time I can understand

1618
01:16:29,529 --> 01:16:32,198
you know like me having a name for

1619
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:34,448
something and then maybe if in

1620
01:16:32,198 --> 01:16:37,419
afterwards I put brackets like you know

1621
01:16:34,448 --> 01:16:39,009
whatever like the actual genetics it

1622
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:40,630
might be confusing for some especially

1623
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:42,130
people who are as a fanatical like maybe

1624
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,868
they just pick and choose which parts

1625
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:44,889
they want to say it is or whatever do

1626
01:16:43,868 --> 01:16:47,649
you think that's a practice in general

1627
01:16:44,889 --> 01:16:50,319
we should just avoid and find some

1628
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:52,029
better way of you know like naming our

1629
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:53,769
favorite clones or whatever or do you

1630
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:55,630
think like on the whole it's not that

1631
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:58,810
damaging I guess to the whole name game

1632
01:16:55,630 --> 01:17:01,750
considering where we're at ya know I

1633
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:03,780
think it's tough I mean I'm a nitpicker

1634
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:10,079
myself when it comes to lineages and

1635
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:13,359
history and changing names and stuff so

1636
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:16,238
yeah I mean I've I grew up with that

1637
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:18,009
kind of stuff where you know early early

1638
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:21,299
on we you know there was a train wreck

1639
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:23,289
and then you know five years later

1640
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:26,350
somebody else is calling something

1641
01:17:23,289 --> 01:17:28,539
different train wreck and then they you

1642
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:31,030
know give up hundreds if not thousands

1643
01:17:28,539 --> 01:17:34,479
of clones and all of a sudden everybody

1644
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:36,819
you know knows that there as train wreck

1645
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:38,468
where as we knew something else as train

1646
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:41,229
wreck so

1647
01:17:38,469 --> 01:17:45,489
the name gameis is it's definitely tough

1648
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:48,359
I mean yeah there's no there's no right

1649
01:17:45,488 --> 01:17:50,919
answer to it and just out of curiosity

1650
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:52,809
in a previous episode Bob Hemphill

1651
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,300
mentioned he's had train wreck so long

1652
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:57,760
he's just like so over it now he's like

1653
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:59,380
so sick of the turret profile has that

1654
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:02,350
happened to you as well he says it

1655
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:06,460
happens to a lot of people yeah yeah I

1656
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:10,270
mean I definitely go don't I almost ever

1657
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:11,948
go for my my train wreck bag but I still

1658
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:17,070
you know have sentiment

1659
01:18:11,948 --> 01:18:19,659
you know cinnamony alley that word yeah

1660
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:21,789
for for train wreck you know it was one

1661
01:18:19,659 --> 01:18:25,000
of the earlier ones I think I got it in

1662
01:18:21,789 --> 01:18:30,430
like 99 we were buying sacks of it you

1663
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:34,899
know back in 1994 you know it was

1664
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:38,770
actually different 99 1 but you know but

1665
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:41,829
uh yeah you can definitely get tired of

1666
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:44,290
some things but I try not to throw the

1667
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:47,130
ones I like to away yeah yeah I think he

1668
01:18:44,289 --> 01:18:49,269
actually expressed a similar sentiment

1669
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:51,819
what I would be interested in knowing

1670
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:53,260
though is what do you think the genetics

1671
01:18:51,819 --> 01:18:55,599
are of trainwreck because everyone I

1672
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:57,190
feel like it's almost people don't want

1673
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,930
to guess because they're like oh well

1674
01:18:57,189 --> 01:19:00,879
you know trainwreck was just a name for

1675
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:02,260
the style of breeding where you just put

1676
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,840
it all you know like the one mile around

1677
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:06,820
all the females and just let it go and I

1678
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,529
get that that's cool but I still feel

1679
01:19:06,819 --> 01:19:10,329
like the people in the know would be

1680
01:19:08,529 --> 01:19:12,039
able to have some kind of guess of what

1681
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:13,269
it is you know like I've heard you know

1682
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,800
it's like a three-way hybrid of land

1683
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:18,310
races or something like that like what

1684
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:22,510
do you think you you know um considering

1685
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:25,750
the fact that you know the one that you

1686
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:29,380
know spread out from Arcada in the late

1687
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:32,948
90s is not the same one I I kind of tend

1688
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:35,619
to think that it might have been almost

1689
01:19:32,948 --> 01:19:38,469
the terpene profile that you know if you

1690
01:19:35,619 --> 01:19:41,469
smell that turpin allene you know it's

1691
01:19:38,469 --> 01:19:45,760
it's the same Terpening that's in durban

1692
01:19:41,469 --> 01:19:47,560
poison you know so I I kind of wonder if

1693
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,869
it's just not oh you smell that and you

1694
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,920
think oh that's train wreck because the

1695
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:55,399
earliest dated train wreck literature

1696
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:58,670
that I've come across is from 1982 in

1697
01:19:55,399 --> 01:20:01,969
Mendocino County Wow that that that

1698
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:05,000
dates it back you know yeah I mean it

1699
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:10,279
was nothing but landraces and trainwreck

1700
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:12,619
you know oh yeah so and so it's just as

1701
01:20:10,279 --> 01:20:15,259
a bit of a curiosity question as far as

1702
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:21,229
you're aware what's the oldest clone in

1703
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:22,940
existence oh I'll give you a hint if you

1704
01:20:21,229 --> 01:20:28,309
want a few people have said yeah

1705
01:20:22,939 --> 01:20:32,859
probably Romulan yeah I don't even know

1706
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:36,580
how how old Romulan is or even how

1707
01:20:32,859 --> 01:20:39,019
available legit piece of Romulan is

1708
01:20:36,579 --> 01:20:41,719
because Romulans one of those ones that

1709
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:45,040
kind of got screwed up a lot you know in

1710
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:47,539
the whole BC scene where they started

1711
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:51,350
yeah they started putting out a bunch of

1712
01:20:47,539 --> 01:20:53,210
hybrids as Romulan and so everybody has

1713
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:58,010
a hybrid of Romulan another call and

1714
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:59,689
Romulan yeah you know but uh does that

1715
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:02,060
one date all the way back to Mendocino

1716
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:08,659
and the California blue indicas I've

1717
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:10,429
heard it goes back to 69 down kind of

1718
01:21:08,659 --> 01:21:11,840
what you said does hold true cuz what I

1719
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:13,880
heard was the case with so basically

1720
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,469
there was a guy and he was kind of doing

1721
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:19,250
his own thing for ages and he had got it

1722
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:20,750
off Romulan Joe in 69 and then when like

1723
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,729
you know the internet came about he came

1724
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:25,429
back so I think there's a whole lot of

1725
01:21:22,729 --> 01:21:28,009
room in that timeframe for things to

1726
01:21:25,429 --> 01:21:29,840
have changed as you said but in saying

1727
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:31,640
that you know I got a few good friends

1728
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,380
who they're pretty confident it's the

1729
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:36,650
real deal and so you know who am I to

1730
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:38,900
say otherwise but um yeah as far as I'm

1731
01:21:36,649 --> 01:21:40,488
aware the cut was lost so to speak to

1732
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:43,159
the masses and then it was just this guy

1733
01:21:40,488 --> 01:21:44,959
who popped back up and was kind of like

1734
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:46,399
oh no no I got it and I've just been a

1735
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,819
hermit for the last thirty years or

1736
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:53,089
whatever so yeah like if it's true shout

1737
01:21:49,819 --> 01:21:57,109
out to that guy yeah yeah yeah no I

1738
01:21:53,090 --> 01:22:00,770
actually was a kind of curious to check

1739
01:21:57,109 --> 01:22:03,319
out that cuz that cut is if if I'm not

1740
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:05,310
mistaken the original Romulan cut is

1741
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:09,899
kind of almost a length

1742
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:12,390
your plant with popcorn nuggets you know

1743
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:16,500
kinda like OG but a different looking

1744
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:19,950
plant for sure so I mean I've heard a

1745
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:23,430
lot of people say that the pnw hash

1746
01:22:19,949 --> 01:22:27,149
plant is the source of a lot of really

1747
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:29,369
good cuts potentially the the same hash

1748
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:32,399
plant that Nevel originally used in the

1749
01:22:29,369 --> 01:22:34,079
seed bank to create a lot of his lines I

1750
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:36,329
think I've seen that you've got that one

1751
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:39,539
or you had some experience with it

1752
01:22:36,329 --> 01:22:41,970
what's your opinions on that I'm not

1753
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:44,939
gonna say I have that one I have an old

1754
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:49,140
hash plant from up in the Seattle area

1755
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:51,769
Pacific Northwest but also there's a

1756
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:56,850
bunch of hash plants up there you know

1757
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:59,400
like the u dubs and all those so it's

1758
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:03,120
definitely one I can't you know trace

1759
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:07,079
back to ok and say for sure this is you

1760
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:08,699
know the one or whatever but III know

1761
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:11,819
whatever whatever Nevel

1762
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:14,880
you know collected and worked with was

1763
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:18,929
definitely a quality piece for sure yeah

1764
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:20,520
and so do you value like his stock as

1765
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:22,230
the high stuff you could possibly get

1766
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,180
like if someone said to you I've got a

1767
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:28,169
pack of the seed bank I've got a pack of

1768
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:29,789
SSS C and I've got a pack of Bo gear you

1769
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:33,029
know brothers of the eternal love which

1770
01:23:29,789 --> 01:23:35,819
one would you pick I'm probably tend to

1771
01:23:33,029 --> 01:23:37,529
go at ball yeah and so what out of this

1772
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:40,859
stuff would you be most interested in if

1773
01:23:37,529 --> 01:23:43,319
you could get it I just mean you know I

1774
01:23:40,859 --> 01:23:45,630
like the original sources Neville's

1775
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:48,149
seemed to be like a collector who came

1776
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:50,159
over to the US and Bowl seemed to be

1777
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:52,679
like not so much collectors but

1778
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:54,750
essentially collectors who collected

1779
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:57,270
from other you know those sources of

1780
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:58,770
origin so Neville is like a step removed

1781
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:01,830
from where you kind of want to get the

1782
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:03,990
you know the stuff from and all mental

1783
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:06,619
stuff was all you know hybrids anyway

1784
01:24:03,989 --> 01:24:08,969
yeah yeah he didn't do pure lines

1785
01:24:06,619 --> 01:24:12,390
another thing which I was interested in

1786
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:14,550
is I had heard that some of the bowl

1787
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:15,990
stock with hit and miss which I thought

1788
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,310
was interesting because it's like if you

1789
01:24:15,989 --> 01:24:19,109
thought about it you would you'd swear

1790
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:21,150
that it's got to be the most under

1791
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:23,130
at point so to speak where you could get

1792
01:24:21,149 --> 01:24:26,698
seeds from at least commercially in the

1793
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:27,868
Western world do you agree that it would

1794
01:24:26,698 --> 01:24:31,019
have been hidden miss or do you think

1795
01:24:27,868 --> 01:24:34,019
nice it should have been all fire no I

1796
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:38,100
definitely had missed because Land Pure

1797
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:41,310
Land race you know seeds are extremely

1798
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:43,170
variable and amount of breeding that you

1799
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:47,070
know it has actually been done on a lot

1800
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:49,408
of them is is is not it's not very

1801
01:24:47,069 --> 01:24:53,849
selective you know at least from what

1802
01:24:49,408 --> 01:24:55,529
I've seen you know so yeah I can

1803
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:57,539
definitely imagine you know just based

1804
01:24:55,529 --> 01:25:00,000
off my own you know land race you know

1805
01:24:57,539 --> 01:25:02,969
preservation runs you know there's

1806
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:07,198
there's a lot of garbage and then you

1807
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:09,750
can you know find good stuff but it's

1808
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:11,579
not what most people want it's it's also

1809
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:14,069
why I don't sell any of that kind of

1810
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:15,719
stuff because even though people think

1811
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:18,420
they want it they really don't want it

1812
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:20,340
you know they grow to a ten pack and

1813
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:25,069
they're like oh [ __ ] pirates you know

1814
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:28,710
the helling all you know reads this crap

1815
01:25:25,069 --> 01:25:32,908
okay so and so how do you ever consider

1816
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:34,829
maybe taking a very select stable

1817
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:36,809
phenotype from a land race stock you

1818
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:38,550
found and maybe like doing some hair

1819
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:40,139
swans on it seeing how stable it is and

1820
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:42,239
releasing that where it's like look you

1821
01:25:40,139 --> 01:25:44,400
want the land race Afghani here's a

1822
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:45,799
somewhat refined but still undiluted

1823
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:51,149
version of it

1824
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:53,070
right well even better when I take a

1825
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:55,529
land race and actually grow out a

1826
01:25:53,069 --> 01:25:57,509
hundred or two hundred of them or even

1827
01:25:55,529 --> 01:26:01,050
something you know as a simple as a

1828
01:25:57,510 --> 01:26:05,190
Preserve you know you know heirloom land

1829
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:08,610
race like pine tar cush my my step one

1830
01:26:05,189 --> 01:26:10,379
is always to do an open pollination

1831
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:15,359
where I take all the boys and I

1832
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:18,090
pollinate all the girls and then I I

1833
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:22,139
when I do that I also make my selections

1834
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:24,989
for the next round and I pull out all

1835
01:26:22,139 --> 01:26:27,060
the select boys and all the select girls

1836
01:26:24,988 --> 01:26:30,750
the best of the best of those big lots

1837
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:32,550
and then I directionally breed those so

1838
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:34,649
it's you know it tightens

1839
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:38,130
a lot and gets rid of the garbage and

1840
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:41,009
for you know you know for next

1841
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:44,550
generation if I sprout those seeds it's

1842
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:46,440
gonna be a you know a lot more uniform a

1843
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:49,289
lot more quality and then you know I can

1844
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:51,928
go from there you know with multiple

1845
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:54,059
generations to really isolate quality

1846
01:26:51,929 --> 01:26:57,090
it's all about selection that's all

1847
01:26:54,059 --> 01:26:59,340
breeding is okay so I've got a bit of a

1848
01:26:57,090 --> 01:27:01,590
hairy question which might be hard to

1849
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:03,059
answer might be easy people often talk

1850
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:05,340
about if you were to get landrace

1851
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:07,409
genetics yourself you'd likely have to

1852
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:09,239
do some you know refining some culling

1853
01:27:07,408 --> 01:27:11,848
all of the usual business they mention

1854
01:27:09,238 --> 01:27:14,250
my question is in relation to a lot of

1855
01:27:11,849 --> 01:27:16,578
Southeast Asian land races people will

1856
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:20,099
always say expect some hermaphrodites

1857
01:27:16,578 --> 01:27:21,868
what would you do though if basically

1858
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:23,730
every female you had showed

1859
01:27:21,868 --> 01:27:26,789
hermaphrodite traits have you just like

1860
01:27:23,729 --> 01:27:29,218
hit the losing ticket there or is it

1861
01:27:26,789 --> 01:27:31,710
possible to breed those together and

1862
01:27:29,219 --> 01:27:33,300
then in the f2 s to try to find

1863
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:34,649
something which didn't have afroditi is

1864
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:37,260
it just like you know not worth wasting

1865
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:40,799
your time if you can't find semi-stable

1866
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:44,369
nests in the first generation right I

1867
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,710
would definitely say open pollinate just

1868
01:27:44,368 --> 01:27:48,658
like I do already all your females times

1869
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:52,158
all your mails and then grow out as

1870
01:27:48,658 --> 01:27:54,929
large of a lot as you can and pull out

1871
01:27:52,158 --> 01:27:57,448
the least hermaphroditic out of the

1872
01:27:54,929 --> 01:28:01,859
bunch and then you know breed further

1873
01:27:57,448 --> 01:28:04,138
with those and oftentimes if you know

1874
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:07,229
you narrow it down like that then you

1875
01:28:04,139 --> 01:28:08,760
can out cross it to you know something

1876
01:28:07,229 --> 01:28:11,218
else that's probably more stable and

1877
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:13,349
they get into the f2s of that and

1878
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:15,529
actually pull something out that you

1879
01:28:13,349 --> 01:28:18,929
know potentially won't have the problems

1880
01:28:15,529 --> 01:28:21,210
so if people take a glance back at those

1881
01:28:18,929 --> 01:28:23,039
earliest seed bank magazines often

1882
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:25,170
there'll be a little comment saying are

1883
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:27,479
inbred for four generations or something

1884
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:29,730
along those lines is that the type of

1885
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:31,738
time frame you should expect if you're

1886
01:28:29,729 --> 01:28:34,709
gonna try to embark in such a product a

1887
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:35,819
project or is that the time frame to

1888
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:37,319
expect if you want to do it to the

1889
01:28:35,819 --> 01:28:38,908
highest level because a lot of people

1890
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:40,529
will say that you know like the early

1891
01:28:38,908 --> 01:28:42,238
year was phenomenal and some also works

1892
01:28:40,529 --> 01:28:44,609
because it was done properly is for

1893
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:45,889
generations like overkill to the point

1894
01:28:44,609 --> 01:28:48,699
where like you're going to have a really

1895
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:55,430
really good product or just the standard

1896
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:58,429
well honestly a lot of the old ones they

1897
01:28:55,430 --> 01:29:01,369
they pushed F wands like they searched

1898
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:03,950
you know line a and line B they either

1899
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:05,840
used a clone for you know the mother and

1900
01:29:03,949 --> 01:29:08,119
then searched you know through a lot of

1901
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,610
plants for you know the mail and then

1902
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:16,369
you know they released F ones a lot of

1903
01:29:10,609 --> 01:29:18,769
times you know oftentimes it all depends

1904
01:29:16,369 --> 01:29:21,559
on how how well it's bred you know

1905
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:25,550
between you know f1 and f4 whether that

1906
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:26,930
f4 is quality or garbage you know and

1907
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:29,270
unless you grow them out that's the only

1908
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:31,850
way to tell yeah and that's kind of I

1909
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:33,860
guess a point that complex me for a long

1910
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:36,230
time you know back in the day

1911
01:29:33,859 --> 01:29:39,019
theoretically there was the least amount

1912
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:40,279
of information about cannabis breeding

1913
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:41,630
around of course there's general

1914
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:43,460
breeding philosophies which are up

1915
01:29:41,630 --> 01:29:45,619
liable to cannabis and never was

1916
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:48,350
utilizing those but what I struggled to

1917
01:29:45,619 --> 01:29:50,869
understand is like you just referenced

1918
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:53,360
someone takes an f1 take it to the f4

1919
01:29:50,869 --> 01:29:55,010
usually it's [ __ ] by the f4 because they

1920
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,319
haven't done good selection along each

1921
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:59,300
step of the way and so it's correct and

1922
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:01,369
so like it's hard for me to believe that

1923
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:03,020
a certain amount if that didn't happen

1924
01:30:01,369 --> 01:30:05,809
with Neville because it's almost like

1925
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:07,250
what he was just like all like extending

1926
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:09,140
it to most breeders back then you know

1927
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:11,149
it's like what everyone took things

1928
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:13,039
several generations it was always an

1929
01:30:11,149 --> 01:30:14,569
improvement at each step they seemingly

1930
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:15,979
did it you know that you didn't take

1931
01:30:14,569 --> 01:30:17,389
them a year to do each generation they

1932
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:19,309
seemingly did it probably like you know

1933
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:22,310
each 3-month cycle they progressed a

1934
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:24,920
generation yeah and so it's like were

1935
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:26,180
they like gods of selection like how you

1936
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:29,420
know what I'm it just seems odd because

1937
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:31,220
I've got some Apollo 13 F fours and I

1938
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,899
got some f1 and it's just like night and

1939
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:34,250
day difference and I so I can't help but

1940
01:30:32,899 --> 01:30:38,000
feel like a similar thing must have

1941
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:42,039
happened to a smaller degree maybe right

1942
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:44,899
right and a lot of times breeders aren't

1943
01:30:42,039 --> 01:30:49,939
selecting from very big pools at all I

1944
01:30:44,899 --> 01:30:52,250
mean I've read how you know certain

1945
01:30:49,939 --> 01:30:55,219
breeders you know are only selecting

1946
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:58,640
from ten seeds that at a run I'm like

1947
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:59,539
well you know that's it's not much

1948
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:02,060
that's not right

1949
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:03,890
reading right there I mean I could do a

1950
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:05,600
lot of work if I'm only doing from 10

1951
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:07,700
but I like to work with at least a

1952
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,220
hundred and if it was a perfect world

1953
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:15,229
yeah thousands would be real nice yeah

1954
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:20,210
you know and so I read an article and it

1955
01:31:15,229 --> 01:31:21,889
says that you really go ahead this is

1956
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:23,810
gonna sound funny but it said you're a

1957
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:25,369
really good interview because you're

1958
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:27,560
able to articulate your thoughts on

1959
01:31:25,369 --> 01:31:30,260
males quite well and I think honestly

1960
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,880
that's probably the question most people

1961
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:34,489
listening to this show are interested in

1962
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:36,590
you know how would you describe your

1963
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:38,510
ideal male you know is it dependent on

1964
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:40,550
each project and more importantly what

1965
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:44,239
characteristics to you good

1966
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:48,850
characteristics that you look for Oh

1967
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:52,489
I mean I'm fairly simple with the boys

1968
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:57,860
ideally I'm looking for something that

1969
01:31:52,489 --> 01:32:00,979
you know puts on some Frost is stinky

1970
01:31:57,859 --> 01:32:02,779
and usually that's kind of a benefit to

1971
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:03,859
you know if they're frosty you can

1972
01:32:02,779 --> 01:32:06,699
actually get you know some of their

1973
01:32:03,859 --> 01:32:09,859
touring terpene profiles off of them

1974
01:32:06,699 --> 01:32:14,840
I've got buddies like with a 707

1975
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:19,759
seedbank he and I think archive might do

1976
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:22,940
it a little bit too but 707 he he

1977
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:25,480
reverses all his males with floral so he

1978
01:32:22,939 --> 01:32:28,159
can really get a good solid you know

1979
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:30,529
smell on you know what they're like and

1980
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:32,059
kind of get a better look because it

1981
01:32:30,529 --> 01:32:35,809
reverses them and makes them kind of

1982
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:40,700
more of a female plant but yeah

1983
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:44,330
frost emails you know stink emails and

1984
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:47,119
then bottom line is uh you know grow out

1985
01:32:44,329 --> 01:32:49,069
the progeny and see what happens and so

1986
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:50,989
I guess it goes without saying because I

1987
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:53,630
mean you just mentioned it you think

1988
01:32:50,989 --> 01:32:56,359
that resinous males are good or maybe

1989
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:59,779
superior to others do you believe though

1990
01:32:56,359 --> 01:33:02,989
that the the terpene profile you get off

1991
01:32:59,779 --> 01:33:04,819
rubbing those trichomes is pretty much

1992
01:33:02,989 --> 01:33:06,529
what its gonna pass on or there'll be

1993
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:10,849
some variation or it may not have any

1994
01:33:06,529 --> 01:33:12,829
correlation it really depends it depends

1995
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:16,760
if the

1996
01:33:12,829 --> 01:33:19,189
if those terpenes are recessive or

1997
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:21,770
dominant you know I've had some males

1998
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:24,109
that are extremely dominant and then

1999
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:27,500
others that just you know go right

2000
01:33:24,109 --> 01:33:29,329
underneath you know and the and the

2001
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:34,489
females chirps you know pop right out on

2002
01:33:29,329 --> 01:33:38,149
top so it's extremely variable yeah okay

2003
01:33:34,489 --> 01:33:40,159
and so how do you feel about the idea

2004
01:33:38,149 --> 01:33:41,779
proposed by both there's a lot of

2005
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:43,309
readers actually a bit like notably DJ

2006
01:33:41,779 --> 01:33:45,319
short and Tom he'll throw their weight

2007
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:47,720
behind it that the idea that there may

2008
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:51,229
be something to males that also produce

2009
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:53,720
a few pistols in terms of them being

2010
01:33:51,229 --> 01:33:55,609
like quite good males you know like I

2011
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:57,560
guess what you would say males showing

2012
01:33:55,609 --> 01:34:00,589
intersex traits of being a female you

2013
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:07,570
know how do you feel about that

2014
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:12,529
honestly I I definitely don't agree that

2015
01:34:07,569 --> 01:34:17,509
males that show intersex are are better

2016
01:34:12,529 --> 01:34:19,460
I think Sam skunkman said the best you

2017
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:21,640
know a hermas or her it doesn't matter

2018
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:25,630
if it's a female her or male her and

2019
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:30,010
I've seen plenty of male Herms you know

2020
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:33,680
and a lot of people I don't think even

2021
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:36,020
spot the the male Herms out because most

2022
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:37,909
breeders I think killed their males two

2023
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:40,580
to three weeks in the flower and don't

2024
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:42,380
even flower out the males and a male is

2025
01:34:40,579 --> 01:34:44,659
just like a female he's gonna herm

2026
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:48,140
a lot of times between six and eight

2027
01:34:44,659 --> 01:34:51,199
weeks in the flower and also a male is

2028
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:52,850
gonna tend to frost up you know six to

2029
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:55,729
eight weeks into flower just like that

2030
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:57,500
female you know I mean so a lot of

2031
01:34:55,729 --> 01:34:59,719
people they kill their males before they

2032
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:02,810
ever frost up before they really get

2033
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:06,409
their terpenes you know fully you know

2034
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:09,380
developed and so they never really know

2035
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:13,430
what they're breeding with you know so

2036
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:17,359
and so you know I'm sorry going oh no I

2037
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:21,470
I mean I I tend to you know oftentimes

2038
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:23,809
let my my my male plants flower out like

2039
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:25,230
a full eight weeks or more you know just

2040
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:27,660
to see what

2041
01:35:25,229 --> 01:35:29,069
what they produce yeah just out of

2042
01:35:27,659 --> 01:35:31,409
curiosity have you ever seen a male

2043
01:35:29,069 --> 01:35:32,639
plant - a similar thing to a female

2044
01:35:31,409 --> 01:35:35,909
we're like at the end of the flower

2045
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:37,829
cycle it'll produce some intersex you

2046
01:35:35,909 --> 01:35:39,119
know like nodes in order to maybe try to

2047
01:35:37,829 --> 01:35:41,279
self-replicate or do you think that's

2048
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:44,250
more of like a deeply ingrained female

2049
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,289
trait as opposed to a male trait oh yeah

2050
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:48,750
yeah yeah no that's why I was saying a

2051
01:35:46,289 --> 01:35:52,439
lot of times the males go don't put on

2052
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:55,198
pistols until six weeks or further in

2053
01:35:52,439 --> 01:35:57,389
the flower yeah interesting in any few

2054
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:59,669
were to get some of those seeds created

2055
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:01,860
on the Maya pistols and you pop them

2056
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:05,429
here what would you expect the offspring

2057
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:08,039
to be like you know I've never sprouted

2058
01:36:05,429 --> 01:36:10,760
them and I've got at least three lots of

2059
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:12,869
seeds that are male x males in my fridge

2060
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:16,949
some of them I've had there for quite

2061
01:36:12,869 --> 01:36:19,920
some time and if we're gonna you know

2062
01:36:16,948 --> 01:36:21,719
we're gonna believe guys like Sam the

2063
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:26,219
skunk man who was actually sprouted he

2064
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:30,989
say he seeds and grown them supposedly

2065
01:36:26,219 --> 01:36:36,750
they come up with something like 25%

2066
01:36:30,988 --> 01:36:40,500
female plants and then 50% kind of inter

2067
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:44,369
inter sex male plants and then 25% male

2068
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:48,960
plants but I haven't personally sprouted

2069
01:36:44,369 --> 01:36:51,420
them so so as like maybe a smaller

2070
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,369
breeder who doesn't have like oh not not

2071
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:54,630
you but as someone else who doesn't have

2072
01:36:53,369 --> 01:36:56,340
a lot of facilities maybe they're just

2073
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:58,440
toying around with their let you know a

2074
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:00,179
few tenths or whatever is there any way

2075
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:01,889
you could recommend being able to hold

2076
01:37:00,179 --> 01:37:04,440
on to a male and being able to flower it

2077
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:09,860
out the full length without just ruining

2078
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:15,899
your crop that's that's tough I mean

2079
01:37:09,859 --> 01:37:18,089
when I do it I either am doing my open

2080
01:37:15,899 --> 01:37:20,189
pollination and so I just leave the

2081
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:22,409
males in the room for the whole time and

2082
01:37:20,189 --> 01:37:25,469
just take care of them to the end or

2083
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:31,710
other times I have pulled out all the

2084
01:37:25,469 --> 01:37:35,670
males and basically just filled a full

2085
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:37,908
you know 4x4 tent with something like 80

2086
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:41,329
or so males

2087
01:37:37,908 --> 01:37:44,059
and you know just kept them you know

2088
01:37:41,329 --> 01:37:46,939
going in little six inch square pots you

2089
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:50,570
know for eight weeks you know it gives

2090
01:37:46,939 --> 01:37:54,169
you that idea of what yeah you know what

2091
01:37:50,569 --> 01:37:57,469
you're looking for but yeah as long as

2092
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:59,000
you have an isolated space it's not near

2093
01:37:57,469 --> 01:38:00,948
the females it's just fine

2094
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,689
okay and I mean you just kind of

2095
01:38:00,948 --> 01:38:04,488
mentioned an interesting topic we've

2096
01:38:02,689 --> 01:38:06,138
asked a few different guests what in

2097
01:38:04,488 --> 01:38:07,549
your opinion is the ideal way to feed

2098
01:38:06,139 --> 01:38:10,310
our hunt and so what I mean by that is

2099
01:38:07,550 --> 01:38:12,320
is what's the smallest size pot for

2100
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:14,300
example that you think you can run a

2101
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:16,039
plant in and you still get an accurate

2102
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:18,020
representation of the plant but you know

2103
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:19,189
like it's fairly small and you can fit a

2104
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:23,420
bunch of them you know and do some good

2105
01:38:19,189 --> 01:38:25,369
hunting yeah I think the smallest I'd

2106
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:29,300
prefer to do is probably about like a

2107
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:31,579
two gallon a two gallon pot which you

2108
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:34,730
know the two gallon errs I use you can

2109
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:39,250
put 36 on a table any smaller than that

2110
01:38:34,729 --> 01:38:41,539
and I don't know if you're getting

2111
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:43,698
enough of a representation and you're

2112
01:38:41,539 --> 01:38:45,560
gonna lose quite a few because of you

2113
01:38:43,698 --> 01:38:49,129
know plants drowning out and just being

2114
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:51,199
too small to keep up yeah yeah yeah and

2115
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:52,670
so something people will probably notice

2116
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:54,888
if they check out your Instagram is

2117
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:56,929
you're a fan of running like the beds

2118
01:38:54,889 --> 01:38:59,239
with the buy all the same strain in the

2119
01:38:56,929 --> 01:39:00,770
bed are you like a big advocate to this

2120
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:01,939
do you think people really need to start

2121
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:04,100
doing it themselves would you think it

2122
01:39:01,939 --> 01:39:07,399
just happens to suit you and you know it

2123
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:12,130
might not work for everyone beds

2124
01:39:07,399 --> 01:39:15,738
definitely have their pros and cons I

2125
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:16,159
generally have way more stuff than I can

2126
01:39:15,738 --> 01:39:18,769
handle

2127
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:22,309
and I don't have a big crew to help me

2128
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:26,900
so I need you know stuff to be as easy

2129
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:30,139
as possible and so you know for me you

2130
01:39:26,899 --> 01:39:34,039
know running 10 or 20 beds is like

2131
01:39:30,139 --> 01:39:37,310
running 10 or 20 pots you know I mean I

2132
01:39:34,039 --> 01:39:40,039
only have to water 10 or 20 you know

2133
01:39:37,310 --> 01:39:42,770
versus hundreds and hundreds of pots you

2134
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:47,060
know so it's it's definitely a necessity

2135
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:49,460
for you know somebody who's not running

2136
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:51,410
a big crew or anything yeah okay yeah

2137
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:53,810
and do you find

2138
01:39:51,409 --> 01:39:55,250
the plants will try to out-compete each

2139
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:56,390
other if they're not of the same strain

2140
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:57,380
because that's an idea that gets thrown

2141
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:58,850
around a lot but I've never actually

2142
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:00,829
toyed with it myself where you know

2143
01:39:58,850 --> 01:40:02,539
people say oh if you run if you run all

2144
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:04,219
all seeds from the same strain like

2145
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:05,810
they'll just they'll exist harmoniously

2146
01:40:04,219 --> 01:40:07,699
but if it's two different strains

2147
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:08,660
they'll fight each other and you know

2148
01:40:07,699 --> 01:40:09,500
one will come out on top

2149
01:40:08,659 --> 01:40:14,719
do you think that's a bit of an

2150
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:18,770
overstatement no no if you have

2151
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:20,960
something fast growing in the beds yeah

2152
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:23,090
and something slow growing yeah the the

2153
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,219
the fast growing rooms are gonna blow

2154
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:27,199
away the others I always try to kind of

2155
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:30,020
match what I'm growing in my beds I

2156
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:34,189
either do a full bed of just you know

2157
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:36,680
one one type or I you know just make

2158
01:40:34,189 --> 01:40:38,059
sure that they're planted so that you

2159
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,090
know nothing's gonna get you know

2160
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:43,160
drowned out and sure even still you know

2161
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:45,560
they're still seedlings and plants that

2162
01:40:43,159 --> 01:40:49,369
do get drowned out from time to time but

2163
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:54,320
I'm always ruining you know 16 25 36 you

2164
01:40:49,369 --> 01:40:56,210
know or more per bed so you know I get

2165
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:59,210
most of them to come out yeah I was

2166
01:40:56,210 --> 01:41:01,069
gonna say it looking at um some of the I

2167
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:03,590
believe it was the purple Urkel TK

2168
01:41:01,069 --> 01:41:05,988
hybrids or something along those lines

2169
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:07,520
though they were all really uniformed I

2170
01:41:05,988 --> 01:41:09,859
was so blown away impressed I was like

2171
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,750
[ __ ] like I was not sailing it would

2172
01:41:09,859 --> 01:41:16,819
have been a challenge to keep that going

2173
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:20,329
happy ok right I mean luckily I've had a

2174
01:41:16,819 --> 01:41:22,609
lot of experience doing it so some of

2175
01:41:20,329 --> 01:41:26,238
these runs just you know you throw them

2176
01:41:22,609 --> 01:41:27,619
in you try them two weeks later and they

2177
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:30,559
just do it all themselves

2178
01:41:27,619 --> 01:41:32,869
so yeah awesome Anna and just a quick

2179
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:35,150
little curiosity question do you co2 at

2180
01:41:32,869 --> 01:41:36,590
all I think that it's fat it's full an

2181
01:41:35,149 --> 01:41:37,969
awful lot like I think it used to be a

2182
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:40,840
lot more of a bigger thing than it is

2183
01:41:37,969 --> 01:41:46,010
now like where do you sit on that one I

2184
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:50,900
have I I toyed around with it 20 years

2185
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:53,960
ago a little bit but I I've never I've

2186
01:41:50,899 --> 01:41:55,639
never really used co2 at all and you

2187
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:57,500
know when when I was commercially

2188
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:59,360
cropping inside I mean I was still

2189
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:02,300
pulling you know two two-and-a-half

2190
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:03,799
upwards of three pounds of light even on

2191
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:05,960
some of my seed runs you know

2192
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:07,520
I'm growing straight from seed I'm I'm

2193
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:14,569
hitting two two-and-a-half pounds of

2194
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:17,929
light so no co2 passive passive intake

2195
01:42:14,569 --> 01:42:19,908
just active exhaust and no air

2196
01:42:17,929 --> 01:42:22,969
conditions the air conditioners or

2197
01:42:19,908 --> 01:42:26,000
nothing like that I'm also on the coast

2198
01:42:22,969 --> 01:42:29,059
so you know it's cool in my neighborhood

2199
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:32,210
okay and just to clarify for everyone

2200
01:42:29,059 --> 01:42:33,949
are you an organic guy you have a bottle

2201
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:35,989
guy where do you sit on it or how do you

2202
01:42:33,948 --> 01:42:41,000
do you feel it affects the end product

2203
01:42:35,988 --> 01:42:43,488
ultimately oh yeah I'm organic and I'm

2204
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,279
extremely simple I really don't use

2205
01:42:43,488 --> 01:42:51,529
barely any bottles at all

2206
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:54,439
I mix dry amendments into my beds you

2207
01:42:51,529 --> 01:42:57,099
know like fish meals bone meals or like

2208
01:42:54,439 --> 01:42:59,928
fish bone meals Cal this that the other

2209
01:42:57,099 --> 01:43:02,449
and I just mix all that stuff in you

2210
01:42:59,929 --> 01:43:05,420
know at the beginning of each run and

2211
01:43:02,448 --> 01:43:08,808
then I water with plain water as simple

2212
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:11,359
as it can get and basically I'm prepping

2213
01:43:08,809 --> 01:43:13,760
to do you know a really big indoor

2214
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:16,158
organic grow in the future

2215
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:20,360
that's going to be automated so that's

2216
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:22,698
what I'm working kind of my my my setup

2217
01:43:20,359 --> 01:43:27,609
towards you know just automated organic

2218
01:43:22,698 --> 01:43:32,109
pure water you know yeah Kapus yeah

2219
01:43:27,609 --> 01:43:36,019
after my heart so with that being said

2220
01:43:32,109 --> 01:43:37,908
do you find that the end product is is

2221
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:41,090
dramatically different like I'm of the

2222
01:43:37,908 --> 01:43:43,039
opinion that you know I guess anything

2223
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:45,110
grown to the highest level is going to

2224
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:47,719
be really good but as a general rule of

2225
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:49,698
thumb I find organic even if it was

2226
01:43:47,719 --> 01:43:51,559
let's just say you had a strain and you

2227
01:43:49,698 --> 01:43:55,069
only consider it to have been grown to

2228
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:57,949
say 80% of its potential and we have two

2229
01:43:55,069 --> 01:43:59,630
buds one organic one synthetic or you

2230
01:43:57,948 --> 01:44:02,359
know like bottled nutrient type thing I

2231
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:03,859
believe that if it's not maxing I think

2232
01:44:02,359 --> 01:44:05,539
if they were both 100% well grow and

2233
01:44:03,859 --> 01:44:06,799
they'd be pretty similar but if we're

2234
01:44:05,539 --> 01:44:08,868
just talking to say 80 percent or less

2235
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,969
than 100 which i think is the realistic

2236
01:44:08,868 --> 01:44:12,319
situation most of the time it's not

2237
01:44:10,969 --> 01:44:14,029
grown absolutely perfectly

2238
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:16,519
I think the organic one wins out by a

2239
01:44:14,029 --> 01:44:17,539
fair margin do you agree with that or do

2240
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:19,100
you think maybe

2241
01:44:17,539 --> 01:44:23,060
the more of a closer race than I'm

2242
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:26,630
giving it credit honestly I think

2243
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:31,460
sometimes some of my buddies stuff that

2244
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:34,880
combine organics and chemicals you know

2245
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:37,880
tend to tend to be a little more pungent

2246
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:41,480
and almost a little more tasty than just

2247
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:44,119
pure pure organics like I do years ago I

2248
01:44:41,479 --> 01:44:47,509
used to do a chemical organic you know

2249
01:44:44,119 --> 01:44:49,640
thing and I I think I it definitely came

2250
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:54,650
out more pungent when when I was

2251
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:56,240
combining the things it was I was

2252
01:44:54,649 --> 01:44:58,699
definitely getting high yields back then

2253
01:44:56,239 --> 01:45:01,579
I'm using a lot of bottled this is and

2254
01:44:58,699 --> 01:45:04,720
that's and all that kind of stuff but I

2255
01:45:01,579 --> 01:45:07,250
I haven't honestly done a side-by-side

2256
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:09,829
trial to really I think that would be

2257
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:11,659
the best bet you know just side by side

2258
01:45:09,829 --> 01:45:14,090
same environment same everything but you

2259
01:45:11,659 --> 01:45:17,119
know keep one organic do one you know

2260
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:20,180
chemical and then you know see what you

2261
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:23,930
know really uh your taste buds tell you

2262
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:25,820
in anime you know how you have an

2263
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:27,890
organic snog you know are you happy to

2264
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:34,219
try whatever or you know why would you

2265
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:37,850
get down on some jungle boys stuff I'll

2266
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:40,280
try some stuff even even if I don't know

2267
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:45,490
where how it's grown I think we we all

2268
01:45:40,279 --> 01:45:48,739
tend to take in and buy stuff that

2269
01:45:45,489 --> 01:45:52,099
hasn't been you know done the best so

2270
01:45:48,739 --> 01:45:54,429
from time to time so I'll try a variety

2271
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,430
of stuff

2272
01:45:54,699 --> 01:46:00,289
so let's change topic for a moment get

2273
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,550
to subject near and dear to my heart and

2274
01:46:00,289 --> 01:46:04,850
probably most people who listen to this

2275
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:07,310
show chem dog you are actually probably

2276
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:09,289
one of the I guess to the public one of

2277
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:10,789
the lesser known aficionados but for the

2278
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:12,319
people in the know I think a lot of

2279
01:46:10,789 --> 01:46:14,930
people know that you are probably one of

2280
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:18,019
the foremost cambogia experts especially

2281
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:19,820
in regards to how they grow being able

2282
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:23,510
to compare them between each other often

2283
01:46:19,819 --> 01:46:24,949
I hear people tell me you know parts of

2284
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:26,270
the skunk VI story which I'm very

2285
01:46:24,949 --> 01:46:28,119
familiar with and they'll be like oh

2286
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:30,350
yeah and skunk VI posted online an

2287
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:31,079
inspector was the guy who vouched for

2288
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:32,789
him and was like

2289
01:46:31,079 --> 01:46:34,109
that's the chem dog and I went and

2290
01:46:32,789 --> 01:46:35,880
checked the thread and sure enough you

2291
01:46:34,109 --> 01:46:38,039
are the first person to kind of chime in

2292
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:40,440
and be like yep that's definitely the 91

2293
01:46:38,039 --> 01:46:41,850
and so yeah you know why don't you give

2294
01:46:40,439 --> 01:46:43,139
us a quick little rundown on your

2295
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:45,600
history with the chem dog and how you

2296
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:49,710
kind of got in twined in at all yeah

2297
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:53,730
that was an accident right there so

2298
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:57,840
basically it kind of stems from Jason

2299
01:46:53,729 --> 01:47:01,229
Kings canna bible that came out early

2300
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:06,180
2000s and he was raving about this chem

2301
01:47:01,229 --> 01:47:08,699
dog right and so it was kind of on my

2302
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:11,210
list you know if I ever came across it

2303
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:16,349
you know I'd love to check it out well

2304
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:20,730
you know come about 2004 2005 you know I

2305
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:25,560
got a chem dog cat you know from one of

2306
01:47:20,729 --> 01:47:27,750
my buddies and doing research on it it

2307
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:30,510
didn't look nothing like a chem dog you

2308
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:34,289
know at least what I believed to be you

2309
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:37,470
know legit chem dog and then uh I was

2310
01:47:34,289 --> 01:47:40,350
talking to my buddy set at 7:07 seed

2311
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:43,470
bank and he was like oh well you know

2312
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:46,260
I've got the original chem dog from

2313
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:49,710
skunk VA when I was like a little sweet

2314
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:52,680
you know and so you know he basically

2315
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:56,869
gave me uh you know the chem dog he had

2316
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:59,610
gotten directly off of skunk ba and

2317
01:47:56,869 --> 01:48:03,779
skunk VA you know he was on overgrow

2318
01:47:59,609 --> 01:48:07,229
background 2005 and he had posted

2319
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:09,090
pictures up and I think G was on there

2320
01:48:07,229 --> 01:48:11,789
and G was like yep that's the chem dog

2321
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:13,770
so everybody you know who was pertinent

2322
01:48:11,789 --> 01:48:16,439
to the discussion had you know pretty

2323
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:18,300
much validated skunk VA is chem dog as

2324
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:20,399
the one you need so I was like that's

2325
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:24,600
the only one I want right there and then

2326
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:28,219
when do you sent a job ransom seeds and

2327
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:31,410
Joe brand started the one through four

2328
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:34,829
you know I I told my buddy at the time

2329
01:48:31,409 --> 01:48:36,809
you know hey you know run down to Sonoma

2330
01:48:34,829 --> 01:48:38,100
and you know give me some cuts off those

2331
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:40,410
seed plants because he'd been talking

2332
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:42,479
them so he did that and he was all

2333
01:48:40,409 --> 01:48:45,868
excited about this that other chem dog

2334
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:48,420
red and all I all I wanted was that chem

2335
01:48:45,868 --> 01:48:51,448
dog one through four and so I got those

2336
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:56,550
and then when you came out to to do his

2337
01:48:51,448 --> 01:48:59,638
2006 tour you know he gave you know

2338
01:48:56,550 --> 01:49:02,070
multiple buddies the the chem dog D in

2339
01:48:59,639 --> 01:49:05,368
the chem dog sister so I got those you

2340
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:09,509
know from obsolete and then I also got

2341
01:49:05,368 --> 01:49:12,808
another chem dog D from Joe brand but

2342
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:15,900
essentially you know by 2006 I had I

2343
01:49:12,809 --> 01:49:19,219
think what seven different chem dogs you

2344
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:23,939
know all from you know the sources and

2345
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:29,510
so you know I grew a long out well you

2346
01:49:23,939 --> 01:49:33,448
know and so how did you kind of go from

2347
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:36,420
having grown them to being more kind of

2348
01:49:33,448 --> 01:49:38,308
what I consider to be the man who a lot

2349
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:41,248
of people think is possibly the only

2350
01:49:38,309 --> 01:49:43,320
holder of like the one - the one and two

2351
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:45,630
because I think you the only one who

2352
01:49:43,319 --> 01:49:47,279
really put up like detailed descriptions

2353
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:48,840
and photographs of the one and two and

2354
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:51,868
everyone's always really interested like

2355
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:53,940
do they still exist and because there's

2356
01:49:51,868 --> 01:49:55,799
kind of a bit of a vacuum around that

2357
01:49:53,939 --> 01:49:57,658
general discussion I think people just

2358
01:49:55,800 --> 01:50:01,860
assume like our inspectors probably got

2359
01:49:57,658 --> 01:50:04,138
it well it's kind of funny because when

2360
01:50:01,859 --> 01:50:06,208
I ran those four out Joe brand he

2361
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:10,199
sprouted the seeds and he groom out that

2362
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:12,510
summer in 2006 he really only gave the

2363
01:50:10,198 --> 01:50:15,748
one through four to two people me and

2364
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:18,900
this this other cat down around the bay

2365
01:50:15,748 --> 01:50:20,819
I think who's actually turns out his

2366
01:50:18,899 --> 01:50:25,138
buddies with you know some of my buddies

2367
01:50:20,819 --> 01:50:26,759
down in mindo but anyways so there was

2368
01:50:25,139 --> 01:50:32,900
only two people who ever had the one

2369
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:32,900
through four aside from Joe brand and

2370
01:50:33,859 --> 01:50:41,819
anyways when I ran all four of them out

2371
01:50:37,038 --> 01:50:45,238
I wasn't a huge fan of the number one it

2372
01:50:41,819 --> 01:50:47,929
was kind of kind of a more hazy thing

2373
01:50:45,238 --> 01:50:50,189
more sativa thing just flew fie buds

2374
01:50:47,929 --> 01:50:53,489
didn't really have this small profile

2375
01:50:50,189 --> 01:50:54,669
that I really cared for I really like

2376
01:50:53,488 --> 01:50:58,599
the two though

2377
01:50:54,670 --> 01:51:01,690
had like cushy popcorn nugs on it had

2378
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:06,340
out like a bubble gum diesel smell to it

2379
01:51:01,689 --> 01:51:08,409
it was really nice anyways so I gave I

2380
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:13,119
think at least three or four of my

2381
01:51:08,409 --> 01:51:15,069
buddies um the chem dog to cut and then

2382
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:17,198
I kind of right around that time or a

2383
01:51:15,069 --> 01:51:18,939
little after that time I kind of just

2384
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:20,559
dropped my entire mother collection and

2385
01:51:18,939 --> 01:51:24,428
took like a three year vacation a little

2386
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:26,560
sabbatical well when I came back my

2387
01:51:24,429 --> 01:51:30,190
buddies are all you know they all had

2388
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:31,870
the chem dog too and I get it back and I

2389
01:51:30,189 --> 01:51:35,829
grow it out and I'm like wait what the

2390
01:51:31,869 --> 01:51:38,349
[ __ ] it's not you can come dog too you

2391
01:51:35,829 --> 01:51:41,948
know I had scrapped the chem dog one or

2392
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:45,579
so I thought well as soon as I grew it

2393
01:51:41,948 --> 01:51:47,979
out I I knew I was like oh man and every

2394
01:51:45,579 --> 01:51:51,969
single buddy I had given it to same

2395
01:51:47,979 --> 01:51:55,329
thing so I had accidentally given

2396
01:51:51,969 --> 01:51:57,579
everybody chem dog number one and nobody

2397
01:51:55,329 --> 01:52:00,519
had chem dog number two so to this day

2398
01:51:57,579 --> 01:52:03,159
we still have chem dog number one but

2399
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:10,060
nobody's seen chem dog number two since

2400
01:52:03,159 --> 01:52:11,500
about 2007 2008 so but the the chem dog

2401
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:14,380
number one is kind of unique

2402
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:16,569
I mean it's extremely high in Mersin it

2403
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:19,929
tests that I think upwards of like four

2404
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:24,789
percent nursing which is really strong

2405
01:52:19,929 --> 01:52:31,300
for just a you know a monoterpene or

2406
01:52:24,789 --> 01:52:34,810
whatever they call it and it's 12 12

2407
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:40,449
plus weaker just as potent as any of the

2408
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:41,679
other chem dogs but uh yeah it hasn't it

2409
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:45,309
hasn't really gotten too widespread

2410
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:48,039
since since Joe grant starts routed that

2411
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:51,310
seed and I think pretty much anybody who

2412
01:52:48,039 --> 01:52:53,469
has it got it from from me or you know

2413
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:55,780
one of my buddies who I originally gave

2414
01:52:53,469 --> 01:52:58,600
it to okay and do you think the chem -

2415
01:52:55,779 --> 01:53:01,109
is most likely just gone in general or

2416
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:03,699
do you think maybe someone's got it it's

2417
01:53:01,109 --> 01:53:08,288
definitely gone I mean I made a couple

2418
01:53:03,698 --> 01:53:11,198
hybrids with it back in Oh 607 you know

2419
01:53:08,288 --> 01:53:13,929
chrome chrome grew the chem dog -

2420
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:20,979
crossed a deep chunk that I made I think

2421
01:53:13,929 --> 01:53:24,219
in oh seven but uh yeah I'd say I'd say

2422
01:53:20,979 --> 01:53:26,589
it's safely gone okay and then sorry I

2423
01:53:24,219 --> 01:53:28,689
guess the big ultimate money question is

2424
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:29,969
what do you think the genetics behind

2425
01:53:28,689 --> 01:53:32,408
doula

2426
01:53:29,969 --> 01:53:35,529
like chem dog yeah where do you think

2427
01:53:32,408 --> 01:53:41,710
the chem dog comes from I think Kim dog

2428
01:53:35,529 --> 01:53:44,109
is just I mean I'm my uncle grown-up he

2429
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:45,960
was a professional photographer and he

2430
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:49,058
kind of traveled the world a little bit

2431
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:51,158
collecting seeds taking pictures then he

2432
01:53:49,059 --> 01:53:53,230
brought a bunch of those home and so

2433
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:56,348
I've got you know he passed away in the

2434
01:53:53,229 --> 01:53:59,169
80s the mid late 80s and so I've got all

2435
01:53:56,349 --> 01:54:01,300
these pictures that he took uh you know

2436
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:03,340
these pure landrace in the COS and

2437
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:09,159
sativas and everything that he grew out

2438
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:12,179
and the Kemna any one is very similar to

2439
01:54:09,158 --> 01:54:18,399
some of these pure land race in because

2440
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:20,170
that he had in the early 80s and you

2441
01:54:18,399 --> 01:54:22,029
know I wouldn't be surprised if it

2442
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:26,099
wasn't something pure like that or maybe

2443
01:54:22,029 --> 01:54:29,828
even just you know some type of Mexican

2444
01:54:26,099 --> 01:54:32,440
you know indica or you know some type of

2445
01:54:29,828 --> 01:54:34,960
sativa indica hybrid you know from the

2446
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:37,569
early days back in Oregon because you

2447
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:42,038
know Joe brand is adamant that that came

2448
01:54:37,569 --> 01:54:44,828
from you know those pounds came from you

2449
01:54:42,038 --> 01:54:47,229
know Southern Oregon area so you are one

2450
01:54:44,828 --> 01:54:50,049
of the few people who I know still has

2451
01:54:47,229 --> 01:54:52,058
contact with Joe brand what can you tell

2452
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:53,288
us about Joe be you know what's he doing

2453
01:54:52,059 --> 01:54:57,219
does he plan on pumping his head up

2454
01:54:53,288 --> 01:54:59,109
again he wants to he wants to he's

2455
01:54:57,219 --> 01:55:05,198
trying to get his life back together

2456
01:54:59,109 --> 01:55:06,639
that's for sure you know so uh hopefully

2457
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:09,279
it works out and he doesn't get caught

2458
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:11,529
up in things again you know you found

2459
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:15,698
he's definitely been through a rough ten

2460
01:55:11,529 --> 01:55:17,229
years that's for sure so if we just jump

2461
01:55:15,698 --> 01:55:19,750
back to the feminizing for a moment you

2462
01:55:17,229 --> 01:55:22,069
versed on the fair few lines which one

2463
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:24,139
in your opinion has the most

2464
01:55:22,069 --> 01:55:26,448
treasure locked inside of it which maybe

2465
01:55:24,139 --> 01:55:28,130
isn't apparent on face value like you

2466
01:55:26,448 --> 01:55:29,689
know if we reference the the bubble you

2467
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:31,368
mentioned earlier it has that lemon lime

2468
01:55:29,689 --> 01:55:33,319
in it you know I guess that's not really

2469
01:55:31,368 --> 01:55:35,658
a self-evident that's locked in there by

2470
01:55:33,319 --> 01:55:37,698
any means what what in your opinion yeah

2471
01:55:35,658 --> 01:55:41,118
the greatest treasure trove Australian

2472
01:55:37,698 --> 01:55:44,649
2s1 I guess Oh see that's a tough one

2473
01:55:41,118 --> 01:55:47,868
because I really love a lot of s1 Baba's

2474
01:55:44,649 --> 01:55:50,598
they're extremely unique some of the

2475
01:55:47,868 --> 01:55:54,618
URLs they're they're rare but there's

2476
01:55:50,599 --> 01:55:58,449
some just pure grapey you know I don't

2477
01:55:54,618 --> 01:56:02,118
know just potty just really high quality

2478
01:55:58,448 --> 01:56:04,000
ones in there but overall my favorite I

2479
01:56:02,118 --> 01:56:08,738
think and this is just a personal thing

2480
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:11,719
is the men dos Mendocino purple s ones

2481
01:56:08,738 --> 01:56:15,500
there's so much variation in those so

2482
01:56:11,719 --> 01:56:21,460
many different terpenes it's it's

2483
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:24,310
extremely variable and in the S ones

2484
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:25,989
with so many different plants and just

2485
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:28,639
expressions

2486
01:56:25,988 --> 01:56:31,488
it's definitely bar none my favorite

2487
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:34,429
even though it's not you know even

2488
01:56:31,488 --> 01:56:37,399
remotely one of the more potent you know

2489
01:56:34,429 --> 01:56:40,340
ones out of the bunch yeah no worries

2490
01:56:37,399 --> 01:56:42,948
and so I mean we heard from Bob Hemphill

2491
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:44,750
in a previous episode you know that not

2492
01:56:42,948 --> 01:56:46,908
so Doug was the guy who popped the seeds

2493
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:49,099
do you know if it's true that he

2494
01:56:46,908 --> 01:56:50,868
initially actually got two seeds and

2495
01:56:49,099 --> 01:56:55,880
there was a male and he may or may not

2496
01:56:50,868 --> 01:56:57,139
have culled it yeah okay so when I met

2497
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:59,960
not so dawg

2498
01:56:57,139 --> 01:57:02,090
he actually hit me up on Instagram and I

2499
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:04,310
had known some of his you know friends

2500
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:07,039
and acquaintances and buddies over the

2501
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:08,840
years and turns out we died we'd even

2502
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:12,289
been to the same parties down in like

2503
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:15,139
Sonoma and Mendocino and stuff but we'd

2504
01:57:12,289 --> 01:57:18,078
never met and anyways he hits me up on

2505
01:57:15,139 --> 01:57:20,389
our Instagram and he's like hey you know

2506
01:57:18,078 --> 01:57:24,139
I'm gonna sprout a seed blah blah know

2507
01:57:20,389 --> 01:57:27,859
I'm like front from probably almost 10

2508
01:57:24,139 --> 01:57:30,199
years ago I had met some kids who

2509
01:57:27,859 --> 01:57:33,198
actually knew him and they had told me

2510
01:57:30,198 --> 01:57:35,519
his you know story way back then and I

2511
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:38,439
was like you know

2512
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:41,710
didn't you have a male and a female you

2513
01:57:38,439 --> 01:57:45,069
know and then the male who accidentally

2514
01:57:41,710 --> 01:57:46,930
got killed when a light fell and lopped

2515
01:57:45,069 --> 01:57:51,789
off its top and he's like how did you

2516
01:57:46,930 --> 01:57:55,360
know that story well I got a weird

2517
01:57:51,789 --> 01:57:57,880
memory and you know I'm uh you know some

2518
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:59,500
of your friends but yeah he's like I

2519
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:03,819
didn't tell them almost anybody that

2520
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:06,220
story and yeah anyways so he knew I was

2521
01:58:03,819 --> 01:58:09,009
legit I knew he was legit cuz his story

2522
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:12,039
was like just added up you know all the

2523
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:14,409
way so yeah we've we've uh DS ever since

2524
01:58:12,039 --> 01:58:16,510
that's also and what do you do you think

2525
01:58:14,409 --> 01:58:19,989
it's pretty safe to say that Maya would

2526
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:24,329
have been something special also it

2527
01:58:19,989 --> 01:58:28,510
could have it could have it yeah and so

2528
01:58:24,329 --> 01:58:31,720
what do you think about the idea of if

2529
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:33,250
you pop feminized seeds and you find a

2530
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:35,980
full-on nail so it's not like a female

2531
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:38,079
that shows male tendencies but it's just

2532
01:58:35,979 --> 01:58:40,149
a straight male and you can't find signs

2533
01:58:38,079 --> 01:58:42,220
of a female what do you think the guy

2534
01:58:40,149 --> 01:58:43,629
that plan is like is it safe to treat it

2535
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:46,990
as if it's a male like if you wanted to

2536
01:58:43,630 --> 01:58:50,050
breed with it would you go ahead or you

2537
01:58:46,989 --> 01:58:53,760
know I'm in a tough position with that

2538
01:58:50,050 --> 01:58:56,619
one because I have grown out literally

2539
01:58:53,760 --> 01:59:02,920
thousands of feminized seeds that I've

2540
01:58:56,619 --> 01:59:06,970
made and I still have yet to find one

2541
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:09,130
single legitimate male I've followed

2542
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:13,560
other people who have supposedly made

2543
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:16,659
the same exact s ones and eswin hybrids

2544
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:23,230
and they've pulled like multiple males

2545
01:59:16,659 --> 01:59:25,479
out of their stuff so uh I honestly

2546
01:59:23,229 --> 01:59:28,779
think you know ninety-nine point nine

2547
01:59:25,479 --> 01:59:31,379
percent of males found and feminized

2548
01:59:28,779 --> 01:59:33,939
seeds are from pollen contamination

2549
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:40,930
basically there's male pollen somewhere

2550
01:59:33,939 --> 01:59:44,259
and yeah that's where the males come

2551
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:50,220
from in all my growing of s ones I found

2552
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:50,220
what initially sextour sextoy oh and

2553
01:59:50,469 --> 01:59:57,939
it was obviously a Pakistani hybrid and

2554
01:59:53,710 --> 02:00:01,210
I had done a Pakistani pollination in

2555
01:59:57,939 --> 02:00:03,549
the room the round before and I had I

2556
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:05,408
thought I cleaned the room proper but

2557
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:09,099
I'm pretty sure you know obviously I

2558
02:00:05,408 --> 02:00:10,839
missed one gray Nepal you know and then

2559
02:00:09,099 --> 02:00:13,900
another time so that that right there is

2560
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:17,489
pollen contamination the other time I

2561
02:00:13,899 --> 02:00:23,679
had a bomb threat feminized hybrid

2562
02:00:17,488 --> 02:00:25,509
sexing as a male and about two weeks in

2563
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:27,158
the flower it was all balls and then it

2564
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:29,530
just started putting on hairs you know

2565
02:00:27,158 --> 02:00:34,029
went full female after that so that is

2566
02:00:29,529 --> 02:00:37,238
just an extreme hermaphrodite so out of

2567
02:00:34,029 --> 02:00:40,179
out of thousands of films that that's my

2568
02:00:37,238 --> 02:00:45,189
experience with males and I think Paulin

2569
02:00:40,179 --> 02:00:48,279
contamination is is the majority of the

2570
02:00:45,189 --> 02:00:49,988
males that people find but who knows

2571
02:00:48,279 --> 02:00:52,149
yeah I mean it certainly seems like a

2572
02:00:49,988 --> 02:00:54,098
plausible explanation while we're on

2573
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:56,439
that topic like I guess you know kind of

2574
02:00:54,099 --> 02:00:59,980
underlying issues with see production

2575
02:00:56,439 --> 02:01:02,379
how do you feel about the rise of the

2576
02:00:59,979 --> 02:01:04,178
more large breeders who I guess

2577
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:06,639
essentially have the market and the

2578
02:01:04,179 --> 02:01:08,828
resources to outsource their seed

2579
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:11,050
production gee do you think that this is

2580
02:01:08,828 --> 02:01:12,309
we're entering like a bit of shaky

2581
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:14,920
ground with that or do you think that

2582
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:20,920
quality control is not likely to suffer

2583
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:24,099
from doing so I definitely think there's

2584
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:26,109
a some definite pitfalls with that I

2585
02:01:24,099 --> 02:01:28,110
mean some of the stories I've heard and

2586
02:01:26,109 --> 02:01:31,658
I'm sure you've heard plenty of them to

2587
02:01:28,109 --> 02:01:34,598
a lot of these big companies they don't

2588
02:01:31,658 --> 02:01:36,399
make their own seeds and a lot of times

2589
02:01:34,599 --> 02:01:40,409
you see people grow and some of their

2590
02:01:36,399 --> 02:01:44,289
seeds out and it is not even remotely as

2591
02:01:40,408 --> 02:01:45,879
advertised you know they're pretending

2592
02:01:44,289 --> 02:01:47,560
they're using or they're say and they're

2593
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:50,440
using this cut or that cut or the other

2594
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:51,789
and it doesn't resemble anything what

2595
02:01:50,439 --> 02:01:56,019
they're saying you know as far as

2596
02:01:51,789 --> 02:01:57,189
progeny goes I mean I don't mean

2597
02:01:56,020 --> 02:02:00,489
personally I don't believe in the

2598
02:01:57,189 --> 02:02:02,649
outsourcing at all myself but I know

2599
02:02:00,488 --> 02:02:04,718
most of the big companies do

2600
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:07,869
would you have exactly the kind of

2601
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:09,819
scaling up your operation to have like I

2602
02:02:07,869 --> 02:02:11,559
guess a bigger crew involved or do you

2603
02:02:09,819 --> 02:02:17,439
always want to keep it reasonably

2604
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:20,050
hands-on yourself I think as long as you

2605
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:24,579
know I have a good oversight on

2606
02:02:20,050 --> 02:02:27,610
everything I could probably you know

2607
02:02:24,579 --> 02:02:29,710
handle handle doing it with the crew and

2608
02:02:27,609 --> 02:02:31,779
as things you know progress at least

2609
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:34,239
here in California

2610
02:02:31,779 --> 02:02:37,630
I'm definitely needed you know gonna

2611
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:40,539
need to go that way I mean I have a

2612
02:02:37,630 --> 02:02:44,710
small crew now but you know ideally you

2613
02:02:40,539 --> 02:02:47,350
know you neither quite a large crew to

2614
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:51,310
go through the kind of numbers and you

2615
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:53,760
know doing as much of the research and

2616
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:56,080
development as I'd like to do so

2617
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:59,469
definitely gonna need you know a handful

2618
02:02:56,079 --> 02:03:01,510
growers and you know just workers and

2619
02:02:59,469 --> 02:03:05,260
all that kind of thing to to do a

2620
02:03:01,510 --> 02:03:07,030
project like that yeah okay and so you

2621
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:08,739
know we've mentioned a few times in the

2622
02:03:07,029 --> 02:03:11,050
episode already like the terpene content

2623
02:03:08,738 --> 02:03:13,658
of plants I'm noticing that terpene

2624
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:16,449
content seems to be quickly overtaking

2625
02:03:13,658 --> 02:03:18,698
in terms of like consumer preference the

2626
02:03:16,448 --> 02:03:20,229
idea of like THC percentages you know

2627
02:03:18,698 --> 02:03:21,908
it's like first THC percentages come

2628
02:03:20,229 --> 02:03:24,189
around people got hooked on that idea

2629
02:03:21,908 --> 02:03:25,839
now terpene percentages are out you know

2630
02:03:24,189 --> 02:03:28,149
more popular people seem to be late

2631
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:30,310
gaining traction readily like the idea

2632
02:03:28,149 --> 02:03:33,129
of let's get real high turbine strains

2633
02:03:30,310 --> 02:03:35,650
do you think that this is going to be a

2634
02:03:33,130 --> 02:03:37,719
lasting trend or just more of a fad

2635
02:03:35,649 --> 02:03:39,729
thing because I guess the underlying

2636
02:03:37,719 --> 02:03:42,429
kind of idea is that

2637
02:03:39,729 --> 02:03:44,859
at the end of the day as much as the

2638
02:03:42,429 --> 02:03:47,050
numbers of THC values you know may be

2639
02:03:44,859 --> 02:03:49,149
boosted or detracted from the popularity

2640
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:50,679
of certain strains people still kind of

2641
02:03:49,149 --> 02:03:52,509
agree that you know like it's just about

2642
02:03:50,679 --> 02:03:54,429
smoking it and like that's kind of the

2643
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:56,050
best measure at the end of the day do

2644
02:03:54,429 --> 02:03:58,029
you think that will probably apply to

2645
02:03:56,050 --> 02:04:01,090
the terpenes as well or you think it'll

2646
02:03:58,029 --> 02:04:03,550
be like a lasting thing I think it'll

2647
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:06,730
last at least very good Wow especially

2648
02:04:03,550 --> 02:04:09,550
considering a lot of the higher terpene

2649
02:04:06,729 --> 02:04:12,549
strains people are using for

2650
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:15,250
concentrates and so you don't even

2651
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:15,940
necessarily need that high of a THC to

2652
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:19,090
make a

2653
02:04:15,939 --> 02:04:22,719
you know high THC you know potent you

2654
02:04:19,090 --> 02:04:25,779
know concentrate and then so then all

2655
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:29,140
you need really is your you know high

2656
02:04:25,779 --> 02:04:31,029
terpene you know content so I think

2657
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:32,710
especially the way you know everybody's

2658
02:04:31,029 --> 02:04:36,609
going with you know the flavors and all

2659
02:04:32,710 --> 02:04:39,130
that you know it'll stick around for a

2660
02:04:36,609 --> 02:04:43,059
good while I think indeed buy into the

2661
02:04:39,130 --> 02:04:44,770
whole flavor game I love flavors you

2662
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:47,320
know otherwise you know I wouldn't have

2663
02:04:44,770 --> 02:04:52,390
a hundred different you know cut sitting

2664
02:04:47,319 --> 02:04:54,969
there my mother so I you know I love

2665
02:04:52,390 --> 02:04:59,619
oranges grapes you know apples you know

2666
02:04:54,969 --> 02:05:01,960
I have a all skunks me all the others

2667
02:04:59,619 --> 02:05:03,698
you know so is that something you strive

2668
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:06,430
for in the breeding like if you were to

2669
02:05:03,698 --> 02:05:08,139
kind of list the main attributes you're

2670
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:09,670
looking to breed when you do a project

2671
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:11,260
like you know like good structure good

2672
02:05:09,670 --> 02:05:13,989
yield you know all that type of stuff is

2673
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:16,710
a good flavor profile something you

2674
02:05:13,988 --> 02:05:23,459
highly value or not necessarily

2675
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:26,980
definitely my to my two criteria

2676
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:30,100
generally are effect you know and not

2677
02:05:26,979 --> 02:05:33,039
necessarily high THC but just quality

2678
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:35,920
effect for you know my chemistry and

2679
02:05:33,039 --> 02:05:39,850
then you know flavor you know

2680
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:42,909
so aside from that I I don't breed first

2681
02:05:39,850 --> 02:05:44,110
a sturdy fast-growing big plant you know

2682
02:05:42,909 --> 02:05:46,569
none of that kind of stuff

2683
02:05:44,109 --> 02:05:49,630
I want flavor and effect and everything

2684
02:05:46,569 --> 02:05:51,039
else if it falls in it's cool if not you

2685
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:55,359
know I got what I want

2686
02:05:51,039 --> 02:05:57,130
you know and so currently what plant is

2687
02:05:55,359 --> 02:05:58,839
the best example of that for you you

2688
02:05:57,130 --> 02:06:04,900
know what's your favorite plant in terms

2689
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:07,690
of flavor and affect my favorites in the

2690
02:06:04,899 --> 02:06:10,139
last couple years have mostly come out

2691
02:06:07,689 --> 02:06:15,819
of the the herbal hybrids

2692
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:18,310
I love phenotypes a lot of the oh gee oh

2693
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:25,619
geez times Arkell

2694
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:25,620
I like the chem dogs times Urkel and

2695
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:29,980
there's a couple others uh offhand I'm

2696
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:32,260
not

2697
02:06:29,979 --> 02:06:33,969
thinking of right now but uh those are

2698
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:37,420
definitely some of my favorites over the

2699
02:06:33,970 --> 02:06:40,630
last couple few years yeah yes I mean

2700
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:43,600
given you've done so many purple Urkel

2701
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:45,699
hybrids and public push hybrids what do

2702
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:47,110
you think is your favorite crosses

2703
02:06:45,699 --> 02:06:48,789
you've done out of all of those ones you

2704
02:06:47,109 --> 02:06:50,259
know out of the Bubba's what do you

2705
02:06:48,789 --> 02:06:51,488
think Baba paired with the best out of

2706
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:56,470
all the ones you made and the same

2707
02:06:51,488 --> 02:07:00,939
question for the Urkel the Oracle

2708
02:06:56,470 --> 02:07:04,750
definitely triangle cush that one just

2709
02:07:00,939 --> 02:07:09,099
spit out so money just you know you

2710
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:11,850
unique and just tasty phenotypes that's

2711
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:16,690
uh that's the easy one with the Bubba

2712
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:22,780
there was a handful of them what was

2713
02:07:16,689 --> 02:07:24,669
that one the Bubba um I like the bubble

2714
02:07:22,779 --> 02:07:30,099
bubble gum that one had a lot of nice

2715
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:36,460
ones it's been about three years since

2716
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:39,010
I've run all the lumps out so do you

2717
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:41,710
plan on restocking either the bubble or

2718
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:43,449
the purple cool feminized lines in the

2719
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:45,579
near future because I noticed when you

2720
02:07:43,449 --> 02:07:49,109
did that I think it was earlier this

2721
02:07:45,579 --> 02:07:51,729
year possibly even restock the lines

2722
02:07:49,109 --> 02:07:53,619
that was like the second batch he'd made

2723
02:07:51,729 --> 02:07:56,559
of them kind of so he's like at a third

2724
02:07:53,619 --> 02:08:00,099
in the work so to speak oh I I haven't

2725
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:04,030
restocked any and I just have you know a

2726
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:08,410
supply of what I have um yeah and I

2727
02:08:04,029 --> 02:08:11,710
don't plan on remaking any any of the

2728
02:08:08,409 --> 02:08:14,229
hybrids a lot of the ones I even you

2729
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:15,789
know sell aren't you know aren't

2730
02:08:14,229 --> 02:08:17,319
original they're not even anything new

2731
02:08:15,789 --> 02:08:20,439
you know other people have sold the same

2732
02:08:17,319 --> 02:08:24,159
exact ones I'm mostly making these for

2733
02:08:20,439 --> 02:08:26,189
myself and then you know I put them on

2734
02:08:24,159 --> 02:08:30,220
the market you know for other people too

2735
02:08:26,189 --> 02:08:35,169
but uh I I don't plan to remake any of

2736
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:37,390
them at most I like to you know go

2737
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:40,090
through large populations of the s1 and

2738
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:43,520
then I might you know make an s-1

2739
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:47,159
feminized hybrid that kind of refined

2740
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:49,380
you know the hybrids and maybe cross

2741
02:08:47,159 --> 02:08:52,470
those two you know some of the better

2742
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:57,449
ones that I liked from each round but as

2743
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:59,039
far as just remaking ya know okay are

2744
02:08:57,449 --> 02:09:02,039
there any special factors that go into

2745
02:08:59,039 --> 02:09:05,760
determining if a strain would be

2746
02:09:02,039 --> 02:09:06,989
specifically good for reversing so is it

2747
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:08,250
just the case that you just pick the

2748
02:09:06,989 --> 02:09:09,630
strain you want to reverse and that's

2749
02:09:08,250 --> 02:09:11,489
the one you want to reverse and that's

2750
02:09:09,630 --> 02:09:12,840
it or is it kind of like you look at a

2751
02:09:11,489 --> 02:09:14,429
whole bunch of strains and you think

2752
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:16,199
well there's a few characteristics in

2753
02:09:14,430 --> 02:09:22,200
this plant which would make it good as a

2754
02:09:16,199 --> 02:09:26,159
donor specifically well just start to

2755
02:09:22,199 --> 02:09:28,649
start with CSI I definitely kind of went

2756
02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:30,180
with trident cruise I'd reversed the

2757
02:09:28,649 --> 02:09:33,449
Bubba in 2006

2758
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:36,470
I pretty much reversed herckel in 2002

2759
02:09:33,449 --> 02:09:38,819
you know just with the accidental thing

2760
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:43,079
you know and saw what it could produce

2761
02:09:38,819 --> 02:09:45,059
and really liked the results so I was

2762
02:09:43,079 --> 02:09:49,140
basically building off a stuff I already

2763
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:55,230
knew and had already done so I I knew it

2764
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:57,480
was quality stuff you know with the with

2765
02:09:55,229 --> 02:09:59,819
the future future lines it's definitely

2766
02:09:57,479 --> 02:10:01,799
uh you know some of the ones I reverse I

2767
02:09:59,819 --> 02:10:04,889
definitely might not even release

2768
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:09,470
because they might not produce you know

2769
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:11,820
but I hope they would you know yeah okay

2770
02:10:09,470 --> 02:10:14,610
and so if we just jump back to the labs

2771
02:10:11,819 --> 02:10:16,409
for a moment where don't lab sit for you

2772
02:10:14,609 --> 02:10:18,929
do you use them at all not not

2773
02:10:16,409 --> 02:10:20,939
interested in the percentages do you

2774
02:10:18,930 --> 02:10:24,720
feel percentages are just overinflated

2775
02:10:20,939 --> 02:10:32,639
at the moment my buddy works for one of

2776
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:36,570
the more legit labs and he well his lab

2777
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:40,140
tends to test a lot lower percentages

2778
02:10:36,569 --> 02:10:41,519
than some of these inflated labs that

2779
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:43,680
most people want to get their stuff

2780
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:47,850
tested at which is one of the reasons

2781
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:50,430
why I don't generally you know use that

2782
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:54,480
as a proponent of my advertising

2783
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:56,760
campaign because something the test you

2784
02:10:54,479 --> 02:11:00,359
know for me at 20% well

2785
02:10:56,760 --> 02:11:04,980
test another lab at 25 or you know 26

2786
02:11:00,359 --> 02:11:08,250
percent so you know I definitely take

2787
02:11:04,979 --> 02:11:11,879
all that data because through it through

2788
02:11:08,250 --> 02:11:17,479
my buddy you know we test all the the

2789
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:20,250
cannabinoids and the terpenes but uh I

2790
02:11:17,479 --> 02:11:23,250
don't exactly you know release the data

2791
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:26,908
because you know all that yeah

2792
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:30,029
secret sauce so how do you feel about

2793
02:11:26,908 --> 02:11:31,618
the whole kind of increase in popularity

2794
02:11:30,029 --> 02:11:33,719
of like getting everything file or

2795
02:11:31,618 --> 02:11:35,578
sequence are you a proponent of it are

2796
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:40,010
you against it I've heard there's kind

2797
02:11:35,578 --> 02:11:43,349
of two camps on the whole idea right um

2798
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:46,289
I'd like to get some things follow

2799
02:11:43,349 --> 02:11:49,949
sequence but you know Philo's approached

2800
02:11:46,288 --> 02:11:55,500
me a few times over the last couple of

2801
02:11:49,948 --> 02:11:58,799
years and I've been adamant I mean

2802
02:11:55,500 --> 02:12:02,729
they'll test anything I got for $300 a

2803
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:04,860
club I'm like hot pan for you know you

2804
02:12:02,729 --> 02:12:07,649
to tell me what I heard you know you

2805
02:12:04,859 --> 02:12:11,130
know honestly they don't even have a

2806
02:12:07,649 --> 02:12:13,589
complete system because I'll they don't

2807
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:15,809
have the base clones to begin with on a

2808
02:12:13,590 --> 02:12:18,569
lot of things I mean unless they have a

2809
02:12:15,809 --> 02:12:20,309
legitimate you know chem dog 91 to start

2810
02:12:18,569 --> 02:12:22,380
their galaxy with unless they have a

2811
02:12:20,309 --> 02:12:26,429
triangle cush to start their oh gee cush

2812
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:29,159
galaxy you know yeah if they don't have

2813
02:12:26,429 --> 02:12:31,710
the core tissue that's responsible for

2814
02:12:29,158 --> 02:12:33,750
all these hybrids then they don't have a

2815
02:12:31,710 --> 02:12:37,078
galaxy you know I mean I've got a bunch

2816
02:12:33,750 --> 02:12:39,479
of tissue you know the the 91 the TK the

2817
02:12:37,078 --> 02:12:42,118
you know the Mendo purple the the

2818
02:12:39,479 --> 02:12:45,149
original Oracle you know all of which

2819
02:12:42,118 --> 02:12:47,630
you know can can be at the core of

2820
02:12:45,149 --> 02:12:50,638
certain galaxies but if they're you know

2821
02:12:47,630 --> 02:12:54,900
galaxies don't include those they're not

2822
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:58,199
gonna be accurate you know and so I've

2823
02:12:54,899 --> 02:13:00,328
heard that there was certain people who

2824
02:12:58,198 --> 02:13:02,428
feel like you shouldn't get it done

2825
02:13:00,328 --> 02:13:05,788
because if you get the sequencing done

2826
02:13:02,429 --> 02:13:08,130
you lose the ability to like patent or

2827
02:13:05,788 --> 02:13:09,779
you know like claim ownership over the

2828
02:13:08,130 --> 02:13:10,588
plant because when it's in like the

2829
02:13:09,779 --> 02:13:12,389
public domain

2830
02:13:10,588 --> 02:13:14,309
it's you know it's no longer yours to

2831
02:13:12,389 --> 02:13:16,078
claim have you had anything like that

2832
02:13:14,309 --> 02:13:17,429
and and if it were true would that be

2833
02:13:16,078 --> 02:13:19,408
something that put you off it or do you

2834
02:13:17,429 --> 02:13:21,149
think that you know like the idea of

2835
02:13:19,408 --> 02:13:22,878
trying to claim ownership of a plane's a

2836
02:13:21,149 --> 02:13:26,069
bit silly

2837
02:13:22,878 --> 02:13:28,469
that's exactly kind of how I feel I mean

2838
02:13:26,069 --> 02:13:33,389
I know there's definitely cats doing

2839
02:13:28,469 --> 02:13:38,069
that and I think it's ridiculous you

2840
02:13:33,389 --> 02:13:41,368
know but you know how it is you can't

2841
02:13:38,069 --> 02:13:43,079
stop progress and so how do you feel

2842
02:13:41,368 --> 02:13:45,179
about I guess you know the somewhat

2843
02:13:43,078 --> 02:13:46,618
controversial subject or just the

2844
02:13:45,179 --> 02:13:48,328
controversy this idea has been

2845
02:13:46,618 --> 02:13:50,398
surrounded and in that seeking

2846
02:13:48,328 --> 02:13:52,139
permission to bring you the strain from

2847
02:13:50,399 --> 02:13:53,699
someone else before you use it you know

2848
02:13:52,139 --> 02:13:55,139
how do you feel about that do someone

2849
02:13:53,698 --> 02:13:57,688
have to heat you up if they want to use

2850
02:13:55,139 --> 02:14:00,179
one of your mails for money Australians

2851
02:13:57,689 --> 02:14:02,010
in like a strain that they're gonna then

2852
02:14:00,179 --> 02:14:05,668
go and so or where do you sit on that

2853
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:08,189
whole issue it definitely is a matter of

2854
02:14:05,668 --> 02:14:11,488
respect you know I definitely appreciate

2855
02:14:08,189 --> 02:14:13,550
it you know I don't view it as necessary

2856
02:14:11,488 --> 02:14:16,678
I don't look at my seeds as possessions

2857
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:19,949
especially if they're sold but even if

2858
02:14:16,679 --> 02:14:24,809
they're given you know I'm very adamant

2859
02:14:19,948 --> 02:14:26,458
on if I give somebody something and you

2860
02:14:24,809 --> 02:14:26,819
know there's restrictions or anything on

2861
02:14:26,458 --> 02:14:31,108
it

2862
02:14:26,819 --> 02:14:34,530
I'll tell them straight up but uh you

2863
02:14:31,109 --> 02:14:37,109
know otherwise people are free to you

2864
02:14:34,529 --> 02:14:39,208
know work with gifts and especially

2865
02:14:37,109 --> 02:14:41,760
bought seed to their heart's content I

2866
02:14:39,208 --> 02:14:45,358
just think you know um it's definitely

2867
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:49,019
respectful to ask ask breeders and you

2868
02:14:45,359 --> 02:14:51,780
know the sources uh you know approval if

2869
02:14:49,019 --> 02:14:54,449
you want to work with their stuff yeah

2870
02:14:51,779 --> 02:14:57,179
okay and so just to play devil's

2871
02:14:54,448 --> 02:14:59,398
advocate what would you do if you wanted

2872
02:14:57,179 --> 02:15:01,078
to use a mat let's just what would you

2873
02:14:59,399 --> 02:15:03,419
do is tell me he'll hit you out and said

2874
02:15:01,078 --> 02:15:04,858
hey hey I just changed my mind on the PT

2875
02:15:03,418 --> 02:15:07,529
K and I actually don't want you to use

2876
02:15:04,859 --> 02:15:09,679
it do you think at that point you know

2877
02:15:07,529 --> 02:15:14,578
that respect should go so far as to like

2878
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:17,248
caning the project right um that would

2879
02:15:14,578 --> 02:15:20,219
be a tough one that would be a tough one

2880
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:22,550
I would definitely respect Tom and and

2881
02:15:20,219 --> 02:15:24,409
and his wishes for sure

2882
02:15:22,550 --> 02:15:26,810
you know because

2883
02:15:24,409 --> 02:15:31,699
you know I just think that's how we

2884
02:15:26,810 --> 02:15:34,250
should all be you know ask for you know

2885
02:15:31,699 --> 02:15:37,220
the ptk my number one goal is just for

2886
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:40,220
preservation of the pierc'd line I mean

2887
02:15:37,220 --> 02:15:43,369
that's above and beyond anything else

2888
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:47,510
that stems of it is just a bonus but you

2889
02:15:43,369 --> 02:15:51,140
know honestly I think Tom just as an

2890
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:54,320
example is is one of those people who

2891
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:56,420
kind of understand he doesn't hold any

2892
02:15:54,319 --> 02:16:00,019
of those lines as his possessions I

2893
02:15:56,420 --> 02:16:03,050
think he he views them as he was just a

2894
02:16:00,020 --> 02:16:05,240
keeper of those genetics for for his

2895
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:08,000
time I mean and that's how I view things

2896
02:16:05,239 --> 02:16:09,319
you know we're all just keepers you know

2897
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,479
for fora

2898
02:16:09,319 --> 02:16:13,099
you know as long as we are a keeper and

2899
02:16:11,479 --> 02:16:16,129
then it needs to go on to the next

2900
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:18,350
person you know yeah but you know

2901
02:16:16,130 --> 02:16:21,199
there's plenty of people who are you

2902
02:16:18,350 --> 02:16:23,240
know opportunists and you know they get

2903
02:16:21,199 --> 02:16:26,359
ten seeds from somebody and it's off to

2904
02:16:23,239 --> 02:16:28,550
the races to make that next hybrid or

2905
02:16:26,359 --> 02:16:32,569
just reproduce it and sell it you know

2906
02:16:28,550 --> 02:16:34,579
yeah yep you know I saw the funniest

2907
02:16:32,569 --> 02:16:36,229
made the other day it's like I was like

2908
02:16:34,579 --> 02:16:38,300
a guy like trying to start a seed coming

2909
02:16:36,229 --> 02:16:42,829
it's like I need kind of Girl Scout

2910
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:47,059
cookies and a ten pack of seeds and it's

2911
02:16:42,829 --> 02:16:49,341
true yeah it's good one so who are some

2912
02:16:47,059 --> 02:16:50,899
of the breeders who you really enjoy the

2913
02:16:49,341 --> 02:16:53,360
work of or you know you really think

2914
02:16:50,899 --> 02:16:56,449
highly if their work and even maybe go

2915
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:58,040
so far as to be like their stuff is you

2916
02:16:56,450 --> 02:17:00,079
know like I feel they follow similar

2917
02:16:58,040 --> 02:17:01,580
ethics to I do and I would even be happy

2918
02:17:00,079 --> 02:17:05,841
to possibly do a project with them

2919
02:17:01,579 --> 02:17:09,229
because I could meet I die on that right

2920
02:17:05,841 --> 02:17:12,200
I mean I'm not shy about you know my

2921
02:17:09,229 --> 02:17:15,319
favorite Raiders and I like to consider

2922
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:18,500
my favorite readers friends I'm

2923
02:17:15,319 --> 02:17:21,110
definitely a huge fan of Bodie I mean

2924
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:24,680
he's he's he's one of the best in my

2925
02:17:21,110 --> 02:17:28,520
book Mean Gene

2926
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:30,559
you know he's rock solid you know if

2927
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:32,000
there's a spot where he could make an

2928
02:17:30,559 --> 02:17:35,439
extra buck he's gonna tell you the truth

2929
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:38,739
and lose that buck over over that dollar

2930
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:42,770
which you know I definitely can respect

2931
02:17:38,739 --> 02:17:45,380
so you know guys like that who just have

2932
02:17:42,770 --> 02:17:48,501
that you know integrity and just honesty

2933
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:49,639
and just you know they're not just

2934
02:17:48,501 --> 02:17:52,370
looking out for that dollar and

2935
02:17:49,639 --> 02:17:55,639
themselves um those are definitely the

2936
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:58,251
you know my favorite readers and the

2937
02:17:55,639 --> 02:18:01,609
ones I you know look up to yeah okay and

2938
02:17:58,251 --> 02:18:03,319
so and if you were just a grower or free

2939
02:18:01,610 --> 02:18:05,540
or maybe a better way to put it is if

2940
02:18:03,319 --> 02:18:08,569
you lost your whole collection as it

2941
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:10,461
were seeds clones everything and all you

2942
02:18:08,569 --> 02:18:12,139
had to name was like you know like 150

2943
02:18:10,460 --> 02:18:14,510
bucks so basically you can buy like one

2944
02:18:12,139 --> 02:18:19,430
packet of seeds which pack would you try

2945
02:18:14,510 --> 02:18:21,790
to restart the Empire do you drive a

2946
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:21,790
hard bargain

2947
02:18:23,171 --> 02:18:29,630
one pack does this include I don't have

2948
02:18:27,710 --> 02:18:33,199
any friends anymore no no it's gonna

2949
02:18:29,630 --> 02:18:39,229
help yeah you should have a vodka oh so

2950
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:41,120
well huh oh shoot that's a really good

2951
02:18:39,229 --> 02:18:47,389
question um mmm

2952
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:49,461
oh shoot no no no good was like I'll go

2953
02:18:47,389 --> 02:18:54,409
it's like some gelato times wedding cake

2954
02:18:49,460 --> 02:18:55,539
no money quick yeah then I can afford

2955
02:18:54,409 --> 02:18:59,860
more back

2956
02:18:55,540 --> 02:19:02,780
that's pretty the best answer ever so

2957
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:05,810
kind of relating what would your advice

2958
02:19:02,780 --> 02:19:08,091
be to a newly emerging breeder more

2959
02:19:05,809 --> 02:19:10,880
specifically when should someone feel

2960
02:19:08,091 --> 02:19:12,649
comfortable to not only release but that

2961
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:15,619
they can feel comfortable charging for

2962
02:19:12,649 --> 02:19:16,609
the work and you know like no and I'm

2963
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:17,841
not talking about like you know you just

2964
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:18,980
make some seeds and give them to your

2965
02:19:17,841 --> 02:19:21,050
friend like that's cool but like when

2966
02:19:18,979 --> 02:19:22,579
should you feel confident that you have

2967
02:19:21,050 --> 02:19:24,079
done the adequate work to be able to

2968
02:19:22,579 --> 02:19:25,700
approach a seed bank and be like look

2969
02:19:24,079 --> 02:19:27,440
you know you know maybe you could

2970
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:28,881
consider the stocking my stuff and I

2971
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:31,010
feel like it's of high enough quality

2972
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:33,079
you know like you should they wait a

2973
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:36,739
certain time like or we know what what's

2974
02:19:33,079 --> 02:19:39,110
your advice in general well just from

2975
02:19:36,739 --> 02:19:44,841
what I've seen you know at least in the

2976
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:47,450
present present time you you know I'm

2977
02:19:44,841 --> 02:19:50,970
not gonna stop anybody from breeding or

2978
02:19:47,450 --> 02:19:53,489
you know creating a seed

2979
02:19:50,969 --> 02:19:57,028
company or gone with it you know with

2980
02:19:53,488 --> 02:19:58,978
even limited experience just because it

2981
02:19:57,029 --> 02:20:04,829
seems these days that's more about

2982
02:19:58,978 --> 02:20:07,349
branding you know than anything else but

2983
02:20:04,829 --> 02:20:12,299
in the future hopefully the bar gets

2984
02:20:07,350 --> 02:20:14,909
raised to where you know you actually

2985
02:20:12,299 --> 02:20:18,509
need to really be a professional grower

2986
02:20:14,909 --> 02:20:20,988
one and really have a strong

2987
02:20:18,510 --> 02:20:24,540
understanding of the cannabis plant and

2988
02:20:20,988 --> 02:20:26,039
you know how it breeds and you know what

2989
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:29,160
to even look for when you're doing

2990
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:31,770
selections you know hmm in the future

2991
02:20:29,159 --> 02:20:35,129
and so do you think breeders who come to

2992
02:20:31,770 --> 02:20:37,770
the market with like you know one parent

2993
02:20:35,129 --> 02:20:39,809
from top dog and one parent from Pirates

2994
02:20:37,770 --> 02:20:42,210
of the Emerald triangle and I've made a

2995
02:20:39,809 --> 02:20:43,920
whole bunch of f1 guys do you think

2996
02:20:42,209 --> 02:20:45,568
that's like there there's a place for

2997
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:47,579
that like or do you think people should

2998
02:20:45,568 --> 02:20:49,799
be like looking to you know maybe do

2999
02:20:47,579 --> 02:20:51,629
more work than that like and more

3000
02:20:49,799 --> 02:20:53,429
importantly I guess my other question is

3001
02:20:51,629 --> 02:20:56,039
do you think that it's a bit of a

3002
02:20:53,430 --> 02:20:57,779
cop-out for someone to maybe develop a

3003
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:59,279
male and by that I mean like it's not

3004
02:20:57,779 --> 02:21:01,500
just an f1 maybe they've even taken it

3005
02:20:59,279 --> 02:21:02,939
to the f2 or like made an f1 and cross

3006
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:04,170
it to another one of their strengths you

3007
02:21:02,939 --> 02:21:06,689
know like they've got some ownership

3008
02:21:04,170 --> 02:21:08,728
over it but then they've just got that -

3009
02:21:06,689 --> 02:21:10,050
like 10 cloner emily's and that's their

3010
02:21:08,728 --> 02:21:16,079
whole offering you know like how do you

3011
02:21:10,049 --> 02:21:18,599
feel about that I mean in in in today's

3012
02:21:16,079 --> 02:21:25,799
world I think it's you know par for the

3013
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:31,079
course you know it is what it is it's

3014
02:21:25,799 --> 02:21:34,199
not ideal but there's cool stuff to be

3015
02:21:31,079 --> 02:21:35,549
found and you know lots of the hybrids

3016
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:39,090
and some that you wouldn't even think

3017
02:21:35,549 --> 02:21:44,309
you know would turn out you know really

3018
02:21:39,090 --> 02:21:46,020
well so yeah I definitely have a

3019
02:21:44,309 --> 02:21:48,269
different perspective than I used to I

3020
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:51,390
used to have more of a purist idealist

3021
02:21:48,270 --> 02:21:54,659
perspective and now it's like well

3022
02:21:51,389 --> 02:21:56,549
there's 101 ways to do it and you know

3023
02:21:54,659 --> 02:21:58,950
it's up to the consumer to choose you

3024
02:21:56,549 --> 02:22:02,039
know who they want to support yeah okay

3025
02:21:58,950 --> 02:22:04,800
and so last little question for this

3026
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:14,670
segment if you could only hang on to one

3027
02:22:04,799 --> 02:22:20,608
and you've kindly got which one just one

3028
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:22,469
yeah if you want you do 300k hello if

3029
02:22:20,609 --> 02:22:31,439
you're giving me three I'd probably hold

3030
02:22:22,469 --> 02:22:32,219
on to triangle cush Kim dog 91 and three

3031
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:38,180
still lemony

3032
02:22:32,219 --> 02:22:41,010
I like or Kalam endo purple both but uh

3033
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:42,180
I'd probably I'd probably have to stick

3034
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:46,978
with the Mendo purple

3035
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:49,020
hi Daddy edges the echo yeah I mean the

3036
02:22:46,978 --> 02:22:51,750
circle breeds better but there's there's

3037
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:53,550
a lot of potential in that Mendo so yeah

3038
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:55,559
yeah well somebody I think that's

3039
02:22:53,549 --> 02:22:59,038
something maybe a lot of people wouldn't

3040
02:22:55,559 --> 02:23:01,260
necessarily think off the bat mmm-hmm

3041
02:22:59,039 --> 02:23:03,899
it's also personal preference not

3042
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:05,550
everybody's gonna share it yeah okay and

3043
02:23:03,898 --> 02:23:07,288
I mean just out of curiosity do you find

3044
02:23:05,549 --> 02:23:09,500
one is more indica leaning than the

3045
02:23:07,289 --> 02:23:13,250
other or they're both about the same Oh

3046
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:15,898
in the ER Cole is definitely more indica

3047
02:23:13,250 --> 02:23:18,000
the the Mendo purple is more of a

3048
02:23:15,898 --> 02:23:21,930
daytime type of thing oh really

3049
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:27,959
um yeah it's just it's it's terpenes are

3050
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:30,869
just you know we next bunch of questions

3051
02:23:27,959 --> 02:23:33,000
were once submitted by our fans first

3052
02:23:30,869 --> 02:23:34,850
one what's your preferred method for

3053
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,068
selfing I guess they mean you know like

3054
02:23:34,850 --> 02:23:41,340
thiosulfate so colloidal silver what's

3055
02:23:38,068 --> 02:23:46,799
your route I always do silver

3056
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:49,380
thiosulfate just because it's easiest

3057
02:23:46,799 --> 02:23:52,769
you only have to spray them two or three

3058
02:23:49,379 --> 02:23:54,358
times at most versus colloidal where you

3059
02:23:52,770 --> 02:23:58,828
pretty much have to scram every day or

3060
02:23:54,359 --> 02:24:01,170
something like that and what time period

3061
02:23:58,828 --> 02:24:02,818
do you spray the plants because I know

3062
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:05,100
that some think which kind of varies a

3063
02:24:02,818 --> 02:24:08,778
little bit like you spray them before

3064
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:12,300
the other females get in there during

3065
02:24:08,779 --> 02:24:15,328
usually a lot of times you have to spray

3066
02:24:12,299 --> 02:24:18,209
your target female about two weeks

3067
02:24:15,328 --> 02:24:20,699
before so you have to flower her

3068
02:24:18,209 --> 02:24:23,579
two weeks in advance of the rest of the

3069
02:24:20,699 --> 02:24:25,710
plants spray her at trigger you know and

3070
02:24:23,579 --> 02:24:29,930
then when the other plants get in

3071
02:24:25,709 --> 02:24:32,719
I generally spray spray her again and

3072
02:24:29,930 --> 02:24:36,659
lately I've been doing a thing where I

3073
02:24:32,719 --> 02:24:42,228
tend to spray every ten days so just to

3074
02:24:36,659 --> 02:24:48,029
make sure you know she she stays a he

3075
02:24:42,228 --> 02:24:50,039
yeah so if you if you spray when you

3076
02:24:48,029 --> 02:24:52,949
trigger you're not gonna be getting

3077
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:56,760
pollen until about five to six weeks

3078
02:24:52,949 --> 02:24:58,350
into flower generally but if you spray

3079
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:59,850
two weeks in advance you're getting that

3080
02:24:58,350 --> 02:25:04,890
pollen between three and four weeks

3081
02:24:59,850 --> 02:25:08,189
which is you know I do yep yep okay and

3082
02:25:04,889 --> 02:25:09,930
so have you ever did you keep the Dyna

3083
02:25:08,189 --> 02:25:11,460
plant completely segregated or have you

3084
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:13,199
found that it can be in the same room

3085
02:25:11,459 --> 02:25:14,909
and you give it a spray and it doesn't

3086
02:25:13,199 --> 02:25:17,760
have impact on the other plants in the

3087
02:25:14,909 --> 02:25:20,100
room yeah I just make sure not to get

3088
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:22,370
any of the spray on the other girls yeah

3089
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:27,510
yeah and it's just fun same room

3090
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:30,870
fantastic so de femme Anaya seeds have a

3091
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:35,340
place in breeding as mothers in order to

3092
02:25:30,870 --> 02:25:37,620
create rag seeds from there oh yeah oh

3093
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:39,659
definitely I mean you know I don't want

3094
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:43,649
to give out all my trade secrets but I

3095
02:25:39,659 --> 02:25:46,680
mean half the reason I you know reverse

3096
02:25:43,648 --> 02:25:50,278
my lines is so I can isolate my favorite

3097
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:54,600
parts of each plant so I'm looking to

3098
02:25:50,279 --> 02:25:57,569
you know pull out my favorite you know

3099
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:59,370
examples of a plant through the S ones

3100
02:25:57,568 --> 02:26:02,068
and actually breathe further into the

3101
02:25:59,370 --> 02:26:04,319
future you know not only with you know

3102
02:26:02,068 --> 02:26:08,010
s2s and everything but you know with

3103
02:26:04,318 --> 02:26:12,930
regular seed out crossings with s ones

3104
02:26:08,010 --> 02:26:14,790
and s2 s so okay I definitely think yeah

3105
02:26:12,930 --> 02:26:16,889
and I think we've already kind of

3106
02:26:14,790 --> 02:26:26,420
touched on this but just now the point

3107
02:26:16,889 --> 02:26:29,250
home what is your favorite camp well for

3108
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:31,379
for raw power and smoking I think the D

3109
02:26:29,250 --> 02:26:34,200
is really good but for

3110
02:26:31,379 --> 02:26:37,559
you know a purist and from an idealist

3111
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:40,350
perspective the 91 is the only one I

3112
02:26:37,559 --> 02:26:41,760
really you know one a long-term breed

3113
02:26:40,350 --> 02:26:45,450
with because I think it's the original

3114
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:47,909
mother source of all the camps it just

3115
02:26:45,450 --> 02:26:51,689
as a follow-up from myself do you

3116
02:26:47,909 --> 02:26:54,270
believe that with the right partner the

3117
02:26:51,689 --> 02:26:56,340
chem 91 could produce some seeds which

3118
02:26:54,270 --> 02:26:58,890
rival its potency or do you think that

3119
02:26:56,340 --> 02:27:00,540
in itself is kind of like the one in a

3120
02:26:58,889 --> 02:27:02,760
million in terms of its potency and it's

3121
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:07,590
quite unlikely you'll get stuff as

3122
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:11,760
potent from it in seed form well if you

3123
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:14,579
think the chem D is if you think the

3124
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:16,770
long lines it is it's a most likely a

3125
02:27:14,579 --> 02:27:19,409
feminized hybrid of the ninety-one

3126
02:27:16,770 --> 02:27:23,220
itself it's a lot stronger than the

3127
02:27:19,409 --> 02:27:27,590
ninety one a lot of the chem 91 hybrids

3128
02:27:23,219 --> 02:27:34,579
I've personally bred they test higher

3129
02:27:27,590 --> 02:27:37,500
then the the original chem 91 so I think

3130
02:27:34,579 --> 02:27:40,139
you know there there's a lot stronger

3131
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:42,239
potency held within this genes and

3132
02:27:40,139 --> 02:27:45,239
generally is expressed through the cut

3133
02:27:42,239 --> 02:27:47,129
it so yeah okay and so we touched on

3134
02:27:45,239 --> 02:27:50,539
Humboldt snow would be - oh yeah do you

3135
02:27:47,129 --> 02:27:54,029
happen to know the origins of it Jose

3136
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:59,760
well on the the guys I've been talking

3137
02:27:54,030 --> 02:28:03,090
to seem to seem to seem to think that it

3138
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:08,130
originally came from the Eugene area up

3139
02:28:03,090 --> 02:28:11,040
in Oregon and they're saying that well

3140
02:28:08,129 --> 02:28:14,759
it's it's essentially the the same as

3141
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:18,899
Oregon snow but they they're they're

3142
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:22,010
saying that it's most likely a bag seed

3143
02:28:18,898 --> 02:28:24,389
another essential a a bag seed but

3144
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:29,639
possibly like a feminized hybrid or

3145
02:28:24,389 --> 02:28:32,189
selfing of the Fairfax for way I'm

3146
02:28:29,639 --> 02:28:36,629
looking to you know kind of look into

3147
02:28:32,189 --> 02:28:38,909
that a bit further myself but it seems

3148
02:28:36,629 --> 02:28:42,959
like it has a lot of potential and I've

3149
02:28:38,909 --> 02:28:44,770
had I've heard multiple you know stories

3150
02:28:42,959 --> 02:28:47,289
from multiple sources

3151
02:28:44,770 --> 02:28:50,020
that seemed a point in you know some

3152
02:28:47,290 --> 02:28:52,870
some version of that direction so yeah

3153
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:54,840
awesome I just want to also you know add

3154
02:28:52,870 --> 02:29:00,600
to that the Fairfax far away of course

3155
02:28:54,840 --> 02:29:04,360
it's a basically a Pakistani Afghani

3156
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:06,430
Indian crossed to skunk number one so

3157
02:29:04,360 --> 02:29:09,850
it's three landraces and then skunk

3158
02:29:06,430 --> 02:29:13,149
number one so yeah yeah have you grown

3159
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:15,100
it out no not yet but I'm looking

3160
02:29:13,149 --> 02:29:16,930
forward to yeah oh that's a have you got

3161
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:20,290
you got so you know someone who's got it

3162
02:29:16,930 --> 02:29:22,989
cuz it's definitely around yeah yeah no

3163
02:29:20,290 --> 02:29:24,250
it's definitely around ivy with it also

3164
02:29:22,989 --> 02:29:27,219
awesome because what's interesting about

3165
02:29:24,250 --> 02:29:29,889
that one is Bob Hemphill had said that

3166
02:29:27,219 --> 02:29:32,859
in his opinion he felt the four-way had

3167
02:29:29,889 --> 02:29:34,930
degraded over the years more so than the

3168
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:37,720
chem 91 and

3169
02:29:34,930 --> 02:29:40,329
however before the four-way was popped

3170
02:29:37,719 --> 02:29:41,289
in 95 I think he said and so what he was

3171
02:29:40,329 --> 02:29:43,978
trying to get it was like it had

3172
02:29:41,290 --> 02:29:46,570
degraded more so in less amount of time

3173
02:29:43,978 --> 02:29:48,789
have you got any experience with that do

3174
02:29:46,569 --> 02:29:51,069
you have any cuts which maybe aren't as

3175
02:29:48,790 --> 02:29:53,530
old as the chem 91 but in your opinion

3176
02:29:51,069 --> 02:29:57,478
they've degraded more significantly than

3177
02:29:53,530 --> 02:29:57,479
it has in you know a shorter time frame

3178
02:29:57,930 --> 02:30:07,780
you know most of the old cuts I have are

3179
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:09,309
fairly solid except I don't know that's

3180
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:11,530
a whole different discussion with the

3181
02:30:09,309 --> 02:30:13,930
whole dud thing I don't know if people

3182
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:16,239
are referring to kind of a dud thing or

3183
02:30:13,930 --> 02:30:19,180
if they're just talking about you know

3184
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:21,760
lesser degradation I think they'd be

3185
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:23,559
like that just as time goes by the end

3186
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:25,329
product is just not as good as it once

3187
02:30:23,559 --> 02:30:29,439
used to be even though it's been grown

3188
02:30:25,329 --> 02:30:32,440
quite well right right yeah i don't know

3189
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:34,600
i don't know i mean the the snow i've

3190
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:37,690
held for almost twenty years still

3191
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:40,989
produces the same exact you know you

3192
02:30:37,690 --> 02:30:43,989
know quality that i remember 20 years

3193
02:30:40,989 --> 02:30:45,610
ago yeah I think maybe let the caveat

3194
02:30:43,989 --> 02:30:47,860
that's placed on that conversation is

3195
02:30:45,610 --> 02:30:49,360
that it's totally dependent on like how

3196
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:51,760
the plants are stored so if you're like

3197
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:53,620
a cash crop up and you don't really put

3198
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:55,239
much time or effort into your mother

3199
02:30:53,620 --> 02:30:57,790
room it's just literally serving a

3200
02:30:55,239 --> 02:30:58,539
purpose of like taking clones you know

3201
02:30:57,790 --> 02:31:00,819
what I mean like

3202
02:30:58,539 --> 02:31:02,679
years like those kind of neglected

3203
02:31:00,818 --> 02:31:05,109
conditions is what leads to it whereas

3204
02:31:02,679 --> 02:31:06,398
you may just not see that whatsoever

3205
02:31:05,109 --> 02:31:07,859
because you don't put them in those

3206
02:31:06,398 --> 02:31:10,628
conditions whatsoever

3207
02:31:07,859 --> 02:31:13,299
right right oh my mom get treated a

3208
02:31:10,629 --> 02:31:15,039
little rough okay maybe there's hope for

3209
02:31:13,299 --> 02:31:18,969
all for all of us out there who need to

3210
02:31:15,039 --> 02:31:21,668
improve our mother stations right so

3211
02:31:18,968 --> 02:31:25,288
next question what information can you

3212
02:31:21,668 --> 02:31:25,289
give us on the big bad Baba

3213
02:31:26,369 --> 02:31:31,899
which one's the big bad but quickly I

3214
02:31:30,248 --> 02:31:35,738
think it's is it one of your crosses I

3215
02:31:31,898 --> 02:31:41,468
think it's like Kim D yeah

3216
02:31:35,738 --> 02:31:47,378
hi ROG Kim D it's crossed Oh Baba it's

3217
02:31:41,468 --> 02:31:50,348
just a just a high quality you know

3218
02:31:47,379 --> 02:31:53,759
hybrid of the three that I've give away

3219
02:31:50,349 --> 02:31:57,369
for free yeah it went under another name

3220
02:31:53,759 --> 02:32:01,058
okay it went under another name the fire

3221
02:31:57,369 --> 02:32:03,219
oh gee Kim D and I just give it away for

3222
02:32:01,058 --> 02:32:06,429
free because I had the seeds and it's

3223
02:32:03,218 --> 02:32:09,638
quality but I don't exactly want to give

3224
02:32:06,429 --> 02:32:16,270
credit to the fellow who it came from

3225
02:32:09,638 --> 02:32:18,488
okay all right so next question when did

3226
02:32:16,270 --> 02:32:20,078
you get your Baba cot and who was it

3227
02:32:18,488 --> 02:32:24,759
from and what do you think Baba is

3228
02:32:20,078 --> 02:32:29,939
exactly genetically okay so I got my

3229
02:32:24,759 --> 02:32:34,238
Bubba in 2005 from my buddy 707 C bank

3230
02:32:29,939 --> 02:32:37,389
he goes by the names CRS skunk and sha

3231
02:32:34,238 --> 02:32:39,759
bud you know on the various forums and

3232
02:32:37,388 --> 02:32:43,028
he's been on the forums I think longer

3233
02:32:39,759 --> 02:32:47,709
than I have so I got that from him in

3234
02:32:43,029 --> 02:32:52,319
2005 and he's had it since at least 2000

3235
02:32:47,709 --> 02:32:54,759
if not a little little earlier than that

3236
02:32:52,318 --> 02:32:58,058
Archive got the same Bubba from him as

3237
02:32:54,759 --> 02:32:59,978
well and a handful of other cats and his

3238
02:32:58,058 --> 02:33:05,378
was sourced you know down around the LA

3239
02:32:59,978 --> 02:33:11,918
area from a glassblower buddy you know

3240
02:33:05,379 --> 02:33:12,400
17 years ago and I I believe it's you

3241
02:33:11,918 --> 02:33:15,579
know

3242
02:33:12,399 --> 02:33:17,440
just straight from you know Josh and

3243
02:33:15,579 --> 02:33:19,870
Matt's you know

3244
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:22,149
extended circle down there didn't do

3245
02:33:19,870 --> 02:33:24,370
believe that whole story that the

3246
02:33:22,149 --> 02:33:26,260
parents was a straight court Baba and

3247
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:28,360
they crossed it to the og or do you

3248
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:32,620
think that's maybe not entirely accurate

3249
02:33:28,360 --> 02:33:34,989
I think that's probably it is accurate

3250
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:36,730
is anything I mean at first I didn't

3251
02:33:34,989 --> 02:33:39,819
believe the story and people I knew who

3252
02:33:36,729 --> 02:33:41,859
had met that like Matt you know or like

3253
02:33:39,819 --> 02:33:45,039
ah he's full of [ __ ] but then you know

3254
02:33:41,860 --> 02:33:49,840
um you know as time went by and I saw if

3255
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:53,110
you will you know other things that led

3256
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:55,271
me to believe different I definitely

3257
02:33:53,110 --> 02:33:59,680
believe you know it's a simple story and

3258
02:33:55,271 --> 02:34:01,890
it doesn't have a lot of ro BS it's it's

3259
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:04,950
it's almost too honest

3260
02:34:01,889 --> 02:34:10,180
um armed in my closet under the stairs

3261
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:12,070
you know so you know okay and then it's

3262
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:14,440
a real sorry little follow up ones that

3263
02:34:12,069 --> 02:34:17,529
was out of your Baba hybrids have you

3264
02:34:14,440 --> 02:34:19,659
found any which on the whole stay quite

3265
02:34:17,530 --> 02:34:24,521
true to the Baba but get rid of the

3266
02:34:19,659 --> 02:34:31,810
horrendously long veg time mm-hmm

3267
02:34:24,521 --> 02:34:35,290
stay true to the Bubba and I want to say

3268
02:34:31,810 --> 02:34:37,539
so because Bubba the Bible hybrids tend

3269
02:34:35,290 --> 02:34:40,930
to segregate in two different directions

3270
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:43,390
they're either about fifty percent of

3271
02:34:40,930 --> 02:34:46,870
them are like Bubba which you're not

3272
02:34:43,389 --> 02:34:51,100
losing the veg time there and then the

3273
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:53,500
other 50% tend to you know grow a lot

3274
02:34:51,101 --> 02:34:55,960
more vigorous like the mother plant that

3275
02:34:53,500 --> 02:35:01,120
they came from and they tend to have the

3276
02:34:55,959 --> 02:35:04,389
mother's char paint so you know faster

3277
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:08,530
drone Bubba not quite yet okay maybe one

3278
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:12,219
day yeah so I've never done a back cross

3279
02:35:08,530 --> 02:35:14,380
using feminized pollen so you know let

3280
02:35:12,219 --> 02:35:15,850
you make like a feminized cross and then

3281
02:35:14,379 --> 02:35:17,859
you hit one of the offsprings of that

3282
02:35:15,851 --> 02:35:25,409
with the same Poland you use to make the

3283
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:25,409
feminized cross I think I have

3284
02:35:25,670 --> 02:35:36,068
let's see so I I did Obama Kush

3285
02:35:31,299 --> 02:35:41,358
basically Mendocino purple cross to

3286
02:35:36,068 --> 02:35:45,648
bubba kush and then i well i didn't name

3287
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:47,420
it obama cash my buddy up and tie guard

3288
02:35:45,648 --> 02:35:50,139
he named it obama cash

3289
02:35:47,420 --> 02:35:52,939
hey thrown him under the bus right there

3290
02:35:50,139 --> 02:35:54,528
but anyways so I took that clone and

3291
02:35:52,939 --> 02:35:57,470
then I pollinated it with Bubba cush

3292
02:35:54,529 --> 02:35:59,658
again so that's kind of a back cross of

3293
02:35:57,469 --> 02:36:01,728
sorts and then you know even katsu Baba

3294
02:35:59,658 --> 02:36:05,209
could kind of be considered the same

3295
02:36:01,728 --> 02:36:08,379
when I cross katsu to the original Bubba

3296
02:36:05,209 --> 02:36:12,228
I think that's kind of a back cross or

3297
02:36:08,379 --> 02:36:16,068
something of sorts and so what is the go

3298
02:36:12,228 --> 02:36:17,959
with I've heard of like Obama cush being

3299
02:36:16,068 --> 02:36:19,579
like a totally different genetic makeup

3300
02:36:17,959 --> 02:36:21,738
to what you listed eyes is there someone

3301
02:36:19,579 --> 02:36:23,059
else who tries to like take credit for

3302
02:36:21,738 --> 02:36:24,469
it or something I think it was like a

3303
02:36:23,059 --> 02:36:28,269
dispensary and they said it was like

3304
02:36:24,469 --> 02:36:31,459
Super Skunk and something else and right

3305
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:33,560
well to clarify there's definitely at

3306
02:36:31,459 --> 02:36:36,408
least three or four different Obama

3307
02:36:33,559 --> 02:36:37,609
pushes because everybody named their

3308
02:36:36,408 --> 02:36:40,279
favorite Kush

3309
02:36:37,609 --> 02:36:44,540
after Obama you know any person right

3310
02:36:40,279 --> 02:36:49,130
yeah so there's a Obama coach down in

3311
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:52,909
San Diego there's an anabolic ish over

3312
02:36:49,129 --> 02:36:55,509
in Michigan there and then my Obama

3313
02:36:52,908 --> 02:36:58,309
coach which is extremely popular around

3314
02:36:55,510 --> 02:37:01,670
Portland and Eugene and Seattle the

3315
02:36:58,309 --> 02:37:03,139
Pacific Northwest you know that that

3316
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:07,250
came from me and my buddy you know

3317
02:37:03,139 --> 02:37:10,278
Tigard so Leafly or Leafly or whatever

3318
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:13,609
they they call themselves they have it

3319
02:37:10,279 --> 02:37:19,279
as a Afghani og or something I don't

3320
02:37:13,609 --> 02:37:22,729
know but they're they're based out of

3321
02:37:19,279 --> 02:37:26,600
Oregon so they should kind of know you

3322
02:37:22,728 --> 02:37:29,478
know what the the popular Obama in that

3323
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:32,568
area is I don't even know yeah you know

3324
02:37:29,478 --> 02:37:36,948
then the notorious from having incorrect

3325
02:37:32,568 --> 02:37:38,649
information about strains right everyone

3326
02:37:36,949 --> 02:37:40,540
is cam know anyone you go look

3327

3329
02:37:47,409 --> 02:37:51,369
then me and my buddies have talked him a

3330
02:37:49,959 --> 02:37:52,869
little bit and they're like oh we'll

3332
02:37:52,870 --> 02:37:57,610

3337
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:07,840
things and they sent me an email back

3338
02:38:05,739 --> 02:38:11,351
being like we just rely on information

3339
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:13,299
submitted by users and so I was like

3340
02:38:11,351 --> 02:38:18,579
okay so that's why we're in the state

3341
02:38:13,299 --> 02:38:22,000
we're in right now right yeah next

3342
02:38:18,579 --> 02:38:23,950
question yeah how are you dealing with

3343
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:31,989
making the transition to the legal

3344
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:35,470
market we'll see yeah it's it's gonna be

3345
02:38:31,989 --> 02:38:38,590
interesting yeah no no no telling right

3346
02:38:35,469 --> 02:38:40,869
now I worst-case scenario I'll have a

3347
02:38:38,590 --> 02:38:44,560
good high-paying job for some corporate

3348
02:38:40,870 --> 02:38:48,970
big-money cannabis best-case scenario

3349
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:51,399
I'll have my own company and you know

3350
02:38:48,969 --> 02:38:54,159
find a little niche that I can fit into

3351
02:38:51,399 --> 02:38:55,959
that'll support all the research and

3352
02:38:54,159 --> 02:39:01,690
development that I kind of want to do in

3353
02:38:55,959 --> 02:39:04,810
the future but uh yeah yeah okay so this

3354
02:39:01,690 --> 02:39:06,370
one's I'm not entirely sure what they're

3355
02:39:04,810 --> 02:39:08,319
getting at so just choose to answer it

3356
02:39:06,370 --> 02:39:10,360
how you will what's the best way to

3357
02:39:08,319 --> 02:39:12,549
pollinate something without having a

3358
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:14,560
seed your whole room and this is the

3359
02:39:12,549 --> 02:39:16,779
pouch doesn't quite make sense take it

3360
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:18,789
out of the room and spray water on it

3361
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:20,079
after so I I don't think they're talking

3362
02:39:18,790 --> 02:39:21,820
about ammo maybe they're saying if I

3363
02:39:20,079 --> 02:39:24,039
want to pollinate a female and I do

3364
02:39:21,819 --> 02:39:25,329
pollinate it should I then like take it

3365
02:39:24,040 --> 02:39:28,720
out of the room and like spray it down

3366
02:39:25,329 --> 02:39:30,219
after it's accepted the pollen off yeah

3367
02:39:28,719 --> 02:39:33,189
yeah no I understand what they're saying

3368
02:39:30,219 --> 02:39:34,629
I mean if if you have mobile plants

3369
02:39:33,190 --> 02:39:38,050
where you know you have your plant your

3370
02:39:34,629 --> 02:39:40,029
female plants in in a pot that you can

3371
02:39:38,049 --> 02:39:42,329
actually bring out of your room and put

3372
02:39:40,030 --> 02:39:45,010
and say like a dark tent or something

3373
02:39:42,329 --> 02:39:47,620
you can you can definitely just pull

3374
02:39:45,010 --> 02:39:49,810
that plan out pollinate it and that

3375
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:52,240
little private tent you know all by

3376
02:39:49,810 --> 02:39:54,940
itself leave it there for 24 hours

3377
02:39:52,239 --> 02:39:59,260
in the dark is just fine the whole time

3378
02:39:54,940 --> 02:40:02,050
and then spray it down with water just

3379
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:04,600
like they're saying and pop it back up

3380
02:40:02,049 --> 02:40:06,039
in your room and you won't have stray

3381
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:10,120
pollen because water kills all the

3382
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:12,160
pollen and it will produce all the seeds

3383
02:40:10,120 --> 02:40:15,670
it needs to not pollinate in your room

3384
02:40:12,159 --> 02:40:18,299
yeah with some hay are you able to give

3385
02:40:15,670 --> 02:40:23,020
us a little more information on your

3386
02:40:18,299 --> 02:40:26,129
10/14 light cycle um

3387
02:40:23,020 --> 02:40:30,190
that's usually only a light cycle I

3388
02:40:26,129 --> 02:40:33,459
would use for longer flour and sativas

3389
02:40:30,190 --> 02:40:35,620
or in the heat of summer if you want to

3390
02:40:33,459 --> 02:40:38,709
reduce temperatures or if you want to

3391
02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:42,820
pull off a crop a little earlier than

3392
02:40:38,709 --> 02:40:45,459
normal I generally don't use them unless

3393
02:40:42,819 --> 02:40:48,610
it's a heat issue or you know I want to

3394
02:40:45,459 --> 02:40:51,069
ripen stuff up early it definitely

3395
02:40:48,610 --> 02:40:53,680
affects yields a bit just because you're

3396
02:40:51,069 --> 02:41:00,129
you're losing you know a good portion of

3397
02:40:53,680 --> 02:41:04,030
time but uh yeah it's a time in a place

3398
02:41:00,129 --> 02:41:07,589
to have to think yeah okay what's your

3399
02:41:04,030 --> 02:41:07,590
favorite place to eat in the Triangle

3400
02:41:07,739 --> 02:41:11,590
huh and I wish we had good food around

3401
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:17,409
here

3402
02:41:11,590 --> 02:41:20,639
oh it's rough oh shoot

3403
02:41:17,409 --> 02:41:22,690
honestly uh I like some of the wool

3404
02:41:20,639 --> 02:41:35,529
Mexican joints as long as they have a

3405
02:41:22,690 --> 02:41:37,989
good margaritas nice yeah what's the

3406
02:41:35,530 --> 02:41:45,310
difference between granddaddy purple and

3407
02:41:37,989 --> 02:41:47,709
the southern humble well I'm not exactly

3408
02:41:45,309 --> 02:41:48,789
sure what cut goes around the southern

3409
02:41:47,709 --> 02:41:52,089
Humboldt purple

3410
02:41:48,790 --> 02:41:56,400
I mean granddaddy purple of course is

3411
02:41:52,090 --> 02:41:59,649
Arkell times Salmon Creek big bud

3412
02:41:56,399 --> 02:42:02,920
whereas southern Humboldt purple

3413
02:41:59,649 --> 02:42:05,879
generally refers to just purple or coal

3414
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:08,670
or purple or chol types

3415
02:42:05,879 --> 02:42:12,800
it's it's kind of just a vague maybe

3416
02:42:08,670 --> 02:42:15,511
generalization a bit yeah yeah okay and

3417
02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:17,250
what's the difference between gray pipe

3418
02:42:15,511 --> 02:42:19,649
and Pecola who do you think purple

3419
02:42:17,250 --> 02:42:23,220
Urkel's the dad or how do you think it

3420
02:42:19,649 --> 02:42:27,890
offshoots from it that's a good one

3421
02:42:23,220 --> 02:42:31,829
I ran out you know beds full of Oracle

3422
02:42:27,890 --> 02:42:34,369
granddaddy purple Grape Ape

3423
02:42:31,829 --> 02:42:37,261
you know Pakistani purple black

3424
02:42:34,370 --> 02:42:39,360
Bridgeville black Afghan just a ton of

3425
02:42:37,261 --> 02:42:44,000
these different purples from around the

3426
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:46,560
triangle years ago and the Grape Ape

3427
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:49,890
supposedly has the same heritage same

3428
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:52,140
exact heritage d'azyr chol um but it

3429
02:42:49,890 --> 02:42:55,229
seems to grow a little bit stronger and

3430
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:58,489
a little bit faster than then the Oracle

3431
02:42:55,229 --> 02:43:04,409
I've had since you know 2001 2002

3432
02:42:58,489 --> 02:43:06,750
yeah intercept what is your so recipe

3433
02:43:04,409 --> 02:43:08,729
for indoors I know you touched on it you

3434
02:43:06,750 --> 02:43:10,050
know what's the you know without listing

3435
02:43:08,729 --> 02:43:11,899
whites and stuff you know what are the

3436
02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:15,720
basic amendments you're chucking in

3437
02:43:11,899 --> 02:43:18,659
right basically I keep it simple I just

3438
02:43:15,720 --> 02:43:24,000
you know for my own needs I use a buy

3439
02:43:18,659 --> 02:43:28,409
gold cocoa blend and then I mix in like

3440
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:31,379
some Bokashi let's see what else some

3441
02:43:28,409 --> 02:43:32,190
insect frass and then fish meals fish

3442
02:43:31,379 --> 02:43:36,270
bone meals

3443
02:43:32,190 --> 02:43:38,431
alfalfa scalps it depends on which run

3444
02:43:36,271 --> 02:43:40,530
sometimes I just go you know with a

3445
02:43:38,431 --> 02:43:42,200
little bit of a high nitrogen stuff

3446
02:43:40,530 --> 02:43:45,090
other times I'm throwing in a bunch of

3447
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:47,159
extra rock dust green sands you know

3448
02:43:45,090 --> 02:43:49,550
long-term release stuff and then I

3449
02:43:47,159 --> 02:43:53,129
always add a nice chunk of a

3450
02:43:49,550 --> 02:43:57,119
diatomaceous earth and you know Omri

3451
02:43:53,129 --> 02:44:00,209
natural because anytime here doing

3452
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:05,761
organics and cocoa and all that yeah you

3453
02:44:00,209 --> 02:44:11,039
got to keep those gnats at bay alright

3454
02:44:05,761 --> 02:44:14,489
so why make an s-1 given there's such a

3455
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:16,891
stigma around feminized seeds especially

3456
02:44:14,489 --> 02:44:19,110
compared to other NorCal growers I look

3457
02:44:16,890 --> 02:44:21,060
at main jain and loompa

3458
02:44:19,110 --> 02:44:24,781
I think maybe what they saying is like

3459
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:29,610
you sell more because if you did dregs I

3460
02:44:24,781 --> 02:44:31,951
don't know oh yeah no I don't understand

3461
02:44:29,610 --> 02:44:34,740
the question I mean honestly in the

3462
02:44:31,950 --> 02:44:39,350
future a lot of people are probably

3463
02:44:34,740 --> 02:44:42,661
gonna lean towards well-done consistent

3464
02:44:39,351 --> 02:44:44,671
feminized seeds over regular seeds a lot

3465
02:44:42,661 --> 02:44:47,550
of people aren't gonna have the time or

3466
02:44:44,671 --> 02:44:50,490
the space to even grow males or even

3467
02:44:47,550 --> 02:44:53,399
need males you take the recreational

3468
02:44:50,490 --> 02:44:55,261
market in Oregon and California where

3469
02:44:53,399 --> 02:44:57,690
everybody is allowed to grow four to six

3470
02:44:55,261 --> 02:44:58,890
plants I don't think anybody any of

3471
02:44:57,690 --> 02:45:02,101
those people are gonna want to grow

3472
02:44:58,890 --> 02:45:04,050
males you know I mean if you're only

3473
02:45:02,101 --> 02:45:08,551
allowed such a limited number of plants

3474
02:45:04,050 --> 02:45:13,800
you know feminized seeds are essentially

3475
02:45:08,550 --> 02:45:16,350
you know a perfect option and a lot of

3476
02:45:13,800 --> 02:45:21,421
the stem stigma behind feminized seeds

3477
02:45:16,351 --> 02:45:23,461
is is kind of false you know I mean

3478
02:45:21,421 --> 02:45:26,161
anytime somebody starts going on and on

3479
02:45:23,460 --> 02:45:28,800
about how bad feminized seeds are I

3480
02:45:26,161 --> 02:45:30,931
asked them well hey your regular seed

3481
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:33,569
breeders are they using chem dogs

3482
02:45:30,931 --> 02:45:36,601
Diesel's og cush is Girl Scout cookies

3483
02:45:33,569 --> 02:45:39,421
all those things came from feminized

3484
02:45:36,601 --> 02:45:43,190
seeds crossed to a male plant of some

3485
02:45:39,421 --> 02:45:45,961
sort you know so it's just like you know

3486
02:45:43,190 --> 02:45:48,899
people need eventually they'll get

3487
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:52,050
educated and realize oh wait how come

3488
02:45:48,899 --> 02:45:54,390
you know the most notorious breeders in

3489
02:45:52,050 --> 02:45:58,560
the entire world like Sam skunk man and

3490
02:45:54,390 --> 02:46:01,649
chimera or you know huge proponents for

3491
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:03,899
feminized seeds yeah like right it's out

3492
02:46:01,649 --> 02:46:06,990
there you know I don't know okay

3493
02:46:03,899 --> 02:46:08,399
Osby say sorry I'm sorry that viewer had

3494
02:46:06,990 --> 02:46:14,729
butchered the question but we go through

3495
02:46:08,399 --> 02:46:21,540
it from our buddy pee bud mark he have

3496
02:46:14,729 --> 02:46:22,261
in the fight last night the way how I'm

3497
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:26,520
a simple man

3498
02:46:22,261 --> 02:46:31,201
real simple um I only like a few things

3499
02:46:26,521 --> 02:46:33,181
and most of us just weed so I don't even

3500
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:35,340
do sports

3501
02:46:33,181 --> 02:46:39,751
that's just me didn't you when trying -

3502
02:46:35,341 --> 02:46:47,041
one whisking edge in front all right are

3503
02:46:39,751 --> 02:46:49,591
we are we talking box yeah yeah what

3504
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:53,069
were some of the traits about the

3505
02:46:49,591 --> 02:46:55,291
pakistani Chitra that really drawed you

3506
02:46:53,069 --> 02:46:58,909
to it and what were the ones you looked

3507
02:46:55,290 --> 02:46:58,909
for in the Maui selected ooh

3508
02:46:59,280 --> 02:47:06,450
so with the [ __ ] rolls one of the things

3509
02:47:03,421 --> 02:47:08,970
the things I really liked about it

3510
02:47:06,450 --> 02:47:12,601
for them in general was the fact that

3511
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:15,569
they're extremely strong and like pining

3512
02:47:12,601 --> 02:47:18,831
and limonade inter paneling and they

3513
02:47:15,569 --> 02:47:21,421
don't have a lot of the common just

3514
02:47:18,831 --> 02:47:24,271
amsterdam terpenes just mirror scene and

3515
02:47:21,421 --> 02:47:26,550
carry awfully you know other there's so

3516
02:47:24,271 --> 02:47:29,521
much stuff out there that is just loaded

3517
02:47:26,550 --> 02:47:31,949
with nursing carry awfully that these

3518
02:47:29,521 --> 02:47:34,771
you know just pungent you know

3519
02:47:31,950 --> 02:47:38,820
over-the-top sharp astringent you know

3520
02:47:34,771 --> 02:47:43,141
terpenes are kind of refreshing you know

3521
02:47:38,819 --> 02:47:47,360
and i used more than one male you know

3522
02:47:43,140 --> 02:47:51,181
in in the breeding with the Pakistanis

3523
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:58,171
but they they definitely were strong

3524
02:47:51,181 --> 02:48:01,649
plants stable plants and we're as close

3525
02:47:58,171 --> 02:48:03,511
to you know what I was you know looking

3526
02:48:01,649 --> 02:48:06,540
for out of the line is that I could

3527
02:48:03,511 --> 02:48:09,961
possibly get yeah okay what that take

3528
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:12,149
away mm-hmm and will you use that my

3529
02:48:09,960 --> 02:48:16,770
father project so G you kind of retire

3530
02:48:12,149 --> 02:48:20,940
him after this I might use I might use

3531
02:48:16,771 --> 02:48:24,601
them a little bit more yeah I've still

3532
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:26,881
got a couple few of those males set

3533
02:48:24,601 --> 02:48:29,461
aside and I definitely know what he

3534
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:32,310
breeds for so there's definitely

3535
02:48:29,460 --> 02:48:33,569
potential for future breeding with them

3536
02:48:32,310 --> 02:48:37,140
yeah definitely

3537
02:48:33,569 --> 02:48:41,851
almost some what do you think the

3538
02:48:37,140 --> 02:48:45,751
genetic makeup of the black is okay wait

3539
02:48:41,851 --> 02:48:46,359
so are we talking about the black I use

3540
02:48:45,751 --> 02:48:51,300
proud

3541
02:48:46,359 --> 02:48:53,800
yeah okay um you know honestly I have no

3542
02:48:51,299 --> 02:48:57,998
solid idea I mean this plant basically

3543
02:48:53,799 --> 02:49:01,208
grows like a bigger Bubba cush plant it

3544
02:48:57,998 --> 02:49:03,639
has a fairly unique profile and at first

3545
02:49:01,209 --> 02:49:05,619
I thought it was nothing special as far

3546
02:49:03,639 --> 02:49:09,219
as you know I just figured it was like a

3547
02:49:05,619 --> 02:49:12,189
baa baa hybrid of sorts but um I guess

3548
02:49:09,219 --> 02:49:16,179
it dates back quite a ways

3549
02:49:12,189 --> 02:49:19,300
in the hind palm area of Trinity County

3550
02:49:16,180 --> 02:49:22,748
and I didn't even know this until I kind

3551
02:49:19,299 --> 02:49:25,599
of refreshed recently but it was even

3552
02:49:22,748 --> 02:49:29,199
featured and I think Jason Kings either

3553
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:32,140
first or second canna Bible but as far

3554
02:49:29,199 --> 02:49:35,890
as you know exactly Nia JH I mean my

3555
02:49:32,139 --> 02:49:41,288
cousin sourced it Ruth at least 1012

3556
02:49:35,889 --> 02:49:43,568
years ago out of high palm and from

3557
02:49:41,289 --> 02:49:46,600
there I don't know aside from it just

3558
02:49:43,568 --> 02:49:49,090
being you know very similar to Bubba

3559
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:53,828
cush but with you know different

3560
02:49:49,090 --> 02:49:56,439
terpenes okay and how did the pack email

3561
02:49:53,828 --> 02:49:57,668
in general influenced the chem dog in

3562
02:49:56,439 --> 02:50:01,479
the crosses you made like how did the

3563
02:49:57,668 --> 02:50:03,998
cross has come out basically mm-hmm

3564
02:50:01,478 --> 02:50:07,198
those are actually some of my favorite

3565
02:50:03,998 --> 02:50:11,799
ones out of the out of the f1 hybrids

3566
02:50:07,199 --> 02:50:15,369
they basically made the chem dogs

3567
02:50:11,799 --> 02:50:19,208
terpenes kind of exaggerated made a more

3568
02:50:15,369 --> 02:50:22,899
pungent more sharp so like with the chem

3569
02:50:19,209 --> 02:50:28,119
D I mean I ended up with you know just

3570
02:50:22,898 --> 02:50:30,118
ones that were extremely pungent and one

3571
02:50:28,119 --> 02:50:35,859
of them in particular it just uh it

3572
02:50:30,119 --> 02:50:38,680
smelled like just super sharp motor oil

3573
02:50:35,859 --> 02:50:42,189
like grease almost and then it tasted

3574
02:50:38,680 --> 02:50:44,859
exactly like that uh-huh which you'd

3575
02:50:42,189 --> 02:50:48,369
think is a bad thing but it was strong

3576
02:50:44,859 --> 02:50:51,988
so it was kind of a good thing awesome

3577
02:50:48,369 --> 02:50:55,180
and so an interesting question

3578
02:50:51,988 --> 02:50:57,788
sandalwood coffee and pine these are

3579
02:50:55,180 --> 02:50:59,648
terpenes which don't seem to really pop

3580
02:50:57,789 --> 02:51:01,510
up as much anymore

3581
02:50:59,648 --> 02:51:02,680
any kind of theories as to why that

3582
02:51:01,510 --> 02:51:04,809
might be do you think they just fell out

3583
02:51:02,680 --> 02:51:09,850
of favor or maybe they were like not

3584
02:51:04,809 --> 02:51:12,488
really dominant terpenes or I mean uh me

3585
02:51:09,850 --> 02:51:14,459
in a couple buddies we love pine so

3586
02:51:12,488 --> 02:51:17,828
there's there's a lot of pine stuff

3587
02:51:14,459 --> 02:51:19,659
we're working with and towards that's

3588
02:51:17,828 --> 02:51:23,199
one of the reasons why you know I like

3589
02:51:19,658 --> 02:51:26,949
the the pakistanis because there's a lot

3590
02:51:23,199 --> 02:51:30,248
of pine in them you know pining a pining

3591
02:51:26,949 --> 02:51:32,560
be you know and then Arkell Oracle has a

3592
02:51:30,248 --> 02:51:35,049
lot of pine in it which you know that

3593
02:51:32,559 --> 02:51:37,840
might even you know entertain the whole

3594
02:51:35,049 --> 02:51:41,108
pint Arkush you know parentage theory

3595
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:43,299
right there to also another reason why

3596
02:51:41,109 --> 02:51:47,430
you know growing up the Xmas buds cuz

3597
02:51:43,299 --> 02:51:52,288
you know looking for pine terpenes but

3598
02:51:47,430 --> 02:51:56,709
over here we love pine sandalwood I'm

3599
02:51:52,289 --> 02:52:00,850
not so sure what was the other turkey

3600
02:51:56,709 --> 02:52:03,430
nor though Oh coffee yeah well there

3601
02:52:00,850 --> 02:52:04,869
there's definitely plenty of coffee this

3602
02:52:03,430 --> 02:52:07,959
guy just needs to get his hands on some

3603
02:52:04,869 --> 02:52:11,859
Bubba cush yeah yeah and there's no

3604
02:52:07,959 --> 02:52:15,609
shortage of coffee yeah so this one I

3605
02:52:11,859 --> 02:52:16,658
might cut out because it might if the

3606
02:52:15,609 --> 02:52:18,550
answer is what I think it is it might

3607
02:52:16,658 --> 02:52:21,908
reveal too much but basically someone's

3608
02:52:18,549 --> 02:52:27,188
messages us and they've said do you know

3609
02:52:21,908 --> 02:52:29,978
if Sierra skunk is the guy that skunk VA

3610
02:52:27,189 --> 02:52:34,029
mentions is like his friend who lived in

3611
02:52:29,978 --> 02:52:35,049
Tahoe and basically in skunk be a story

3612
02:52:34,029 --> 02:52:36,939
he's like yeah I had this friend in

3613
02:52:35,049 --> 02:52:38,648
Tahoe and I gave him the chem dog and

3614
02:52:36,939 --> 02:52:42,158
you know go there and we'd snowboard and

3615
02:52:38,648 --> 02:52:43,478
blah blah blah maybe that's not enough

3616
02:52:42,158 --> 02:52:45,340
info for you to really answer that one

3617
02:52:43,478 --> 02:52:49,809
but this guy seems to think it's the

3618
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:52,439
same person okay so he's wondering I do

3619
02:52:49,809 --> 02:52:55,299
know anything about that

3620
02:52:52,439 --> 02:53:01,988
Sierra skunk isn't isn't the guy from

3621
02:52:55,299 --> 02:53:04,269
Tahoe awesome do you like to use any

3622
02:53:01,988 --> 02:53:05,738
specific types of growing in regards

3623
02:53:04,270 --> 02:53:08,590
like training you know are you like a

3624
02:53:05,738 --> 02:53:09,998
lollipop dirty like mainline a few

3625
02:53:08,590 --> 02:53:13,719
colors you just let them do their own

3626
02:53:09,998 --> 02:53:17,829
thing what's your kind of take on it all

3627
02:53:13,719 --> 02:53:20,170
I like natural so as natural as I can

3628
02:53:17,829 --> 02:53:23,950
but I also like to clean up the unders

3629
02:53:20,170 --> 02:53:26,978
and clean up the sides so I kind of

3630
02:53:23,950 --> 02:53:29,829
close to lollypop but somewhere between

3631
02:53:26,978 --> 02:53:33,728
lollipop and a natural plant structure

3632
02:53:29,829 --> 02:53:35,978
you know is how I like to do it look at

3633
02:53:33,728 --> 02:53:37,778
awesome and what method do you find is

3634
02:53:35,978 --> 02:53:43,568
the best for trying to yield the most

3635
02:53:37,779 --> 02:53:48,189
generally speaking um I mean being that

3636
02:53:43,568 --> 02:53:53,409
I'm not really going for yields ever you

3637
02:53:48,189 --> 02:53:55,930
know I I'm one of the people who firmly

3638
02:53:53,409 --> 02:53:59,170
uh goes with the there's a hundred and

3639
02:53:55,930 --> 02:54:00,700
one right ways to do something so I

3640
02:53:59,170 --> 02:54:04,870
think you can get high yields with a

3641
02:54:00,700 --> 02:54:06,700
dozen different methods you know yep so

3642
02:54:04,870 --> 02:54:09,340
whatever works best for you is what I

3643
02:54:06,700 --> 02:54:11,560
always told all righty so we'll just

3644
02:54:09,340 --> 02:54:14,978
jump into our last few questions just

3645
02:54:11,559 --> 02:54:18,278
got a little short answer ones what is

3646
02:54:14,978 --> 02:54:24,969
your least favorite strain ooh

3647
02:54:18,279 --> 02:54:26,710
least favorite huh huh damn those are

3648
02:54:24,969 --> 02:54:33,129
usually the ones that you just toss

3649
02:54:26,709 --> 02:54:37,919
right yeah yeah no no huh I've tossed

3650
02:54:33,129 --> 02:54:43,568
quite a few hmm I don't know if I have

3651
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:48,510
any least favorites I I ran out a

3652
02:54:43,568 --> 02:54:52,559
landrace what was it a Pakistani Archon

3653
02:54:48,510 --> 02:54:55,478
recently and it was absolutely terrible

3654
02:54:52,559 --> 02:54:58,049
you know I was I was gonna I was gonna

3655
02:54:55,478 --> 02:55:03,159
do a reproduction of it and I was like

3656
02:54:58,049 --> 02:55:06,879
what am i reproducing here so a recent

3657
02:55:03,159 --> 02:55:09,760
memory that's pretty bad what do you

3658
02:55:06,879 --> 02:55:11,648
think is the most overhyped strain so

3659
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:13,630
not necessarily like you know like blue

3660
02:55:11,648 --> 02:55:15,549
dream it's real hyped but like what

3661
02:55:13,629 --> 02:55:17,818
strain do you think gets a good rap on

3662
02:55:15,549 --> 02:55:23,799
the whole but it's actually pretty trash

3663
02:55:17,818 --> 02:55:26,010
right right um there's tons of them

3664
02:55:23,799 --> 02:55:32,259
these days huh yeah

3665
02:55:26,010 --> 02:55:34,000
yeah yeah I I mean me personally you

3666
02:55:32,260 --> 02:55:38,559
kind of nailed it with the damn blue

3667
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:42,370
dream I mean it's been so popular up

3668
02:55:38,559 --> 02:55:45,279
here I mean even some of my kid brothers

3669
02:55:42,370 --> 02:55:47,290
have run like 99 plant gardens of

3670
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:50,560
nothing but blue dream and you know the

3671
02:55:47,290 --> 02:55:52,540
past five to ten years and I've never

3672
02:55:50,559 --> 02:55:55,180
even grown the plant I'm just like no

3673
02:55:52,540 --> 02:55:55,620
thank you so I'm gonna give it to blue

3674
02:55:55,180 --> 02:56:00,460
Dre

3675
02:55:55,620 --> 02:56:02,470
nice so in terms of both like you know

3676
02:56:00,459 --> 02:56:04,750
breeding side of things but as well as

3677
02:56:02,469 --> 02:56:06,728
also like the general political domain

3678
02:56:04,750 --> 02:56:08,648
what do you think's the worst thing to

3679
02:56:06,728 --> 02:56:13,478
have happened to the kind of a scene

3680
02:56:08,648 --> 02:56:16,659
since you've became involved in it well

3681
02:56:13,478 --> 02:56:19,358
oh yeah

3682
02:56:16,659 --> 02:56:21,270
probably recreation recreational

3683
02:56:19,359 --> 02:56:24,909
legalization

3684
02:56:21,270 --> 02:56:27,939
I mean I don't I don't know any any

3685
02:56:24,909 --> 02:56:32,260
growers at least in California who

3686
02:56:27,939 --> 02:56:34,780
really voted for it and I mean just

3687
02:56:32,260 --> 02:56:37,540
watching what's happened in Colorado and

3688
02:56:34,780 --> 02:56:41,439
Washington and even organ you know

3689
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:47,080
coming on now I mean it's it's pretty

3690
02:56:41,439 --> 02:56:49,840
much killing it's killing the way things

3691
02:56:47,079 --> 02:56:51,068
used to be in a anyways so what a lot of

3692
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:54,010
people would have kind of like the

3693
02:56:51,068 --> 02:56:55,779
pitfalls that that were over sided you

3694
02:56:54,010 --> 02:56:56,889
know like what's happening now that's

3695
02:56:55,780 --> 02:56:58,210
like the problem is it the case that

3696
02:56:56,889 --> 02:57:00,519
people are losing like their right to

3697
02:56:58,209 --> 02:57:02,009
grow or like the numbers or what's up

3698
02:57:00,520 --> 02:57:06,130
with the legalization

3699
02:57:02,010 --> 02:57:09,909
it's just mass production big money

3700
02:57:06,129 --> 02:57:12,728
commercial grows you know one one you

3701
02:57:09,909 --> 02:57:15,879
know huge grow can wipe out you know a

3702
02:57:12,728 --> 02:57:19,148
hundred or a thousand you know small

3703
02:57:15,879 --> 02:57:21,159
farmers you know so I think it's just

3704
02:57:19,148 --> 02:57:22,858
been a way of life you know in Northern

3705
02:57:21,159 --> 02:57:26,978
California

3706
02:57:22,859 --> 02:57:30,309
you know Oregon and just around where I

3707
02:57:26,978 --> 02:57:31,920
grew up and it's not gonna be that way

3708
02:57:30,309 --> 02:57:35,920
for much longer at all

3709
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:37,780
so yeah so what do you think is the

3710
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:38,960
biggest mistake you see like kind of

3711
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:46,460
newly emerging

3712
02:57:38,959 --> 02:57:49,899
his make mmm biggest mistake probably

3713
02:57:46,459 --> 02:57:54,409
crossing uh one male times one female

3714
02:57:49,899 --> 02:57:57,889
yeah small selections small selections

3715
02:57:54,409 --> 02:58:02,659
and the one-to-one model the one number

3716
02:57:57,889 --> 02:58:04,159
one model is never good you know and

3717
02:58:02,659 --> 02:58:06,469
then final one

3718
02:58:04,159 --> 02:58:09,649
oh no sorry no final one second last one

3719
02:58:06,469 --> 02:58:10,939
what is kind of your growing tip for

3720
02:58:09,649 --> 02:58:12,409
everyone listening you know what's a

3721
02:58:10,940 --> 02:58:14,090
little secret you think maybe not a lot

3722
02:58:12,409 --> 02:58:16,520
of people do and growing and it helps I

3723
02:58:14,090 --> 02:58:17,780
could even be like you know the use of a

3724
02:58:16,520 --> 02:58:19,520
particular cell phone I remember one

3725
02:58:17,780 --> 02:58:21,550
time someone said make sure you use

3726
02:58:19,520 --> 02:58:27,890
silica you know that shit's awesome

3727
02:58:21,549 --> 02:58:30,829
mm-hmm um let me think the simplest

3728
02:58:27,889 --> 02:58:31,909
thinking thing I oh I'm yeah right there

3729
02:58:30,829 --> 02:58:34,760
keep it simple

3730
02:58:31,909 --> 02:58:37,250
oh I see it all the time people try to

3731
02:58:34,760 --> 02:58:40,280
complicate their gross you know they

3732
02:58:37,250 --> 02:58:42,978
they use a dozen different you know

3733
02:58:40,280 --> 02:58:44,720
bottled nutrients say they try to they

3734
02:58:42,978 --> 02:58:48,429
kill their plants with kindness you know

3735
02:58:44,719 --> 02:58:50,989
and they don't even managed to you know

3736
02:58:48,430 --> 02:58:53,780
reap the rewards of everything that are

3737
02:58:50,989 --> 02:58:55,940
given so I say don't forget about

3738
02:58:53,780 --> 02:58:58,489
keeping it simple because you can

3739
02:58:55,940 --> 02:59:00,860
produce excellent quality excellent

3740
02:58:58,489 --> 02:59:04,069
yields and save yourself a bunch of

3741
02:59:00,860 --> 02:59:05,960
headache and money by just keeping it

3742
02:59:04,069 --> 02:59:09,039
simple yeah without a doubt

3743
02:59:05,959 --> 02:59:11,719
alright on to the real last question now

3744
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:13,520
I like this one because it gives good

3745
02:59:11,719 --> 02:59:15,619
insight into all the breeders if you

3746
02:59:13,520 --> 02:59:19,100
could go to one place in time and

3747
02:59:15,620 --> 02:59:21,050
history geographically all that where

3748
02:59:19,100 --> 02:59:26,450
would you go to collect landrace seeds

3749
02:59:21,049 --> 02:59:33,409
ooh it'd probably have to be cat can I

3750
02:59:26,450 --> 02:59:34,909
have a a resource yeah and there were

3751
02:59:33,409 --> 02:59:37,610
certain years that were really good for

3752
02:59:34,909 --> 02:59:39,379
hash production you know back in the 60s

3753
02:59:37,610 --> 02:59:42,979
and 70s I just need to pick the right

3754
02:59:39,379 --> 02:59:44,809
year yeah I definitely go to you know

3755
02:59:42,978 --> 02:59:48,549
somewhere along the Hindu Kush mountains

3756
02:59:44,809 --> 02:59:51,799
you know Afghanistan Pakistan I'm

3757
02:59:48,549 --> 02:59:52,559
definitely more of an indica type myself

3758
02:59:51,799 --> 02:59:55,469
so

3759
02:59:52,559 --> 02:59:58,769
you know somewhere somewhere in the 60s

3760
02:59:55,469 --> 03:00:00,590
70s right read about it around them

3761
02:59:58,770 --> 03:00:02,578
there that would be about right for me

3762
03:00:00,590 --> 03:00:05,130
sounds fantastic

3763
