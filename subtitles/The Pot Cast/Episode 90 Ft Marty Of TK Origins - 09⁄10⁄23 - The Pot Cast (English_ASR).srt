00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,120
uh which I always thought was a Thai

170
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,079
Afghani cross I want to say but whatever

171
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,280
is in this particular bud has that exact

172
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,120
same like turps and Aroma after you

173
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,119
smoke it and it leaves that lingering

174
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,759
smell in the air you looks like it too

175
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,918
has very orange hairs on top of like

176
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,400
green flower and on little spinny um

177
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,120
sticks kind you know it has a very

178
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,758
similar look so I've been enjoyed that

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,840
lately that also answer the question

180
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,199
usually ask people about

181
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,598
sativas yeah I love it is that the um

182
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,560
the lumbo you posted uh yeah exactly I

183
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,839
don't know why they call it that but um

184
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,560
it's basically I think it came from

185
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:59,119
Alaska I want to say people hunted up

186
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,120
there or somewhere and my Budd here up

187
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,319
in near Jacksonville had at both City

188
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,560
seeds and uh yeah he came through the

189
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,879
other day and I gave him a pack of

190
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,839
seedar too to look for some males and he

191
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,599
gave me a jar of that so that was a nice

192
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:14,638
gift Ah that's beautiful did you get a

193
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:18,360
chance to try much of those like Mexican

194
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:23,038
and South American sativ is growing

195
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,080
up um as far as Mexican goes not per se

196
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,120
like in South Florida there was so much

197
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,800
brick weed that would come to Florida

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
and for some reason I couldn't even sell

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,439
a house stuff but a lot of my friends

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,520
were like moving truck Liv that stuff I

201
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,160
had friends who make 50 60 Grand a pop

202
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,198
doing like one deal with like a bunch of

203
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,360
Mexi brick and like I said I could

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,919
barely even sell an had to much l a

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,560
pound or more um we smoked it early

206
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,758
early on as kids here and there when

207
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,598
there's nothing else around but

208
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,960
definitely wasn't my favorite um and I

209
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,000
know obviously there's some good ones

210
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,359
that came from parts of Mexico but uh

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,158
yeah nothing like these Colombian and

212
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,120
Panama smoking I've ever seen now as far

213
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,598
as

214
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,840
Asian uh back then as a kid when I first

215
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,800
moved to Pomo I had met a group of

216
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,198
friends and we would actually pitch in

217
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,000
once in a while to buy like an ounce

218
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,720
between us from this guy that had a

219
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,519
connection and he called it Hawaiian hay

220
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,199
or no sorry Hawaiian skunk and it was

221
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,359
just some of the stinkiest butt ever it

222
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,280
was super fluffy would fill a giant bag

223
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,400
and uh the guy that would go get it the

224
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,959
guy that was selling it lives in a

225
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,719
high-rise condominium building full of

226
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,318
old people and the people the guy that

227
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,919
we knew was little older than us but he

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
knew the guy go over there and get an

229
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,679
ounce but back this is back before seal

230
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,000
meals or jars were being used so he

231
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,359
would always come back with like a lick

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
seal bag with like this big fluffy ounce

233
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,399
and the stories were always about some

234
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,639
old people that get in the elevators

235
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,159
with them and just get these crazy looks

236
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,480
and probably within a year so after that

237
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,879
connection basic I think the guy got

238
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,360
kicked out of the condo or maybe got

239
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,519
busted or something so that was we lost

240
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,919
that connection but that was a that was

241
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,080
definitely some sort of sativa hazy type

242
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:59,599
stuff like really really funky and

243
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,399
different had lots of colors um one of

244
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,159
my good friends of this day actually

245
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,240
Angelo he's SK by see Green Lounge um on

246
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:08,838
Instagram we he was one of the ones with

247
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,120
pitch in on that stuff with me when we

248
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,120
were probably like 14 15 15 years old

249
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,639
I'd say yeah we were young oh epic what

250
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,759
was the effect like of that Hawaiian

251
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:24,199
skunk well it's been many years but uh

252
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,278
obviously um I just remember to this day

253
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,440
I would say it's in the top 10 weed

254
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:32,399
we've ever I've ever smoked um variety

255
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,640
wi I don't know uh I can't say exactly

256
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,320
what the buzz was like but I'm pretty

257
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,439
sure we all Lov it a lot and you know it

258
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,879
was like as kids it was just like some

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,240
of the best stuff we'd ever seen and

260
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,360
still this day like I said if I had a

261
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,519
bag of that stuff people would be like

262
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,480
what the hell is that um it was really

263
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,039
exotic and I have no clue if it was

264
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,278
actually Hawaiian or whatever it was but

265
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,879
that's what it was called ah epic epic

266
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,919
let me um let me take you back for a

267
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,439
moment because you you referenced you

268
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,159
know you've always got some TK you got

269
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,200
some OG Kush on hand that's uh exactly

270
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,958
what I imagined I want wanted to ask you

271
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,560
do you have a favorite out of the

272
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,639
two um on any given day not really I

273
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,199
pretty much smoke them equally I pretty

274
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,759
much a bong hit person so always doing

275
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,120
bong hits one after the other and

276
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,679
basically I never really choose one a

277
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,799
day is pretty much mixing stuff up like

278
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,120
a salad all day long I got seven or

279
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,278
eight different varieties and pretty

280
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,679
much smoking through on a regular basis

281
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,078
um as far as triangle I've a lot more

282
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,239
familiar with that because that's the

283
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:31,759
one that I've had the cut that me and fr

284
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,759
my friends have had for years um and the

285
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,958
OG Kush I only found out about five

286
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,000
years ago when I went public and then

287
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,719
met Josh and a bunch of people that you

288
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,879
know involved with the OG Kush and

289
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,000
that's when we kind of tied all the

290
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,240
story together but

291
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,919
um uh yeah they're on their day they're

292
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,120
pretty equal um the triangle seems to be

293
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,799
a little bit more finicky these days

294
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,639
than it used to be like I used to always

295
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,439
pop used to use 600 wat lights back when

296
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,200
I was growing it mostly and I don't know

297
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,240
if it just like like less light like it

298
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,399
does um but once you get under thousands

299
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,278
it just seems like it's a little bit

300
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,759
harder to get you know to where it's

301
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,559
perfectly tasty and way way we used to

302
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:11,319
always get it um so yeah how would say

303
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,838
the triangle if I had to pick one

304
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,360
because like I said it got a lot more

305
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,360
time with her and OG K I've only had her

306
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,519
for like five years so wow there's a

307
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,200
there's a lot to go into there the first

308
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,039
one I want to touch on I've seen a lot

309
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,000
of people posting recently about how

310
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:30,240
they feel OG comes out way better under

311
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,679
HPS than LED has this been your

312
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,600
experience absolutely um it's been

313
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,719
definitely tricky with the

314
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,278
LEDs uh like back you know when I first

315
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,759
started I learned using checkerboard

316
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,120
back in the day we used to use HPS and

317
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,078
highight um so for sodium and highlight

318
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,480
sorry and uh we do a checkerboard setup

319
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,479
so actually where I'm at now doing stuff

320
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,079
bigly they have a few rooms that are

321
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,278
checkerboarded and that seems to be some

322
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:01,719
of the best quality in the building I I

323
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:04,639
believe anybody as far as LEDs go um you

324
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,079
can get super beautiful looking nugs but

325
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,240
there's just a little something that's

326
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,679
missing um and like it really you have

327
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,480
to really validate I've had a couple

328
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,278
batches that come out super good but

329
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,879
it's not consistent it's like you know

330
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:19,360
like one out of three will come out way

331
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,679
you want it so it's definitely something

332
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,720
to do with the LEDs that's missing still

333
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,638
maybe something to do with like a little

334
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,800
UV light or some UVB light that's

335
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,879
missing from the LED still I know some

336
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,559
companies are throwing bars in out and

337
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,519
adding that stuff so we'll see if it

338
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,078
progresses more and they get better and

339
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,320
I've also seen some really good batches

340
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:38,120
come out you know when they do come out

341
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,720
good out of the ls they do come out good

342
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,360
so it's definitely possible um it's just

343
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
for some reason it's more consistent in

344
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,480
the

345
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,360
HPS yeah interesting okay certainly a

346
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,839
sentiment I've heard echoed by a few

347
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,120
people so that's that's something I'll

348
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
have to take in I I wanted to quickly

349
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,399
ask cuz you mentioned that you know the

350
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,720
TK is a little more finicky now than

351
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,559
before and on past episodes we've

352
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,160
discussed in detail how the same is said

353
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,479
quite a lot about the chem dog I wonder

354
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,360
have you seen any other like the common

355
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,320
thing with the chem dog we hear is like

356
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,159
it takes longer to root the flavor is

357
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,278
not as strong anymore it's a little less

358
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,679
vigorous would you say that you see

359
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,799
those same sort of reductions or is it

360
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,479
just maybe in one specific area and less

361
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:23,240
in

362
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,079
others um it definitely Roots fine still

363
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,360
um the V is good

364
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,519
still I mean it's I think it's just

365
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,600
because the last few years I've been

366
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,120
using LEDs and like the times I've grown

367
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,759
it in the last few years at home or in

368
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,959
Central America where we're living it

369
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,120
was you know just a little harder to Fig

370
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,159
out the LEDs compared to what I remember

371
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,198
so but then we've had a couple batches

372
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,958
come out of this grow with the HPS

373
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,919
recently that like went way back and

374
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,919
tasted the way they should and stuff so

375
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,240
we had a couple tests that you know we

376
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,078
never did lab testing back in the day

377
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,680
but hour I'm seing lab testing on these

378
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:58,319
things and we've ranged between 19% THC

379
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,078
to 32% THC you know depending on how

380
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,320
good the B come out and uh so yeah I've

381
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,519
seen that hit 32 actually recently and

382
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
that was one of the tastier ones we've

383
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,159
had yet for some reason the rooms we

384
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,720
have are pretty much are all a little

385
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,278
bit different one room would produce

386
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,120
better than the other we have two LEDs

387
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,759
there's uh there's 11 rooms total at the

388
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,120
gr I'm at now and out of those 11

389
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,680
there's two LEDs and then the rest are

390
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,120
HPS but then some have checkerboard with

391
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,719
um Allied and some are just all HPS so

392
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,639
each room has his own little personality

393
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,160
I guess you could say so some of the

394
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,000
rooms definitely put off more fire than

395
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:38,600
others um and since I've been there

396
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,278
basically it's been almost almost a year

397
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,720
now I was working with these guys here

398
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,399
in Florida and we had a hurricane Ian

399
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,440
came through last year and it was right

400
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,839
about before I got to L my brand and uh

401
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,800
basically it wiped out power and flooded

402
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,880
the entire Zone and wiped out the entire

403
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,519
Coastline where the storm hit and it

404
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,159
basically the eye went right over the

405
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,198
Grove we were at and power went out the

406
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,919
cameras went out the backup generators

407
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:04,039
went out and so nobody could even get to

408
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,479
the place for 3 days so that definitely

409
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,360
set the whole building into a tail spin

410
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,039
a lot of stuff had to get killed

411
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,600
actually funny because most of the MS um

412
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,639
from the West Coast that they had all

413
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,879
the genetics from the West Coast

414
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,519
actually had hard time with the power

415
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,838
being off for a day or two but some of

416
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,720
the stuff I brought from the East Coast

417
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,600
like TK and OG for example were actually

418
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,920
survived the power out of like no

419
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,320
problem but most of the babies that we

420
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,078
had going that were getting ready to go

421
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,680
in flower um my brand whatever they

422
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:32,958
pretty much all died and we had to reset

423
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,479
everything it took another six months to

424
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,239
get up and going actually what what a

425
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,000
what an incredible Testament to the the

426
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,799
power of the TK and the

427
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,639
OG that's cool okay so I I um I wanted

428
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,240
to ask while we're on the topic what

429
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,318
style of growing do you

430
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,079
do well I've always been more of a salt

431
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:53,519
grower because here in Florida we're

432
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,239
always indoor I mean we didn't really

433
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,399
have the luxury like everyone out west

434
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,720
does of growing outdoor because first

435
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,480
off the humidity second of all back in

436
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,440
the day the they had drones and they had

437
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,759
clear helicopters and they go out and

438
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,319
you know do like sweeps with their

439
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,120
helicopters and find like every single

440
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:10,958
plant outdoors they you know out it

441
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,759
seemed like every plant that would be

442
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,799
outdoors would get found I don't know

443
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,079
how they did it but I tried a few times

444
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,000
there some patches here and there and

445
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,519
like we would crawl through Hedges and

446
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,198
bushes and put little plants in the

447
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,039
ground we come back a couple days later

448
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,078
and there'd be ATC tracks that we go you

449
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,480
know quag tracks right to the spot where

450
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,039
they were and they would cut them down

451
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,480
before they were even growing so we

452
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,719
never had a chance in outdoor basically

453
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,959
what I'm saying um I've had a couple

454
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,399
bashes here and there in Central America

455
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,078
outdoor but just like experimental and

456
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,559
like five gallon pots and soil so my

457
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,599
whole life has pretty much been indoor

458
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:48,359
with hydro and it's as far as indoor I

459
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,879
prefer salts obviously I've tried just

460
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,399
actually I'm smoking I'm just trying

461
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,240
right now which came from Organics alive

462
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:56,440
which I'm enjoying so I'll probably use

463
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,879
that again in the future um but yeah

464
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,279
we've always that's basically how I

465
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:02,439
learn and that's basically better for

466
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:04,759
indoors how always learned as far as

467
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,600
like living soil and stuff that's more

468
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:08,838
always thought it was more for maybe in

469
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,558
a bed or if you're growing in you know

470
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:13,798
Big Greenhouse or outdoor plants in like

471
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,918
giant containers where you know the the

472
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,480
living soil will actually starts living

473
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,600
in benefits from everything you're doing

474
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,720
to it versus you know an indoor

475
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:25,000
situation you're usually growing in

476
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,160
small pots um so yeah we've always been

477
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,240
I've done rock wall I've done cocoa I've

478
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,640
done clay pellets that's basically how I

479
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,240
learned years ago and you know lots of

480
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,000
different nutrient Brands over the years

481
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,440
and we've always produced fire weed I

482
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,679
smoke it myself all the time um so yeah

483
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,919
happy with it what an epic answer and

484
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,759
massive shout out to Organics alive one

485
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,960
of our sponsors that's so cool to hear

486
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,240
you grown a batch and smoking it and

487
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,558
it's good yeah it's a group of surfers

488
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,558
too so we actually I met with a couple

489
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,399
of them and um actually at the Aral Cup

490
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:02,759
this last year I went and met with Eric

491
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,400
from Organics live he super cool guy and

492
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,640
uh we plan on hanging out again soon

493
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,038
once it comes to Florida so definitely

494
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,520
good headcut that's epic yeah my um

495
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,319
interactions with Eric have been really

496
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:15,440
awesome as well I wanted to quickly ask

497
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,720
for our listeners out there you got any

498
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,279
tips for growing the TK or the OG I

499
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,038
think in the past I've heard a lot of

500
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,798
people say like whatever cow mag you'd

501
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:25,960
normally use like double or triple it

502
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:27,119
when you grow on an OG what's your take

503
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,000
any tips for the

504
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,399
listeners well

505
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,038
me personally when I was growing my best

506
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,559
TP ever back in the day we were being as

507
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:39,079
simple as can be and I wasn't really

508
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:41,480
adding any cow mag um this was under 600

509
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:43,279
watt sodiums I was using flood and drain

510
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,000
tables this is for years I did this

511
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,279
probably 10 years and we had the same

512
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,599
brand I learned on actually um was a

513
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,960
two-part liquid called rockol Formula 1

514
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,519
and they stopped making it years ago I

515
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,079
think Sunlight Supply bought the company

516
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:57,480
out and then they changed the formula

517
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,000
and it was never the same again and then

518
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,599
they just got faded up

519
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,038
but that's what I learned on basically

520
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:05,240
all the way back in like 1990

521
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:08,879
91 and I used that stuff all the way

522
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:12,159
till I got in trouble um in

523
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,080
2011 so I know the company's gone away

524
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,240
since then but that was the two-part I

525
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,720
never had any I me basically I would

526
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,558
find you know there's all these like

527
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,960
snake oils I just called them you know

528
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,319
at the hydro stores that were $50 a

529
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,880
bottle for this that and the other and I

530
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,240
tried a few things here and there some

531
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,760
bud swell and all the different products

532
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,400
cool Bloom and different botanic eares

533
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,839
and different you know additives but I

534
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
always had the best results from just

535
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,199
being simple with that I thought you

536
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,798
know like just the two-part nutrient the

537
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,519
right PHH and just that 600 watt light

538
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,519
which they seem to love and in Florida

539
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,319
we always grew you know I my style

540
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,519
growing was always like in a house in

541
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,879
bedrooms or a garage where you didn't

542
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,240
really have the luxury of having Mass AC

543
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,840
systems added you know unless you

544
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,919
install yourself so a lot of times we

545
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,279
just run your central AC unit so your

546
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,159
house could only get so cold your

547
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,119
bedrooms only get so cold unless you had

548
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,520
AC but a lot of times I would do like

549
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,279
two or three lights per room and you can

550
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,918
only get you know your your house as

551
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,720
cold as you're living in it so it seemed

552
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,200
like the best batches obviously for

553
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,679
years are always in the winter months in

554
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,120
Florida because it would actually get

555
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,120
pretty chilly in Florida especially

556
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:20,479
Central Florida get in the 40s and 50s

557
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:23,479
at time sometimes even lower so those

558
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,038
nights that time of year um for whatever

559
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,200
reason TK always thrived and I was like

560
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:30,000
when the tastiest stickiest than is

561
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,640
batches would always come out in summer

562
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,079
months you get bigger plants obviously a

563
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,559
little bit warmer and they just never

564
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,720
taste as good sometimes they be a little

565
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,000
more bland or almost like cardboard um

566
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,079
you can just almost tell it was just

567
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,720
like you know it took time but over time

568
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,519
we just realized that it was they like

569
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,480
the cooler temperatures and I started

570
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:49,879
adding many splits and smaller like

571
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,038
window units to my room and it really

572
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,200
set it off like year round where it was

573
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:56,640
always good that's awesome to hear I

574
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,679
haven't heard about it grown in Ultra

575
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,840
cold conditions have you ever got the TK

576
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,400
to go purple or is it just pretty much a

577
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,439
green plant uh you can get the leaves

578
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,080
may have to turn dark but like I've seen

579
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,038
I give it to a friend of mine in

580
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,480
Michigan who actually grew it last year

581
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,960
and I guess it get super cold up there

582
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,839
obviously I don't know how cold his room

583
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,880
got but it looked as dark as I've ever

584
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,240
seen it um but down here no we always

585
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,480
had it it was always green um for the

586
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,079
most part like you might get some

587
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,558
coloring on the leaves during the winter

588
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,199
mon I was talking about when it got cold

589
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,759
enough you get your room down to like 55

590
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,720
or 60 sometimes if you tried

591
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:33,158
um and you know basically the lights on

592
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,200
it wouldn't be that cold but at night

593
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,960
that's when you wanted to have it really

594
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,000
cold back then it seemed like um so

595
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,798
whatever combination we used to do in

596
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,319
the winter months here just made that

597
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,879
stuff taste like magic it's some of the

598
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:48,319
best weed ever and I tried it warm I

599
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,000
tried it cold I tried it you know all

600
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,519
different ranges but like it definitely

601
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,640
likes it cooler not cold cold and I

602
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,200
definitely like some warmth in the

603
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,919
beginning to get going obviously you

604
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,240
know like that's what we that's St we do

605
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,640
it now um get it growing for like the

606
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,839
first month kind of warm especially with

607
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,679
LEDs you got to have some warmth up to

608
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:08,759
like 84 85 degrees even on the LEDs um

609
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,200
but half the way you know halfway

610
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,000
through we pretty much start dropping it

611
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,640
down I would anyway um all the way down

612
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,880
probably like say 70 for daytime T high

613
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,880
and 60 to 65 for night time would be a

614
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,120
good Target and that always seems to be

615
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,799
a magic formula for

616
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:31,079
it ah okay beautiful and out of

617
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,519
curiosity what's like the single most

618
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,359
memorable batch of TK you've had and do

619
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:39,240
you remember how it was

620
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:41,678
grown uh well like I was saying most of

621
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,679
the time I grew it I was using clay

622
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,240
rocks um and doing flood and drain and

623
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,360
then at some point I switched over to

624
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,519
drippers and it just made the plants a

625
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,959
lot thicker and just blew up actually so

626
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,158
I kind of like got out of the whole

627
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,278
flood and drain thing and switched the

628
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,679
drippers at that point and then then you

629
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:59,720
started learning a little bit more about

630
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,759
prop steering and drying them out a

631
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,120
little bit more at the end and and it

632
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,038
seemed like there were some batches that

633
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,839
were just incredible from from that um

634
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:09,278
there's a couple times timers went out

635
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,639
and the plants almost died on the stick

636
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:12,679
and they just ended up being like Oh my

637
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,120
god what happened it got so good so

638
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,360
that's about the time we started

639
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,719
learning you know how to like starve

640
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:22,038
your plants and basically help bring out

641
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,200
more flavors and oils and and you know

642
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,400
the cooler temperatures combined

643
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,200
basically was a nice combination for

644
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,080
sure that's beautiful that's beautiful I

645
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,960
want to talk more because you you

646
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,240
mentioned um some seed projects a few

647
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,000
questions ago but before we get there

648
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,759
let's go back and set the scene because

649
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,440
I know everyone who's listening is

650
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:44,319
really Keen to hear exactly what your

651
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,080
name is TK Origins so let's go back to

652
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,918
the start what was your first experience

653
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,199
with

654
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,480
cannabis uh first experience was uh I

655
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,400
think I was 12 years old like

656
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,360
1984 U my parents had split up and my

657
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
dad moved to a nice house on the beach

658
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,119
he rented like a few hours North

659
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,880
actually she book Ron and my brother and

660
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,000
I were still living at my mother's house

661
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,480
and we go visit him on the weekends and

662
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,440
he apparently smoked a lot I didn't know

663
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,240
it then but um that that trip one of

664
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,360
these trips at his house basically I was

665
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,240
being nosy and him and my brother were

666
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:20,119
out for the day I guess or do and

667
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,519
something and I was going through my

668
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,319
dad's room and I stumbl across a change

669
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,398
basket on top of his dresser and on top

670
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:31,480
of there was this huge roach um clamp in

671
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:34,119
a clamp in a r flip um device like one

672
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,120
of those metal clamps so I knew what for

673
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,398
some reason what it was I guess I was in

674
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:40,359
seventh grade at the time and just knew

675
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:41,959
what it was I knew it was drugs you know

676
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:43,798
but I didn't didn't think it was I

677
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,120
wasn't scared of it but whatever for

678
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,038
whatever reason that day I found a

679
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,038
lighter and got curious and I took it

680
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,158
out back on our patio and took a little

681
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,119
hit off it and put it out right away all

682
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,520
paranoid immediately and I was actually

683
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,879
worried immediately like I was going to

684
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,240
get seen by The Neighbors The Neighbors

685
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,600
was going to smell it it was the smell

686
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,880
at the house my dad was going to see

687
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,359
that I smoke some of it so it just hit

688
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,919
me immediately like paranoia style and I

689
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,278
didn't see weed again for another year

690
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,480
until nth

691
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:13,440
grade ah okay and and what was that next

692
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,278
experience like uh nth grade well for a

693
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,000
couple years in a row my dad was we

694
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,599
moved in with my dad and he was running

695
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,038
houses every year moving us from school

696
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:24,079
to school um so ninth grade I went to

697
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:27,119
this real nice um high school that was

698
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,558
full of surfers and skaters and like all

699
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,719
my type of people basically and that was

700
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:34,200
I had just started surfing the year

701
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,600
before in eighth grade um in b beach and

702
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,558
so I started going to this new school

703
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,119
met a bunch of friends and they all had

704
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:40,798
Brothers a little older than them they

705
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,558
were all smoking weed already and

706
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,000
basically I just kind of ran into it

707
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,599
that way again parties or go to like a

708
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,720
football game with some of the guys at

709
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,038
the school and smoke under the beachers

710
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,360
and stuff like that we all skated start

711
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:55,599
getting into skating at the time and go

712
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,000
to skate parks and built little half

713
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,719
pipes in our yards and um that whole

714
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,839
scene of people are all on smoking weed

715
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,720
at the time so that's basically when I

716
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,199
got into it ah and and do you remember

717
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,000
were there any names associated with the

718
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,558
stream back then or was it just like the

719
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,519
days where it was like the kind and

720
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,278
stuff like that yeah it was definitely

721
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,759
no names I remember from back then the

722
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:17,038
early days there was always somebody

723
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,079
else had it and they would pull it out

724
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,720
and roll up a joint or um had a pipe or

725
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,599
something on them ah interesting

726
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,278
interesting and and you've touched on

727
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,038
the surfing aspect and this was

728
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:30,159
something I wanted to talk to you about

729
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:32,798
because much like the Grateful Dead I

730
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:36,120
feel like surfing in general is very

731
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,480
intertwined with cannabis culture was it

732
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:39,158
is it one of the cases with the Chicken

733
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,159
and the Egg like which one came first

734
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,159
for you the Cannabis or the surfing or

735
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,799
was it sort of at the same time no it

736
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,360
was definitely surfing I started surfing

737
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,319
that year before like I said it was 8th

738
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,439
grade um I bought my first uh surf board

739
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,519
out of a pawn shop and I live like maybe

740
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,919
a mile from the beach in b beach so I

741
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,038
started going there all the time on the

742
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,840
weekends and my dad was always against

743
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:02,038
me surfing he always knew that it was

744
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,759
like a stoner type sport you know it's

745
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,879
just maybe because of the Fast Times

746
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,158
movies or whatever it was but he just

747
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,919
always frown on it at first um for years

748
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,440
actually so um I almost like had to do

749
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,120
it like secretly I'd go to the beach you

750
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,960
know my surfboard type thing uh so yeah

751
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:21,038
it was surfing first skating next and

752
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,120
then smoking weed pretty much came next

753
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:27,679
after that the uh the holy Trio I love

754
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,079
it so skating Smoky yeah no it is

755
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,519
interesting because obviously you know

756
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,158
like there's that history of like the

757
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,879
brothers of eternal love and their

758
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,559
connection with surfing so it is I guess

759
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,080
maybe that's partly where your dad got

760
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:41,200
his perception of it from maybe it could

761
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:43,158
be he just always wanted to be me to be

762
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,440
a sports player like you know like

763
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:46,519
either baseball or something soccer

764
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,000
whatever it was he had me playing

765
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:50,679
baseball real young and stuff I didn't

766
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,558
want to do basically and he was always

767
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,120
on the TV watching sports growing up

768
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,839
which actually got me to not like those

769
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,079
kind of sports too much um so that's

770
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,678
probably what actually let me to surfing

771
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,839
and skating to begin with there you go

772
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,200
right we tend to Rebel from our parents

773
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:08,000
that's uh that's that's pretty part for

774
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,480
the course so from that second

775
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,079
experience when did the penny drop for

776
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,480
you that cannabis was something you

777
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:17,158
wanted to get really involved

778
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,798
with well let's see ninth grade I was

779
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,080
just kind of I wasn't buying or anything

780
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,119
yet these guys always had it you know so

781
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,079
we would get high with them but um we

782
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:29,239
moved my dad finally bought a house for

783
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:31,199
10th grade but it was like an hour south

784
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,880
there 45 minutes south there so we moved

785
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,399
from like I said all over the place and

786
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,760
I finally get settled in Meet bunch of

787
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,079
friends and they moved me to another

788
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,200
place like south of there which the

789
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,720
waves weren't as good uh that the school

790
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,278
I was supposed to go to was all super

791
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,000
nice and new so that's the reason you

792
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,798
bought the house and then we we moved

793
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,398
there over the summer and they Clos that

794
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:49,918
school down so then next thing you know

795
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,479
I'm getting shipped to like this crazy

796
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,440
Public School in the middle of the real

797
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,679
bad neighborhood and uh wasn't liking it

798
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,558
one bit basically it was like small all

799
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,840
click of Surfers that I met you know in

800
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:04,398
that first year and uh basically we live

801
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,639
close to the beach so I like that part

802
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,918
about it and he bought a nice house on

803
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,080
the water actually so I enjoyed that and

804
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,919
I guess eventually I started making

805
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,038
friends and stuff so anyway that first

806
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,200
year I met a bunch of kids skating

807
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:18,079
surfing and that was probably the year I

808
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,038
started actually buying weed that was

809
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,599
actually the group of friends I was

810
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,000
talking about earlier we were buying

811
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:25,000
that Hawaiian skunk from the guy um and

812
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that was actually before I was even

813
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,558
driving a car yet so I was 15 and uh

814
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,880
yeah that was the year I first started

815
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,879
buying and selling a little bit of weed

816
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,720
here and

817
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,399
there ah incredible so were you just

818
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,600
like sort of selling and middl Manning

819
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,079
it for a while before you started

820
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,759
growing or what was that progression

821
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,038
like to them become a

822
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,240
grower yeah definitely um started out

823
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:47,798
just kind of like buying it for our

824
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,759
personal and stuff I never thought about

825
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:53,720
growing it or seeing plants until years

826
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:57,440
later but um actually at some point when

827
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,319
I was I think I was 16 or 15 or 16 still

828
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,640
someone had gave me this thing called a

829
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:03,398
Phototron and my dad had a pretty we

830
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,919
moved into a pretty good sized house and

831
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:07,038
the house was like divided into two and

832
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,200
I had my own like room on the other side

833
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,519
of the house my own entrance SL glass

834
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,798
door so I can kind of come and go and

835
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,720
sneak in and out of the house easy if I

836
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:15,960
wanted my dad was kind of lenient wasn't

837
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,079
very strict with us um it was just me

838
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,120
and my brother other with them and he

839
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,639
actually had a place going on in okopoko

840
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,959
he had a condo with a couple friends of

841
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,240
his and he would go visit there all the

842
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,840
time and leave my brother and I and

843
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,278
leave me in charge of the house

844
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,839
basically so at some point somebody gave

845
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:35,319
me a Phototron which was like this

846
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:37,558
little octagon box um that was like size

847
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,720
of a little mini refrigerator and all

848
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,359
the sides had these like um tinted

849
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,120
windows that you could lift up or slide

850
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,240
up and then access the center which had

851
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,518
a bunch of these fluorescent lights that

852
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,640
were running up the center along the the

853
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,200
walls and I think someone gave it to me

854
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,320
because it had a fan that had broke on

855
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,240
them or something and they didn't want

856
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,359
it anymore so I took it home and stuck

857
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,919
it in my little master closet and

858
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:00,839
covered it with like 30 laundry and a

859
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,399
surf for and stuff and actually popped

860
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,038
some seeds that I found bag of weed I

861
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:06,839
had no idea what it was but basically

862
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,440
got him going and flowered them out on

863
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:10,000
that little thing actually did a couple

864
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,558
bouches of it a couple of my friends I

865
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,839
still talked to this day actually

866
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,079
remember that it's super funny but um

867
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,558
never got caught pulled it off threw

868
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,398
that thing away at some point it was

869
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:22,000
pretty much garbage oh man the Phototron

870
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,278
that's a blast from the past I love to

871
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,919
hear that and uh that's cool that you

872
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:28,440
managed to do a few crops from those

873
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,799
seeds do you do you have any memories at

874
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,519
all about like if you had to guess based

875
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:33,839
on the structure or the smells like

876
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,359
looking back what do you think those

877
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,000
genetics might have been I really don't

878
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,599
remember they're tiny plants they

879
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,919
probably you know it might have been

880
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,158
like quarter ounces or something that

881
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,080
came out of there per plant like that I

882
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,039
might have done like three or four

883
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:48,359
plants each batch and you know it was

884
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,480
just just it's kind of like a little

885
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:52,000
hobby learning thing it's almost like a

886
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,120
if I see if I can get away with it here

887
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
my my house kind maybe H look kudos to

888
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:00,719
you that that's Epic and you mentioned

889
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,359
that um you know the property in aapo

890
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,798
did you ever get to try any cool weed

891
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:07,038
down there um I never have to been to

892
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,519
aapco myself my dad was going down there

893
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,480
all the time he would always that's

894
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,480
probably the reason my parents separated

895
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,798
I would imagine because he was going

896
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,200
down there partying with his friends and

897
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:17,038
my Mom hated it so he'd always come back

898
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,319
with like knockoff clothes for us my

899
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,398
brother and I like Levi jeans and this

900
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,918
polo shirts and this that and the other

901
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,959
um so no I never actually spent time in

902
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,799
alapo I've been to Mexico three times

903
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,200
different locations surfing but not to

904
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:32,240
aquapa um more recently actually I've

905
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,519
been to southern Mexico which is

906
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,839
probably one of the better surf in my

907
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,480
life there you go Okay cool so so you

908
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,199
got into it pretty early so you know how

909
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,880
did things progress because for anyone

910
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,558
who's been following your story online

911
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,880
they'd probably be aware that you were

912
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:49,079
involved in the whole TK story quite

913
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,000
young you know sort of around 19 to 20s

914
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,240
it sounds like it wasn't too long of a

915
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,558
time period before you transitioned into

916
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,558
that story is that right yeah well it

917
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,519
all started um

918
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:02,638
actually going back a year I was

919
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,278
15 and I wasn't driving yet and I was

920
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:06,079
skipping school one day and we lived on

921
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:07,798
like a dead end Street or my dad had his

922
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,119
own job or he can come and go anytime he

923
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,000
wanted so I never knew when he would

924
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,558
back out of the driveway I'm supposed to

925
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,720
be going to the bus stop but I always

926
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,720
sneak out my surfboard and try to like

927
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,000
run down the street where he wouldn't

928
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,360
see me and that's how I was get to

929
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,398
school and get away with it um so one

930
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,038
day I'm walking down the street with my

931
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,638
surfboard trying to like avoid my dad

932
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,038
and I get to the end of my street and my

933
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:27,558
neighbor from across the street was a

934
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:29,558
surfer also and was a little older than

935
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:31,278
he was like 10 years older than me and

936
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:32,558
he pulled up in his little Mustang and

937
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:34,319
hun the horn asked me if I wanted to go

938
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,798
to the beach with him I was like looked

939
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,319
and see had surbs in the back I was like

940
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:40,720
oh yeah so I jumped in and then that day

941
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,839
was basically the day that I would meet

942
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,159
my whole crew later on that was like the

943
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,879
day that would change my life so we went

944
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,080
to uh the beach that day a beach a

945
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,320
little further north that I normally

946
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,839
would go to I lived in Papo he took me

947
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,158
to Deerfield Beach like the town north

948
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,319
of there and there was a pier there and

949
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,799
basically a whole scene it was

950
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,439
volleyball courts and chicks everywhere

951
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,918
and bunch of surfers and the waves were

952
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,360
good that day so this guy who's 10 years

953
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,599
older than me starts introducing me to

954
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:12,078
his friends um some of these guys were

955
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,079
actually Pro Surfers and Surfer you know

956
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,000
companies or whatever already already

957
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:16,760
had sponsorships and stuff and they had

958
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,599
a video camera going on that day on the

959
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,599
beach on a big Tri Cloud so I'm hanging

960
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,720
out with these guys I'm surfing myself

961
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,280
and then basically at some point I get

962
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,358
asked if I wanted to run the camera for

963
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,079
a while and video everybody he pointed

964
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,159
out everybody who to video and show me

965
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,039
how to use the camera real quick I like

966
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,559
H yeah let's do it so I started messing

967
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,800
with the camera and videoing all these

968
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,918
guys you know I was like super young

969
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,079
looking up to all these characters that

970
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,358
were like 10 years older than me at the

971
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,000
time and I've already knew who some of

972
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:46,679
these guys were from seeing them surfing

973
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,519
at my local Beach so that day we uh we

974
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,960
rallied a bunch of people up and went

975
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,280
back to this guy Taco Joe's house who

976
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,280
was one of the guys that was surfing

977
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,560
with us that day um they called him Taco

978
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,200
Joe because he had a Mexican restaurant

979
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:01,000
right there there near the beach called

980
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,919
Taco Joe's so he ran by that name for

981
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,358
years Miami mangoes actually knows him

982
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,200
really well there's actually a video of

983
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,960

984
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:12,598
boxing ring at a at a nightclub years

985
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,039
ago so anyway we get back to that guy's

986
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,760
house and I'm just a little young kid

987
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,519
there everyone there walking around with

988
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,079
boms and rolling up joints fat you know

989
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,480
fat bags of weed and rolling up joints

990
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,119
with and there's girls coming and going

991
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,039
in bikinis and there's a trampoline out

992
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,280
back or the pool and the guy got a pack

993
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,679
of pit and it was like big fat Jeep and

994
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,040
I'm like oh [ __ ] these guys are the [ __ ]

995
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:39,598
so that day I uh I met a couple other

996
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,880
people that I never seen before met um

997
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,680
and basically I had already been buying

998
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,240
weed at this point so I started

999
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:46,358
conversation with one of the guys that

1000
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,078
was there that didn't surf he was like

1001
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:50,039
one of the guys that didn't have any son

1002
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,039
he was like pale and he had an English

1003
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,039
accent so we started talking about

1004
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,519
something I forget what it was about but

1005
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:58,279
one thing led to another and he gave me

1006
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,559
his information if I ever wanted to get

1007
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,880
a couple oun of weed here in there from

1008
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:04,000
him he said no worries to hook you know

1009
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,720
he hook me up so that's basically the

1010
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,679
person I met that day that would end up

1011
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,480
becoming my mentor later on um that same

1012
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,960
day at that place I met a few guys that

1013
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,559
were end up you know being Growers I

1014
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,240
would find out later on but I had no

1015
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,358
clue of the time

1016
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:21,719
obviously wow and and was it a pretty

1017
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,279
rapid transition into being involved in

1018
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:25,679
their whole world or did it take some

1019
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,319
time to build some more Rapport no it

1020
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,279
took a little time for sure I think like

1021
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:32,239
I said I was 15 then um and just buying

1022
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,160
like an ounce here and there with some

1023
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,919
friends I Got a Car shortly after that

1024
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,879
and started hooking up with the guy and

1025
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,720
got buying maybe quarter pounds he was

1026
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,480
Fring to me at the time and like over

1027
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:45,399
time a quarter pound we lead to a half

1028
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,159
pound and half pound lead to a pound and

1029
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,039
it started to get stinky in my house and

1030
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:52,440
I was still live in my dad's house so um

1031
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:56,358
at that point in time I think I was

1032
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,639
around 17 I want to say um I was still

1033
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,078
living there and I had to go get a

1034
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:02,279
little Warehouse little mini warehouse

1035
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,680
uh what you call mini storage unit and I

1036
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,960
had to find one that had power in it

1037
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,440
that I could put a little refrigerator

1038
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,440
and and store the weed in that was my

1039
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,039
whole goal so I found one did that so I

1040
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,200
was able to buy a pound at a time and

1041
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:16,519
not have to worry about my dad finding

1042
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,399
so um yeah that's basically how I

1043
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:22,199
started ramping up these guys selling

1044
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,599
weed for them um and at some point in

1045
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:29,318
time later on guess I

1046
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,838
was yeah middle 17ish I was asked by the

1047
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:33,358
English guy if I wanted to go on a trip

1048
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:36,000
to Amsterdam and that's how that thing

1049
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,039
came up basically offered me he offered

1050
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,838
me to pay for everything to go there

1051
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,519
with him and if I would carry seeds back

1052
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:42,719
for him and the reason he asked me that

1053
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,679
is because I had already gone on a

1054
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,679
couple surf TS by then with some friends

1055
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:49,480
and we've gone to Costa Rica Puerto Rico

1056
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,039
and a few other places by this point I

1057
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,760
always carry we always carry weed on our

1058
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,599
pants back then because the was before

1059
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,440
9111 and it was easy to travel with weed

1060
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,000
and it was basically like brainer we did

1061
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,039
it like easily so I guess my friend was

1062
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,599
super paranoid to do that himself so he

1063
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:05,759
brought me along thinking like oh I'll

1064
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,480
bring them seeds back for him no

1065
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,680
wores so that was uh the year I got

1066
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,358
asked to go to Amsterdam but before I

1067
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,838
could even go there I had to ask my dad

1068
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:15,358
for permission and I couldn't tell him I

1069
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:16,559
was going to Amsterdam obviously because

1070
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,679
he probably would have said no in a

1071
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,239
heartbeat um so I made up this whole

1072
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,799
story about how I was going to visit my

1073
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,078
friends family in England or we're going

1074
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,400
to go skateboard some some of the

1075
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,160
streets maybe some some skateboard parks

1076
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,400
there and do some sightseeing and all

1077
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:33,239
this stuff and my dad let me like had no

1078
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,160
problem with it so and back then there

1079
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:36,399
was no passports needed to travel over

1080
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,039
there just all you needed was a birth

1081
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,280
certificate so um it was pretty easy to

1082
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,679
do um so I think we went I definitely we

1083
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,319
went like uh right before the holidays

1084
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:49,159
so I had like some school time off I

1085
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:50,400
want to say um and that was like my last

1086
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,598
year in school there and I was getting

1087
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,680
ready to move out of his house soon

1088
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,240
anyway so it was pretty close to the end

1089
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:59,440
of me living there um so yeah that's

1090
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,159
when went basically the first time so

1091
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,358
how how old were you when you went over

1092
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:06,199
what year was

1093
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:08,880
it uh it was 1989 the very end of 1989

1094
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:11,519
so I was 17 still um when I got back

1095
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,960
from that trip it you know turned 1990

1096
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,838
and I think the end of that year by

1097
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,480
summertime I had moved out um so

1098
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,799
basically I when we got back from that

1099
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,599
trip I kind of had figured out that this

1100
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,920
guy was growing at this point along with

1101
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,680
a couple of people that came on the trip

1102
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,559
with us so I kind of had a feeling what

1103
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:31,480
was up um I wasn't I didn't see anything

1104
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,078
yet at this point but I got home and

1105
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,679
started looking for a place to move out

1106
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,880
to and I had this friend that I had

1107
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,159
surfing with all the time named Joe um

1108
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,400
and he was actually a couple years older

1109
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,279
than me and was one of the ones that was

1110
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,880
actually buying some of the weed from me

1111
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,880
and it you know Grew From like like I

1112
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,838
said a quarter pound to a half pound I

1113
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,640
you know he's buying a couple pounds at

1114
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:52,838
a time and we were singing good amount

1115
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,279
of weed together so he had an apartment

1116
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:56,000
that had an extra bedroom and he he

1117
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,839
offered me a place to move in so I

1118
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,039
jumped on on it and we started living

1119
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:02,719
together and going out partying together

1120
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,679
and selling weed together he had

1121
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,039
connections that would come from Central

1122
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,039
Florida um from like new Samina Beach

1123
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,000
and Orlando area and that's actually how

1124
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,039
I met Craig because Craig would drive

1125
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,358
down with this guy Mike Luke um together

1126
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:19,400
like basically to buy as many pounds

1127
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:21,239
they can get from us cash um so we had a

1128
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,920
pretty good thing going for a while

1129
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,919
until one day we came back home from I

1130
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,240
don't know what it was lunch or

1131
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,920
something too

1132
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:34,039
and the apartment had gotten broken into

1133
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,519
so uh he made it look like basically I

1134
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,400
come to find out later on it was the guy

1135
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,719
Joe that set it all up but I'll get back

1136
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:44,160
to that eventually um so the house

1137
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:45,959
looked like it was Rob both rooms got R

1138
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:48,799
they found four pounds that I had in my

1139
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,159
room and they found some cash basically

1140
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,359
all I had um they he made it look like

1141
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,759
they stole stuff out of his room too so

1142
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,880
I believe it you know was like we got

1143
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,920
randomly robbed by somebody so we both

1144
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,960
moved out I found my own place um

1145
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,559
because of that robbery though my friend

1146
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,920
that I had been buying the weed cash at

1147
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:07,239
that point because I was getting better

1148
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,000
prices for it um and because of the

1149
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:11,399
robbery my friend felt bad for me and

1150
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,838
basically offered me to come to his

1151
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,960
house one day which I did and took me

1152
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,960
for a ride and we went to his Gro which

1153
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,199
I had never seen before um so that day

1154
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,358
walked into this nice house and Boke Ron

1155
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,919

1157
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,200

1158
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:31,838
and it was furnished super nice and set

1159
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,358
up like somebody lived there but I could

1160
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,400
smell weed immediately when I walked in

1161
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,639
so I knew it was up and he asked me if I

1162
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,119
wanted to be a helper on the next

1164
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,680
cleaning up the bash that was about to

1165
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:47,239

1166
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:49,519

1169
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,599

step brother and step brother's best

1173
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,439
friend who were like actually like a

1174
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,318
year younger than me so yeah that was

1175
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,000
around uh 18 years old I guess when I

1176
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,440
got offered that job and started doing

1177
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,800
that and it was basically every two

1178
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,720
months two or three months I would go

1179
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,599
there for three days and make a couple

1180
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,239
Grand and not only that but I was also

1181
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,359
selling me for the guy and making money

1182
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,919
off that um and that's how things

1183
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:25,799
started I mean and actually started

1184
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,519
learning you know little things about

1185
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,839
the house and he started teaching me you

1186
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,920
about cloning and getting plants vegging

1187
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:33,920
and Mom plants and cleaning up and all

1188
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,480
the important stuff that you need to

1189
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,800
know um so yeah that was that all

1190
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,760
started around

1191
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,960
18 um and then I think it was

1192
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,880
uh yeah I turned 19 I had my own place

1193
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,440
at this point and that same guy Joe um

1194
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,480
was moved he moved back up to Central

1195
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,800
Florida where he was originally from but

1196
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,318
he was still coming down and buying

1197
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,400
pounds and bringing cash so so uh he

1198
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:01,800
came we set up something one day where I

1199
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,119
had grabb I think almost yeah it was 10

1200
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,359
lbs and I couldn't get to my warehouse

1201
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,119
in time that day where I would normally

1202
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,719
store if I had to start or whatever

1203
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,480
because they Clos the gates at 8:00 pm

1204
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:13,598
they open up at 600 every day type thing

1205
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,838
and I got there late so I had to take it

1206
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,280
to my apartment so the guy Joe gets

1207
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,318
there he gets to Hotel um we go plan on

1208
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,119
going out that night he comes over my

1209
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:26,599
house and I had the weed sitting in my

1210
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,800
refrigerator and a big seal meal bag and

1211
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,838
a garbage bag and uh he didn't know it

1212
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,280
was there but he asked me for a beer at

1213
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:34,639
some point I didn't think twice and I

1214
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,000
told him just grab one out of the fridge

1215
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,159
I should have grabbed it myself thinking

1216
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,719
back but he's seing the weed in there

1217
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,279
and then we went out drinking and on the

1218
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,679
way out I stopped at the gas station to

1219
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,440
get gas and he gets a page from his

1220
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:49,719
girlfriend at the time blowing him up

1221
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,200
and he had this crazy chick um so he

1222
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:53,039
gets out of the car and go make a phone

1223
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:56,558
call saying you know talk to this chick

1224
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,639
about something and shut her up so that

1225
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,280
basically he was off making arrangements

1226
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:03,480
to have somebody come to my place and

1227
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,400
Rob it while we were out that night so

1228
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,240
we got out drinking he had some friends

1229
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,599
that own some nightclub or he had a

1230
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:10,039
friend that was like a bouncer at a

1231
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:11,480
nightclub and another friend that like

1232
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:13,880
was a manager there or something so we

1233
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,440
had connection to this night we go to we

1234
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,000
come back like 3 4 in the morning pretty

1235
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,039
late night all drunk and he comes to my

1236
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,280
house where he would normally would come

1237
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:23,239
in and at least come in and smoke a

1238
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,960
joint or do some bonit with me before he

1239
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:26,838
would leave but this night he decided to

1240
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,639
just drop me off and like tell me he'

1241
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:30,639
meet me in the morning and we'll do the

1242
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,400
deal so I didn't think anything of it

1243
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,879
you know it was pretty late I go

1244
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,559
stumbling in the house and the first

1245
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,039
thing I noticed is my sliding out door

1246
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:40,079
was broken into um so I ran straight to

1247
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:42,079
the fridge and seeing it was gone the

1248
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,680
weed uh the house they went through

1249
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,680
everything they found my head stash they

1250
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,960
found a few grand cash I had a nice

1251
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:48,519
watch somewhere in the house they took

1252
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,240
everything I think they left me like a

1253
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:55,960
little gr nugget like a joke so because

1254
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:58,639
of that the same guy the man guy from

1255
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:02,679
England he felt bad again for me and

1256
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:04,159
then that became um my opportunity to

1257
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:05,440
partner up with him in that house

1258
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,519
basically because he was actually trying

1259
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,280
to get another house going somewhere

1260
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,199
North like a couple hours North he found

1261
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,079
10 acres a nice house on it he was

1262
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,639
starting to set it up spent a lot of

1263
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:18,440
time there and it was a perfect perfect

1264
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:22,598
opportunity for him to have a partner at

1265
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:24,318
the time and so I he got me uh he got me

1266
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:27,079
to move out of that place obviously and

1267
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:30,000
I did um realized pretty quickly that

1268
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,680
the guy Joe was the thief it just didn't

1269
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,159
make sense a lot of things that happened

1270
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,598
and I called him out over on the phone

1271
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:36,118
and you know basically admitted to it

1272
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,559
kind of told him me to [ __ ] off and come

1273
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,960
to find out he was smoking Coke and

1274
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,680
doing free base and like really [ __ ]

1275
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,039
up in life so that's why he got to be

1276
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:46,919
that type of person so I didn't know

1277
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,400
that side of the guy at all you know I

1278
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,880
just kind of was making money and kind

1279
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,358
of blind to it all

1280
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,200
so it was actually that guy I guess we

1281
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:58,639
could all thank for my situation and the

1282
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:00,639
OG Christian TK because of those

1283
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,679
robberies I was given the opportunity to

1284
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:06,400
run a grow and that's where that se

1285
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:10,000

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,920
there the first time I went uh we didn't

1296
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:31,358
find the that good of weed actually the

1297
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,838
first trip and the guys I was with were

1298
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,719
kind of arrogant I guess you could call

1299
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:36,039
it we already had good weed in Florida

1300
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,279
so we went there with high

1301
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:40,318
expectations um so all the coffee shops

1302
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,240
we hit up the first day or two were just

1303
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,838
like generic orange Bud that seemed like

1304
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:46,439
it the same stuff getting passed around

1305
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:48,440
all the coffee shops like gu tourist

1306
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,800
weed and I mean we actually found some

1307
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:55,159
good hash that everyone was like stoked

1308
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,519
on but uh as far as actual flow no um

1309
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:58,598
actually it took two days and that trip

1310
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,039
it was kind of a short trip I think we

1311
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,359
went for like six or seven days that

1312
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:05,880
trip um but like maybe day two or three

1313
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,799
we're out drinking at a pub playing pool

1314
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,880
a couple of us and we met this couple

1315
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,920
and we we knew we were there for the SE

1316
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,358
Bank we didn't know where it was yet uh

1317
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,480
we don't knew about the c bank because

1318
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:16,838
it was in the back of High Times

1319
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,440
magazine they had these little articles

1320
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:21,719
back then all the time and sorry just to

1321
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,480
confirm you mean like Neville's The Seed

1322
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:26,239
bang the seed bang yeah this is 1989

1323
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,480
yeah cool keep going

1324
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,399
so this couple had some good weed on

1325
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,760
them and they are actually rolling up

1326
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,400
cones and mixing tobacco in it so we

1327
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,000
refused to do that but we took a little

1328
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,318
nog and roll our own joint it was really

1329
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,639
good I can't remember what it was but it

1330
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:45,639
was that couple that basically gave us

1331
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:47,039
um told us how to get to the seed bank

1332
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:48,118
which was at the Cannabis castle at the

1333
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:49,519
time and we thought we could actually

1334
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,079
walk to it but we found out it was like

1335
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,159
an hour hour and a half away by a taxi

1336
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,760
which we had no clue where that was so I

1337
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,318
think the next day some of the guys

1338
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,040
contacted um the seed bank made sure

1339
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,800
they were open before we tracked off we

1340
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:04,679
got directions and there was like four

1341
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,880
of us got in a van and and went there

1342
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,159
that day and grabbed a bunch of stuff

1343
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,599
and you know when I first came out I

1344
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,399
might have said I met Neville back in

1345
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,519
the day or whatever but I mean I

1346
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,800
knew we didn't know who never was back

1347
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,400
then straight up nobody did I mean maybe

1348
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,519
some people that Liv there whatever did

1349
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,800
but we only knew of the SE bank and all

1350
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:24,239
the stories of Neville didn't come out

1351
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,760
till many years later so we had all the

1352
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,399
packaging we had the catalog from there

1353
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,160
and you know that's what I meant by we

1354
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,519
shopped at Neville's place the seat Bank

1355
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,759
basically um so yeah I don't know we

1356
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:36,000
could have met him but I was so young we

1357
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,680
went shopping there we went in the

1358
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,960
castle there was like a little it was

1359
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:41,279
kind of like a living room you walk into

1360
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,240
it seemed like somebody lived there and

1361
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,559
that's where they had their little shop

1362
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:46,879
and I later find out they had like a

1363
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:48,440
basement where they were grown but I

1364
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,798
never saw any of that we seen a big

1365
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,119
Greenhouse out back um but there was

1366
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:54,679
people working there there's two or

1367
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,480
three four people working there in the

1368
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:58,679
front of this the time that's who we

1369
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,880
dealt with don't know who who they were

1370
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:03,199
or names or Neville is one of them

1371
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,079
probably not so I know that right at the

1372
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:06,399
end of 89 apparently it was close to

1373
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:08,119
when he was almost getting in trouble or

1374
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,280
indicted so who knows where he was at

1375
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,519
the

1376
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,920
time but it was it was definitely the

1377
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:16,679
the Cannabis castle that we shopped at

1378
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,559
um and we grabbed a good majority of the

1379
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:22,078
stuff we could we grabbed like um

1380
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:23,960
there's I think five Growers out of the

1381
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,039
group and they were trying to get like a

1382
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,480
couple packs of each for all of them so

1383
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:29,239
we're trying to get I think like a dozen

1384
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,440
of each variety they had in the

1385
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:34,239
menu um and a lot of it I didn't even

1386
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,400
see later on like basically we got back

1387
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,838
to Florida and that stuff all got

1388
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,838
divided up amongst everybody um and

1389
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:43,558
basically the Hindu Kush that I ended up

1390
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:44,679
popping with a real small pack for some

1391
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:46,359
reason I don't know maybe it was like

1392
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:47,798
they were low on inventory I know it

1393
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,679
wasn't in the catalog and I know a lot

1394
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:51,159
of people claim that wasn't in the

1395
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:52,879
catalog and trying to prove whatever

1396
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:55,078
stories I lying about it wasn't the

1397
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,358
catalog that then but whatever reason it

1398
00:49:55,079 --> 00:50:01,000
was um he gave us a pack of hind seeds H

1399
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:02,759
cush seeds and they ended up being the

1400
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,480
ones that made the pollen and the

1401
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,280
Emerald Triangle room that you know

1402
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,960
created the triangle and you p with the

1403
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,440
sorry I I'll just drill into some

1404
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,358
specifics because I know people will be

1405
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,920
interested do you when you say a small

1406
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:16,078
pack you mean like there was only like

1407
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,119
six seeds and not like 10 or something

1408
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,960
no no it was like a single pack you know

1409
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,760
like maybe 10 or 12 seeds it was I think

1410
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:26,480
by then I want to say okay and for some

1411
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,480
reason they charged less for those then

1412
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,159
everything else I think they were like

1413
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,798
$2 a seed or some of the other stuff on

1414
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:33,598
the menu was like five a seed um he

1415
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:35,119
actually had a couple other fush um

1416
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,798
varieties on the menu I remember that

1417
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,920
one was sold out it was like Kush times

1418
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:41,039
Kush and then another one we brought

1419
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,838
back was like skunk times Kush and for

1420
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:44,119
some reason those were $2 a piece each

1421
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:45,400
you know so we didn't even think they

1422
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:47,079
were that good to be honest we thought

1423
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,079
they were based on the price that they

1424
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:51,599
you know he was like giving away a

1425
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,160
freebie type thing ah okay and and the

1426
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,920
Hindu Kush seeds that you ended up

1427
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:57,598
popping were they in like packaging that

1428
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,240
said Hindu Kush or was it just generic

1429
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,960
packaging or was it in like a pack that

1430
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:03,318
said something else but he was like oh

1431
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,960
by the way this is actually Hindu Kush

1432
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:07,679
uh I'm pretty sure they were all in

1433
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,679
actual seed bank packaging but they're

1434
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,759
we had to like consolidate them when we

1435
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,440
were out there back home and like little

1436
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,960
dime bags and then we hand rode on

1437
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,519
everything and I don't know who kept all

1438
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,039
the packaging on that trip I know some

1439
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,679
of the packaging came back with us I

1440
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:23,318
know some the catalogs did too um and I

1441
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,919
kept the catalog myself you know was

1442
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:28,480
like a porn magazine I kept looked at

1443
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,599
all the time but uh as far as the

1444
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:34,079
packaging goes I can't remember um if it

1445
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,519
was if they're all basically the seat

1446
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,359
Bank packaging that we took back and H

1447
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:40,119
Kush is one of them or we just you know

1448
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:41,679
I just know that I we had a pack of H

1449
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:42,798
Kush that came from there that day and

1450
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,239
it was written

1451
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:48,358
on um and did any of the other packs you

1452
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,159
got end up turning into anything

1453
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:51,838
memorable or was it really just that

1454
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,159
Hindu Kush that ended up being the

1455
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:56,558
memorable one for obvious reasons no we

1456
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,318
were we did a bunch actually for there

1457
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,240
is definitely some prior to that we were

1458
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:04,000
doing some Northern Light 5 testing um

1459
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:07,039
we found a really nice early Pearl and a

1460
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,079
real nice Northern Light 5 Haze um that

1461
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,239
was actually a quick finisher like 70

1462
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:13,160
days or something and they you know the

1463
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:15,439
guys I was with they're all about the

1464
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:17,679
the big yields and the fastest finish

1465
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,079
they can get and and bang it out you

1466
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:21,399
know that's and basically trying to

1467
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,798
squeeze five six bouches a year so it

1468
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,760
was all about making the money you know

1469
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:27,440
I'm not going to lie um if if we had the

1470
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,960
opportunity back then in Florida was

1471
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,519
just that way if we had the opportunity

1472
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,079
like in California or Washington or

1473
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:33,480
place Hawaii or whatever where you could

1474
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,640
actually get away with growing upd door

1475
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,000
I'm sure we would have been more into

1476
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:40,759
the you know that side of it but it was

1477
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,838
all about crops you know making crop

1478
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,160
making money out of the crops and fast

1479
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:47,719
as possible these guys roll off for the

1480
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:49,759
speed clones and S you know genetics

1481
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:52,279
basically that were done in eight weeks

1482
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,920
nine weeks Max and then beyond that they

1483
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,079
pretty much give away or throw out um so

1484
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,639
we went went through a bunch of nl5 haze

1485
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:00,960
and only kept one um and some of the

1486
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:02,480
guys actually that had a little more

1487
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,880
patience than the guy I worked with and

1488
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,119
would actually do some of their stuff a

1489
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,880
little longer so when it came time to me

1490
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,680
buying some of the weed I didn't always

1491
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,640
get just our stuff my friend was getting

1492
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:15,078
it from his little like Co-op of friends

1493
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,199
that he had you know to get from so if I

1494
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:18,599
needed five six pounds a week one week

1495
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,558
and we didn't have any he would get it

1496
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,160
from somebody else for me and some of

1497
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,798
those guys grew that Haze way better

1498
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,719
than we did for whatever reason I'm sure

1499
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:28,239
they let it go longer like for us the

1500
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,759
guy would take it down in like 60 days

1501
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,759
and it was still like a lot of white

1502
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,640
hairs and just kind of like real hairy

1503
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,079
orangey in the bag type look other times

1504
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:37,358
it would go a little bit longer it

1505
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,160
seemed like it would swell up more maybe

1506
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:41,440
in the winter months or something but

1507
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:43,440
yeah we ran that a couple times we ran a

1508
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,440
northern light that was real short squat

1509
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,559
big fat leaves and it didn't yield that

1510
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,559
good um we found a a big skunk that was

1511
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:54,480
good they found a Shiva skunk that was

1512
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:56,359
good from that that was a huge yielder I

1513
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,280
didn't like the weed actually personally

1514
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:01,318
but a lot of people liked it and they

1515
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,280
sold tons of it because it made you know

1516
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:04,639
like giant plants for whatever reason I

1517
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,798
think you know like back then we were

1518
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,400
getting an average around two pounds of

1519
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:10,599
light and this this stuff for whatever

1520
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,639
reason was getting three pounds of light

1521
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:14,798
so it got all these guys all like

1522
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:17,318
psyched to grow that one um I didn't

1523
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:19,838
like it like I said and then there was

1524
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:21,639
uh what else comes to mind some of the

1525
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:23,798
genetics these guys had when I came on

1526
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:26,118
board were actually some of the better

1527
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:28,239
stuff still that I remember growing back

1528
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:30,039
then it was like the anald triangle the

1529
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,959
guy that we got the anald triangle from

1530
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:35,199
came from Washington State and he was

1531
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,720
probably 20 years older than me so he

1532
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:38,960
was 10 years older at all my crew but I

1533
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:40,598
think he might have been the guy that

1534
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,639
taught these guys the whole method of

1535
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:44,359
growing the nutrients and the whole

1536
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:45,639
setup basically because he brought it

1537
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:48,639
from Washington I want to say like

1538
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:51,838
around 86 or so 87 and that's when he

1539
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:54,039
took these genetics over here um so he

1540
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:56,078
was the one that gave these guys uh the

1541
00:54:54,039 --> 00:55:00,039
Emerald Triangle they had Williams

1542
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:03,119
Wonder they had clone big bud and I want

1543
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:05,960
to say the original G13 that we had came

1544
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,519
from him although I can't confirm that

1545
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,159
um but that one I've seen around Florida

1546
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,759
for years um what else there was a

1547
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:14,318
couple others he might have brought over

1548
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,880
but um yeah he was the one that

1549
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,639
basically started these guys I think in

1550
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,960
their path of you know how they did

1551
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:24,038
their thing wow that's that's so cool to

1552
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,720
hear what a what an awesome range of

1553
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:28,240
genetics that was sort of going around I

1554
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,598
want to quickly ask before we jump into

1555
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:31,358
the Emerald Triangle stuff cuz I know

1556
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,838
everyone's itching for it you mentioned

1557
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,440
Williams Wonder I'm a sucker for

1558
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:36,119
Williams Wonder I love it what was your

1559
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,280
memory of that special clone was it a

1560
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:43,000
good one I loved it it was uh it was the

1561
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,760
first time I've seen like real clumpy

1562
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,400
tallic stack you know like neon green

1563
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,440
colorful weed like that it was one of

1564
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,160
the first things i' seen growing

1565
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,599
actually the first house I went to trim

1566
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:55,679
um that I asked I was asked to go trim

1567
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,359
was I think it was a room of Williams

1568
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,480
Wonder and big bud and something else I

1569
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:01,838
can't remember um but yeah that was the

1570
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,719
first time I ever seen like a full 12

1571
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:05,480
light room going of anything I love

1572
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:07,759
smoking that stuff it was always

1573
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,079
tasty interesting that that's really

1574
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,920
cool to hear and the gentleman who you

1575
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,000
describe as like possibly the one who

1576
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,000
introduced your friends to the whole

1577
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,838
growing scene what was he like was he

1578
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,358
that typical old school like you know

1579
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:20,838
kept his head down didn't talk much

1580
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:23,000
about it or was he like willing to chat

1581
00:56:20,838 --> 00:56:24,719
to you a bit about things I never got to

1582
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,679
talk to him much I met him a couple

1583
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,639
times and my friends just like coming

1584
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:30,440
and going and and he my friend would

1585
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:33,000
tell me you know stories about him and

1586
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,960
who he was but he was to himself he I

1587
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,440
think he had like a 20 acre Plant Farm

1588
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,400
up in Palm Beach I want to say and one

1589
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,159
crazy story I do remember for sure about

1590
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:46,720
him was he had like a 30 or 40 light

1591
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:49,558
like steel building going with a propane

1592
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:51,118
going for CO2 and I guess the guy had a

1593
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,400
big plant nursery and this was like in

1594
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,079
the center of his property and it was

1595
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,440
next to a big lake that he had and I

1596
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,720
think something happened with a propane

1597
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,760
tank where it blew up the building like

1598
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,038
made way through a batch and the guy had

1599
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,839
like a bunch of excavators on the

1600
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:06,000
property and tractors and stuff and I

1601
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,558
heard that he pushed the entire building

1602
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,239
that night into the lake after like

1603
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,680
burned down or I don't know maybe it

1604
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,598
went out real quick or something but

1605
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,239
like the whole building imploded and he

1606
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,079
took his excavator and pushed it all

1607
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:18,639
into the lake and then buried that Lake

1608
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:19,280
a few days later and that was the last

1609
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:22,318
of

1610
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:25,599
it so that's that guy was pretty pretty

1611
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:27,358
heavy um and back then hearing about a

1612
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,720
40 lighter or whatever it was that he

1613
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:30,159
had it was just like holy [ __ ] that's

1614
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:33,118
crazy because 12 lights was already

1615
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:35,038
sketchy as can be wow yeah I can only

1616
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,838
imagine back at that time 40 lighter

1617
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,440
would have been Insanity so let's just

1618
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:40,960
quickly jump back to it then so you've

1619
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,159
got back from Amsterdam youve got these

1620
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,400
new genetics how did things progress

1621
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:48,118
from that point to when you eventually

1622
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,519
began involved in the house where uh you

1623
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:53,400
know you started popping some of those

1624
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:55,519
seeds such as the Hindu Kush

1625
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,280
um well

1626
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,960
basically once I got robbed by that guy

1627
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,880
and moved out I got myself a place maybe

1628
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,720
a mile away from that other girl house

1629
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:09,200
my friend had he actually own the house

1630
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:10,759
and uh once he let me start taking over

1631
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,838
and sharing a batch with him and started

1632
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,680
doing this thing up north I would start

1633
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:16,239
riding my bike there or drive we had a

1634
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:18,358
car par there every night like a decoy

1635
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,919
car but I I was able to ride my bike

1636
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:22,038
there even walk there if I wanted to so

1637
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,838
I started going there daily um taking

1638
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:26,119
care of the place he would still come

1639
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:27,159
down like once a week maybe twice a week

1640
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:30,160
some sometimes to make sure everything

1641
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:31,519
was cool and checking on me um check in

1642
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:34,519
on everything was going

1643
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:36,199
on um so yeah I was at that house that

1644
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:37,480
we would start popping those seeds and

1645
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:38,919
at this point I was like you know I was

1646
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,400
starting to get really into it and I was

1647
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,519
super intrigued to find new flavors all

1648
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,920
the time so I was probably more into it

1649
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:46,440
than these guys were as far as finding

1650
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,760
that new genetic and they normally would

1651
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,400
we had like a little space I'll explain

1652
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,079
how the room was set up eventually but

1653
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,240
we had a little space by our doorway

1654
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,559
where we had like a little space for

1655
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:56,798
four plants five plants Maybe

1656
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,079
and that's where we would do our testing

1657
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:59,719
at so we didn't even have like a

1658
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,160
dedicated area it was just kind of like

1659
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:03,480
a little extra space um we had a little

1660
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:05,118
closet somewhere where we would sex

1661
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,079
plants to see if they're male or female

1662
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,720
but then once they they were sex we

1663
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:10,160
would put them in there and test them

1664
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,239
and if they didn't turn out like

1665
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,639
phenomenal they would usually get canned

1666
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:17,399
like on the first batch or given away to

1667
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,038
somebody if they were good um so there's

1668
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,160
only like a handful that we really kept

1669
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,599
and like lots of stuff that I really we

1670
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:25,199
went through that I wish we kept like

1671
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:26,640
there was one called Hawaiian snow that

1672
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,118
to me was like the first time I ever

1673
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,118
seen a bag like squeeze the bag and it

1674
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:33,079
just leave like a super shiny shiny coat

1675
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,599
on the bag and it was like real neon

1676
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:37,880
green some sort of satif cross I can't

1677
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,359
remember what it was but they killed it

1678
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,640
immediately of course you know I had

1679
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,159
like head stashed of it for a while and

1680
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:44,920
got to enjoy maybe a half pound of it or

1681
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:46,719
something but that was one they killed

1682
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,838
off I wish they kept there was a handful

1683
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,519
and a bunch of them I think there was

1684
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:53,400
like a Northern Lights times skunk there

1685
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:55,000
was a you know handful of good ones that

1686
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,318
just never made the cut because like I

1687
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,318
said these guys were sticking to those

1688
00:59:57,318 --> 01:00:00,480
big yielders and you know they seem to

1689
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:02,480
be happy with what they already had

1690
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,199
seemed like for the most part that's

1691
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,440
interesting to hear yeah I can imagine

1692
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:09,078
that like stuff would have been quick to

1693
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,000
be C back in those days so what was who

1694
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:12,798
was it who decided to pop the seeds did

1695
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,480
did you have a feeling about these Hindu

1696
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:20,239
Kush seeds or how did that all go down

1697
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,679
um I don't exactly remember why I think

1698
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,439
they were just maybe next in line or

1699
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:25,159
something I know for a fact that like

1700
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,760
the one before that like when I first

1701
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:29,480
came out I wasn't 100% sure it was a

1702
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,440
Hindu I told a couple people that it was

1703
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,440
either Hindu or Northern Lights or a

1704
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,639
couple different things that I wasn't

1705
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,440
100% sure on but then once me and my

1706
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:38,000
friend Craig started talking about it

1707
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,400
all because he he was super into all

1708
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,880
these different genics like me he would

1709
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,440
come down and I had this little tackle

1710
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:47,160
box with like these little dividers and

1711
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,358
it kept like a real sealed um lid and I

1712
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:50,000
kept all these different flavors in

1713
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:52,078
there for I don't know why but it was

1714
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,318
just something at the time and he came

1715
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,599
down and we would basically go through

1716
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:58,318
these like little like mini Cannabis Cup

1717
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:01,880
and Sample them all out and Bong Hits

1718
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:04,639
and joints and so for sure he talked

1719
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,920
about the the seated Hindu Kush and the

1720
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:09,279
Hindu Kush that that we grew it was like

1721
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,760
there was like probably five plants

1722
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,160
there was like two real short mutant

1723
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,480
ones that had to like prop up off the

1724
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,318
ground because they weren't getting any

1725
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,960
light and there's two that were like

1726
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:19,199
kind of reaching up to the trellis so

1727
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,559
there was definitely not

1728
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:22,679
inconsistent as far as the G structure

1729
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:25,039
there's like I said there's almost like

1730
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:28,000
two indas and two almost like

1731
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:29,960
hybrid kind of leaning stretchy plants

1732
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,280
but whatever it was they all tasted just

1733
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,679
super different and incredible like I

1734
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,960
was so bumed and my friend killed them

1735
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:37,639
all off after he did because I would

1736
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,079
take him all home for some head stash

1737
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:41,679
grun or something if I you know if I had

1738
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:42,760
to but he basically killed them all off

1739
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,118
because he didn't want to take a chance

1740
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,839
of any more seeds coming out anywhere we

1741
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,000
we never found the hermit plant we

1742
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:50,759
basically just cut everything dried it

1743
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,599
and that's we found out the seeds were

1744
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,960
in there afterwards so I ended up taking

1745
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,519
I think those plants smoke basically and

1746
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,760
uh we killed off he killed off all the

1747
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:01,559
moms that we kept from seed and that was

1748
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,480
the last of the do basically but it was

1749
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:05,880
definitely different and Craig and I we

1750
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,278
had SE over for a while um that was

1751
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,160
probably you know cross with itself or

1752
01:02:08,278 --> 01:02:13,719
whatever and uh I had a seeds collection

1753
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:15,838
this hollow Coke can this years later

1754
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:17,519
this happened but this coke can had all

1755
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:19,480
these seeds from that batch and other

1756
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,239
batches theal triangle batches that were

1757
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,559
seated here and there just a collection

1758
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:26,519
I have from Amsterdam still from 93 when

1759
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:28,319
I went back and this girl I was dating

1760
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:30,000
at the time I went to like a on a surf

1761
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:31,880
trip and she was trying to like clean my

1762
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,079
house and like do me a favor and like

1763
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,760
surprised me and I come home and the

1764
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,318
Coke can was in the refrigerator and I

1765
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,079
guess she threw it out but she'll deny

1766
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:41,079
it to the day because she never admitted

1767
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:42,640
to it um but she was probably cleaning

1768
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:44,559
the house and tried to pop the can and

1769
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:45,679
it wouldn't open and she probably it

1770
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:48,480
looked like an old can and she just

1771
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:50,000
tossed it but that that can had so many

1772
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,880
good season and it's

1773
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,480
ridiculous die to have those things back

1774
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,039
that that sounds so there's like a lot

1775
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,039
of critical information in there I'd

1776
01:02:56,039 --> 01:03:01,160
love to get a few specifics so um you

1777
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,039
know for anyone who's not familiar like

1778
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:06,239
the the idea is that you know the TK um

1779
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:09,160
and OG Kush came from an accidental

1780
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:11,278
pollination involving this unknown clone

1781
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:13,879
called The Emerald Triangle and the

1782
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:16,039
Hindu Kush that we're speaking about so

1783
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,880
so just to confirm there was no males in

1784
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:21,520
the room it was it was a a hermy Polland

1785
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,798
never saw a male we never had SE before

1786
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,440
in in the Emerald Triangle and there's

1787
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:26,759
definitely no leaks because that was

1788
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,679
something that I was always warned and

1789
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,920
never open the doors and so there's you

1790
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:32,239
know there was no flashing lights in the

1791
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,200
room or anything we never found we never

1792
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:35,719
found a culprit so it had to be we just

1793
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:38,679
assumed it had to be from one of those

1794
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:40,038
plants that went hermy and I mean never

1795
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:42,038
even knew what a Herm me was at that

1796
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:44,880
point I was pretty young it was my first

1797
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:47,559
year really growing weed on that kind of

1798
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,400
scale and I had never really seen a Herm

1799
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:52,400
before that so didn't really know what

1800
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,880
to look for didn't know that some small

1801
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,318
plan like that can make so much pollen

1802
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:59,000
with pollen most of a room but the way

1803
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:01,159
the room was set up we had an AC um

1804
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,798
added to the room like a 5 ton AC unit

1805
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:05,639
and it was like 4 feet away from the

1806
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:09,559
door so in the way I gu the we had the

1807
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:12,199
fan set up so it circulated the room um

1808
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:13,519
like like cyclonic and apparently it

1809
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:15,000
just sucked all that pollen right

1810
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:16,519
directly into the AC vent and then

1811
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,358
spread across through the vents across

1812
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:20,480
the whole room so that was you know

1813
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:22,440
something we never thought about when we

1814
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,318
were testing C's there obviously at that

1815
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,760
point we obviously thought you know I

1816
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,519
only thought males could do that and so

1817
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,319
once we realized we had no males we

1818
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:33,880
thought we were good to go so yeah so

1819
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:35,838
based on what you're saying there was

1820
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,440
like quite a fair bit of seed produced

1821
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:40,679
in the overall crop well I was pretty

1822
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,559
consistently seated but some people said

1823
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:43,960
they found a shitload in there other

1824
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:47,000
people said they couldn't find but maybe

1825
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:49,358
one so it wasn't like really really

1826
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,920
spread across the room there's Craig

1827
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:52,358
remember had on a batch that was like

1828
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,920
said he opened up a butt and every

1829
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:56,400
single little Nugget had a seat in it so

1830
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,798
maybe that was closer to the vanent or

1831
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,480
to the the pollination or something but

1832
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:02,278
yeah it wasn't really really bad like

1833
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,278
like Alec Anderson for example the one

1834
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:05,798
who found the OG push seed he swears

1835
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:07,278
that there wasn't many seeds at all he

1836
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:09,639
had like I think he bought four ounces

1837
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:12,079
off Craig back then that came from me

1838
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,358
and uh out of out of those four ounces I

1839
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,839
think he said he found one or two seeds

1840
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,880
I want to say so he'll sit there and

1841
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:19,798
argue that it was not many seeds at all

1842
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,440
but that was definitely from the same B

1843
01:05:19,798 --> 01:05:24,838
weed yeah wow okay um sorry I'm going to

1844
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,920
have to keep pulling us back cuz there's

1845
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:30,038
so many interesting details here so um

1846
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,920
so when you talk about the Hindu having

1847
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:33,520
those two different sort of phenotypes

1848
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,159
generally speaking the squatter ones you

1849
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:37,000
had to prop up and the lankier ones

1850
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:39,038
those lankier ones did they sort of have

1851
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,719
a structure that resembled the OG and

1852
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,839
the TK to you that I can't remember I

1853
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:44,239
just know that they were really small

1854
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:45,719
plants when I put them in there there

1855
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,519
was kind of like last minute kind of

1856
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:50,558
thing I tossed them in um and they just

1857
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:51,960
kind of grew like single stock Bean pole

1858
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,160
and threw like little nuggets across the

1859
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,720
whole Branch um no sidearms really

1860
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:58,558
because I never really had a chance to

1861
01:05:55,719 --> 01:06:00,000
veg out much um so that's why I was

1862
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,039
really bu when to get to run him a

1863
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,480
second

1864
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:06,920
time sure and and in terms of the uh the

1865
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,400
smoke you know you said it was good

1866
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:12,278
smoke were there any of those four

1867
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,119
plants four five plants of the Hindu um

1868
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:15,760
when you smoked them was there anything

1869
01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:17,640
about them that reminded you of the OG

1870
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,160
or the TK or do you think maybe the end

1871
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:20,519
product is more reflective of the

1872
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:24,798
Emerald

1873
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:27,480
Triangle um it's hard to say it was a uh

1874
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:30,119
the Emerald Triangle had kind of like a

1875
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,318
much thicker structure and we we would

1876
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:35,400
top those and the way we grew was off

1877
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:37,239
the ground um I I'll get into that real

1878
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,880
quick the way the room was set up so

1879
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:40,838
this this I think it was brought from

1880
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,798
Washington also this blueprint of how we

1881
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:45,159
did everything with stolen power and a 5

1882
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:48,038
ton AC with 12 lights that particular

1883
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:49,879
nutrient brand and everything so we

1884
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:52,119
would get into a garage you know these

1885
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,278
guys did anyway I helped a couple later

1886
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:57,160
on but they would go into a clear garage

1887
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:58,559
um clean it out and then run a hose

1888
01:06:57,159 --> 01:07:00,480
across the floor and find where the

1889
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,960
water would puddle the most and then

1890
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,440
that's where they would drill like a

1891
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,599
half inch hole would go through the slab

1892
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,760
of the house to the ground and it would

1893
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,920
do like 12 or so holes in the room so

1894
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,799
basically once you set up the room the

1895
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,639
plants are grow on the ground and they

1896
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:17,278
would do drip to waste and the water

1897
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:19,759
would find its way to those holes and

1898
01:07:17,278 --> 01:07:24,119
that's basically how these room set up

1899
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:26,119
so off the ground um basically well

1900
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:29,119
first off they would set up

1901
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:31,079
three um garbage cans where like the

1902
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,318
stations with like a big Pickle Barrel

1903
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:34,960
where they would feed from and each one

1904
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:37,159
controlled 100 plants on the ground and

1905
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,920
there was a divider wall where the the

1906
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:40,358
barrels were and like the hose and

1907
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,318
everything was usually where the garage

1908
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:44,480
door was we build like a little divider

1909
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:48,558
wall and then beyond that was where the

1910
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,440
grow room was so those three um barrels

1911
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:53,880
would control 300 plants that would sit

1912
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:56,159
on the ground in rows in one gallon pots

1913
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,680
in clay Pebbles and we used to use these

1914
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,199
little skinny like black drippers um

1915
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:02,960
like a little spaghetti dripper they

1916
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:05,679
call it about then and we used to use

1917
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,440
common Home Depot timers like hardware

1918
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:10,159
store timers and run them at like every

1919
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,240
two hours for like one or two minutes I

1920
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:15,278
want to say so that's basically was the

1921
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:18,519
dripping the water the watering system

1922
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:22,399
the lighting we used to have these round

1923
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,600
um Chinese hat style hoods and you put

1924
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,599
them together and they end up being like

1925
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,159
four feet around and they had vertical

1926
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:32,159
lighting by then in those so we had

1927
01:08:29,158 --> 01:08:33,479
checkerboard highlight sodium um in

1928
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,798
those lights and they're super

1929
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:38,198
lightweight and you can control them

1930
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:40,838
from a single string so what we would do

1931
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:42,479
is at the doorway of the garage um we'd

1932
01:08:40,838 --> 01:08:45,479
have these like dock cleat where you

1933
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:47,119
could tie off to and each light had its

1934
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:49,798
own little pulley attached to the

1935
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:52,439
ceiling and so once we built the trellis

1936
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:54,838
in the room um you could control all the

1937
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:58,639
lights like height and low or whatever

1938
01:08:54,838 --> 01:09:00,079
from the doorway and basically that's

1939
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,480
how the lights were set up we had like

1940
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:07,238
two D minifiers up pie on the wall where

1941
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:11,119
the water just ran to the floor and we

1942
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:13,399
had a 5 ton AC and all this needed extra

1943
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:15,238
power so back then obviously everyone

1944
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,198
was stealing power like it was no big

1945
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:18,439
deal which was sketchy in itself because

1946
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,198
everybody knew that if you got caught

1947
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:22,158
just doing that you're facing some sort

1948
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:24,599
of federal felony by the power company

1949
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,399
and um they could you know cuu and all

1950
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,838
this stuff so that that part Al was

1951
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,798
sketchy but uh you could do 12 lights in

1952
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:33,119
Florida back then without stolen power

1953
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:35,479
unless you had like a

1954
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:38,519
mansion wow that's that's really

1955
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:40,919
interesting I mean gosh a lot I'm sure

1956
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,319
it's well thought out when you had those

1957
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,440
holes on the ground and the plants were

1958
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,880
on the ground did it not get like really

1959
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:51,599
cold uh I'm sure it did but you know it

1960
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:53,199
was Florida um so we like I said it was

1961
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,719
that was South Florida and it was hotter

1962
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:57,039
down there than than other places I've

1963
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:59,359
grown but um I don't seem to remember

1964
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,800
any issues all the Bates turn out pretty

1965
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:04,079
good in there and like the weed was

1966
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,239
always fire um as far as temp and I

1967
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:08,559
could see if you're up like in Northern

1968
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:09,919
like New York or up north that would

1969
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,120
probably be too cold on the ground you

1970
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,279
almost have to add heating or something

1971
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:15,479
to to the floor if you did it that way

1972
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:18,000
but Florida we didn't have that problem

1973
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:19,678
um and and going back to that room we

1974
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,600
didn't quite finish the trellis

1975
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,800
basically we would put these first

1976
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,880
strips of wood around the entire room

1977
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,960
two different levels and go around and

1978
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:30,199
attach little eye hooklets every like

1979
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,000
foot or so and then it would take two

1980
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:35,359
people we go in a room while the plants

1981
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,560
were small and have a roll of twine we

1982
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:38,279
would toss back and forth with each

1983
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,400
other and like Loop through the IH

1984
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:41,840
hookus and make like a weave trellis

1985
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:44,960
basically and we work our way and the

1986
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,520
two weave all the way out to the door it

1987
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,760
took a while but once we got to the door

1988
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,320
that was like the last time you could

1989
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,199
get in the room basically so once you

1990
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:53,679
got it all trell off so I mentioned that

1991
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:54,879
before in the past about the homemade

1992
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,199
trell weed to do because you could buy

1993
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,960
trellis back then um so basically this

1994
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:02,039
whole 12 light room was completely

1995
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,719
trellised off with two layers of Nets

1996
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:05,600
you know and then they didn't come down

1997
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:07,399
until Harvest basically that's a cool

1998
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,679
setup gosh you got me thinking I could

1999
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:11,238
probably integrate some of these

2000
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:13,760
practices into my

2001
01:11:11,238 --> 01:11:15,799
gr as far as the veg back then what we

2002
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,239
did was uh we would take clones into one

2003
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,520
inch cubes it was ruckles already around

2004
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:23,158
in the 80s um so we would put them in

2005
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,920
one inch cubes they would take like 400

2006
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:27,920
at a time to get 300 good ones and then

2007
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,079
they would go in a 3in cube with holes

2008
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,560
in them and then from there we didn't

2009
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:34,960
have grow tables back then so we built

2010
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,120
our own um so the mom room was built on

2011
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:40,239
these big wooden grow tables that had

2012
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:42,359
shower liner um on top of it like glued

2013
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,839
together to keep the water from leaking

2014
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:46,880
and uh they had like two or three th000

2015
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,319
watt lights in that room with big moms

2016
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:52,279
on in containers getting drip drippers

2017
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:54,639
with the Rocks then the small vegro

2018
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:57,439
where the the babies would go into was

2019
01:11:54,639 --> 01:12:00,199
like a like a bit probably like a 8 by 4

2020
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:02,319
by8 table they built with wood Lightwood

2021
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:04,439
with sides and they also Ed the shower

2022
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:06,039
liner on that too and they would be on a

2023
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:09,198
tilt and they would put all the the

2024
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:11,719
3inch cubes on there with a th watt over

2025
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:13,399
those and to water them they would just

2026
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:14,760
you know dump water down one side of the

2027
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:15,879
table and it would run down through all

2028
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,560
the plants to the other side of the

2029
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,960
drain we had so we would get them like

2030
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,520
about a foot tall in there pretty much

2031
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,719
before they would go into the main room

2032
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,440
and that's when they would go into the

2033
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:27,079
one gallon pots with the rocks and the

2034
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:29,158
drippers and they would get pretty good

2035
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:30,800
size in those 3in cubes I mean they'd be

2036
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:32,079
fully white Roots you know busting out

2037
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,079
of the bottom of them you know by the

2038
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:36,800
time you put them in the Rocks um so and

2039
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:38,119
then we would start off with the lights

2040
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,360
all the way up at the ceiling when we

2041
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:41,198
put first put them in there because back

2042
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:43,279
then there was no dimming or whatever so

2043
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:44,638
we we're using thousand watt lights so

2044
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,198
we kept them all the way at the ceiling

2045
01:12:44,639 --> 01:12:49,079
and the lights would know work the way

2046
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:50,319
down first week you know slowly bring

2047
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:54,559
them down off the

2048
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:57,439
pulley nice nice and I'd love to ask you

2049
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:59,800
before I forget tell me a bit about um

2050
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:01,000
the Emerald Triangle strain itself you

2051
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,960
know I think a lot of people would be

2052
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,600
really interested in that one do you did

2053
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,760
you see like how would you describe it

2054
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,600
was it a Kush type plant was it a more

2055
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:14,039
lanky plant what's your

2056
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,120
recollection uh well the first time I I

2057
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:17,719
used to buy it before I seen it growing

2058
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:21,279
for a couple years so I know it was

2059
01:13:17,719 --> 01:13:22,439
around before I ever seen the grow um

2060
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:24,479
these guys were growing probably think

2061
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:27,759
from like ' 868 s or whatever when that

2062
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,359
Guy brought the genetics to Florida um

2063
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,480
so that one off the floor off the one

2064
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:34,920
gon pots top of the pot would grow to be

2065
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:37,919
about four foot tall on average maybe a

2066
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:40,319
little bit taller um we topped it and it

2067
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:43,679
would grow four or five heads but there

2068
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:46,079
were thicker stems and definitely way

2069
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,158
bigger leaves than any of the triangle

2070
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:49,920
or ogs that I've seen actually I've seen

2071
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:52,599
a couple big leads on some of the ogs

2072
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,920
but this these seem to get pretty big

2073
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:58,600
and as far as smell I se remember it

2074
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:01,239
definitely had more of a floral sweet

2075
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,639
scent to it it was definitely super good

2076
01:14:01,238 --> 01:14:05,718
it had like more of a candy kind of

2077
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:07,719
leaning turs I want to say um and

2078
01:14:05,719 --> 01:14:09,119
knowing where it came from you know all

2079
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:10,840
the story since then there's a good

2080
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:13,000
chance it has some Northern Lights in it

2081
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,400
because I mean that's the Northwest up

2082
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,920
there in Washington we got to give them

2083
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:20,158
props because first off that's where

2084
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:21,520
most of nor lights came from um you know

2085
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:22,960
I've heard multiple stories now

2086
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,600
basically that's where they originally

2087
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,198
origin from and even Neville supposedly

2088
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,639
got a lot of his seeds from there that

2089
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:32,198
he took back to Amsterdam and started

2090
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:36,400
breeding with also um from the Northwest

2091
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:38,839
was uh Emerald Triangle um from auson

2092
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:40,839
and then there's years prior there's

2093
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:44,319
this cryptonite strand here in Florida

2094
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,039
that was the rumors uh that the Clone

2095
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:48,759
came from Seattle area as well from like

2096
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:50,800
a scientist that worked at a college

2097
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:53,960
there or something um that was more of

2098
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,079
an 80s genetic but uh yeah there's

2099
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,239
definitely been a lot of stuff coming

2100
01:14:55,079 --> 01:14:59,840
from that zone between there and Santa

2101
01:14:57,238 --> 01:15:01,678
Cruz and their triangle of California

2102
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,920
that whole Pacific Northwest out there

2103
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,079
you definitely got to give him credit

2104
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,158
for a lot of the stuff a lot of it went

2105
01:15:05,079 --> 01:15:10,840
full circle to Amsterdam to Florida and

2106
01:15:07,158 --> 01:15:12,359
back and whatever um but the perfect

2107
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,319
salad came together in the house that we

2108
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:15,799
were

2109
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:17,679
growing yeah no huge credit to the

2110
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,199
Pacific Northwest they they've done a

2111
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:22,000
lot some of my favorite strains like the

2112
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:24,399
blue meoo come from that area so huge

2113
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,238
huge work done there by those guys I

2114
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,599
guess I'd be interested in terms of the

2115
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:33,039
Emerald Triangle itself if you had to

2116
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:35,280
pick do you feel like the OG and the TK

2117
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:37,119
lean more towards the Emerald Triangle

2118
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,920
maybe the Hindu or like some sort of

2119
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:41,079
unique combo of the two that's not

2120
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:44,119
necessarily like one or the

2121
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:45,960
other H it's definitely a mix because

2122
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:47,679
the emerald definitely wasn't making

2123
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,279
like popcorn nuggets I don't remember it

2124
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,079
was more like Spears like bigger spear

2125
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:53,880
Buds and like I said it definitely was a

2126
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:56,238
bigger yielder and and definitely bigger

2127
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,840
stems I remember we used to have to use

2128
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:01,158
like um yard loppers to cut them down

2129
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,840
they get so fat you know versus like the

2130
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:05,039
TKA and the OG you can cut them down

2131
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,880
almost almost with scissors at times um

2132
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,920
so there's that it definitely made

2133
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,000
bigger leaves because it was actually

2134
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,079
some of the bigger leaves I remember

2135
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,719
seeing at the time growing at all stuff

2136
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:18,198
we were growing at that particular

2137
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:20,239
moment or air um but like yeah I really

2138
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:22,158
can't say as far as like the gassy notes

2139
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:26,119
I can't I don't remember it having too

2140
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:27,799
much gas to it now the the Hindu um I

2141
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:29,319
can't remember I can't pinpoint if those

2142
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,960
were gassy or not either but they are

2143
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:35,158
extremely different than anything we had

2144
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:37,079
or smoked before um so you know the the

2145
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:39,319
fact that I I kind of Point towards

2146
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:40,800
those is because like years later in the

2147
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:42,359
last few years there's a lot of

2148
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,880
information came out from like Neville

2149
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:48,119
himself and other people um that have

2150
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:51,800
claimed that his Hindu Kush work was

2151
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:52,920
basically nl2 cross with Kush 4 I've

2152
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,000
heard a couple other different stories

2153
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,679
too too but they always included

2154
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,039
Northern life Tye genetics so there's

2155
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,719
that yeah yeah I I've heard some of

2156
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:03,880
those comments as well so you know I

2157
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:06,359
think that's reasonable I'd be

2158
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:08,840
interested to know so when you did this

2159
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:10,759
crop was it basically like a room full

2160
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:13,119
of Emerald Triangle plus these Hindu

2161
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:15,239
plants or is were there other plants in

2162
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:16,920
the room like were you doing a mix sort

2163
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:20,238
of thing or how was the

2164
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:21,760
setup we try to do one main genetic at a

2165
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:24,079
time for whatever reason I think just

2166
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,679
based on how big our moms were that we

2167
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,238
had and we only had limited space and uh

2168
01:17:26,679 --> 01:17:30,158
this group of guys would pass genetics

2169
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:32,039
around the tribe between us and we would

2170
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:33,439
grow out two or three big moms of them

2171
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:35,840
and then that would be the one that we

2172
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:37,879
would take clowns off of for example so

2173
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,480
for whatever reason that room I did was

2174
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,639
all Emerald Triangle it was like 300

2175
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:45,279
anal triangle plants and then those five

2176
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:47,159
or six uh hinges ah interesting okay so

2177
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:49,800
when you got to the end of the Harvest

2178
01:17:47,158 --> 01:17:52,238
and you're seeing there's these seeds in

2179
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,480
the bud were there enough seeds that you

2180
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:55,279
thought oh this is going to to affect

2181
01:17:53,479 --> 01:17:56,919
the ticket or was it like you know you

2182
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:59,880
couldn't really tell unless you cracked

2183
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:02,239
it open and did you pop any of those

2184
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,400
seeds um it definitely affected the

2185
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:06,279
ticket and the owner of the house my

2186
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:09,039
partner he was definitely pissed off at

2187
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:11,039
first um because in his mind we were

2188
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,880
taking away tons of weight from the

2189
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,560
plants focusing on energy towards making

2190
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,679
seeds so he always had this set thing in

2191
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,080
his mind where he had to get at least

2192
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:20,679
you know like 24 PBS per room two pounds

2193
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:22,479
per light or he was pissed off type

2194
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:24,639
thing and I think that room ended up

2195
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:28,000
being the like 20 pounds or whatever I

2196
01:18:24,639 --> 01:18:29,600
want to say um so yeah he was pissed but

2197
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,719
at the same time I sold it all

2198
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,560
immediately to my buddy Craig up in

2199
01:18:31,719 --> 01:18:37,960
Orlando and to my buddy Mike Luke up in

2200
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,320
that same area too and uh so luckily

2201
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:42,439
that's who got those because was Craig's

2202
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:44,399
friends that would end up finding the TK

2203
01:18:42,439 --> 01:18:47,519
and the ogc later

2204
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:48,759
on yeah okay I mean I want to hear about

2205
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,320
that but I want to quickly ask did you

2206
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,679
pop any of those seeds immediately or

2207
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:53,439
did you sort of just put it on the back

2208
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,440
burner and then yeah tell tell us a bit

2209
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,198
about how the weed went from there and

2210
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,799
where the seeds ended up

2211
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:01,399
going I personally didn't pop a lot of

2212
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,079
those seeds a lot of those seeds end up

2213
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:04,599
going into that cook pan like I talked

2214
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:06,359
about I collected thousands of them and

2215
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:08,760
I had like this huge ziplock baggy of

2216
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:09,839
them um I never had a chance to pop many

2217
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:13,199
of them because like I said they got

2218
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,719
tossed out a couple years later um I had

2219
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:16,759
a few friends that tried popping some

2220
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:19,119
here and there I don't remember anything

2221
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:20,440
that came out like super keeper style

2222
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:23,158
we've you know seen some stuff that had

2223
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:27,039
similar structure maybe to the OG and TP

2224
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:29,759
like round popcorn like a acorn shaped

2225
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:32,079
like clumpy nuggets you know dra up the

2226
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,440
main shaft and had that same pushy look

2227
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:35,719
to it but definitely wasn't like super

2228
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:40,759
dank like some of the stuff we already

2229
01:19:35,719 --> 01:19:42,359
had at the time also there was a well

2230
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:43,760
there was another strain I'll get into

2231
01:19:42,359 --> 01:19:46,679
that story as well but there was another

2232
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:49,480
strain that came into our group called

2233
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:51,199
The Hatch plant and went by um so

2234
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:53,638
basically this was like a couple years

2235
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:56,479
later it's like 93

2236
01:19:53,639 --> 01:19:58,279
94 um so a friend of mine one day called

2237
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:00,238
me up and he's telling me he has this

2238
01:19:58,279 --> 01:20:01,238
plan at his house that his [ __ ]

2239
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:02,959
girlfriend wanted out of there

2240
01:20:01,238 --> 01:20:05,678
immediately so he like asked me to come

2241
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,319
over and get it if I would um I guess he

2242
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:09,960
knew I agree with the time it's kind of

2243
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:11,559
reason why he asked so I went over there

2244
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,158
his place it was this little ceiling

2245
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,880
that was probably like six inches tall

2246
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:17,359
and like a solo cup so I took it and he

2247
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,960
swore that it came from some of the best

2248
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:21,279
weed he's ever seen in his life some of

2249
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,840
the stinkiest [ __ ] ever and I had to try

2250
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:25,479
it I had to make sure I didn't kill it

2251
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,679
whatever so I took good care of it for a

2252
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:29,839
minute I took it to my friend's house

2253
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,639
that Grove at this point in time I had

2254
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,000
moved on I was doing my own thing and

2255
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:34,480
and like we stopped doing the

2256
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,198
partnership thing together but I was

2257
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:38,279
still helping them do the triming and

2258
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:40,759
helping them sell the weed so I took

2259
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:43,439
this plan over there um to his place and

2260
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:45,400
I set it off the side in the mom room

2261
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:47,279
and I came back a couple days later and

2262
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:48,920
it was gone and I asked him like where I

2263
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:50,599
went he said he tossed it in the trash

2264
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,520
because it had this like mutated looking

2265
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,600
leaf and he usually thought that this

2266
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:57,280
kind of SE linges were [ __ ] so he didn't

2267
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:59,560
want it anymore so he's threw the trash

2268
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:01,079
on me so I go to the trash which had

2269
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,800
like the lid was half open still and

2270
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:05,079
there's like light getting in there and

2271
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,560
I pull it out it's still alive it's like

2272
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:10,039
trying to grow through some debris in

2273
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,600
the trash can I take it home with me and

2274
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:13,399
it did have a weird Lea but I nurs it

2275
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,920
back to heal to where it started growing

2276
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:18,879
normal leaves again uh so at this place

2277
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:20,600
in point in time I had two lights at

2278
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,440
this house I lived in and it was just

2279
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:25,719
more for like Hobby and personal stash

2280
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:27,439
and facing bills and once that plant got

2281
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:29,639
big enough to take enough clones to fill

2282
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:32,678
the two lights up with I flowered It Out

2283
01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:34,760
by itself and it ended up being some

2284
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:38,000
super stinky like really really good

2285
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:39,960
weed just like the guy said um but it

2286
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,719
made its own seeds for whatever reason

2287
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:44,960
there was no other plants there that did

2288
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:47,399
it there was no light leaks nothing um

2289
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,239
it made you know probably 10 20 seeds

2290
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:52,439
per plant or whatever it was small

2291
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:55,479
amount and uh those seeds would go on

2292
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:57,519
the be some of the stinkiest best weed I

2293
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:59,479
have ever seen to this day and I would

2294
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,920
literally almost like trade my truck

2295
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:03,198
right now on heartbeat for anyone one of

2296
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:05,560
those that we had that's how good they

2297
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,559
were um I know we're jumping around all

2298
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:10,320
over the place time time frame whatever

2299
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,800
but just going talking about met here um

2300
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:14,599
so anyway that that particular variety

2301
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,800
we never ran in the big rooms because we

2302
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:20,000
knew it made seeds but I kept it around

2303
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,440
anyways for personal and those seeds

2304
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,639
from that for whatever reason I decided

2305
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:26,799
to start popping um once I bought my own

2306
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:29,039
house like a year later 20 or no

2307
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,480
1994 U I bought my own house up in

2308
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:33,639
Jupiter and we started going through

2309
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:35,399
those seeds and it took a long time to

2310
01:22:33,639 --> 01:22:37,840
realize it and we named a bunch of them

2311
01:22:35,399 --> 01:22:39,479
with numbers it was like HP4 and nine

2312
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,279
and a bunch of different numbers and

2313
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:43,559
pass them around and like some of the

2314
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:46,479
best stuff they ever the number four was

2315
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:49,159
this like skinny Leaf Jagged sharp edge

2316
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:51,599
with like leaves almost like razor sharp

2317
01:22:49,158 --> 01:22:52,960
almost like a soft tooth or something um

2318
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,840
and I've never seen plant with like that

2319
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,279
before and that was the best one of them

2320
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,199
all and it happened to be the one that

2321
01:22:56,279 --> 01:23:00,960
got some sort of virus like within a

2322
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:03,198
year or two and died off unfortunately

2323
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,359
um that was my favorite um there's three

2324
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:07,479
or four others that went on to be like

2325
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:09,799
extremely stinky and good that like

2326
01:23:07,479 --> 01:23:11,079
people would grow it and almost almost I

2327
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,880
like run with the law immediately

2328
01:23:11,079 --> 01:23:16,559
because it was just so strong so come to

2329
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:19,719
find out years later I ran into the guy

2330
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,560
that the original seat came from and he

2331
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:23,520
we were at a strip club one I we're

2332
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:25,520
drinking out conversation about this

2333
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,320
stuff told him a story about that

2334
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,639
seeding he laughed he's like you know

2335
01:23:27,319 --> 01:23:31,279
what that was from a super skunk cross

2336
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:33,760
with a hatch plant that made its own

2337
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:35,920
seeds for some reason the room made a

2338
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:39,360
few seeds and like that's where your

2339
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:41,480
buddy found that seed from so yeah it

2340
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:42,960
was actually Super Skunk cross with

2341
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:44,359
hashplant I don't know where the seed

2342
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,719
came from he didn't know where it came

2343
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:49,319
from but everything that that those

2344
01:23:47,719 --> 01:23:50,760
seeds you know almost everything we

2345
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:52,719
popped out of those seeds whereas like

2346
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,000
keeper style there's probably a hand

2347
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,679
that weren't but like the majority of

2348
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,158
the ones we kept were just some of the

2349
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,119
alltime my alltime favorites um and

2350
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,399
there might be one still around this day

2351
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,599
that somebody made seeds with I'm trying

2352
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:06,920
to track down and uh we just had a hard

2353
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:08,679
time finding us so far yeah shout out

2354
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,520
get in touch with Marty if you know

2355
01:24:08,679 --> 01:24:13,520
anything that sounds cool

2356
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:16,000
man so I I mean I'd love to know what

2357
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,679
was the path from you know the point of

2358
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,560
your first sale to I believe you said

2359
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:24,119
Craig and another guy how did that then

2360
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,560
transition into having t the OG to the

2361
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:29,158
best of your

2362
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:31,679
knowledge well uh that seated B ofo

2363
01:24:29,158 --> 01:24:34,679
triangle that happened in 1991 that was

2364
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:37,359
the year I was living on that house um

2365
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:39,840
and at that point Craig was coming down

2366
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:41,679
and getting stuff from me directly and

2367
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,960
or I would bring up stuff to him

2368
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,719
sometimes maybe few mon five or 10 pack

2369
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,079
on the front if he didn't have the cash

2370
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:51,439
for it and we had a working relationship

2371
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:53,559
like that um so at some point in time he

2372
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:55,638
got a hold of like 10 of those seated

2373
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,119
pounds took him back up there and his

2374
01:24:55,639 --> 01:25:00,560
dad at the time was helping him sell the

2375
01:24:58,118 --> 01:25:03,479
weed his dad had a karate studio in a

2376
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,239
surf shop and had a lot of clientele and

2377
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:07,599
Surfer friends that smoked so they had a

2378
01:25:05,238 --> 01:25:10,079
lot of people they sold to um so they

2379
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,920
sold you know three four pounds every

2380
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,519
couple days basically piecing them out

2381
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:16,000
so they would go through a 10 pack in a

2382
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:20,080
week or two weeks pretty fast that then

2383
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:23,679
um so it was out of that batch that

2384
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:26,399
Craig um had sold to his good friend who

2385
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:28,719
I met a couple times over the years and

2386
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:31,039
he's the guy that found the TK and

2387
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,560
another guy was Alec Anderson which I

2388
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:35,679
never met him back in the day but or

2389
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:37,719
never heard of him really until recently

2390
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:39,158
but um he also had bought a quarter

2391
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:40,520
pound the other guy bought like a pound

2392
01:25:39,158 --> 01:25:42,679
or a couple pounds of it and found a

2393
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:44,800
bunch of seeds the guy Alec Anderson

2394
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:47,480
only found one or two seeds from like

2395
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,119
four ounces um so the other guy was one

2396
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:52,759
that found the TK um he's the one that

2397
01:25:50,118 --> 01:25:55,679
first told us many many years ago like

2398
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:57,840
mid 90s that like he got a hold of Craig

2399
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:59,158
and like hey I found this killer seed in

2400
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,719
that batch of ammo triangle that you

2401
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:03,559
guys had years ago a couple years ago

2402
01:26:01,719 --> 01:26:05,520
and popped a couple seeds out of it and

2403
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,880
I found this super keeper you guys

2404
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:11,239
should check out and that was around the

2405
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:13,760
time that he had brought Craig a fresh

2406
01:26:11,238 --> 01:26:16,238
plant of it that was like just cut down

2407
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,560
shoved into a brown bag like took a

2408
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:19,359
couple these off it but there's like

2409
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:21,199
stem and everything was in there and I

2410
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:23,960
drove up from Jupiter where I was living

2411
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:27,079
at the time like an hour drive and went

2412
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:28,480
to Craig's house and basically thinking

2413
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:30,238
I was going to get some weed to smoke

2414
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:31,718
and it was this wet plant we could we

2415
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,599
had to split up and like dry it out

2416
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:34,760
ourselves and smoke it so his whole

2417
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,119
theory was we'll give you a quarter

2418
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:39,119
pound we'll dry out to an ounce and uh

2419
01:26:37,118 --> 01:26:41,079
me and me and Craig shared it and split

2420
01:26:39,118 --> 01:26:42,719
it and it ended up just being fire

2421
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:44,519
regardless I was smoking on it when it

2422
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,760
was still wet like little little hits of

2423
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:48,280
it in the bong and it was just so tasty

2424
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:51,079
um and we knew right away we had to have

2425
01:26:48,279 --> 01:26:53,319
it but he told us right away that it was

2426
01:26:51,079 --> 01:26:55,039
it was super skin skinny growing it

2427
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:57,118
didn't make much and I don't expect much

2428
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:59,719
of a yield from it type thing so that's

2429
01:26:57,118 --> 01:27:02,319
we went into it looking at like that um

2430
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:04,399
so shortly after that happened he had

2431
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:07,158
brought Craig some clones of it and I

2432
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,638
drove up to grab some um and I met the

2433
01:27:07,158 --> 01:27:11,039
guy at Craig house a couple times he

2434
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,880
stood out to me then because he was he

2435
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:15,719
was a tattoo artist and he actually

2436
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:18,000
worked in Orlando at then cornbread

2437
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:20,600
cornbread Ricky tattoo parlor out there

2438
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,319
in Orlando um which I never met those

2439
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,199
guys till years later but I met this guy

2440
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:27,238
that found the TK seed and he was a

2441
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,079
tattoo artist and basically that's I met

2442
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:31,599
him at Craigs house multiple times and

2443
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:34,118
stood out to me so later when all this

2444
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,280
stuff came out five years ago um Craig

2445
01:27:34,118 --> 01:27:38,158
and I started talking and at first Craig

2446
01:27:36,279 --> 01:27:40,238
had all totally forgot that it was that

2447
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:41,920
guy and he was for some reason thinking

2448
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:44,839
it was Alec Anderson that gave us our

2449
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,480
cut which I had never even met Alec so I

2450
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,000
had to like refresh his memory and

2451
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:49,399
immediately he you know he thought back

2452
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,600
and like felt like an idiot because I

2453
01:27:49,399 --> 01:27:52,759
think he went public a couple times and

2454
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:56,159
told people came from

2455
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:58,440
the triangle but it wasn't um so yeah he

2456
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:00,079
fixed his he fixed all that his in his

2457
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,479
memory bank and we've we've laughed

2458
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,960
about it since then and we've gone over

2459
01:28:01,479 --> 01:28:05,799
all the stuff but um it was definitely

2460
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:08,399
this other guy who doesn't really want

2461
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,840
his name to be told anymore and I guess

2462
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:13,719
you know for whatever reason he's just

2463
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:16,800
kind of to himself and quiet so um yeah

2464
01:28:13,719 --> 01:28:19,719
that's how that went yeah wow okay so so

2465
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,400
you actually had the the TK quite early

2466
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:23,319
or how how long would it have been after

2467
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:25,920
it was found did you get it

2468
01:28:23,319 --> 01:28:27,840
then it was a couple years I think he's

2469
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:31,760
I want to say they found it right

2470
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:34,719
afterwards probably around 92 93 92 or

2471
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:37,880
something um I don't think I got it till

2472
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:39,039
I moved into my house in Jupiter in 94 I

2473
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:42,039
didn't think I got it to like the year

2474
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:45,880
after that so 95 996 I think is when I

2475
01:28:42,039 --> 01:28:49,158
got it me and Craig both interesting

2476
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:51,239
okay and then when did you hear about

2477
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:53,039
the this you know the OG Kush found by

2478
01:28:51,238 --> 01:28:55,079
Alec

2479
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:57,198
that was many years later that was uh

2480
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:59,840
that wasn't until I created my first

2481
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:01,319
Instagram account it kind of went public

2482
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:04,840
um and at that point I only knew about

2483
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:07,599
the triangle being related to me um and

2484
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:10,520
then my buddy Miami mango made a comment

2485
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,239
on his post on Instagram at this point I

2486
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,400
was living in Central America kind of

2487
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:16,279
like Lan low had I had an art page

2488
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:18,198
because I was sound art and that was the

2489
01:29:16,279 --> 01:29:20,399
only I had on Instagram but then one day

2490
01:29:18,198 --> 01:29:22,279
I started getting all these random like

2491
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:23,599
cannabis accounts following me for

2492
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:26,679
whatever reason I had like a 100 new

2493
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,560
followers that day I didn't know why

2494
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:29,760
then he goes by Miami mango everyone

2495
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,320
knows him as I'm sure you know him as

2496
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,600
that too um I grew up with him in South

2497
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:36,158
Florida like going way back to like 11th

2498
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,840
grade I've known him that long and we

2499
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:40,599
used to SED each other occasionally here

2500
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:42,639
and there and uh he kind of ousted me on

2501
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,320
one of his posts talking about triangle

2502
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:47,319
cush and mentioned my art page on his

2503
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:49,279
weed page and that's where all those

2504
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:51,000
followers came from so that's kind of

2505
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,559
how I came out and at first I was a

2506
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,039
little bit mad about it you know I was

2507
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,679
kind of eggy um didn't really want to be

2508
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:58,880
part of the scene yet didn't really care

2509
01:29:56,679 --> 01:30:02,279
for it we were happy Liv in Lan low in

2510
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:04,560
Central America and uh he taught me into

2511
01:30:02,279 --> 01:30:06,679
creating an account on Instagram and

2512
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:09,719
like you know joining in with him

2513
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:12,199
whatever and causing a ruckus so that

2514
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:13,639
was when I created Origins DK and that

2515
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:17,039
was the first name I came up with when I

2516
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:19,440
created the account basically um so it

2517
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:21,118
was after that that I started meeting

2518
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:23,638
people through through him for example

2519
01:30:21,118 --> 01:30:25,639
he introduced me to JH D and he told me

2520
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:27,840
about this train that Josh D had called

2521
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:30,000
the OG Kush that he thought was very

2522
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,319
similar to the triangle Kush and that I

2523
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,238
should maybe meet him and see if we

2524
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:36,840
could figure that out so at that point

2525
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:39,000
in time shortly after I created Origins

2526
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:42,400
Josh and I started talking he invited me

2527
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:45,880
and my fiance to California to go visit

2528
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:47,399
his farm in h Santa Barbara So Charlie

2529
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,560
after that we did that and that's when I

2530
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:51,599
met Josh and we started trading stories

2531
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:53,639
and um that's about the time I started

2532
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,520
seeing seen or hearing podcast with Alec

2533
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:57,079
Anderson and talking about Bubba

2534
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,520
bringing the cut out from him out to

2535
01:30:57,079 --> 01:31:01,559
Florida from Florida to California to

2536
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,400
Josh and you know I did all the research

2537
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,560
and talking to Josh back and forth

2538
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:06,759
that's where I learned more and more

2539
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,000
about all that um and it wasn't until

2540
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:10,320
even a couple years after all that

2541
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,600
before we put more pieces together where

2542
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:14,479
like Alec Anderson finally admitted that

2543
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,920
the seed came from us because at first

2544
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:18,959
he was making up different stories

2545
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:21,960
saying that it was a it was a plant that

2546
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,719
died and somebody that died that had

2547
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,118
plant so he kind of like dead ended the

2548
01:31:23,719 --> 01:31:28,319
story there you know and then years

2549
01:31:26,118 --> 01:31:31,279
later it came out on another Adam dun

2550
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:33,000
show that Mii mango and my buddy Craig

2551
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:34,519
actually called in on and they started

2552
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,960
talking to Alec in person it was the

2553
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:39,600
crippy episode and on that episode Alec

2554
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:41,000
was like oh man I didn't want to say any

2555
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,880
names or whatever and I was being

2556
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,319
respectful towards you know the surfer

2557
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:49,840
code and basically he admitted that that

2558
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:52,559
seed came from our weed um my weed from

2559
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:55,319
Craig basically back in the day

2560
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:57,080
wow him coming out and and admitting all

2561
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:59,198
that just kind of like put it all you

2562
01:31:57,079 --> 01:32:01,559
know that piece of the puzzle together I

2563
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:04,000
already known from from Josh's side of

2564
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:08,000
the story about how um he got the cut

2565
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,198
from Matt Bubba Burger who somehow got

2566
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,479
it from I think there was a story I

2567
01:32:10,198 --> 01:32:13,198
haven't talked too much to Alec but

2568
01:32:11,479 --> 01:32:14,238
there's a story on one of the podcast he

2569
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:16,118
talked about where one of his old

2570
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,678
roommates had like robbed him at

2571
01:32:16,118 --> 01:32:19,679
gunpoint for some of their genetics or

2572
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:22,239
something um and then it was like a

2573
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,440
mutual friend of him and B that had

2574
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:25,959
gotten a hold of those genetics or

2575
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:28,319
something like that and so Bubba had

2576
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,800
taken him from there um I guess I guess

2577
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:31,960
he was already living in California and

2578
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:34,840
he was teamed up with Josh somehow in

2579
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,039
Hollywood in AO and they're growing a

2580
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,520
few different things out there but

2581
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:39,319
Bubba's like hey I got these genetics

2582
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,280
and Florida Ang go grab that would just

2583
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:43,279
blow the stuff away he was talking about

2584
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:45,519
a fish plant that he had out here so he

2585
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:47,039
came out in Florida and he grabbed a few

2586
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,719
cuts of it along with a couple other

2587
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:50,760
things they had here and brought them

2588
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,880
back out to their grow and that's how

2589
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:55,119
Josh got a hold of it

2590
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,520
and that's where the story started in La

2591
01:32:55,118 --> 01:33:00,519
like at that point it was only called

2592
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:02,040
Kush and according to Kenji and be real

2593
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,600
and Josh and some of the other people

2594
01:33:02,039 --> 01:33:06,560
involved once it made it way out there

2595
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:09,480
it became like super popular because it

2596
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:11,679
was really really good and basically

2597
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:14,559
they started touching Crazy Prices like

2598
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:17,840
talking like $800 an ounce some some uh

2599
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:20,480
predicaments so because of that people

2600
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,119
started naming everything Kush seeing if

2601
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:24,638
they can get higher prices stuff

2602
01:33:22,118 --> 01:33:26,319
according to Josh and these guys um and

2603
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:28,279
so because of that they had to change

2604
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:32,359
the name and that's when the OG thing

2605
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:36,679
started um OG being for original and

2606
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:38,920
that was Josh and Bubba and Kenji and a

2607
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:40,039
couple other friends and be real is

2608
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:43,158
doing

2609
01:33:40,039 --> 01:33:45,760
Bly and like how does it feel to see

2610
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:48,519
like the way these two strains have gone

2611
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:51,560
on to like become like top tier list of

2612
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:53,840
every smoker out there oh it's super

2613
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:55,320
super cool super humbling for sure I get

2614
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,920
a lot of people that are super

2615
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:59,639
appreciative of it all I get a lot of

2616
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:01,359
thank yous all the time and um just

2617
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:02,279
really warm welcoming for the most part

2618
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:03,719
you know there's been a couple

2619
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:05,118
characters that I've had some runin with

2620
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:07,359
here and there but for the most part

2621
01:34:05,118 --> 01:34:09,719
everyone's been really cool Josh and his

2622
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:12,158
whole pack that I met we've become like

2623
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:13,800
really close friends since then um he

2624
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:17,719
was actually just visiting my place in

2625
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:19,400
Central America last week um and he he

2626
01:34:17,719 --> 01:34:20,319
had a place down there as well himself

2627
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:22,719
for

2628
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:24,599
years um for some just random reason he

2629
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:26,239
doesn't even surf but he has this little

2630
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:28,039
house on a beach that me and Craig used

2631
01:34:26,238 --> 01:34:29,678
to go to as kids like on our first

2632
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:32,039
couple surf trips and surf this little

2633
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:33,560
random Beach um far from everything and

2634
01:34:32,039 --> 01:34:36,158
we used to go there to get away from the

2635
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:38,880
crowds and Josh just so happens to have

2636
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:41,039
a house there so this a weird

2637
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,600
coincidence we have a lot in common um

2638
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:44,279
so he was down there with his family and

2639
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:46,800
for his wife's birthday and they visited

2640
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:48,319
all my my little area and basically got

2641
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,199
to check out some restaurants I set him

2642
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:53,279
up with and some hotels and stuff so

2643
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:55,599
that was cool yeah shout out Josh D

2644
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:57,599
whenever I've um met him at like events

2645
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,520
he's been super nice guy always enjoyed

2646
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,920
hanging out with him so definitely

2647
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,360
definitely on board with that and I

2648
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,960
guess I wanted to quickly ask while

2649
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:07,439
we're on the topic cuz I do want to get

2650
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,480
back to the story um you know there's a

2651
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:12,198
myriad of OG kushers that have all come

2652
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:13,839
out since the originals you know like I

2653
01:35:12,198 --> 01:35:16,198
guess some of the more famous ones like

2654
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:20,159
you know like the Fire OG the face off

2655
01:35:16,198 --> 01:35:22,079
OG sfv do you have any favorites or have

2656
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:23,839
you tried most of these ones and what's

2657
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:25,760
your thoughts do you think like to a

2658
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,760
degree some of them are s1's of others

2659
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:32,760
or like where do you see that when I

2660
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:34,560
first met Josh um him and a guy named

2661
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:36,920
Mojave that were at the farm the first

2662
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,159
day we met Mojave was actually partners

2663
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:41,279
with Adam D in Amsterdam in their C

2664
01:35:39,158 --> 01:35:43,039
company years ago so he's he's like a

2665
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:45,238
wealth of knowledge he's I learned a lot

2666
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:48,439
from him about history and he was

2667
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:51,039
actually part of the uh big holy sir um

2668
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:55,158
strain I want to say his family was so

2669
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:57,439
he knew a lot um that day at the farm uh

2670
01:35:55,158 --> 01:35:59,039
basically they were growing all ogs so

2671
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:05,279
that was the first time I ever got to

2672
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:07,960
see OG um Josh OG ghost OG Ryan OG

2673
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:10,079
Marathon OG he had the TK going he had

2674
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:11,960
like a whole two acres of like all OG's

2675
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:14,600
going so I was like a kid in a candy

2676
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:16,000
store that day um so we were walking

2677
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,639
around checking them all out and like

2678
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,920
basically he had bashes that were like

2679
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:22,239
three four weeks old and then he had

2680
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:24,079
some there were like maybe two three

2681
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:26,039
weeks from being done or something maybe

2682
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:27,719
a little longer so I got to see a couple

2683
01:36:26,039 --> 01:36:30,719
different different phases of them as

2684
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:32,000
well but to me first like our our thing

2685
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:33,800
at first was we were trying to figure

2686
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,439
out if the triangle and the OG were

2687
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:39,480
basically the same plant that maybe had

2688
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:41,198
mutated over the years this is prior to

2689
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:42,839
the whole Alec thing coming out you know

2690
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:44,960
this five years ago when I first met

2691
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:49,079
Josh and we first started talking so

2692
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:50,279
before I met or talked to Alec um and

2693
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:52,039
you know there was still a lot of like

2694
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:53,880
discrepancies about

2695
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:56,319
which cut was which and a lot of people

2696
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:58,159
seem to think they're the same thing but

2697
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,519
in person you can see there's definitely

2698
01:36:58,158 --> 01:37:02,799
height differences and I mean they smell

2699
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:03,960
very similar to the to the finger R but

2700
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,960
like once they got a little closer to

2701
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:06,760
being done you can see they were

2702
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,679
definitely different you can see all the

2703
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,600
different variations according to Josh

2704
01:37:08,679 --> 01:37:14,199
and Mojave that day they claimed that

2705
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,560
there majority of them the good ones all

2706
01:37:14,198 --> 01:37:19,479
came from the same cut and were just

2707
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,800
renamed over the years and they grew in

2708
01:37:19,479 --> 01:37:22,319
different locations and they might have

2709
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,159
morphed them a little bit and it be a

2710
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:26,759
little bit different than the original

2711
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:28,638
so that was our first train of thought

2712
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:30,400
um and since then we kind of realized

2713
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:32,880
for sure the TK and the OG are from

2714
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:34,399
different seeds so they're like sisters

2715
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,639
um and they definitely if you grow them

2716
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:36,799
side by side they definitely have a lot

2717
01:37:35,639 --> 01:37:39,400
of differences to

2718
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,639
them so yeah we figured that much out

2719
01:37:39,399 --> 01:37:44,519
since then um I haven't grown a whole

2720
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:47,239
lot of them I've grown a handful i've

2721
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:50,599
smoked a lot of them uh unfortunately I

2722
01:37:47,238 --> 01:37:52,519
haven't had a large area facility to

2723
01:37:50,599 --> 01:37:54,039
like collect and store a bunch of

2724
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:56,280
genetics since all this stuff started

2725
01:37:54,039 --> 01:37:58,198
for me like when I first came out of

2726
01:37:56,279 --> 01:38:00,599
hiding and was on Instagram I was living

2727
01:37:58,198 --> 01:38:01,678
in Central America we had a small place

2728
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:03,039
and then you know I had like a couple

2729
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:05,359
little tiny rooms I was able to do stuff

2730
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:08,000
in down there but taking big risk down

2731
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:09,319
there if you get in trouble obviously um

2732
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,079
and we actually had a home invasion down

2733
01:38:09,319 --> 01:38:14,880
there too which I'll get it get to

2734
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:16,719
eventually um so yeah there was I

2735
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,760
haven't really had a chance to to

2736
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:22,319
properly grow out all the ogs myself

2737
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,440
like Josh has um like I was more

2738
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,639
familiar obviously with the triangle but

2739
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:29,359
they grow very similar to each other um

2740
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:31,840
very similar structure very similar like

2741
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:34,319
traits and leaf look and stems and

2742
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:37,920
everything they both are a little bit

2743
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:40,039
they like less light than most plants um

2744
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,079
so yeah those are things that uh I've

2745
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:43,840
come to learn last few years but about

2746
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:45,880
the ogs and stuff you know are

2747
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,639
definitely very similar as far as the

2748
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:50,239
TPA goes um as far as growing most of

2749
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:52,039
them I would love to I'm I'm looking

2750
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:53,959
forward to the day where where Florida

2751
01:38:52,039 --> 01:38:55,719
eases up on hom grow and I could have

2752
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:58,599
all the ogs in my collection here and

2753
01:38:55,719 --> 01:39:00,399
get to try them all myself but as far as

2754
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:03,079
favorites go that other than the

2755
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:06,638
original OG and the TK I've had a really

2756
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:08,000
good bag of Face Off that was insane um

2757
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,520
I've also had some crosses that were

2758
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,279
made with that in Costa Rica from C that

2759
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:13,199
I like a lot a couple other ones I had

2760
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:16,279
down there from the archive that were

2761
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:18,118
crosses with his uh this face off Rec

2762
01:39:16,279 --> 01:39:20,158
more recently we had a zace we went

2763
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:21,880
through here A bunch of genetics or a

2764
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:27,479
bunch of seeds of it and found some real

2765
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:30,039
nice gasty couple Skittles type ones um

2766
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:31,799
so definitely I like the face off I've

2767
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:35,319
definitely the first time I actually

2768
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:37,360
seen um any of the ogs on that trip I

2769
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:40,279
ran into Josh was actually a San frano

2770
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:41,479
Valley and my friend had in Santa Cruz

2771
01:39:40,279 --> 01:39:44,960
which actually reminded me of the

2772
01:39:41,479 --> 01:39:47,959
triangle when I first saw it um and I've

2773
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:50,480
smoked Fire OG the marathon

2774
