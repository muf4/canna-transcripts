102
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,879

break ground in May

104
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,798
well that must be a really sort of

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
exciting time for for you and the people

106
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,879
around you I guess the question it

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
brings to mind to me is that there are a

108
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,978
lot of people out there who are quite

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,139
into Buddhism quite into sort of Eastern

110
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,879
spirituality how do you feel that

111
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,340
interplays with cannabis do you feel

112
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,918
like there's overlap there

113
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:40,918
well of course um well for one there's

114
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,019
they're theorizing now that um the true

115
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,299
home of the cannabis plant is in the

116
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,978
Tibetan Plateau so

117
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,379
um they're now finding

118
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:53,339
Source Origins that was one of the first

119
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:56,399
places that it was so and in a lot of

120
00:04:53,339 --> 00:05:00,239
the um you know deeper

121
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,039
esoteric studies of Buddhism Hinduism

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,340
um Jainism these different things

123
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,520
there's been talk and utilization of

124
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:12,359
cannabis and in a multitude of different

125
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,279
ways also in taoism and Chinese herbal

126
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,560
pharmacopoeia these kind of things if

127
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,739
we've been utilizing this plant

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,319
um medicinally and spiritually for

129
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,538
thousands of years you know humans on

130
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,399
all levels but

131
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:29,879
um in Buddhism especially there's

132
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,719
there's certain practices and certain

133
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,579
um

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,580
things that there was association with

135
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:38,219
cannabis in the form of bung which is a

136
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:41,399
basically a steeped milk drink that they

137
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,800
use cannabis so there were some

138
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,500
practices that basically you drink the

139
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,960
whole bottle of bong you get locked in

140
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,060
this rock Hut you have you do this

141
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,459
particular practice have this particular

142
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,500
experience and then you know so it's

143
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:58,638
it's been utilized in um

144
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,259
in Buddhism and in a multitude of other

145
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,460
religions for thousands of years from my

146
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,220
understanding

147
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:07,799
even I mean when you talk about the you

148
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,840
know with Jesus and the holy anointed

149
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,520
oil you know from all of our

150
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,079
understanding that was cannabis oil you

151
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,000
know so

152
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,099
um you know people say what they want

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,740
and whatever but when you start

154
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,319
researching and start studying what was

155
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,960
being used what oil was a prize

156
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,120
medicinal oil an anointing oil a healing

157
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,519
oil back then it all started pointing

158
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,939
towards cannabis

159
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:36,180
wow I mean we we've had past guests talk

160
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,860
about bungs such as irizen um who gave

161
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,600
us a little bit of a rundown of how that

162
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,740
plays into the Indian culture but a

163
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,460
really interesting point you just

164
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,740
brought up is how it the the the sort of

165
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,538
ceremony you just described sort of has

166
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,978
a lot of parallels with like sort of the

167
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,379
way people are really getting into

168
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,779
Ayahuasca these days have you ever seen

169
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,699
that or noticed that yourself

170
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,859
oh for sure

171
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,699
um I've you know personally I've drank

172
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,259
an Ayahuasca I don't know 30 40 times

173
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,259
um it was part of my

174
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,479
preliminary studies and practices you

175
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,919
know about 20 years ago I actually

176
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,538
wanted to be a shaman you know I thought

177
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,599
I was going to be one of those guys you

178
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:16,918
know until my first teacher

179
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,879
um you know kind of laughed at my face

180
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,000
and

181
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,519
you know stated clearly how um how

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,279
stupid that was and so I didn't do that

183
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,379
and instead went um

184
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,879
you know utilize the plant that I'd

185
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,240
already have a deep relationship with

186
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:36,719
and went full force into that but

187
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,639
utilizing these plants San Pedro cactus

188
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,740
Ayahuasca Salvia these different things

189
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,300
to kind of um disentangle

190
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,598
um the egoic

191
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,259
you know anchor to some degree soften up

192
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:54,180
the you know attachments from all your

193
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,699
self-centeredness and give you a

194
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,900
self-observation

195
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,300
format to a degree to where you can

196
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:02,098
start seeing how fake you are yourself

197
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,379
um or how you're not one of the other

198
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:06,120
you know or both

199
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,819
um so

200
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,060
for us you know the Ayahuasca and

201
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,680
especially when I talk about this drink

202
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,379
it was associated with a practice called

203
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,598
mahakala which is a wrath lamination of

204
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:21,240
Buddha of compassion it's a protector

205
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,800
but it's a it's in a wrathful form of

206
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,740
compassion

207
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,098
um so which

208
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,259
um the the image of this this six-armed

209
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:34,319
um wrathful protectors holding a skull

210
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,519
cup of a reddish fluid they called

211
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,140
rockti

212
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,778
um but you know we always make jokes

213
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,860
with as Ayahuasca you know so for years

214
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:42,958
you know

215
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,019
um but that being said

216
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,259
when you have a full-fledged

217
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,299
full-blown cannabis ingestion experience

218
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,620
you know we all under I mean anyone

219
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,778
that's ate in too much cannabis

220
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,879
understands that that it's it's about as

221
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,720
strong as it gets you know

222
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,360
um

223
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,100
Ayahuasca obviously with the

224
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,899
dimethyltryptamine and the MAO inhibitor

225
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,600
from the banisteriopsis copy you know

226
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,759
basically a chakruna it has the DMT

227
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,659
alkaloid and the banisteriopsis copy of

228
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,179
the vine

229
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,958
um has the MAO inhibitor

230
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,079
um

231
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:19,799
so that induces a certain experience

232
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,160
that's unique to those things but

233
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:25,559
um from my experience when you get into

234
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,120
say the you know the Apex of any

235
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,759
experience there's a lot of similarities

236
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,039
there so the Apex of an Ayahuasca

237
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,778
experience versus the Apex of a heavy

238
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,838
cannabis experience and through

239
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:39,720
ingestion they're quite different

240
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,240
but esoterically and emotionally you can

241
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,040
have a similar experience of you know

242
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,778
death experience

243
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:51,659
um com you know heavy self-observation

244
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:54,120
analytical annihilation of your you know

245
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:56,579
or an empowerment of you know some

246
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,080
people they don't utilize the plant in

247
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,759
the appropriate way and it just empowers

248
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,639
their ego you know we've seen these

249
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,980
kooky wannabe shamans or

250
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,539
um also you know I mean we're really

251
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,039
familiar with the Cannabis industry so

252
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,559
we can just use that

253
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,899
you know there's never I've never seen

254
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,299
any other industry in the world and any

255
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,980
other continuum

256
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:23,359
of business that it can that a plant can

257
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,980
promote such an ego such I'm the best

258
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,379
such uh you know I'm better than

259
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,539
everyone else I'm what I have is better

260
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,559
than yours it's I haven't seen that in

261
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:34,019
any other

262
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,239
any other thing so then I look at

263
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,220
cannabis like oh it's maybe exacerbates

264
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,320
the ego in a lot of ways or annihilates

265
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,560
and disentangles the ego in a lot of

266
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,300
ways so it's a quite unique parallel

267
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,838
that it has

268
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,458
um

269
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,920
Ayahuasca on the other hand

270
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,659
you know for me personally it was more

271
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,299
of a

272
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:58,338
you know Holodeck of all my karmic

273
00:10:54,299 --> 00:11:01,019
experience and I was able to see

274
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,180
the beginning point of a lot of my

275
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,459
issues and why they were

276
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,259
started why it got conditioned a certain

277
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:10,559
way with cannabis I wasn't able to see

278
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:13,379
it so clearly but more in a

279
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,639
undertone was there you know it happens

280
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:17,220
in a way

281
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,679
it just happens in a different way but a

282
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,420
similar result can manifest in my

283
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,778
perspective of

284
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,879
um humbleness subdued ego these kind of

285
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,679
things that happen from both you know

286
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,360
Ayahuasca happens for me having a little

287
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,338
more richly

288
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,800
um you know because I

289
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,480
added to the point of death experiences

290
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,120
shamanic death kind of style things

291
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,920
which that's hard to do some cannabis at

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,120
least for me I'll just go to sleep you

293
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,399
know

294
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,720
um versus Ayahuasca you have a death

295
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,339
experience and you pass out because you

296
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,139
think you're dying sometimes because you

297
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,140
can't breathe you're asphyxiating

298
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,778
through hyperventilation and and

299
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,278
um you know panic attack kind of things

300
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,078
so you can pass out through that

301
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,720
experience

302
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,578
um so when for me personally when I've

303
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,278
had those level of experiences because

304
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,379
my teacher was kind of a freak he would

305
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,919
take um we would get Ayahuasca from the

306
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:13,200
shipo and out of culpa in the Amazon

307
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,199
jungle he would take that Ayahuasca and

308
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,700
he would reduce it by 75 percent so if

309
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,040
you have a leader then you'd put it down

310
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,959
to a quarter liter

311
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,719
um and then he'd give that

312
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:27,299
um so we'd you know the times I've had

313
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,759
certain doses they've been high doses of

314
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:32,039
that kind of concentrated medicine to

315
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,078
where you're say taking 200 milliliters

316
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,458
but in all actuality it's near a liter

317
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,019
you're drinking

318
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:39,838
um so that's that induces a different

319
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:42,179
type of experience that that our our

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,760
crew is

321
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:46,859
um it's very integral to our crew

322
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,620
um so

323
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,700
you know if you can't have a shamanic

324
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,039
death you can't have these death

325
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,220
experiences then

326
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,659
um your perspective of who you are we

327
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,278
feel is kind of limited because you

328
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,139
don't get to see who you are when you

329
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,639
have a death you know so if once you do

330
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,360
get to see who you are when you have a

331
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,539
death

332
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,459
and see who you're not it um it opens a

333
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:10,019
lot of um information for you opens a

334
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,359
lot of awareness to your own mind and

335
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,060
how you can work with yourself so

336
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,680
I mean both of those things come from my

337
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,299
perspective from Ayahuasca and from

338
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,458
Cannabis just in different forms

339
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:23,399
different formats different message

340
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:26,518
different delivery but in the end a

341
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,919
similar result so yeah what a great

342
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,539
little run down on the comparisons and

343
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,059
differences between the two and so much

344
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,679
of what you said really resonates with

345
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,018
things I've been noticing in the

346
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,719
community especially how you talk about

347
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:43,139
the Cannabis Community or the plant kind

348
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,540
of has this uncanny ability to draw in

349
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,278
people who tend to be quite focused on

350
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:50,000
ego and the thing I've noticed recently

351
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,559
is that I feel like there's very little

352
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,720
consideration given to Alternative

353
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,578
perspectives within the scene especially

354
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,220
when you've got say two people who are

355
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,838
having a disagreement there's often very

356
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,639
little room for considering the other

357
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,040
person's point of view

358
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,360
what do you think it is about cannabis

359
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,799
that does that compared to the

360
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,980
psychedelics you kind of reference

361
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,838
dosages and you got me thinking is it is

362
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,278
the problem that with when smoking

363
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,380
cannabis generally speaking you can't

364
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,778
get a dose big enough to really approach

365
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:21,120
that sort of ego death which you can

366
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:23,039
with say Ayahuasca and maybe you can

367
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,539
approach it with the bung what's your

368
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,879
thoughts on that

369
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,860
well I mean I think a lot of people with

370
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,639
these like thousand milligram Edibles

371
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,200
have had that experience now you know

372
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,139
because they'll eat the whole candy bar

373
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,720
you know and from my perspective when

374
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,959
something's extracted with hexane or

375
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,778
extracted with a you know a hydrocarbon

376
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,278
and then made into an edible

377
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:49,559
um something happens something different

378
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,059
happens from my perspective you know so

379
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,739
there's all these different

380
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,719
um

381
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,459
Avenues of extraction they're going to

382
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,100
promote a different type of result

383
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:02,399
versus if you're doing a organic ethanol

384
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,199
extraction or whether you're doing a you

385
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,240
know water separation

386
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,519
ice hash and then taking that product

387
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,259
and putting it into MCT oil and then

388
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,419
eating that you know there's there's all

389
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,819
kinds of different ways so that's

390
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,778
something to be considered as well you

391
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,620
know

392
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:18,620
um and I think that

393
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:24,480
strain specific you know is is is is

394
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:27,059
something for me most of the strains I

395
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,920
like to smoke are going to induce a high

396
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:32,518
mentation capacity

397
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,379
um analytical thought or hyper

398
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,500
analytical thought or hyper critical

399
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,360
thought so this kind of

400
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,860
um

401
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,778
experience this induced from certain

402
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,360
strains it doesn't work for some people

403
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,338
and maybe someone that might you know be

404
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,159
more

405
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:52,019
CBD or indica prone they smoke a

406
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,299
high-end sativa or a high-end hybrid

407
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,519
sativa and they're having a panic attack

408
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:59,159
thinking all kinds of weird thoughts you

409
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:03,000
know like they took LSD or something

410
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:04,198
so it depends on the person you know one

411
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,360
of the things my first teacher always

412
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,099
told me is it's all you know every

413
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,959
person has to know their vehicle

414
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,540
what works best for them

415
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,578
what foods work best for them you know

416
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:16,740
does drinking lots of water work for you

417
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:18,479
does it not does eating lots of meat

418
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,159
work for you does it not does eating

419
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,079
lots of edge work for you does it not

420
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,120
you know so really analyzing your body

421
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:24,958
and analyzing the fuels you're putting

422
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,560
in it

423
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,599
you know is really important so for us

424
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,698
um you know Organics is a big a big

425
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,180
facet in our life and every aspect of

426
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:36,799
food cannabis all these type of things

427
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:41,638
um

428
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:42,919
so you know I think cultivation methods

429
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,959
um I think

430
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,039
environmental factors all these things

431
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,679
are gonna

432
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,078
lead to a certain experience or a

433
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,399
certain

434
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,500
experience with the plant you know

435
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,778
certain awareness awareness level or not

436
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,179
you know when we talk about people's um

437
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:02,278
opinions

438
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:06,539
and their inability to find balance in a

439
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:07,259
conversation when there's disagreement

440
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:09,058
um

441
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,400
you know it's obviously it's hard in the

442
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,500
Cannabis industry because I mean it's

443
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,360
hard in all aspects of society these

444
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,220
days you know people can't disagree with

445
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,838
each other without getting in a fight it

446
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,120
seems like it's like not cool to

447
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,698
disagree anymore it's not cool to think

448
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,000
different and you know that's I think

449
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,500
that's maybe a more of a societal thing

450
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,179
especially in Western societies where

451
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,099
they're taught everything they think is

452
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,740
special they're special their view is

453
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:36,719
special their perspective is special all

454
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,640
this kind of thing in actuality it's

455
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,519
just perspective it's not special

456
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,320
you're not special any being is not more

457
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,240
special than any other being you know

458
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:49,259
that's just not how it works and the

459
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,259
reality of this universe but ideologies

460
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:54,599
and conditioning through Western

461
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,179
mindsets through other aspects of

462
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,819
mindsets have reinforced and conditioned

463
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,559
this type of specialness into everyone

464
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,000
where I think we're experiencing that

465
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,379
especially in the Cannabis industry

466
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,679
because it's plant

467
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,320
will exacerbate the ego or delineate the

468
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,820
ego one or the other and so when two

469
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,740
people disagree

470
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,899
it's it's really hard especially in our

471
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,880
industry for them to find some type of

472
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,440
balance and common ground because you

473
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,600
know most people aren't skilled in doing

474
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,220
that most people aren't skilled in

475
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,740
Psychology and philosophy most people

476
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,660
aren't skilled in these kind of esoteric

477
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,058
studies that are basically based on

478
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,820
recognizing the self

479
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:36,538
recognizing the problems of that it

480
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:38,759
creates and recognizing the solutions to

481
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:40,919
eliminate those problems that's not

482
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,779
something that's taught openly in the

483
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,299
western culture you know in in Buddhist

484
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:47,819
culture and in Asian cultures

485
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:50,339
um it is you know and in the

486
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:53,339
philosophies it is you know it's because

487
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:55,798
we don't believe in a self like um

488
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:58,019
Western philosophies do we don't believe

489
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:00,058
in this we believe it as an illusory

490
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:04,319
thing that's created through conditions

491
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:07,440
you know so in that contest text it can

492
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,000
also be destroyed through conditions so

493
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,400
we don't because we don't believe it's

494
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,240
an inherent thing we believe it's based

495
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,160
off of

496
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,099
dependence through other conditions

497
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,259
hence it being a result so we don't

498
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,699
believe it's something that's there so

499
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,099
we believe it's something that can be

500
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,380
analyzed and destroyed

501
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,538
um versus other religions and other

502
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,960
mindsets they believe this self is there

503
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:31,980
the soul is special you're special and

504
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,179
that's

505
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,779
I think

506
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,640
personally a a big part of that why in

507
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:41,339
the Western World we can't disagree

508
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,660
happily we can't be like no that's what

509
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:44,279
you think well here's what I think and

510
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,019
everyone be like wow that's cool we have

511
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,139
different thoughts we have different

512
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:50,339
views that's okay you know I mean it's

513
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,960
another thing if we're trying to talk

514
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:54,538
about him you know

515
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,579
truth because a lot of Western cultures

516
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:59,038
now think that their perspective is

517
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:01,319
truth and their truth you know and

518
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,058
and we all know that's not true you know

519
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:05,099
we your perspective is your opinion

520
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:06,720
based off conditioning based off

521
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,879
awareness or ignorances that are

522
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,200
developed through your life pattern you

523
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,720
know so then you have this perspective

524
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,759
and until you can recognize that as such

525
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,798
it's hard to annihilate such a thing

526
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,798
it's hard to recognize such a thing as a

527
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,900
problem you know so

528
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:25,519
you know it's it's a there's a lot of

529
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,480
aspects to it cultural you know and also

530
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,058
plant-based you know and from our

531
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,220
perspective Karma base meaning the

532
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:33,720
result of our actions you know a lot of

533
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,019
us make a lot of actions in our younger

534
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,579
life eat a lot of poor Foods impute a

535
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,639
lot of negative information into our

536
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:43,139
brain and then later in life we say hey

537
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,960
we want to do something special we want

538
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,538
to be a good person but we realize

539
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,279
our actions don't align with that all of

540
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,919
our conditioning and all of our study

541
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,558
and all of our work that we put in for

542
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,960
the last however many decades or years

543
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:00,119
we realized was done towards the wrong

544
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,240
thing it was done towards money it was

545
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,798
done towards success instead of done

546
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,839
towards empathy done towards

547
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,400
open-heartedness done towards compassion

548
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,538
and helping others you know the things

549
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,519
that actually

550
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:13,500
you know are going to help this world

551
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,179
we can see like someone like Jeff Bezos

552
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,640
you know through this whole cobit

553
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:19,860
Endeavor he cashed out really hard is he

554
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,538
helping anyone not a person

555
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:24,359
you know so

556
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,379
all that money all that wealth all that

557
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,199
success

558
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,480
but he doesn't have a speck of empathy

559
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,580
so is he successful he seems like a

560
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,440
troll then you know he seems not even

561
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:36,058
like he's worth to be alive on Earth you

562
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,558
know because if you have that much money

563
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:39,599
and success and you don't help and

564
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:41,460
change this planet you're garbage you

565
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,139
know so I think these things

566
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,140
aren't

567
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,940
being promoted heavily in society where

568
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,380
I think they should you know and I think

569
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,900
that's one thing a lot of us are finding

570
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,419
with this plant is that it kind of

571
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,820
engages this compassionate empathetic

572
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,860
mind in us to where we can see this in

573
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,899
others where we can see people need help

574
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,779
where we can want to help or we can see

575
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,720
this plant's going to help or you know

576
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:09,119
we can buy more Rolexes a new car you

577
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,038
know show it all off on IG you know like

578
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,418
or we can do with that style you know

579
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,339
there's a lot of different styles you

580
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:16,259
know but I think it's based more off of

581
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:18,658
the conditions of society and where

582
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:19,500
we're headed and where we are versus you

583
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,679
know

584
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,819
and versus the plants influence towards

585
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,100
that I guess

586
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:27,359
yeah most certainly I think there's so

587
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:28,980
much of what you said there that I've

588
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,019
been noticing myself recently

589
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,519
particularly that you know a lot of

590
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,500
people yeah never really given a formal

591
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,019
opportunity to learn about how to be

592
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,519
self-reflective and consider where they

593
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,279
fit into the picture and how their

594
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,900
actions influence things and kind of on

595
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,940
that line of thinking I've noticed

596
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,740
recently that at least from my

597
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,340
perspective there appears to be some

598
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,960
medicine coming from an unlikely place

599
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:54,899
kind of traditionally the sort of

600
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,419
Instagram trolls like clout King and

601
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,159
Stan the Man these guys who historically

602
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,440
I just thought maybe provided a bit of a

603
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,900
laugh recently I feel like they've kind

604
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,580
of maybe inadvertently started helping

605
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,038
people realize this and I noticed this

606
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:09,779
when clout King came out with some

607
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,000
branded cannabis which he was calling

608
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:15,480
turds and then another line called kids

609
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,759
and I was like it kind of seems a bit

610
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,319
like sarcastic and ironic on face value

611
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,538
but I think he's actually trying to like

612
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,519
wake people up to like the sort of clout

613
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:25,379
chasing that we've kind of spoken about

614
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,779
or ready and that you know it's not

615
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,220
exactly the greatest thing what's your

616
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,480
thoughts on them doing that do you see

617
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,919
it kind of the way I do or do you just

618
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,019
think it's just a troll

619
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,640
no I like Cloud King what he's doing I

620
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,440
don't know Stan the Man I don't know um

621
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,320
that reference so I'm not familiar but

622
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,600
you know I follow Cloud King and I I do

623
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,418
a similar thing I like to like you know

624
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:49,019
bring awareness through me

625
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:50,880
or whatever you call it meaning

626
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,158
um you know like

627
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,559
what we call in Buddhism there's a type

628
00:23:53,159 --> 00:24:00,419
of debate called reductio reductio at

629
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:03,899
absurdum where you posit the absurdity

630
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,460
of a scenario or a position

631
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:11,280
first

632
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:14,880
so you you basically posit the result of

633
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:18,058
an erroneous position in the Forefront

634
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,340
and in the in a debate standard when you

635
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:23,700
do that you basically you take someone's

636
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:25,918
position they have and you analyze the

637
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,419
result of that position and you put that

638
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,880
up in the Forefront but it's actually

639
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:32,340
erroneous and kind of absurd so they're

640
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,860
gonna they're gonna attack it

641
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:37,918
but you do that in a format to get them

642
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:40,740
to attack themselves you know to them to

643
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,460
negate their own idea so it's a type of

644
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,380
um

645
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,538
type of a debate positioning you know

646
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,240
but the more the reduction is just

647
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:50,819
positing the erroneous results of an

648
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,759
idea in the Forefront of a debate

649
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:55,798
so I think a lot of these memes are like

650
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,058
that you know like kind of a not to say

651
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,619
passive aggressive but um more a

652
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:03,658
subliminal poke you know and we're gonna

653
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:06,538
they're gonna posit this idea that's

654
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:09,480
that's stupid basically you know in a in

655
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:12,419
in the resultant format meaning like hey

656
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,919
it's like this isn't this cool or this

657
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,840
is blah blah blah and everyone's like

658
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,240
that's so stupid or that's all this you

659
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,379
know and so what I've experienced is

660
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,179
that people

661
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,679
you know I'll posit these kind of ideas

662
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,320
as like

663
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,059
you know this is this is this is dumb

664
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:30,119
it's not cool it's not beneficial for

665
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,859
self or Humanity and a lot of people

666
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,178
will get it and a lot of people get

667
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,259
turned on by it and be like oh yeah

679
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,719
know it's like

680
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,380
it makes me laugh you know I was just

681
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,819
talking with my teacher you know well we

682
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,320
went to the you know we went to Whole

683
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:05,278
Foods so we can get some coffee filters

684
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,558
you know

685
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,480
so and he needed some allergy medicines

686
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:11,460
up too so we went over there and we're

687
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,380
laughing um you know we're talking about

688
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,640
this you know talking about how people

689
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,200
think once you're a Buddhist you're

690
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
supposed to be enlightened you know he's

691
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,740
like oh even people think with monks you

692
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,940
know even where monk of his Holiness of

693
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,859
the Islam and they were supposed to be

694
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,778
enlightened you know he's all that we're

695
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:26,959
not supposed to get angry or eat meat or

696
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:29,940
anything like that he's all so stupid

697
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,058
you know because the reality is is we're

698
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,798
all human and if we were enlightened we

699
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,899
wouldn't be on a spiritual path to

700
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,240
evolve you know we wouldn't have chosen

701
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,298
a path to try to deal with all our

702
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,720
ignorances and our own

703
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:48,960
you know lame ways of being we wouldn't

704
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,819
have to you know so

705
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,500
yeah so it's it's it's it's an

706
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,538
interesting um dichotomy what's

707
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,839
happening now I think with this whole

708
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:59,940
woke mentality

709
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:03,058
spirituality you know you can go do

710
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:06,240
Ayahuasca in any City in the nation you

711
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:09,119
know with some wacko wannabe Shaman or

712
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,179
some you know Shaman that some other

713
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:14,219
wacko like brought here to make money

714
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,740
off of and make business off of it's

715
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,200
like it's sad you know

716
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,480
um but it's a societal Norm right now so

717
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,240
this kind of um

718
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,400
you know these meme Lords that are that

719
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,259
are um sharing their perspective and

720
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,140
trying to shed light on the the

721
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:34,079
ignorances of our industry and our scene

722
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,360
I think it's awesome I love it it's cool

723
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,298
so that's my perspective of it

724
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:41,459
yeah and one I can certainly understand

725
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:43,859
in certain regards

726
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,419
something which I wanted to loop back to

727
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:47,579
because you mentioned it a bit earlier

728
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,500
was you said you like smoking strains

729
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:52,379
that are kind of more mentally

730
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,140
stimulating stimulating Clarity and

731
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,820
reflection out of curiosity what are

732
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,960
some of the strains which for you at

733
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:59,960
least achieve that

734
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,860
um I mean my favorite strain that I'm

735
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,980
smoking on right now is this um purple

736
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:12,298
Hindu Kush that I got from Mr Bob

737
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:14,819
Hemphill uh is his uh IG handle

738
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:17,418
um his genetics company

739
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:19,980
um with his wife is crickets and cicada

740
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:22,860
and he's

741
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:28,140
one of the

742
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:30,658
um more popular respected and cool

743
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,460
um strain collectors of the last couple

744
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:34,320
decades so

745
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,538
that's that's actually what I've been

746
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,240
I'm really enjoying right now because it

747
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:41,819
offers this full range of

748
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,278
what I'm going for from you know

749
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:48,240
stimulating mindset to also

750
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:50,099
High satisfaction kind of OG subdued

751
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,558
kind of but it still has this very

752
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:53,099
stimulating aspect to it

753
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:54,658
um

754
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,158
so that's what I'm liking on right now

755
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,919
but other than that

756
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,360
um this Sour OG from Amico seeds that's

757
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,480
a

758
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,219
um it's a Hell's Angels OG by sourdes

759
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,179
libel

760
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:11,700
um that one I crossed the 78 Ogle affi

761
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,740
to making the tens and cushes

762
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,600
those are really I really like a lot

763
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,759
because it's it brings this really

764
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,278
high-end stimulating

765
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,919
aspect but then it still has this chem

766
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,619
OG kind of

767
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,480
satisfying you're there Vibe you know

768
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:29,579
um the hazy Kush

769
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,740
was is another one that

770
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:35,220
induces that but that'll induce a type

771
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,380
of euphoria after a half hour or so for

772
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,899
this kind of racy

773
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,399
edgy onset that'll you know some people

774
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:43,500
love some people don't like it all

775
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:46,759
because it you know make it give you

776
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,798
that lip sweat give you that kind of

777
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:53,398
you know hyper anxiety to some degrees

778
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:54,119
if that's how your chemistry is

779
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:55,500
um

780
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,778
so those are those are those are the

781
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,940
strains I've really been liking a lot

782
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:02,579
um for those for those that kind of

783
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,620
Avenue personally

784
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:05,879
um

785
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:09,719
yeah

786
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,659
um I'm not really a sativa or an Indica

787
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,819
I'm really focused mainly on hybrids for

788
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:16,140
what I'm what I'm liking personally you

789
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:18,778
know

790
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,340
um so yeah a good great answer and some

791
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:22,079
good starting points for people to go

792
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:23,819
look into if they're into that sort of

793
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,558
thing I know that I personally love

794
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:27,778
exactly what you're talking about you

795
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:29,158
know those mentally stimulating sativas

796
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:31,500
and for what it's worth

797
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,820
the one I've always really enjoyed which

798
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,220
admittedly haven't been able to have

799
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:37,678
that much access to was genius from uh

800
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,058
Brothers Grimm that was just a

801
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,580
phenomenal strain for sort of that

802
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:43,200
mental Clarity just to loop back to a

803
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,720
point you mentioned just before the

804
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,500
initial one I loop back to you mentioned

805
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,880
that

806
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,460
um there's some current sort of debate

807
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,460
around or discussion at least around

808
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,960
whether the origin place of cannabis is

809
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,960
sort of maybe around the Himalayan

810
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,340
region and it got me wondering do you or

811
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,740
have you ever been able to smoke much

812
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:05,819
sort of Nepalese or maybe even like the

813
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,079
Chinese strains we see and either way do

814
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,639
you want to work with those strains

815
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,658
going forward or are they a bit too sort

816
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,659
of land racy

817
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:18,619
um I have smoked some of them and um

818
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:22,019
they're not necessarily to land racy

819
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:23,879
more and I do have a few things from

820
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,099
China right now and I have quite a few

821
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,159
things from The Nepalese Himalayan

822
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:29,819
region and then also Laos

823
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,600
um

824
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:32,599
the

825
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,898
um Bodhi gave me some lawation land race

826
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:42,119
years back and I popped a bunch of those

827
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:44,939
and those were very similar to hazy Kush

828
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,199
so I was really shocked you know

829
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,120
um I busted these out and I was like

830
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,038
whoa this is weird smells just like hazy

831
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:52,079
Kush this is true man it grows just like

832
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:54,119
a dude this is so weird you know so of

833
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,278
course I crossed that the hazy end of

834
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,699
that too but so

835
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:02,339
that was um one land race from Asia that

836
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:06,960
I really did like and I have some things

837
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:09,298
up from Northern India closer to you

838
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,579
know more on the western side of the

839
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:13,980
Himalaya obviously but I don't have

840
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:16,798
I haven't really sourced a lot from the

841
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,480
Tibetan Plateau or from even Siberian

842
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,940
Plateau I have some stuff from up in

843
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,099
Siberia but it's it's you know some

844
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,419
different Autoflower stuff some some

845
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:26,398
other things that I'm trying to look

846
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,740
through crimerians chimeria and stuff

847
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,538
it's I'm just unfamiliar

848
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,759
um with the history on some of these

849
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:35,819
things so I don't I don't really know I

850
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,038
started some of it but it was wasn't

851
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:39,658
what I was looking for so

852
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,619
um I didn't go into work with any of it

853
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,620
too much so

854
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,980
I would um I would like to see a little

855
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,440
more information though on

856
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,899
you know the history of

857
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,580
the gene pool I do know that like what

858
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:55,739
there's what they're saying from the

859
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:57,480
Tibetan Plateau I don't even actually

860
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,298
know what strain that is but they're

861
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,298
saying the earliest cannabis Origins

862
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:05,099
they're it's pointing to there now

863
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,859
um if you research it's pretty easy to

864
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:09,000
find Google searches of it but um so I

865
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,839
thought that was quite interesting you

866
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,380
know

867
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,699
so yeah certainly I mean it's kind of

868
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,340
always been thought it was sort of

869
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,620
around that area near the Afghan sort of

870
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:20,639
border with the Himalayas so certainly

871
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:22,439
seems like there could be some

872
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,538
credibility in that one

873
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,100
just to take us back to the question we

874
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:28,619
normally ask guests when we start the

875
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:30,000
episode what are you smoking on today or

876
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,678
what do you plan on smoking on later

877
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,659
today if you haven't already

878
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,820
ah that purple Hindu Kush that I was

879
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:37,740
mentioning it's pretty much my right now

880
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:40,619
it's been my go-to

881
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:43,259
all day all night kind of thing

882
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:45,839
um so that's kind of yeah I've been

883
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:47,278
smoking it all day been all night if I

884
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,379
want to mix it up a little bit I'll

885
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,538
grind up some you know

886
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,059
bubble hash in with it and then take

887
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:55,379
long hits of that

888
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:57,839
pretty simple

889
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,039
I don't um even though I have access and

890
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,819
I have

891
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:05,339
you know 30 30 flowers to choose from I

892
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:07,859
still just put one or two in my jar

893
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:10,139
and I gave away all the rest and I smoke

894
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:12,480
those two strains three strains usually

895
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,338
I mean I can certainly vouch that many

896
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,398
of the cultivars in Bob hemphill's

897
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:19,019
Library are just simply lovely what is

898
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:20,519
it about this purple Hindu Kush that

899
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:23,099
you're a fan of because we've heard a

900
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:25,019
lot of people go to Great Lengths to try

901
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,000
to differentiate this particular cut

902
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:28,679
apparently it's quite old it's not the

903
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,679
normal Purple Kush that goes around it's

904
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,898
definitely not Jaeger which is kind of

905
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,300
sometimes confused is this purple kush

906
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:38,098
in Oregon what's your thoughts on this

907
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,080
one is it totally different to others or

908
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:43,338
just a sort of improved version of the

909
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,338
other purple cushes we see

910
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:48,299
um well it's kind of interesting because

911
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,699
um you know the first Purple Kush I got

912
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,419
was in

913
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:55,739
90 92 in in Ridgecrest you know there

914
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,900
were some guys bringing some purple kush

915
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,118
down and there from Oregon and I was

916
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,980
buying a lot of it and obviously selling

917
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,900
my three quarters getting a quarter for

918
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,519
free you know so

919
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,260
um and then just like stacking up as

920
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,659
many quarters as I could so we can all

921
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,520
you know me and me and the homies can

922
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:13,078
all just puff and rage this Purple Kush

923
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,219
right

924
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,760
um

925
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:18,779
so from then to now I've had quite a few

926
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,060
different

927
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,940
iterations of it

928
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:27,480
um and this is by far

929
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,220
you know the best makes um

930
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,940
I mean in my own opinion it makes the

931
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:34,799
high from Jaeger kind of subpar

932
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,740
um it's very interesting this this train

933
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,900
because it has like a orangey Tangy terp

934
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:41,699
in it also which is

935
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,740
you know kind of reminds me of tangyland

936
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:46,980
a little bit but um

937
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:49,919
it's just more funky more kind of OG

938
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,500
Fury more kind of even like

939
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,358
oh no it just has all these exotic notes

940
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,760
that are just on another level

941
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,199
and the high is just Untouchable I

942
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,359
haven't you know I haven't found

943
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,039
something I enjoyed more to this point

944
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,858
yet right now

945
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,619
um it's one of my favorites and everyone

946
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:09,239
that I've smoked out with it is in the

947
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,619
same boat they're just like whoa what

948
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,019
was that you know

949
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,119
so it's it's something special

950
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:16,500
um and then like every time I keep

951
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,320
giving um

952
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,338
uh Mr Rob hampel props on it he's always

953
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,440
like

954
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:25,440
she's a special one that's all he

955
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,059
replies she's a special one she's a

956
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,940
special one you said that a bunch of

957
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:31,559
times now she's a special one and it's

958
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,700
like that you know

959
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,019
um so

960
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:35,519
that's kind of where I'm at with that

961
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:38,280
and right now

962
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:41,280
yeah awesome and a good little rundown

963
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,260
In the comparison so take me back what

964
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,119
was your first ever experience with

965
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,520
cannabis

966
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,900
oh that was a long time ago

967
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:54,000
um I'm 46 now so I was six years old and

968
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,338
I was in Nebraska I was six five or six

969
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,739
years old and me and my neighbor friend

970
00:36:56,338 --> 00:37:00,960
um you know we he lived across the alley

971
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:03,239
from me in the back and so the alley

972
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,858
away was our kind of like Play Zone and

973
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:07,559
we were we you know you know back then

974
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:08,819
in the 80s it and it didn't really

975
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,739
matter you know you didn't have to have

976
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,240
someone watching you you know you walked

977
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:13,979
home from school you walked to the

978
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,838
babysitter you play it all day until

979
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,858
night you know that kind of vibe you

980
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:18,900
know

981
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:21,119
um you know nobody kidnapping kids is

982
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,320
like they are now you know but well it

983
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,940
wasn't I don't know probably just

984
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,760
happening then too but anyway that being

985
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,440
said we're me and my friend were playing

986
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,359
and we see these plants in this guy's

987
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,880
backyard and they were just like calling

988
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:35,279
us you know I just remember them like in

989
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,079
the breeze moving like I'm always like I

990
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,240
wanted them you know so me and my friend

991
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,440
jumped this guy's fence

992
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,699
um and rip these plants out of the

993
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,800
ground and took them back to my house

994
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:45,539
you know and then I took them to the

995
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,460
house and I had them you know had one of

996
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:48,960
those little blue swimming pools that's

997
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,460
in Lincoln Nebraska you know one of

998
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,559
those um and I a little just little

999
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,820
plastic pools that I mix oil in or

1000
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,858
whatever you know a little kiddie pool

1001
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,180
so if we put all those plants in there

1002
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:58,920
and then filled it with water and then

1003
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,480
we were just like tromping around like

1004
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,880
kind of like a wine Crush you know just

1005
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,500
like my dad goes I was like what the

1006
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,119
[ __ ] you know like what's going we're

1007
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,619
like what we didn't know what was going

1008
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,780
on so that was my first experience with

1009
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,539
cannabis you know

1010
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,500
um my first experience ingesting it I

1011
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:19,259
think I was I was in Eugene and I was 10

1012
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,519
years old and two different times I

1013
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,859
remember

1014
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:24,480
um one kid middle schooler kids like hey

1015
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:26,400
John come here try this you know and I

1016
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,800
tried a little hit of what he had in a

1017
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,559
little pipe and um

1018
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,060
and nothing really happened and then the

1019
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:36,000
next time was right around that time

1020
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:37,139
near this place called wiztec or

1021
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,199
Cuthbert

1022
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:42,598
um Cuthbert Amphitheater in Eugene near

1023
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:44,098
the UVO Stadium there's there's like

1024
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,720
some canoe shoots and there's this kid

1025
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,859
there and you know you know a few years

1026
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:48,719
older than me too he's like hey come

1027
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,880
here you want to try this I said yeah I

1028
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,858
walked over so what is it he busted out

1029
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,720
this little foil had some hash in it

1030
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:56,578
with some gold like look like Asian

1031
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,980
lettering on it like stamp like tie

1032
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:00,539
probably and he rolled up a little ball

1033
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,219
popped in this pipe and me and him

1034
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:04,139
smoked this little bowl and I just went

1035
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:06,118
about my way you know I don't know if I

1036
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:07,920
even felt it then either you know

1037
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,838
um so those are my like around that same

1038
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,338
time another friend of mine in Eugene's

1039
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,739
dad was growing a big field of wheat in

1040
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:15,000
his backyard hemp or something and we

1041
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:16,799
ripped a bunch of those plants out of

1042
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,179
the ground and dried them on my roof and

1043
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,579
smoked it one

1044
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,559
you know I found a found some bamboo

1045
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,119
down the way so I cut the you know

1046
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:25,920
segment of bamboo made my own little

1047
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,019
pipe this whole thing you know none of

1048
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,400
this is that you know I'm just you know

1049
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:30,960
free free-flowing you know I haven't

1050
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,338
learned this anywhere my parents you

1051
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,059
know my dad was the military all this

1052
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:34,858
but

1053
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:37,139
so maybe it was like past life stuff you

1054
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:39,239
know or something so a lot of it came

1055
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:42,299
very natural you know so what's funny

1056
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:44,279
when in the the my friend's dad that had

1057
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,539
the field in Eugene and we just took the

1058
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,280
plants out and ripped them right out

1059
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:48,659
fresh but he had the shed that he was

1060
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,040
drying all the stuff in and we looked in

1061
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:51,358
there and I remember looking it was all

1062
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,980
brown and weird looking so we're like

1063
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,559
let's take this fresh green stuff you

1064
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,960
know and so those are my those are my

1065
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,059
first experiences with cannabis and then

1066
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,900
you know it was until I was in high

1067
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:02,279
school

1068
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,200
um really before I started um

1069
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,780
experimenting you know

1070
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:09,719
there you go and I mean you brought up a

1071
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:11,460
great little segue there in that I had

1072
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,939
read online that you grew up as sort of

1073
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,019
a military child and um then as a

1074
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,720
teenager you kind of started

1075
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:20,159
experimenting with psychedelics how did

1076
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,019
all of that play into being a military

1077
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:24,598
child I can only imagine it was kind of

1078
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:27,659
a bit frowned on how did you get around

1079
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,220
that sort of obstacle of the family

1080
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,618
well

1081
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:33,539
um you know like so basically

1082
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,858
you know I wanted to what's crazy I

1083
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,079
wanted to be a youth pastor when I was

1084
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:39,000
younger you know so I was like

1085
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,220
you know kind of I was going to

1086
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,960
Christian Schools training to do that

1087
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:44,699
and then had some really cool

1088
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,740
experiences happen and the church I was

1089
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:48,659
going to didn't really um you know they

1090
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:50,338
didn't Vibe with my experience very well

1091
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:52,799
you know so whatever

1092
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:55,500
um that being said my dad was like very

1093
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,119
strict military my mom's Asian

1094
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,760
um so you know we had quite a strict

1095
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,920
household but when I was 18 I was kind

1096
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,740
of allowed to do what I wanted

1097
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,260
um so you know started experimenting

1098
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:09,059
with everything but even if at that time

1099
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,200
you know we're experimenting with

1100
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,699
everything because we were out in

1101
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:13,980
Ridgecrest it's out in the Mojave Desert

1102
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:16,679
you know all the kids are boiling PODS

1103
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,960
of chips and weed you know like eating

1104
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:20,879
eating like gypsum you know Loco weed

1105
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,199
like um you know deter you know

1106
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,579
moonflower you know the one the local

1107
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,139
weed that grows on the desert yeah yeah

1108
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:26,700
they're they're they're all poisoning

1109
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,838
themselves with this these like gypsum

1110
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:29,399
weed pods you know so they're all having

1111
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,139
their stomachs pumped having these like

1112
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,119
three days psychedelic experiences you

1113
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:34,920
know where you know and the the gypsum

1114
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,300
wheat experience isn't a fun psychedelic

1115
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,099
experience it's like one where you go

1116
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,740
blind and you like could have all these

1117
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,960
crazy scary scary trips you know

1118
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:44,699
um that being said so we're you know

1119
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,500
we're kind of a weird little town so you

1120
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:47,879
know we do things like drink Robitussin

1121
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,380
you know I'd drink like you know

1122
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,480
everyone drink one bottle I drink two

1123
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,920
you know we'd take boxes of marazine

1124
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,059
which is like this motion sickness pill

1125
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,680
you eat the whole box you get

1126
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:57,779
psychedelic you know you actually have

1127
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,759
true hallucinations you know so this is

1128
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,560
like kind of what I grew up around so

1129
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,440
we're just continually experimenting

1130
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,358
with everything then mushrooms and LSD

1131
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,639
and all that stuff and

1132
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:10,019
you know just being a just being like

1133
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,299
that kind of kid I think from the time I

1134
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:14,579
was 18 to 23 I wasn't um I didn't have

1135
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,720
much agenda I was still wanting to you

1136
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:17,579
know at that point I was wanting to go

1137
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:19,199
into the Special Forces wanting to go on

1138
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,820
the Green Berets and try to go Delta and

1139
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,338
try to be like a mercenary killer you

1140
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,300
know that was kind of my mindset

1141
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:30,539
um but I was out in Georgia and you know

1142
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,680
ended up getting a 30 strip of L but I

1143
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,358
thought it was a 10 strip because it was

1144
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,098
given to me as a 10 strip

1145
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,019
um so I cut it in 10 rectangles instead

1146
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,039
of 30 pieces and I ate a few of those

1147
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:39,300
and

1148
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:40,980
you know

1149
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,839
um had quite the experience obviously

1150
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,820
and when I was coming down I was

1151
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:47,639
watching this cartoon called spawn you

1152
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,440
know by Tim McFarlane and I kind of saw

1153
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:51,239
my future if I was going to go into the

1154
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,740
Green Berets and what was you know I

1155
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:54,959
just it was a very trippy it was very

1156
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:57,838
trippy to see that tripped out and then

1157
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,059
so that kind of changed my changed my

1158
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,500
trajectory and that's when I moved to

1159
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:04,199
Eugene and

1160
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,159
you know just bartending started growing

1161
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:06,838
herb

1162
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,139
you know and

1163
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:14,219
stopped bartending only growing her and

1164
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:16,139
that's kind of the all that luckily I

1165
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:19,679
was in contact with quite a few good um

1166
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:21,480
Elders of the Eugene community that

1167
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,639
saw something in me and started sharing

1168
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,679
literature and information with me that

1169
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:28,379
you know set me on a different path

1170
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,519
basically kind of opened my eyes to a

1171
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,440
different um

1172
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,179
different type of warriorship I guess

1173
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,920
you know instead of being like a warrior

1174
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,039
that kills people you know a warrior

1175
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,200
that like is set out and steadfast for

1176
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:42,358
helping others you know so just

1177
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:44,460
different different I mean even then I

1178
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:46,739
wanted to be the best killer on Earth to

1179
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,900
help people you know so the intention

1180
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:50,818
was right it's just the everything else

1181
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,880
wasn't you know so

1182
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:55,858
yeah certainly and so I mean growing up

1183
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,318
with those Elders influence on you it

1184
00:43:55,858 --> 00:44:00,900
must have been a bit of a leg up to have

1185
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,519
to not go through exactly all the trials

1186
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,960
and tribulations people do when they're

1187
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:06,659
kind of learning the ropes themselves

1188
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,579
what were some of the strains that they

1189
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:10,920
were growing or that you were gifted at

1190
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,660
the time and what sort of like

1191
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,940
um setup were you using was it like just

1192
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:18,598
basic lights indoor give us a bit of a

1193
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,818
rundown on how you first started growing

1194
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:24,240
well how I first started growing um

1195
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:28,858
right when I moved to Eugene in this was

1196
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:31,338
a 97 97 I think 90 and a 97.

1197
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:34,199
um I instantly started growing peppers

1198
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:35,519
Habaneros Scotch Scotch bonnet all these

1199
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:37,559
different dad teal all these different

1200
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,480
spicy peppers because I had allergies

1201
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,460
really bad in the Willamette Valley area

1202
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,780
and I was using these peppers I was

1203
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,220
eating them just to like deal with my

1204
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,440
allergies

1205
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:48,118
and then I put a couple seeds in a

1206
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,099
spider plant in my bedroom and I

1207
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,900
sprouted and I was like oh I'm gonna

1208
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:53,880
grow these things you know so then I

1209
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,980
made this little makeshift closet set up

1210
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,318
with like Styrofoam walls and all that

1211
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:01,079
the little light that you know 150 watt

1212
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,759
or 250 watt light that's like a you know

1213
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,519
a parking lot light you know that you

1214
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,560
use for like it was off of a dentist a

1215
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,539
dentist office parking parking the

1216
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:12,299
parking lot light you know I used that

1217
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:14,579
and then I had another little

1218
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,260
um light that I was using you know and

1219
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:18,180
so and then I built a little makeshift

1220
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,760
closet box after this you know my first

1221
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:22,199
run actually with these you know seeds

1222
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,060
out of this spider plant and I grew it

1223
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:26,159
all Herm they had seeds it was garbage

1224
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:27,420
you know like stray garbage you know and

1225
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:29,519
I was like I'm gonna do it right so I

1226
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,559
built a little box put this light and

1227
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,500
then put a 400 watt in there so I had

1228
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,539
the 400 plus the 250. and built a little

1229
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,980
box in my closet and then I had the

1230
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,858
strains that I had there obviously

1231
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,318
Eugene was kind of a you know a hub for

1232
00:45:40,858 --> 00:45:45,480
good weed so I first started growing

1233
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:47,159
with this train called Trinity

1234
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,800
um another strain called Big Sur holy

1235
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:51,779
and then blueberry and blueberry Trend

1236
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,760
and another's train called IDK which

1237
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,339
stood for I don't know but it was you

1238
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,040
know Eugene chronic strain so obviously

1239
00:45:56,338 --> 00:46:01,318
Trinity has the lore and the it's like

1240
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,779
Legends trained from Eugene for like you

1241
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:05,818
know forever still

1242
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,900
um and then the other strains are pretty

1243
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:09,358
apparent

1244
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,280
um but uh yeah so that's kind of how it

1245
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,199
started and then the second grow after

1246
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,240
that little closet I made my whole

1247
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,639
closet to grow and just had a trap door

1248
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,739
and then you know went from the 650

1249
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,199
watts to the thousand watt and then we

1250
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:23,279
went to 2001 then 4000 watts and 8 000

1251
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:25,019
you know and then it's just like that

1252
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,540
you know you just keep

1253
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:29,940
leapfrogging up doubling up

1254
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:32,460
that's kind of how it started

1255
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,559
yeah fantastic

1256
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:38,280
Trinity is an interesting one because

1257
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,599
it's kind of I feel like it's it's one

1258
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,280
of those strains where it's like

1259
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,740
everyone has super fond memories of it

1260
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,680
but no one really kept it on lockdown

1261
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:48,059
and it brings up this idea of like why

1262
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,519
do you think it is there are these

1263
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,799
strains which people Revere so much but

1264
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,960
at the same time seemingly no one was

1265
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,880
able to really hang on to a cut or if

1266
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,500
there is a cut around now there's some

1267
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,720
people who are a bit like oh I'm not

1268
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,420
really sure if it's the real one still

1269
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,279
how do you think we got to this point

1270
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,420
I was the last one in Eugene that I knew

1271
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,339
that I had the cut and I let it go

1272
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,720
because I thought it was lame after a

1273
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:11,818
certain point you know

1274
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:13,679
um it was having these uh little seed

1275
00:47:11,818 --> 00:47:15,659
pods in it you know

1276
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:18,239
um and it was just having some

1277
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:20,039
degradation I think but that could have

1278
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,659
just been my ignorance at the time and

1279
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:23,759
me not knowing

1280
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:25,559
how to deal with the plant in the same

1281
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,079
way so I let it go because I thought it

1282
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,779
was it was boring to me after

1283
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,420
you know that many years you know

1284
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,220
and the new the new train that's around

1285
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,858
definitely isn't that you know the

1286
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:39,779
future Trend definitely wasn't that

1287
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:41,880
um and we got a bunch of Trinity strains

1288
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:45,720
since then that were almost identical

1289
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,579
but they weren't that so

1290
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:49,799
um you know a lot of these strains it's

1291
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:51,480
like usually

1292
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,099
you know there's a person that's holding

1293
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,679
a lot of these once that person decides

1294
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:57,240
to let it go a lot of times it goes away

1295
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,980
because

1296
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,598
you know people aren't that good at

1297
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,338
holding on to genetics

1298
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,318
people aren't that committed at holding

1299
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,059
on to 100 mothers you know

1300
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,338
or just going to have a space just to

1301
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:10,019
keep their staple of genetics you know

1302
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:11,940
that's just

1303
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:13,440
especially now it's kind of rare

1304
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,940
I mean I wish I still had that first

1305
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,500
Trend but

1306
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,480
you know

1307
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,280
at a certain point

1308
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,019
you get over it and it's not worth

1309
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,720
keeping anymore

1310
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:26,880
yeah that's kind of how it is for me you

1311
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,739
know like the golden pineapple

1312
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,838
um it was it was a great one for a long

1313
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,939
time I smoked it a lot now I don't even

1314
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:34,259
want to smoke it you know it's not

1315
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,280
something I put in my jar even though

1316
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,280
it's

1317
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:42,780
everyone loves it every you know new

1318
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,819
smoker loves it every you know just but

1319
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:47,040
it's just not my uh not in the not my

1320
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:49,858
cup of tea anymore

1321
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,719
yeah understandably after having enjoyed

1322
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:53,578
something for a long period of time you

1323
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:54,959
kind of look for the sort of new and

1324
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:56,160
better things

1325
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,079
I love that you mentioned the golden

1326
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,059
pineapple because it's I'm one of those

1327
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,519
people you just referenced I love it I

1328
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:05,159
I'm not burnt out on it it's um it's

1329
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:07,739
some lovely stuff is this what you would

1330
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:09,779
consider one of the sort of high quality

1331
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,699
genetics which has been around Eugene

1332
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,380
for a while I remember I read something

1333
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,179
I think it might have been online it

1334
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,760
kind of said you moved back to Eugene

1335
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:20,279
and found that there was all these sort

1336
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,319
of high quality genetics and clones that

1337
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,119
were held by the community around there

1338
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,318
was this one of them and what were some

1339
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:27,599
of the other ones that you really

1340
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:30,090
enjoyed from that scene

1341
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,359
well I mean like I was saying

1342
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,740
[Music]

1343
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:33,779
um

1344
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:35,879
you know I held a lot of these things

1345
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,260
and and I was the one that actually

1346
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,940
passed the golden pineapple around

1347
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,359
Eugene

1348
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,980
um I got it from a friend

1349
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,318
um there's this person that brought the

1350
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:49,260
brought the golden pineapple to Eugene

1351
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:51,239
on Instagram his um handle his Shad

1352
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,160
glass and he's the one that actually

1353
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:55,559
brought that cut to Eugene

1354
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:56,420
and brought it out of Hood River

1355
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:00,119
um

1356
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:02,760
so yeah that that was one of them

1357
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:04,559
um for sure but I you know when I got

1358
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,780
that

1359
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,239
uh you know

1360
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,579
at that time we had a huge amount of

1361
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:14,039
genetics in the town you know

1362
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:15,240
um so like I had you know when you it

1363
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:17,279
was very interesting when you have

1364
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,779
certain strains

1365
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,339
um and you hold certain strains and

1366
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,680
everyone knows you to hold them without

1367
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:24,900
giving them out you can get lots of

1368
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:27,299
strains and people will give you lots of

1369
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,519
strains I mean even look at the I had a

1370
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,500
strain called the Eugene Lemon Diesel I

1371
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:33,239
brought it down to

1372
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:36,480
um Santa Cruz next thing you know lemon

1373
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:38,578
tree pops out imagine that you know you

1374
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,240
bring this strain that's the Eugene

1375
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:43,440
Lemon Diesel to a town

1376
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:44,959
and next thing you know all these

1377
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,880
strains start popping out of it you know

1378
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,500
and then I found out from my um you know

1379
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,660
Santa Cruz cannabis companies all oh

1380
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,338
dude

1381
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:54,838
you're the one that brought that that to

1382
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:57,440
Santa Cruz because that's where the the

1383
00:50:54,838 --> 00:51:00,900
lemon tree came out of I said oh I know

1384
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,119
and you know but a lot of people don't

1385
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,099
want to say that you know because it

1386
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,900
doesn't sound good for them anymore you

1387
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:08,460
know what I mean that I started selling

1388
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,318
the Lemon Diesel out of a dispensary

1389
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,059
called creme de Cana out of Santa Cruz

1390
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,579
and I brought the golden pineapple down

1391
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:15,960
there too and the Silver Surfer

1392
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,818
um and we started selling them out of

1393
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,260
their dispensary next thing you know all

1394
00:51:17,818 --> 00:51:21,779
these Brands start popping up you know

1395
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:24,359
so it's funny you know

1396
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,599
normal very normal

1397
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,219
yeah it's interesting to hear that I I

1398
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,619
just want to quickly ask we've often

1399
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:34,439
heard that the lemon tree is some sort

1400
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:36,838
of Lemon Skunk hybrid do you think it's

1401
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,220
maybe just a relabeled Lemon Diesel that

1402
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:39,900
came from you or do you think there's

1403
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:42,058
maybe some sort of pollination and it

1404
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,099
was like a seed from that

1405
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,839
oh yeah I don't honestly I don't really

1406
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:47,519
know you know because anytime I've been

1407
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,139
around those guys they're super weird to

1408
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,079
me so I just assume there's some truth

1409
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:53,338
to something you know so I don't I don't

1410
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,500
really know you know what I mean I can't

1411
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:57,420
say but I do know that the lemon tree

1412
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,519
definitely isn't the Lemon Diesel

1413
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,280
because it's not as good

1414
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:05,400
um it's not even close it is good but

1415
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,380
and it grows different too

1416
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,480
um grows a little faster a little

1417
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:13,619
bushier you know the the true Lemon

1418
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:16,318
Diesel was was straight Lemon Pledge

1419
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:18,960
lemon rind and

1420
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:21,900
I mean it I couldn't I never smelled a

1421
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,858
strain more lemony than that but the way

1422
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:28,920
it grew was this very

1423
00:52:24,858 --> 00:52:31,440
slow Stout kind of Afghani style but

1424
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,720
like it had the very tight you know kind

1425
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,579
of like the Master Kush but a little you

1426
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:37,679
know it's just very interesting but it

1427
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:40,019
grew more missally and

1428
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:44,338
um but very tight very slow growing

1429
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:46,920
very tight to the stock yeah okay so

1430
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:48,299
I don't really know really when um he

1431
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,358
told me that I was like oh that makes a

1432
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,059
lot of sense you know yeah sure maybe

1433
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,318
one day we'll find out the answer

1434
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:56,819
another sort of genetic that I was

1435
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:58,858
hoping you might be able to give me a

1436
00:52:56,818 --> 00:53:01,259
bit of a rundown is I've seen you work

1437
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:04,078
with the uh best [ __ ] ever and the sour

1438
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:06,540
best [ __ ] ever this is these are sort of

1439
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,800
old school Cuts where the origins are a

1440
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:09,659
bit cloudy you know you've got some

1441
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,339
people in the scene who kind of try to

1442
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:12,719
claim ownership over them and other

1443
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:15,420
people just say look it's not really

1444
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:17,459
known and I think we know who we're

1445
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,960
talking about yeah I think there's only

1446
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,880
one person claiming ownership of this

1447
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,980
our best [ __ ] ever and he's a complete

1448
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,780
Kook you know so

1449
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,760
other than that because you can tell

1450
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:28,079
because this guy will steal like you

1451
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,400
know he would he would steal our photos

1452
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,380
you know and he would use them on

1453
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,300
Neptune's seed bank you know as his own

1454
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,619
photos trying to sell the sour best [ __ ]

1455
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,859
ever but it was tens and Kush number two

1456
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:39,480
you know and so like anyway yeah so if

1457
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:42,119
someone's willing to steal and use

1458
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,099
someone else's photos as their own I'm

1459
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,858
sure they did that with that strain too

1460
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:49,980
you know what I'm saying and for my for

1461
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:52,259
my understanding with um you know with

1462
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,420
that person and where that who I got the

1463
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,099
cut from and how they you know there's a

1464
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,680
lot of there's a lot of uh

1465
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:01,260
a lot of a lot of a lot of sinister

1466
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:04,618
stuff around that kind of reality

1467
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,240
yeah definitely the thing about it which

1468
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:08,400
hopefully I'd like to get some

1469
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:10,199
perspective from you on is what do you

1470
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,180
think are the genetics within it we've

1471
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:13,618
heard some people say that it's a whole

1472
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:15,239
range of different things we've heard

1473
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:17,818
more recently people express it it's

1474
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:19,379
probably just some sort of ogs one where

1475
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:21,239
do you sit on that

1476
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,940
well that's what I've been saying

1477
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:27,239
um honestly um you know the person that

1478
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,858
uh you know um said is the Lemon Thai by

1479
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:30,899
this that and the other well when I

1480
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:32,039
tested it with philos some years back

1481
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,539
you know

1482
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:35,039
um there it wasn't related to any of

1483
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:37,440
those genetics and they said it was an

1484
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,659
identical clone of OG Kush it's a OG

1485
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,179
Kush clone is what they said but they

1486
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:44,338
also said that with Fire OG ghost OG OG

1487
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:46,259
Kush all that so

1488
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:48,480
um we just we just say it's an S1

1489
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:50,400
because you know I don't think philos

1490
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,960
could see if it was an S1 or not if

1491
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,059
they're saying it's an identical clone

1492
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,920
and I talked to

1493
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:58,140
um you know people about this and

1494
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,119
they've agreed so

1495
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:02,940
you know I don't know what to say it

1496
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,980
seems like it seems like OG Kush to me

1497
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,019
seems like an S1 of OG

1498
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,858
that's just kind of how it seems like to

1499
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:10,259
me

1500
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:12,598
yeah sure I think there's definitely a

1501
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,720
gathering pool of white to sort of

1502
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:18,300
support that kind of similarly I've seen

1503
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:21,719
that you work with a male that you call

1504
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:25,079
the 78 lafiog and this is interesting

1505
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:27,179
because it popped that name sort of pops

1506
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,818
up in other places like there's the DNA

1507
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:31,739
release of La con which sort of alludes

1508
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:34,440
to a similar sort of parent but it might

1509
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:35,879
be different what's this male and what

1510
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,980
does it bring to the table for you and

1511
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,019
is it the similar sort of one that we

1512
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,719
saw with the Bombay kush or it's just a

1513
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:44,039
similar sort of name

1514
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,379
um I'm not really sure to be honest I

1515
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:48,779
got the pollen from um

1516
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:51,539
um my friend he goes by Andrew Puffin on

1517
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:53,880
Instagram and he got the seeds from Leo

1518
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:56,880
from Aficionado and they were you know

1519
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,760
what they were labeled so

1520
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,559
um there's a big story and uh you know a

1521
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,960
history of how those seeds were Acquired

1522
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,220
and how you know what happened and all

1523
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,659
that which I don't really want to get

1524
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:07,858
into it's none of my business and I

1525
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:08,940
don't really know what's true or not so

1526
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:10,500
I don't even want to start to project

1527
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,280
you know

1528
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,318
um

1529
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,900
so that's kind of what's up with that

1530
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:18,420
the genetic pool of it I don't really

1531
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,099
know you know we can say it's one thing

1532
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,960
and say it's another but anyone that's

1533
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:23,460
talking about it I just it's hard for me

1534
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,838
to believe

1535
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,760
um because nobody really knows and when

1536
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:30,239
I do genetic tests on it it doesn't hit

1537
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,099
the marks that they're saying it is so

1538
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,299
you know that's kind of where I've been

1539
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:35,400
at with it

1540
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,839
I do like the genetic profile of what

1541
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,338
it's offered

1542
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:40,139
um that's for sure so that's why I'm

1543
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:42,960
continually I'm working with it and

1544
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:45,539
that's why I got you know my buddy got

1545
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,599
he basically did a seed increase on it

1546
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:49,619
and so we got I got more of that from

1547
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,460
him

1548
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:56,400
yeah nice and so how does this play into

1549
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,380
or maybe more better put can you give us

1550
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,660
a bit of a run down on the back story of

1551
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:03,240
the tens and Kush and how the Genesis of

1552
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:06,118
that sort of came about

1553
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:07,858
Yeah so basically um

1554
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:12,119
so basically

1555
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:13,500
the sauro G from amiko is um I really

1556
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,720
liked a lot and so when I got that

1557
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:18,599
pollen I got that pollen

1558
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:20,338
um from someone from Drew and I it was

1559
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,260
handed to me in a little pill bottle you

1560
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:24,058
know like a little um just a pill you

1561
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,920
know there's a little bit like if you

1562
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:28,079
were to you know as a double lot pill

1563
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,119
and it had maybe like a half of a pea

1564
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,140
half of a p size worth of pollen in

1565
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,059
there

1566
00:57:31,139 --> 00:57:35,279
so I basically put that by the golden

1567
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:36,960
pineapple and the sour G and the sour

1568
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,619
brush it ever

1569
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,500
um and then just pop some seeds out of

1570
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:46,559
it and then every one out of the Sour OG

1571
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:49,019
cross was good every single one

1572
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,420
um and so that's why I kind of

1573
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:53,400
grabbing an affinity towards it and

1574
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,900
started working with it it's just

1575
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,838
because of the I like the high so much

1576
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:00,240
and there's CBD potential in it

1577
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,099
um but other than that

1578
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,659
you know that was that was the reason I

1579
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,380
started working with it to be honest and

1580
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:06,779
then

1581
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,940
the reason I started running with it is

1582
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,640
because what was being produced on the

1583
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:14,460
female end was so

1584
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:15,900
so awesome I just couldn't um

1585
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,280
you know I just wanted to keep going

1586
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,260
with it so

1587
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,300
started working with some males finding

1588
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,520
some good males throwing them buy some

1589
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,800
things and getting some good results so

1590
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:28,259
I was pretty happy

1591
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,539
nice and I've noticed online that

1592
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:32,339
there's a few different phenotypes you

1593
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:34,679
like I think I remember seeing the

1594
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:36,719
number two and the number four how would

1595
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,338
they differ in terms of if people were

1596
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:39,659
going to get one of those crosses and

1597
00:58:38,338 --> 00:58:41,219
they're wondering you know what's this

1598
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:43,078
one bringing to the table versus the

1599
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:45,419
other how would you kind of give them

1600
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,880
the comparison

1601
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,579
well the the tens and Kush number two is

1602
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,858
more like a souped up Sour Diesel you

1603
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:56,400
know has a lot of these cab notes a lot

1604
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:58,920
of a lot of diesel fuel notes um but

1605
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,318
it's going to be more stimulating even

1606
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,659
more than this hour even

1607
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:06,179
um the the richness of it and the

1608
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:08,519
complexity the terpene profile is a lot

1609
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:11,818
more complex you know a lot more lime

1610
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:14,519
nodes a lot more I mean it almost smells

1611
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:17,219
like super glue or kind of um you know

1612
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:19,739
those kind of those kind of um

1613
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:22,318
those kind of uh

1614
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:25,618
those kind of um

1615
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:29,699
notes to it but the tens and floor has

1616
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:33,539
this Sandalwood incense

1617
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:34,679
cush perfume kind of and and it's they

1618
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:38,338
look totally different the tension

1619
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:40,980
cushion number fours purple silver very

1620
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:43,980
beautiful and the tens and two is very

1621
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,298
lime green very like um soury looking

1622
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:48,000
you know

1623
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:50,460
um so that's that's that's that's the

1624
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,719
difference of them um on that context of

1625
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:56,519
the high on on um the other hand is is

1626
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:59,818
quite different

1627
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:02,119
the um the high on the

1628
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:06,239
tens and four is going to be more OG

1629
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:10,200
more you know Kush Kush La Kush K kind

1630
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:11,039
of vibe High versus the high on the tens

1631
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:13,980
and

1632
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:17,039
two it's going to be more stimulating

1633
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,838
more you know cam diesel kind of you

1634
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,739
know maybe give someone anxiety kind of

1635
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:22,920
high

1636
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:25,019
oh interesting interesting

1637
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,358
on the other end of the spectrum we've

1638
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:29,519
got the more sort of sativa offerings

1639
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,318
from you being like the hazy Kush and

1640
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,420
the Mystery cush which is kind of built

1641
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:35,338
off that what was the backstory on those

1642
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,900
ones and was it intentional that you

1643
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:39,179
wanted to have these two sort of

1644
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:41,639
opposite sort of Flagship strains or it

1645
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:43,980
just kind of came about that way

1646
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:46,679
yeah no it's um it just came about that

1647
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,318
way so basically the golden pineapple I

1648
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:52,618
crossed the OG cush Sage from th seeds

1649
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:54,420
into the um this strain called the dawn

1650
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:56,220
or Kid Next Door

1651
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:59,338
um is a classic Eugene's train which was

1652
01:00:56,219 --> 01:01:02,039
a um train wreck by purple Affy so I

1653
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:04,019
crossed the OG cush Sage by that grabbed

1654
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:07,199
some males out of that put it to the

1655
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:09,719
golden made the hazy Kush

1656
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,879
um and pretty much every single pheno

1657
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:13,679
that came out of that cross was epic and

1658
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,358
so then I back crossed it

1659
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:16,679
um and then we popped the seed and we

1660
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:18,179
didn't know what it was hence it was

1661
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:20,219
called the mystery but then if it was

1662
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:22,139
the daughter of the hazy you know so

1663
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:23,578
um the mystery Kush was just or mystery

1664
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,980
Hayes was just that it was just

1665
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:27,539
basically the daughter of the hazy Kush

1666
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,858
um and that's and that's what's up with

1667
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:31,199
that

1668
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:33,179
so it's just a back Cross of hazy

1669
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:35,338
basically that we didn't know in the

1670
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:37,019
beginning and then we figured it out

1671
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:38,759
through testing and everything

1672
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:41,420
yeah sure

1673
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:44,460
so I mean talking about the back cross

1674
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:45,960
what sort of a male do you want to pick

1675
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,539
when you're looking to do a back cross

1676
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,980
if you make an F1 hybrid with hazy Kush

1677
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:51,659
and you think all right I'll use this

1678
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,480
email from this back cross it to the

1679
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:56,879
hazy cushion we'll get our bx1 do you

1680
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,460
look for like the most hazy Kush leaning

1681
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,740
mail so to speak or how do you go about

1682
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:03,240
that process of creating that line bread

1683
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:05,399
strain

1684
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:07,500
well a lot of times when I'm doing um

1685
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,559
you know so like when I did the the

1686
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,059
tensin cross I used four males I pick my

1687
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,420
four best males and I use those four

1688
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:18,599
because I wanted to get a a a a a larger

1689
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:20,760
genetic swath swath of the of the gene

1690
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:22,920
pool what was crazy doing that

1691
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,299
it felt like I didn't get that I felt

1692
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,920
like I got

1693
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:27,179
more

1694
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,700
you know

1695
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:31,679
of the same all the progeny that I've

1696
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:33,179
popped they're all very similar you know

1697
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,279
so I always I think that's quite

1698
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:37,318
interesting that when I do these kind of

1699
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,019
multi-male pollinations

1700
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:42,298
how similar all the strains that come

1701
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:43,798
out of it how all the the phenos that

1702
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:45,179
come out of it are I thought they'd be a

1703
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:46,019
lot different

1704
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:48,358
um

1705
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:51,719
but they're actually usually more close

1706
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:53,940
to the line you know so that's kind of

1707
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:55,798
how I do it personally I pick my best

1708
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,358
males and I give more options I don't

1709
01:02:55,798 --> 01:03:00,119
really like to pick just one male that's

1710
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,900
just not how I do it personally

1711
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:02,818
um

1712
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,099
you know I have but that's just not

1713
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:09,000
generally how I do it

1714
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:11,760
okay and do you like to keep males and

1715
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,159
when you re-release seeds you're kind of

1716
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,380
remaking it in the same way or do you

1717
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:18,118
like to have like a pool of seeds pop

1718
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,740
some new ones pick a new mail and sort

1719
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:22,380
of like each offerings its own sort of

1720
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:24,899
unique thing it just depends on what I'm

1721
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:28,019
going for honestly

1722
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:30,720
um you know right now like I I did a

1723
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:32,099
femme line I reverse the hazy and I made

1724
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:33,838
some stuff with that so I'm testing that

1725
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:35,880
right now as one of my first reversal

1726
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:38,400
lines so I'm seeing if they're all good

1727
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,240
before I release any

1728
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,460
um

1729
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:44,639
other than that you know really I'm just

1730
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:46,440
trying to see and find what I am in tune

1731
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:50,219
with most you know right now

1732
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:52,500
um Bodhi gave me um Larry OG by purple

1733
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:54,959
and unicorn F3 that I'm gonna try to

1734
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:58,019
make some purple OG's with

1735
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,699
um so I have that I have an indigo child

1736
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:01,500
male that's from

1737
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:03,358
um mass medicinals that I might throw

1738
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,619
into some things and then I have some

1739
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:06,239
other stuff at home that I'm going to

1740
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:09,420
start sourcing some things to find some

1741
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:11,759
males with personally you know

1742
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:14,579
yeah wow it looks like you've got some

1743
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,099
interesting options on the horizon give

1744
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:19,559
me a little bit of a rundown about uh

1745
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:21,240
how you first came to befriend with

1746
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:22,980
Bodhi I find everyone's always really

1747
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:25,139
interested in the origins of Bodhi

1748
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,338
friendships and I guess what's kind of

1749
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:28,259
interesting is you know with the very

1750
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:29,880
similar names people might have

1751
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,160
mistakenly thought there was some

1752
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,720
tension there or something like that but

1753
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,858
uh I get the impression it's the

1754
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:36,838
opposite

1755
01:04:34,858 --> 01:04:37,858
yeah yeah yeah

1756
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:39,960
um

1757
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:42,420
oh I'm wrong I don't remember actually

1758
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,780
when I met Bodhi

1759
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:47,460
actually 2000

1760
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:52,680
when we personally met I think it was

1761
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:54,659
2000 what is it 2021 2014 Maybe 13. the

1762
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:57,179
emerald cup

1763
01:04:54,659 --> 01:05:00,420
um yeah no and and I the first I'd heard

1764
01:04:57,179 --> 01:05:01,739
about Bodhi which is very funny is um I

1765
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:03,720
was in Santa Cruz and I was doing a lot

1766
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:05,219
of work there and I was selling herb to

1767
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:07,919
this spot um Santa Cruz Mountain

1768
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:09,358
Naturals and Aptos you know and and I

1769
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,798
went in there and the guy's like hey do

1770
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:12,119
you know Bodhi seeds and I was like are

1771
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:13,920
you [ __ ] kidding someone's like

1772
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:16,140
ripping off my [ __ ] name but

1773
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,880
literally I said are you kidding he said

1774
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:20,519
no man his boat he sees he's a [ __ ] G

1775
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,200
I was like really I said okay cool you

1776
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:23,639
know and I just like you know I didn't

1777
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:24,960
really do much research I was at that

1778
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:26,879
time I was like oh that's interesting

1779
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,619
you know

1780
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,240
um but then I did a little more research

1781
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:31,740
and saw like because I was never in the

1782
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,000
forums that just wasn't a part of my

1783
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:34,618
thing you know I didn't know any of that

1784
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,179
I didn't know that world even existed to

1785
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:37,858
be honest so

1786
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:39,598
um when I found out

1787
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:40,920
um what was funny is I I find out from

1788
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,900
all these old heads they tell me about

1789
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,180
the forums you know what I mean

1790
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:47,639
um you know my friend Mike he's kagyu or

1791
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:51,058
Coastal seeds and another friend of mine

1792
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:52,318
um you know katsu seeds is uh Bob you

1793
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:53,880
know he's so they're telling me all this

1794
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:55,679
stuff about the forums and I'm like oh

1795
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,240
sick and I didn't really know that that

1796
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:58,379
was going on so I was like it was

1797
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:01,439
interesting so then when I was talking

1798

01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:04,319
the time when we hang out and we

1829

1833
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:17,400
very little little little about weed you

1834
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,779
know and um what's so crazy is the one

1835
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,240
of the last times I was hanging out with

1836
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,700
him um we started talking and you know

1837
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:25,379
as we were talking about Peru and you

1838
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:27,239
know first time I went down there and

1839
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:28,200
blah blah blah you know I was telling I

1840
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:30,179
was like oh I went down to the first

1841
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:32,219
Amazonian Shimano conference and aquitos

1842
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:34,919
you know he's all what so good llama I

1843
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:36,118
was there I said what he's like yeah I

1844
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,039
was there I was like oh that's so funny

1845
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:40,440
because that's where I actually had um

1846
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:42,180
come up with my name you know

1847
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,400
um he's all yeah man I didn't have the

1848
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:46,199
money to go into the the conference so I

1849
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,000
went down to call but I think he said or

1850
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:49,980
went on a different Journey you know I

1851
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,298
said that's [ __ ] crazy man because

1852
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,920
that's where I come in contact with my

1853
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:55,318
first teacher where I actually spawned

1854
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,039
the name greenbody because you know he

1855
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:58,739
was

1856
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,359
basically a Crazy Wisdom you know kind

1857
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:02,098
of like the real Don Juan you know his

1858
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:05,338
last Incan Royal descendant of the royal

1859
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:07,559
family basically left everything in

1860
01:08:05,338 --> 01:08:10,199
um Peru to go to India took his two sons

1861
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:11,700
to India learned buddhistarma there for

1862
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:14,338
three years under the karma cardio

1863
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:15,719
lineage come back to Peru right so I met

1864
01:08:14,338 --> 01:08:18,179
him there and so he was basically

1865
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:19,798
teaching you know the path of wisdom and

1866
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:21,359
Enlightenment through the through the

1867
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:23,100
wisdom plants and the power plants in

1868
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,560
association with quantum physics and

1869
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:27,298
buddhistarma you know so I was like ah

1870
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,920
you know like green body meaning the

1871
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:30,298
enlightenment that that derived from the

1872
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,159
wisdom plants the green you know so

1873
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:33,778
that's the where the name spawned from

1874
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,099
that moment so it's like very

1875
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:37,560
interesting all these very interesting

1876
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:40,140
parallels you know and so like

1877
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:42,060
you know we were talking some years few

1878
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,440
years for three or four years ago three

1879
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,779
years back and I was like oh we should

1880
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:47,579
do a we should do a collab to show that

1881
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:49,020
like that we're different you know and

1882
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:50,880
that but they were like homies and [ __ ]

1883
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,080
he's all we should do that you know and

1884
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,460
I was like oh we should donate all the

1885
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:54,960
money to it's only this Library Museum

1886
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,179
project you know and he's all that

1887
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,460
sounds awesome so yeah he gave me uh

1888
01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:01,319
four ancient OG males that he had that

1889
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:03,239
he had uh final hunted or someone might

1890
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:04,500
have you know hunted for him I can't

1891
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:06,358
remember those are the best ones he

1892
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,798
picked though and he gave me those and

1893
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:08,460
that's what we did that project with you

1894
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:10,198
know

1895
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:12,060

1896
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:13,198
um yeah no it's it's it's very

1897
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,480
interesting

1898
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:18,000

1902
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:24,838
respect for him and a lot of respect for

01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:26,759
what he's done his travels and really

1904
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:28,380
just more who he is as a person you know

1905
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:29,219
that had nothing to do with weed you

1906
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,319
know just

1907
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:33,838
you know he's just such a [ __ ] cool

1908
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:35,160
guy that you know he's very likable you

1909
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,679
know very sweet guy you know so then

1910
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:40,079
when you start to research like or even

1911
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,520
like you know if you just researched one

1912
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:43,500
of his trips you know or one of his

1913
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,540
travels you're like whoa It's like

1914
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,179
pretty impressive you know

1915
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:49,798
um so yeah you know um

1916
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:52,798
it's kind of the

1917
01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:55,920
kind of the the brief rundown of it to

1918
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:58,140
be honest so no brilliant backstory and

1919
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,380
I can I can certainly attest he's a very

1920
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:02,340
cool cat he's definitely one of a kind

1921
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:04,079
interesting you brought up the ancient

1922
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:06,840
OG because I wanted to ask you about

1923
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:09,420
that what sort of attributes do you

1924
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,760
think that male brings to certain

1925
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:14,340
hybrids and I've always had this

1926
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,020
suspicion that like the ancient OG was

1927
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:18,420
such a crowd favorite because of that

1928
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:20,159
mythical Iranian in it have you ever

1929
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,359
seen that sort of thing come through in

1930
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:24,599
the crosses

1931
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,519
yeah so I mean for me personally that

1932
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,600
that's the reason I like it you know the

1933
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,100
um

1934
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,020
and I'm not sure if it's from the

1935
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:33,539
Iranian that's like that's bringing all

1936
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:36,120
these qualities but

1937
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:39,500
um you know from shape

1938
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:43,380
um you know bud shape to

1939
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:45,479
trichome size to

1940
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,640
um you know these kind of

1941
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:50,819
very interesting because you know the

1942
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:53,159
snow Lotus has such a you know prominent

1943
01:10:50,819 --> 01:10:55,500
smell that this ancient OG doesn't bring

1944
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:57,539
that to such a degree right

1945
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,460
so I think that's what it is right snow

1946
01:10:57,539 --> 01:11:00,840
Lotus Iranian land race or something

1947
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,179
like that

1948
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:06,360
um and then uh you know so that snow

1949
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:08,100
Lotus you know usually is pretty strong

1950
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:09,539
um it comes in pretty heavy and it

1951
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,400
doesn't with this one it's more of the

1952
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:12,899
rainy in it that I'm assuming is coming

1953
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:14,339
in because it's it's something different

1954
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:15,599
than the snow Lotus you know so it's

1955
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:17,760
like

1956
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,100
um you know the first first nug I had of

1957
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,600
it I enjoyed it so much that I was just

1958
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,219
like I was kind of on a hunt for it

1959
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,880
after that you know

1960
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:25,980
um

1961
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,600
in motherload Gardens did a cedar

1962
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:29,519
increase of it you know so I was gonna

1963
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,679
link up with him and get some seeds from

1964
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,420
him and try to do a project that and

1965
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,800
then I just hit up you know Bodhi and

1966
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,940
he's all nah man I got a bunch of males

1967
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,420
let's do it with these I was like oh

1968
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:42,359
yeah all right let's do this then so

1969
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:44,340
yeah the it's very it's it's a it's a

1970
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:45,719
cool it's a cool um it's kind of like

1971
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,279
honestly what it reminds me of it

1972
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:49,619
reminds me of land race Terps with a

1973
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:52,979
with a new age style structure you know

1974
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:55,140
yeah wow interesting I noticed that some

1975
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:58,500
other strains you were offering were

1976
01:11:55,140 --> 01:12:01,800
utilizing the RADS which I believe is a

1977
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:04,198
cut of go geog is that correct

1978
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,300
yeah so I have the pine saw on the Goji

1979
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:07,799
Ras that um Bodie gave me some years

1980
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:10,020
back and

1981
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:12,659
that Pine saw I really like a lot the

1982
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:14,280
gojiraz I like it's just a little not my

1983
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:16,319
headspace you know it brings me it's a

1984
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:18,779
little more Indigo head

1985
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:20,939
and that's um that's a little heavy for

1986
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:22,859
me personally just it's a little

1987
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:25,279
tiresome for me so

1988
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:28,319
yeah sure sure

1989
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:31,019
so I noticed in your work that there's

1990
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:33,840
often really interesting sort of crosses

1991
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:36,300
that often utilize sort of plants that

1992
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,460
aren't really used in the same way like

1993
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:40,079
I think you mentioned earlier the Tangy

1994
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,359
land I've noticed that you've used that

1995
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:44,819
one before and for me personally that

1996
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:47,698
was a strain which I don't feel like you

1997
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:49,920
see it pop up all that often what was it

1998
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:52,139
about the tangyland for example that

1999
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,480
made you want to use it was it just a

2000
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:56,460
killer strain and do you in general look

2001
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:58,500
to utilize plants which maybe aren't

2002
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:59,939
being used in other people's breeding

2003
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,619
work or it's more just about what the

2004
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:03,419
plant has to offer

2005
01:13:01,619 --> 01:13:05,399
oh yeah with the Tangy land the reason I

2006
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,440
used it because it had this straight

2007
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:11,759
like burnt rubber

2008
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:14,339
lemon tan G Vibe you know so it you know

2009
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:17,280
it's purple it had this look it had the

2010
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:19,619
smell but um personally you know

2011
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:22,079
whenever I do a lineup or whenever I'm

2012
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:23,698
gonna pollinate I just kind of usually

2013
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,738
pick five or ten of my most favorite

2014
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:27,419
strains at that moment and I just

2015
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:28,738
pollinate them you know so it's not

2016
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,480
there's not a whole lot of them head

2017
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:32,039
signs to it it's more just like

2018
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,158
intuition and what I feel like doing

2019
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:36,840
more than anything

2020
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:40,439
sure and when you make strains in

2021
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:42,539
general do you tend to sort of pollinate

2022
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:44,219
all the females you've got maybe test

2023
01:13:42,539 --> 01:13:46,500
them out and see which ones are really

2024
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:48,119
working or do you tend to conceptualize

2025
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,619
it a bit more and think oh you know this

2026
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:51,840
female with this male is going to work

2027
01:13:49,619 --> 01:13:54,359
really well and make them a bit more

2028
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,940
like that on say on paper more so than

2029
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:58,559
just haphazardly

2030
01:13:56,939 --> 01:14:00,960
um I think everything I do is kind of

2031
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,340
haphazard but um yeah no I mean like

2032
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,679
most the stuff I'm trying to line up

2033
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:07,020
together to to make it pencil out in the

2034
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:09,119
end you know so if I'm doing a bunch of

2035
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:11,100
OG's I'm gonna you know do some OG

2036
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:13,140
oriented towards those

2037
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:14,940
um you know I'm not going to try to mix

2038
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:16,260
the turd profiles up too much because I

2039
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:18,419
don't want you know I've experienced

2040
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:20,460
that with the hazy that anything I cross

2041
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:23,279
hazy with would turn into hazy you know

2042
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,198
so I was like that wasn't the best with

2043
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:27,779
some things but some things worked out

2044
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:31,319
really good awesome awesome

2045
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:34,139
so when you do make a new strain do you

2046
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:36,479
like to test it in-house do test it with

2047
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:38,820
testers and how many seeds do you like

2048
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:41,879
to see popped if so to get an idea of

2049
01:14:38,819 --> 01:14:43,679
what's inside that gene pool

2050
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,140
um usually everything I give I give to

2051
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:49,560
two different people my one friend and

2052
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:51,659
um in Peru and he tests a lot of things

2053
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:54,480
down there and then another friend in

2054
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:56,460
southern Oregon that tests um them down

2055
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,678
there in the outside environments

2056
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:00,359
outside greenhouse and all that so I'd

2057
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:01,560
like to do a pretty pretty rigorous test

2058
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:03,420
and I

2059
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,920
you know like to give it to my friends

2060
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:06,600
and have them run it and tell me what

2061
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:09,179
they think and all that kind of thing so

2062
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,100
I'm not just trying to release stuff I

2063
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:13,560
have but that's not that's not what I'm

2064
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,300
trying to do I mean the stuff that I

2065
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:18,120
have released without testing I test and

2066
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,340
then uh you know just to make sure to

2067
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:22,079
you know I've I have sent some strands

2068
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:24,179
out that I haven't tested but then I've

2069
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:26,519
later tested them and feel good about it

2070
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:27,539
so it's not that big a deal but yeah for

2071
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,800
the most part I'm trying to test

2072
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:30,719
everything

2073
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,420
um and but me personally you know all

2074
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:36,300
I'm gonna do in my own personal testing

2075
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:38,520
realities is pop ten seeds and if I

2076
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,500
can't get a superstar out of those 10

2077
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,080
seeds it's not not something I'm really

2078
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:46,380
wanting to release to be honest

2079
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:49,079
yeah sure it raises an interesting sort

2080
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:51,900
of question because for the longest time

2081
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:53,640
there's been sort of this underlying

2082
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:55,139
idea in the community that you have to

2083
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,699
test your seeds before you release them

2084
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:59,280
and then more recently we've seen the

2085
01:15:56,698 --> 01:16:01,019
Advent of breeders who are open about

2086
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:02,340
the fact they say you know I'm selling

2087
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,380
these seeds they're not tested so

2088
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:06,179
they're quite open about it but then

2089
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,739
they're still and and like in a certain

2090
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:09,060
regard people are like oh well that's

2091
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:10,198
okay you know you're being upfront about

2092
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:12,060
it

2093
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,500
um but then you know when maybe they've

2094
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,300
got a bone to pick with that same

2095
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:17,279
breeder they'll then be like well you

2096
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,320
don't test your seeds you know and it's

2097
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,479
sort of like do you feel there is an

2098
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:23,340
expectation to test seeds or do you feel

2099
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:24,599
like just being honest is more important

2100
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:27,420
and it actually doesn't really matter

2101
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:29,280
what you do where do you sit

2102
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,060
well I think being honest is the number

2103
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:32,279
one

2104
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:34,560
thing that should be happening if people

2105
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:36,960
want to risk um you know because I've

2106
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,400
just recently sold stuff that's untested

2107
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,560
because people wanted it so bad and I

2108
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:41,939
said dude I haven't tested it but if you

2109
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,260
want to rock it I'll sell them to you

2110
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:45,119
but I'm just telling you man I haven't

2111
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,920
tested them so I don't know and they're

2112
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:48,599
like I don't care dude they just buy

2113
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:51,060
them you know so it's cool you know

2114
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,560
honesty is the key you know

2115
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,960
um I mean me personally I think

2116
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,699
ethically I want to test my gear because

2117
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,399
I don't want to send stuff out to people

2118
01:16:56,698 --> 01:17:01,678
that's not going to do good

2119
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:03,479
um maybe not going to germinate good I'm

2120
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,158
not going to perform good I don't I

2121
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:07,500
don't want that for people

2122
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:08,759
um even if I but if it doesn't perform

2123
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,880
good

2124
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:13,260
um because of their conditions then it's

2125
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,179
okay too

2126
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,860
um you know I have a 100 money back

2127
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:18,300
guarantee not money back but I'll just

2128
01:17:16,859 --> 01:17:19,679
replace your seeds I'll give you packs

2129
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,880
of seeds if you don't even like anything

2130
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,260
you don't like the way it smells you

2131
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,060
don't like the way it grew it didn't pop

2132
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:25,320
for you it wasn't as strong as you

2133
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:26,760
wanted whatever you just let me know

2134
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:28,619
I'll just give you new season I don't

2135
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,480
care you know it's not a big deal you

2136
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:32,460
know so

2137
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:34,500
um that's just kind of where my ethos is

2138
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:37,439
on that on that

2139
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,939
yeah I saw your post on Instagram and I

2140
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,099
was really impressed with your return

2141
01:17:38,939 --> 01:17:43,439
policy in case people aren't aware it's

2142
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,060
just basically saying that no matter who

2143
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,859
you got the seeds from no matter how you

2144
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,480
came about acquiring them like if you've

2145
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:51,238
got the packaging and you can show me

2146
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:52,619
you know that they were my seeds and

2147
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:53,939
you're unhappy with the results I'll

2148
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:56,579
sort of sort you out with something

2149
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:58,738
going forward do you think that that's a

2150
01:17:56,579 --> 01:18:01,380
policy that other breeders should adopt

2151
01:17:58,738 --> 01:18:03,479
more so going forward or what's your

2152
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:06,300
thoughts on the way other breeders offer

2153
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:08,698
return policies I know that notably some

2154
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:11,100
breeders are you know quite reluctant to

2155
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:12,658
offer replacement seeds do you feel like

2156
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,699
there's a happy medium or do you feel

2157
01:18:12,658 --> 01:18:17,039
like your policy is sort of the best

2158
01:18:14,698 --> 01:18:19,319
option going forward

2159
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:20,519
oh I don't I don't think I you know

2160
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:22,139
people can do whatever they want it's

2161
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,940
not my business what other breeders do

2162
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:25,320
or what other people are doing you know

2163
01:18:23,939 --> 01:18:27,178
I just do what I do because that's what

2164
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:29,039
I like to do it that's the way I like to

2165
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:30,119
do it that's what makes me feel good in

2166
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:30,719
the end you know

2167
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:33,300
um

2168
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:36,239
I don't you know yeah what other people

2169
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:37,800
do is not my business I don't know I

2170
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:39,119
don't want to try to make a standard for

2171
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,679
everyone how they should think and be

2172
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:42,658
you know that's already happened enough

2173
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:46,859
this last year I think it's stupid

2174
01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:49,859
so I don't want to get involved in that

2175
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:51,359
yeah understandable and I mean recently

2176
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:53,639
there's been a lot of discussion over

2177
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:56,759
the past year or so about this idea of

2178
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:58,560
if you buy a packet of seeds are you

2179
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,840
entitled to sort of do with them what

2180
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,820
you want meaning if you find a male from

2181
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:05,159
those seeds should you breed with it do

2182
01:19:02,819 --> 01:19:06,840
you feel like it's okay for someone if

2183
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:08,939
they've bought a packet of seeds to go

2184
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,560
ahead and breed with it and because I

2185
01:19:08,939 --> 01:19:12,359
think you know we've kind of seen some

2186
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,880
breeders who get a little bit upset at

2187
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:16,380
that and it does raise this question of

2188
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,420
you know well if you've bought the seeds

2189
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,800
like do you truly own them in the sense

2190
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,539
that you can do what you want with the

2191
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,239
progeny

2192
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:26,399
well don't you I mean you bought them

2193
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,139
you owned them it's like that's kind of

2194
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:29,460
how I look at it and I've already given

2195
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,140
everyone the pass to do whatever they

2196
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:32,760
want with my genetics and they don't

2197
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:33,840
have to credit me they don't even have

2198
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,400
to give me a name they don't have to

2199
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,079
give me anything I don't care

2200
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:39,000
they bought it you know do whatever they

2201
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:40,079
want this it's a plan the plant's free

2202
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,238
you know

2203
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,800
Freedom's free too you know so do what

2204
01:19:42,238 --> 01:19:47,279
you wish I'm not the I'm not the boss

2205
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:49,199
and I'm not the GateKeeper you know so

2206
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,579
I think people should be able to do

2207
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:52,379
whatever they want with whatever they

2208
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:54,000
own I think they should be able to do

2209
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:55,679
whatever they want in their own mind and

2210
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,640
their own actions

2211
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,380
um I don't want to be the one that

2212
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,820
controls it so when people do ask me hey

2213
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,980
man is it cool yeah do whatever you want

2214
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:03,359
rename it whatever you want do whatever

2215
01:20:01,979 --> 01:20:05,158
you want

2216
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:08,099
that's called freedom

2217
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:11,339
and I'm into that kind of thing

2218
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:13,739
yeah strong point there I like that

2219
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:15,840
so on a kind of different note I've seen

2220
01:20:13,738 --> 01:20:17,819
on your Instagram that there were some

2221
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,500
photos I saw of these really impressive

2222
01:20:17,819 --> 01:20:21,119
looking plants that were grown in

2223
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,560
greenhouses and as far as I was

2224
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,140
concerned they look as good as some of

2225
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,179
the top sort of indoor you see do you

2226
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:29,460
think that Greenhouse grown product will

2227
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:31,140
become a mainstave the industry going

2228
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:34,079
forward and do you think there ever

2229
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:36,539
might come a time when it gains the sort

2230
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,039
of top shelf status over indoor or do

2231
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:40,880
you think indoors just always probably

2232
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:44,279
going to hold that title

2233
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:46,440
well I think um I mean me personally I

2234
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:48,539
think um mixed light greenhouse is

2235
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:50,279
probably gonna be a way of the future

2236
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:51,539
and every level

2237
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:53,099
um because you're going to be able to

2238
01:20:51,539 --> 01:20:56,579
advance and get higher trichome

2239
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:59,520
cannabinoid counts when you do a sun

2240
01:20:56,579 --> 01:21:01,519
plus mixed lighting because you have the

2241
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:04,199
sun plus you have these other spectrums

2242
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:07,080
that are artificial and that does

2243
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:09,299
something I think even just light

2244
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:12,539
deprivation Greenhouse with proper

2245
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:15,600
climate controlled uh

2246
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:17,039
greenhouses is going to be the is going

2247
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,179
to be the future

2248
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:20,279
um personally just because of the

2249
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:22,260
overhead and the P L's and Roi of what

2250
01:21:20,279 --> 01:21:23,880
that product is

2251
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:27,360
so

2252
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:29,520
um you know me personally even with all

2253
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:33,420
that Greenhouse herb that was grown so

2254
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:35,340
good it was so tasty it's just and I

2255
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:37,319
smoked a lot of it

2256
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:39,600
I mean

2257
01:21:37,319 --> 01:21:40,859
I still prefer indoor that's just me you

2258
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:45,239
know

2259
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:48,479
um but if I were to you know

2260
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:51,059
if I were to have grown the greenhouse

2261
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,339
in the same

2262
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:56,760
um boundary of protocol as I would of

2263
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:57,920
the indoor I mean it's just the way the

2264
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:02,239
future really

2265
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,239
to have a climate controlled

2266
01:22:02,698 --> 01:22:08,819
um non-artificially lit

2267
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:12,600
with artificial supplementation I think

2268
01:22:08,819 --> 01:22:14,460
that's just a way of the future honestly

2269
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,699
I'm not a fan of outdoor herb meaning

2270
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:20,279
like full season grown outside like with

2271
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:22,439
all the dust and all the dirt and all

2272
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:24,000
the wind and all the conditions beating

2273
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:26,279
on the plant the whole time that's not

2274
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,020
really I'm not a fan of smoking that

2275
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:29,759
um personally

2276
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:33,920
um but I'm a huge fan of smoking

2277
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:37,140
controlled climate controlled Greenhouse

2278
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:39,420
yeah certainly and on that topic of

2279
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:42,360
greenhouses what's your thoughts about

2280
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:44,219
big AGS move into the can of space there

2281
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:46,079
seems to be a lot of concern about it

2282
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:47,760
but we've also seen on the other end of

2283
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:50,640
the spectrum that a lot of the Canadian

2284
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,619
LPS and some of the American ones have

2285
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,840
been kind of going bankrupt like

2286
01:22:52,619 --> 01:22:56,640
dominoes in a sense over the past few

2287
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,319
years do you think this is a growing

2288
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,360
Trend and do you think we do need to be

2289
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:02,579
concerned about big AG moving into the

2290
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:04,019
counter space

2291
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:05,819
well I don't think we need to be

2292
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:09,000
concerned it's going to happen you know

2293
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:11,698
I'm most my products that I buy are from

2294
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,679
Big AG suppliers you know so why why

2295
01:23:11,698 --> 01:23:15,658
would you buy beneficial bugs from like

2296
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,279
your grow store we could get them from a

2297
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:20,099
big AG supplier that's going to be like

2298
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:22,559
a tenth of the cost you know

2299
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:25,920
um why would you buy gallons when you

2300
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:27,539
can buy 55 gallon or you know totes or

2301
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,679
whatever it just doesn't make sense you

2302
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:31,800
know and the only way you can get those

2303
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:33,239
is usually from you know big AG you know

2304
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,880
um because they're the the housing

2305
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:37,619
housing formats for these you know

2306
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,380
so I mean I'm not worried about it I

2307
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:42,179
like I like the I like the big AG influx

2308
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,739
to be honest because they have a lot of

2309
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:46,380
knowledge and information of scaling

2310
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:48,658
that just isn't in the Cannabis industry

2311
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:51,600
certainly that's something I try to keep

2312
01:23:48,658 --> 01:23:53,279
in mind because I I forget who we're

2313
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,920
having a discussion with but we were

2314
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:57,779
talking to someone one time about how a

2315
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,300
lot of the sort of

2316
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:03,420
um processes and technology that are

2317
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:05,159
kind of being toted as the the newest

2318
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,079
and most improved in the Cannabis

2319
01:24:05,158 --> 01:24:09,899
industry we're often pioneered by big AG

2320
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:12,000
in like the 30s or the 40s even

2321
01:24:09,899 --> 01:24:14,698
what's exactly what's your thoughts on

2322
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,640
the idea that they have a good place to

2323
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:19,619
play in the sense that they're probably

2324
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,600
going to end up producing sort of more

2325
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:23,939
of like the Bud Light equivalent for the

2326
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:26,219
Casual enthusiasts and then the older

2327
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:29,158
heads are sort of The Craft Brewers do

2328
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:31,319
you subscribe to that sort of idea

2329
01:24:29,158 --> 01:24:34,198
well what I what I see happening is

2330
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:36,420
basically there are some collaborations

2331
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:40,079
happening with with a lot of this

2332
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:42,539
because when when we start working with

2333
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:44,760
um big Ag and we start working with

2334
01:24:42,539 --> 01:24:46,198
these bigger bigger companies they're

2335
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,820
going to want to work with people like

2336
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:50,039
us because we're going to be the ones

2337
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:51,899
holding the relationship to the plant

2338
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:53,880
information we're going to be the ones

2339
01:24:51,899 --> 01:24:55,559
holding all the genetics we're going to

2340
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:58,260
be the ones that can

2341
01:24:55,560 --> 01:25:01,080
you know with with their with their

2342
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:03,300
input and with their information and

2343
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:05,219
with their help and our help really

2344
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:07,860
reach new heights of this industry you

2345
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:10,020
know that's just my perspective Mel

2346
01:25:07,859 --> 01:25:12,599
certainly and do you think there are any

2347
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:14,520
specific lessons that the big producers

2348
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,020
could learn from the small time Growers

2349
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,239
and I guess specifically what I'm

2350
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:20,100
interested in is there seems to be this

2351
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:22,319
critical point where at a certain point

2352
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:24,480
in scaling up the quality just

2353
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:25,738
inherently goes down do you think that

2354
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:27,599
there's something the big producers

2355
01:25:25,738 --> 01:25:28,919
could learn from the more craft Growers

2356
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,120
to get over that or do you think it's

2357
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,119
just a problem of scale

2358
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:36,300
um no I don't think it's a problem with

2359
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:39,420
scale personally but the I think the

2360
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:40,980
cultivation aspect is is is

2361
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:43,260
um not something that could that's going

2362
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:45,839
to be hindered so much by scale I think

2363
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:49,140
it's more of the um

2364
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,460
more of the processing aspects that are

2365
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,260
limited by scale

2366
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:54,179
yeah okay interesting so do you think

2367
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:56,179
that there will always kind of be a spot

2368
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:58,319
in the market for the mom and pop

2369
01:25:56,179 --> 01:26:00,119
connoisseur producer or do you think

2370
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:02,219
with the changing laws it's going to

2371
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:03,599
become harder and harder

2372
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:05,698
well it's for sure going to become

2373
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,500
harder and harder for the mom and pop

2374
01:26:05,698 --> 01:26:10,259
Because unless that Mom and Pop is

2375
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,520
working with someone that can take it to

2376
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:13,920
the next level it's going to be really

2377
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:16,139
difficult for them to survive

2378
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,579
um that's just how it goes you know and

2379
01:26:16,139 --> 01:26:19,679
that's how we've seen in every other

2380
01:26:17,579 --> 01:26:21,059
industry if you even look at the whiskey

2381
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,219
industry

2382
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:26,520
um with like you know Bourbons or like

2383
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:27,359
you know craft beer it's the same you

2384
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,540
know

2385
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:32,279
most mostly's Mom and Pops aren't you

2386
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:34,920
know or even the small craft breweries

2387
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:38,819
they're not Mom and Pops they're

2388
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:41,039
you know a a diva style artist that's

2389
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:42,960
backed by someone with money

2390
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:45,539
you know that so you got this craft

2391
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,639
Brewer that's a high-end Brewer and then

2392
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:49,738
they're backed with um by you know a

2393
01:26:47,639 --> 01:26:51,359
hedge funder or a friend that's got

2394
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:53,158
money or something like that to take

2395
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:55,559
them to this next level so most these

2396
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:58,979
craft breweries are like that you know

2397
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:01,800
so if we look at that industry

2398
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:04,259
um you know doesn't look good for

2399
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,520
the mom-and-pop little grower and Mendo

2400
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:07,560
you know

2401
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,960
yeah sure

2402
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:12,000
so do you think that maybe a necessary

2403
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:14,880
step in progressing forward is that

2404
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,219
people kind of look to reach out and

2405
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,779
make these Partnerships or you know

2406
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:20,520
Foster a sort of more friendly

2407
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:21,960
relationship with other people because

2408
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,760
at the moment we see a lot of people

2409
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,739
trying to create their own little brand

2410
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,440
with a small team do you think maybe

2411
01:27:25,738 --> 01:27:29,698
it's more advantageous to try to do

2412
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:32,839
something on a bigger scale in

2413
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:32,839
partnership with other people

2414
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:37,920
um I mean

2415
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:38,819
even like myself if I wouldn't have

2416
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,699
um

2417
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:44,279
made the Partnerships that I have

2418
01:27:41,698 --> 01:27:46,738
whether they be friends or whether they

2419
01:27:44,279 --> 01:27:49,439
be colleagues whether they be whatever

2420
01:27:46,738 --> 01:27:51,959
they are if I wouldn't have made these

2421
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:54,238
partnership friendships connections

2422
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:56,399
relations I wouldn't be able to succeed

2423
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:58,379
like I'm about to

2424
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:00,719
um it just wouldn't be possible

2425
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:02,940
it is with the right relations it is

2426
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:05,639
with the right connections

2427
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:06,960
um so that's just how I see it if if

2428
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:09,300
anyone thinks they're going to do it on

2429
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,800
their own I mean good luck because how

2430
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:12,420
are you going to fund that we even see

2431
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,219
how the California industry pretty much

2432
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,600
shut down anyone with under a million

2433
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:16,739
dollars you know

2434
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,699
so

2435
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:23,119
meaning a liquid million dollars that

2436
01:28:20,698 --> 01:28:25,678
you're able to just throw away you know

2437
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:27,840
yeah that's been a focal point of

2438
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,699
discussion on the past few episodes and

2439
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,440
most notably we've seen there's a bit of

2440
01:28:29,698 --> 01:28:34,319
an exodus of people from California

2441
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:37,678
going to other states notably places

2442
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:41,219
like Oklahoma and a few other places

2443
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:43,260
that have got sort of a more LAX uh set

2444
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:46,319
of rules at the moment do you think

2445
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:48,780
these states will basically continue to

2446
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:50,399
flourish or do you think legalities and

2447
01:28:48,779 --> 01:28:52,079
the things which have turned a

2448
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:53,638
California into what it is right now

2449
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:55,380
will eventually catch up with these

2450
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:57,480
other states

2451
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:59,460
no I think some of these states saw that

2452
01:28:57,479 --> 01:29:00,539
saw what California did and didn't want

2453
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:02,158
to do that

2454
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:03,359
they saw what happened and they didn't

2455
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:05,219
want to do that they wanted to actually

2456
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:05,939
create business for their for their

2457
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:08,219
state

2458
01:29:05,939 --> 01:29:10,559
versus California basically creating so

2459
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:13,319
many hurdles where business isn't going

2460
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:15,780
to happen in the state unless you're

2461
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:18,299
you know unless you got a huge backbone

2462
01:29:15,779 --> 01:29:19,979
of cash so

2463
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:21,900
um

2464
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:23,939
yeah it's been really difficult for

2465
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:27,000
people I think that way

2466
01:29:23,939 --> 01:29:29,579
are there any states that have kind of

2467
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,619
particularly stood out to you as seeming

2468
01:29:29,579 --> 01:29:33,658
more kind of welcoming to people who are

2469
01:29:31,619 --> 01:29:35,519
looking to get a get their business up

2470
01:29:33,658 --> 01:29:36,658
and running or would you say look if

2471
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,480
you're doing it now just do it where

2472
01:29:36,658 --> 01:29:42,420
you're at now and just do a good job

2473
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:44,399
I mean Oregon Oregon it's been pretty

2474
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:47,039
easy Most states that are happening now

2475
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:49,679
are pretty easy Oklahoma's really easy

2476
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:51,539
um you know obviously in Michigan you

2477
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:55,500
know New York's gonna pop off soon

2478
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:57,500
Florida these places are you know but a

2479
01:29:55,500 --> 01:30:00,179
lot of them are they're hurtled through

2480
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,079
licensing hurdles you know

2481
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:05,279
um

2482
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:07,319
so I mean for me personally

2483
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,819
I mean I don't I don't I'm not telling

2484
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:10,500
anyone to get into the industry to be

2485
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:12,238
honest because

2486
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,158
you know I don't think it's a good play

2487
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:16,198
unless you've already figured it out

2488
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,939
you know or unless you're coming with

2489
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:18,658
something new or something hot to the

2490
01:30:17,939 --> 01:30:22,439
market

2491
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:24,359
I mean a new brand really now it's a

2492
01:30:22,439 --> 01:30:27,719
little late I think you know

2493
01:30:24,359 --> 01:30:29,939
yeah for sure

2494
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:32,698
so something I wanted to chat to you

2495
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:35,819
about is that you are a passionate fan

2496
01:30:32,698 --> 01:30:38,638
like myself of Organics so I'd love to

2497
01:30:35,819 --> 01:30:39,899
know what is your recommendation for

2498
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,819
someone who's looking to get into

2499
01:30:39,899 --> 01:30:44,039
Organics maybe they're transitioning

2500
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:46,079
maybe they've never grown before what

2501
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:48,779
sort of a base setup you might recommend

2502
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:50,639
to them and do you um you know follow a

2503
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:52,559
particular style of Organics or are you

2504
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:54,900
just kind of a mix and match and use

2505
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,900
what you like

2506
01:30:54,899 --> 01:30:59,399
well I um I mainly use dries but I'm

2507
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:01,679
coming out with my own line and my own

2508
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:03,658
soil line so that's what I use right now

2509
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,980
is I'm using all my own products that

2510
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:06,779
I'm in collaboration with another

2511
01:31:04,979 --> 01:31:07,979
company that I won't mention here right

2512
01:31:06,779 --> 01:31:09,779
now

2513
01:31:07,979 --> 01:31:12,000
um I guess until we release you know but

2514
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:14,158
we're all in licensing process right now

2515
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,800
of offering uh you know a start to

2516
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:19,379
finish soil and uh you know three-part

2517
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,579
pelletized nutrients some um you know

2518
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:22,100
liquid

2519
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:24,000
um cold extract

2520
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:26,100
Forest hummus

2521
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,300
liquid product you know these kind of

2522
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,520
things that are

2523
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:31,199
basically that's my that's what I use

2524
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,840
now I use that with a couple other

2525
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:37,138
products you know I use a you know a

2526
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:40,380
liquid food compost and then um that's a

2527
01:31:37,139 --> 01:31:43,260
liquid I use and then I use um em

2528
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:46,859
also so you know just basically pretty

2529
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:49,380
simple Organics but

2530
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:52,380
um you know a lot of dry amendments

2531
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:53,819
very little products I mean I don't

2532
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,760
think you can buy any of the products I

2533
01:31:53,819 --> 01:32:00,840
use from the grow store so everything's

2534
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:03,719
either on bulk bulk AG or you know these

2535
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:06,600
type of these type of genre

2536
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:09,480
all organic though dry pelletized or

2537
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:12,420
like I said um you know em is a

2538
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:15,479
basically like a super lab you know with

2539
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:17,279
a bunch of other probiotic reality to it

2540
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:19,500
um you know and then the liquid food

2541
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:22,139
compost this hydraulic hydrolyzed food

2542
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:23,698
compost they add enzyme too and break

2543
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:26,659
down the food compost and make a liquid

2544
01:32:23,698 --> 01:32:26,658
nutrient with it so

2545
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:32,219
so that's the basics

2546
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:34,860
yeah brilliant and do you think that

2547
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:37,139
Organics can be utilized or even

2548
01:32:34,859 --> 01:32:39,119
automated such that it can be used by

2549
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:41,340
bigger facilities because this is a sort

2550
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:43,439
of idea we've oh for sure heard yeah

2551
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:46,199
we've heard a lot of people say that you

2552
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:48,000
just don't see it happening do you see a

2553
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:50,219
day where there will be you know a big

2554
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,840
producer who utilizes no-till or

2555
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:54,420
something like that

2556
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,880
well I mean like even our ours is a

2557
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:59,219
somewhat no-till but yeah like

2558
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,900
honestly it's you're gonna have to love

2559
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:03,000
the plant you know because this Organics

2560
01:33:00,899 --> 01:33:06,059
thing isn't for the money it's for the

2561
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,779
love of it and the the P L and Roi of it

2562
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:11,940
works and it can scale heavily

2563
01:33:09,779 --> 01:33:13,979
um if you know what you're doing if you

2564
01:33:11,939 --> 01:33:15,539
don't for sure you're gonna fail

2565
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:17,158
um and you're not going to produce what

2566
01:33:15,539 --> 01:33:19,319
you need if you know what you're doing

2567
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:22,019
then you're going to succeed

2568
01:33:19,319 --> 01:33:24,238
um I think it can uh

2569
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:26,219
you know the thing is just the yield of

2570
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,479
convention is is better you know so

2571
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:30,060
you're going to get more you're going to

2572
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:32,579
get more more herb with uh chemicals you

2573
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:34,860
know and I haven't been able to get more

2574
01:33:32,579 --> 01:33:36,359
weight out of Organics yet

2575
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:38,339
um I've been able to match it and I've

2576
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:39,658
been with through LED and all this kind

2577
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:42,300
of stuff but

2578
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:43,859
um I haven't been able to surpass

2579
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:46,020
um conventional

2580
01:33:43,859 --> 01:33:48,719
uh weights conventional cultivation

2581
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,699
weights with Organic [ __ ]

2582
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,439
um but I won't you know personally I

2583
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:55,019
don't ingest anything that's grown with

2584
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:56,339
conventional salts and all that so I

2585
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:58,440
mean even if I grew with that I wouldn't

2586
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,179
be able to smoke it so

2587
01:33:58,439 --> 01:34:04,559
um you know that's just what's up I only

2588
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:08,760
I personally only smoke organic herb um

2589
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:11,280
I usually 95 of the time eat only

2590
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,780
organic food so obviously unless I'm

2591
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,000
going to a restaurant things like this

2592
01:34:12,779 --> 01:34:17,238
you know so that's just how I this is

2593
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:20,460
how my makeup is

2594
01:34:17,238 --> 01:34:22,738
yeah certainly I I subscribe to the same

2595
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:24,899
sort of ideas and trying to eat organic

2596
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:27,059
where possible and you raise this sort

2597
01:34:24,899 --> 01:34:29,158
of interesting idea in my mind that a

2598
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:31,739
lot of people who grow organic tend to

2599
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:33,359
become more conscious of these sort of

2600
01:34:31,738 --> 01:34:34,678
things about the types of food they're

2601
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:37,679
ingesting and trying to get more

2602
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:39,719
nutrient dense food or inputs wherever

2603
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:42,300
possible and I think it was even Bodhi

2604
01:34:39,719 --> 01:34:44,760
who said that you know Organics can be

2605
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:46,980
like a gateway to just gardening in

2606
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,840
general do you agree with that do you

2607
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:50,819
find that you also tend to just grow

2608
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,860
potatoes and you know just whatever it

2609
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:54,420
may be because you've learned about how

2610
01:34:52,859 --> 01:34:56,099
to grow organically with cannabis or was

2611
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:58,319
it the other way around for you or how

2612
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:59,460
did that work

2613
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:01,319
um it was kind of the other way around

2614
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:03,960
for me I learned to grow I mean Eugene

2615
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:05,759
if you had you know camweed like Hydro

2616
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,800
grown weed in Eugene you're like looked

2617
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,679
down upon you know if you didn't have

2618
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:12,300
like the dankest organic herb you

2619
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:13,739
weren't like anyone in Eugene you know

2620
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:14,820
that's kind of just how the vibe was

2621
01:35:13,738 --> 01:35:16,559
there you know it wasn't like you're

2622
01:35:14,819 --> 01:35:18,238
busting out you're like oh man I got

2623
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,800
this Hydro dude check out this hydro

2624
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:21,899
weed it's so dank that just not what's

2625
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:23,579
not happening you would be at last at

2626
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:25,319
there you know

2627
01:35:23,579 --> 01:35:27,779
um that's just how the culture was there

2628
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:28,979
you know so this is different you know I

2629
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:31,979
don't know it's interesting you

2630
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:33,658
mentioned that because in places in

2631
01:35:31,979 --> 01:35:35,039
other spots in California and around the

2632
01:35:33,658 --> 01:35:37,619
world you know for the longest time you

2633
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:40,859
know I got that Hydro was touted as

2634
01:35:37,619 --> 01:35:43,439
being the bee's knees but I feel like in

2635
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:46,738
the last few years at least in the sort

2636
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:49,259
of educated consumer's mind the indoor

2637
01:35:46,738 --> 01:35:52,019
no-till organic cannabis has become

2638
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:53,460
synonymous with the highest quality have

2639
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:55,820
you found this to be true in your

2640
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:55,819
experience

2641
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:00,719
um I mean I'm still waiting for people

2642
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:02,698
to give me a jar of weed that's danker

2643
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,079
than my jar of weed I don't know I'm not

2644
01:36:02,698 --> 01:36:06,299
saying that I got the best weed by any

2645
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:07,738
means but I sure would love someone to

2646
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:10,320
give me a jar that's better so I can

2647
01:36:07,738 --> 01:36:11,698
smoke it okay interesting and then I

2648
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:13,439
want to and I want to be friends with

2649
01:36:11,698 --> 01:36:15,899
that person

2650
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:17,939
yeah definitely I mean have you ever

2651
01:36:15,899 --> 01:36:19,979
been given any Jaws that were

2652
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:22,619
particularly impressive maybe not better

2653
01:36:19,979 --> 01:36:24,299
but just still quite impressive

2654
01:36:22,619 --> 01:36:26,539
people don't usually give me weed for

2655
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:28,800
some reason I don't understand why

2656
01:36:26,539 --> 01:36:30,899
ah there you go all right people we're

2657
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,719
putting the call out I mean I have one

2658
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:35,579
friend that um is from Eugene that I I

2659
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:37,380
always enjoy deserve and his herb was

2660
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:41,460
always dank um he's a good buddy of mine

2661
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:42,659
Brent his uh IG handles fanario Farms

2662
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:45,480
um and

2663
01:36:42,658 --> 01:36:46,979
I gotta say that in Eugene I feel like

2664
01:36:45,479 --> 01:36:50,279
we're the

2665
01:36:46,979 --> 01:36:52,138
two of the better you know organic

2666
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:55,859
Growers over the last couple decades

2667
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:57,480
there and I think you know we're still

2668
01:36:55,859 --> 01:37:00,599
two Brands kicking out of that town

2669
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:02,698
still so they must have meant something

2670
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:05,400
for all those years

2671
01:37:02,698 --> 01:37:07,259
certainly and you raise another good

2672
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:09,359
little segue here and that I noticed in

2673
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:12,179
some of your crosses you utilize the dog

2674
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:14,460
walker OG which was made by a friend of

2675
01:37:12,179 --> 01:37:17,639
the show one eye who's also based out of

2676
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:19,560
Oregon and it got me wondering do you

2677
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:21,060
find there's like networking and

2678
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:22,860
friendships within the Oregon Community

2679
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,880
are you friends with one eye for example

2680
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:26,039
or

2681
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:27,900
yeah I love it she's cool if he's he's

2682
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:29,819
cool as [ __ ] yeah for sure rich is a

2683
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:31,439
good guy um I mean it's a it's a tight

2684
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:32,579
scene everyone knows each other I'm not

2685
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:34,500
to say everyone gets along with each

2686
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:37,079
other because there's a lot of um weird

2687
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:39,300
jealousies and envies and you know

2688
01:37:37,079 --> 01:37:40,559
obtuse perspectives based out of

2689
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:43,380
ignorance and all that kind of stuff

2690
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:46,800
just like normal Humanity you know

2691
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:48,600
and then you know how Oregon is

2692
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,520
everyone thinks they're the best at it

2693
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:52,139
and everyone thinks they're the you know

2694
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:54,179
what I mean got the best or do the best

2695
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:56,279
or whatever you know it's a weird weird

2696
01:37:54,179 --> 01:37:57,539
area and they wanted to you know they

2697
01:37:56,279 --> 01:38:00,179
want the best for the cheapest that's

2698
01:37:57,539 --> 01:38:02,399
Oregon you know

2699
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:03,960
that's like that's old old people buying

2700
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:06,359
packs right

2701
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:10,260
well I mean it's even in the like you

2702
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:12,420
know any any anywhere it's like that you

2703
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,800
know yeah most people don't even most

2704
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:15,480
people don't even know what good is

2705
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,520
National you know that's just how it is

2706
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:19,619
I've seen I've seen all the I've seen

2707
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,020
work herb you know I've seen boxes on

2708
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:24,119
boxes on boxes of the most exotic hype

2709
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:26,159
herbs it's like whatever and it's

2710
01:38:24,119 --> 01:38:27,719
[ __ ] garbage so it's like

2711
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:30,238
you know I don't know what's happening

2712
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:31,980
you know so you raised an interesting

2713
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:34,500
point which I was discussing with a

2714
01:38:31,979 --> 01:38:36,599
friend a few years back in that we're at

2715
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:39,179
a Grower's Market in Downtown Oakland

2716
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:41,460
and he had a jar of headband from Bob

2717
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:44,520
Hemphill and he also had a jar of some

2718
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:46,679
wedding cake from someone else and the

2719
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,360
the wedding cake it had the look it had

2720
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:50,460
the Aesthetics it was Frosty but there

2721
01:38:48,359 --> 01:38:52,859
was no Terps to it it didn't leave a

2722
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:54,960
lasting impression it was really kind of

2723
01:38:52,859 --> 01:38:57,059
quite lackluster in a certain regard and

2724
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,100
yet the headband it hit you in the face

2725
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,719
with these loud Terps it was the real

2726
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:03,179
cut it just had everything you wanted

2727
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:05,698
from a headband and yet my friend was

2728
01:39:03,179 --> 01:39:07,440
saying to me you know these jars will

2729
01:39:05,698 --> 01:39:09,000
sell for the same amount and I thought

2730
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:10,979
to myself how can that be like the

2731
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,139
headband is clearly Head and Shoulders

2732
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:14,339
above this wedding cake and he was

2733
01:39:13,139 --> 01:39:16,560
saying yeah but you know the average

2734
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:18,719
consumer they're used to that headband

2735
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,760
smell they've smelted over the past 10

2736
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:22,500
years a bunch of times and the wedding

2737
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:24,719
cake it's all the bee's knees and the

2738
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:27,238
rage online at the moment so my question

2739
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:29,639
is how do we go about educating the

2740
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:31,198
community or the Casual Enthusiast if

2741
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:34,079
this is the sort of dynamic we're

2742
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:35,579
dealing with at the moment

2743
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:37,738
well that's the thing is people are

2744
01:39:35,579 --> 01:39:40,679
uneducated and they're not going to get

2745
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:42,119
educated because there's only honestly a

2746
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:45,239
few places in the world that have

2747
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:48,359
cannabis education on um you know

2748
01:39:45,238 --> 01:39:50,279
high-level Organics or culture or

2749
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:53,219
cannabis culture all that kind of thing

2750
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:56,519
it's pretty slim you know NorCal from

2751
01:39:53,219 --> 01:39:58,920
Santa Cruz to NorCal to Eugene not even

2752
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:59,880
Portland I would say but Eugene

2753
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,500
um

2754
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:03,840
I mean there was a culture that was

2755
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:06,539
happening there for a long time

2756
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:09,300
especially before weed was legal

2757
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:10,920
everywhere you know so that culture is

2758
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:13,139
something that's not going to happen

2759
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,819
anymore and only few people have that

2760
01:40:13,139 --> 01:40:16,619
perspective and understanding so of

2761
01:40:14,819 --> 01:40:19,920
course it makes sense why

2762
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:22,500
all this everyone doesn't know you know

2763
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:26,039
how could you think uh you know a gelato

2764
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:29,158
cross that's grown with salts that has

2765
01:40:26,039 --> 01:40:30,119
no Terps is better than a good headband

2766
01:40:29,158 --> 01:40:33,599
you know

2767
01:40:30,119 --> 01:40:35,219
or whatever you know or a good OG or a

2768
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,840
good you know it's just

2769
01:40:35,219 --> 01:40:38,579
it's just there's just it's lack of

2770
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,960
Education you know lack of understanding

2771
01:40:38,579 --> 01:40:43,019
and lack of perspective

2772
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:45,119
that's just my perspective you know

2773
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:48,960
yeah sure

2774
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:51,719
so I mean on a different note what would

2775
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:54,060
be some advice for an aspiring breeder

2776
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:56,399
this is a question we commonly get asked

2777
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:58,440
by the fans how would you recommend

2778
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:00,539
someone go about getting their foot into

2779
01:40:58,439 --> 01:41:03,678
the scene and maybe getting some crosses

2780
01:41:00,539 --> 01:41:03,679
out there to the masses

2781
01:41:04,039 --> 01:41:09,658
oh I don't know I mean I would

2782
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:12,359
I wouldn't I wouldn't suggest people to

2783
01:41:09,658 --> 01:41:14,939
start breeding to be honest you know

2784
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:17,639
not to make money if they want to breed

2785
01:41:14,939 --> 01:41:19,439
just for their self and getting getting

2786
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:21,239
seeds out there I think they should just

2787
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:22,079
pick whatever intuitively they like the

2788
01:41:21,238 --> 01:41:25,519
best

2789
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:29,158
whatever they strive for the most

2790
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:31,560
and do that again on the male side blend

2791
01:41:29,158 --> 01:41:33,719
them and like start just making stuff

2792
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:35,520
and giving seeds out and you know doing

2793
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:37,260
whatever they can to get seeds out but

2794
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,400
not to make money you know I wouldn't I

2795
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:40,139
wouldn't suggest anyone to get into

2796
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:42,179
breeding right now

2797
01:41:40,139 --> 01:41:44,639
it's pointless

2798
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:47,520
yeah okay so it's a bit saturated in

2799
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:49,039
your opinion well I mean you can imagine

2800
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,780
some new

2801
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:54,179
strained person or new breeder that's

2802
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:57,118
going to be new and doesn't have any

2803
01:41:54,179 --> 01:41:58,618
track record history you know street

2804
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:00,420
cred or any of that trying to make a

2805
01:41:58,618 --> 01:42:01,319
business out of that I don't know you

2806
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:02,520
know

2807
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:04,319
good luck

2808
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:05,880
I don't know and I would I would I I

2809
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:07,920
just don't suggest it personally I

2810
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:10,020
suggest if you want to breed right now

2811
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,819
just breed for the love of it and

2812
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:13,920
you know and if you want to do it for

2813
01:42:11,819 --> 01:42:15,179
the money then don't you kind of raise

2814
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,100
an interesting point which we've

2815
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:19,980
discussed a little bit in the past in

2816
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:22,679
that is it possible for someone to get

2817
01:42:19,979 --> 01:42:26,039
in the industry now coming to the game

2818
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:29,039
so late specifically I often hear this

2819
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:31,319
referenced in regards to like Vape cards

2820
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:33,060
and maybe products which in the past

2821
01:42:31,319 --> 01:42:35,698
there have been a little bit of shady

2822
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:37,860
practices you know is it possible for

2823
01:42:35,698 --> 01:42:39,359
someone to start a company trying to

2824
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:41,639
make a product like that or trying to

2825
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:43,559
sell cannabis or breed seeds with good

2826
01:42:41,639 --> 01:42:44,639
intentions or is it just simply like the

2827
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,780
boats left

2828
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:47,579
foreign

2829
01:42:45,779 --> 01:42:50,219
I mean I personally think the boat's

2830
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:52,439
left but that's just that's just me you

2831
01:42:50,219 --> 01:42:54,359
know I mean if you're if you got a huge

2832
01:42:52,439 --> 01:42:56,099
hedge fund and you have unlimited money

2833
01:42:54,359 --> 01:42:58,259
and you want to throw you know quarter

2834
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,820
million half a million at branding and

2835
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:02,280
you want to like do it like that I'm

2836
01:42:59,819 --> 01:43:03,960
sure you can make it you know

2837
01:43:02,279 --> 01:43:06,479
because we all understand it's all

2838
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:08,698
Optics right now right

2839
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:10,500
um so if you're if you got the money to

2840
01:43:08,698 --> 01:43:13,799
Brand hard and get into those Optics I'm

2841
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:16,079
sure you can happen no problem but

2842
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,639
um no one that's from the street or no

2843
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:20,219
one that's from the industry that's

2844
01:43:17,639 --> 01:43:22,980
known anything is going to care

2845
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:24,658
and give you respect that's just how I

2846
01:43:22,979 --> 01:43:27,000
see it but

2847
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:28,399
yeah certainly and I mean it's a tough

2848
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,300
crowd out there you know

2849
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:32,819
[Laughter]

2850
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:34,920
certainly and on that topic of a sort of

2851
01:43:32,819 --> 01:43:36,960
changing landscape I've noticed that the

2852
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:38,579
breeding landscape itself is starting to

2853
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:42,539
change a bit and we're beginning to see

2854
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:44,760
breeders like for example jbezi a step

2855
01:43:42,539 --> 01:43:46,618
away from seed selling is the Main

2856
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:49,020
Avenue and more so looking into

2857
01:43:46,618 --> 01:43:52,439
licensing their Cuts or their sort of

2858
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:54,179
cultivations to different facilities do

2859
01:43:52,439 --> 01:43:56,519
you see this as something which will

2860
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:58,739
continue to happen going forward and do

2861
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:00,420
you think we risk maybe getting to a

2862
01:43:58,738 --> 01:44:01,979
point where home Growers are kind of

2863
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:04,859
finding it hard to get good quality

2864
01:44:01,979 --> 01:44:06,718
seeds if that continues

2865
01:44:04,859 --> 01:44:09,179
well I think it's hard already to get

2866
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:10,739
quality seeds I mean I've I've tested a

2867
01:44:09,179 --> 01:44:13,199
lot of stuff and the reason I'm I'm

2868
01:44:10,738 --> 01:44:15,238
doing what I'm doing is because when I

2869
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:17,099
test a lot of gear and try to find good

2870
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:18,658
stuff it's hard for me to find you know

2871
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:20,880
so

2872
01:44:18,658 --> 01:44:22,979
um you know that's just my perspective

2873
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,199
so I started doing it myself and doing

2874
01:44:22,979 --> 01:44:27,539
what I wanted myself and trying to you

2875
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:29,158
know make things out of my own intuition

2876
01:44:27,539 --> 01:44:31,079
and all that

2877
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:33,658
um you know so I think it's pretty hard

2878
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:35,460
right now for people to you know find

2879
01:44:33,658 --> 01:44:36,960
good seed honestly you know I think it's

2880
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:39,658
hard to find good genetics I think it's

2881
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,859
hard to find the truth you know it's

2882
01:44:39,658 --> 01:44:42,779
easy to find

2883
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:45,059
whatever but it's hard to find the good

2884
01:44:42,779 --> 01:44:46,618
stuff I think you know

2885
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:49,560
unless you're unless you're working with

2886
01:44:46,618 --> 01:44:50,339
some some good old trusted people you

2887
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,600
know

2888
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:53,460
and

2889
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:55,079
you know those are those are those are

2890
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:58,639
and the industry very obvious they're

2891
01:44:55,079 --> 01:44:58,639
very easy to find it seems like

2892
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:02,400
there's a there's a couple handfuls of

2893
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:04,618
really

2894
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:06,658
quality good people that are breeding

2895
01:45:04,618 --> 01:45:08,519
and and and they got the they got the

2896
01:45:06,658 --> 01:45:10,979
credentials to back them most of them

2897
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:13,380
while we're talking about that sort of

2898
01:45:10,979 --> 01:45:15,539
you know bigger facilities and working

2899
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:17,520
with things like that have you ever been

2900
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:19,560
to facilities and found certain

2901
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:21,900
cultivars that you think really work

2902
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:24,420
well in a sort of bigger monocropped

2903
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:25,738
environment and if so which ones would

2904
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:28,199
you recommend

2905
01:45:25,738 --> 01:45:30,779
well I mean really any any columnar

2906
01:45:28,198 --> 01:45:33,118
style you know

2907
01:45:30,779 --> 01:45:35,759
plant is going to do good in a you know

2908
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:38,099
giant sea of green or scaled outgrow you

2909
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:41,400
know it's pretty much like uh

2910
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:44,460
low uh low low BRAC the leaf ratio I

2911
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:47,579
mean low low uh Leaf to Brack ratio and

2912
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:51,000
high testing and you know

2913
01:45:47,579 --> 01:45:53,158
medium medium speed growing and it's

2914
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,139
it's just a you know

2915
01:45:53,158 --> 01:45:56,939
most of my breeding I'm trying to select

2916
01:45:55,139 --> 01:45:59,219
for certain things like trimming and

2917
01:45:56,939 --> 01:46:01,198
these kind of things so not trying to

2918
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:03,359
grow breed a bunch of leafy stuff that

2919
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:04,678
doesn't have a high cannabinoids you

2920
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:06,299
know

2921
01:46:04,679 --> 01:46:08,100
so

2922
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:09,900
um on the scale level though I think

2923
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,960
that you know a lot of the designers

2924
01:46:09,899 --> 01:46:13,979
trains right now I mean there's a reason

2925
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,960
they're being grown the way they're

2926
01:46:13,979 --> 01:46:17,879
being grown you know they do well in

2927
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:20,158
those conditions for sure

2928
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,440
I mean all that you know gelato cookie

2929
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:24,539
cross kind of stuff it's uh

2930
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:27,960
you know grows good in that style

2931
01:46:24,539 --> 01:46:29,579
yeah I mean you just mentioned that some

2932
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:31,439
of the traits that you're breeding for

2933
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:33,779
being like you know ease of trimming and

2934
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:35,519
things like that if you had to list in

2935
01:46:33,779 --> 01:46:37,500
general some of the traits that you

2936
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,780
think are advantageous and you look to

2937
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:41,460
have within your projects what would

2938
01:46:39,779 --> 01:46:45,500
they be

2939
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:47,880
um terp profile cannabinoid um

2940
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:50,158
cannabinoid production then structure

2941
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:52,139
trimmability you know

2942
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:53,698
Brack the leaf ratio all that kind of

2943
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:55,920
stuff for my

2944
01:46:53,698 --> 01:46:57,118
really specifics you know almost in that

2945
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:00,000
order

2946
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:03,000
you know deter profile and cannabinoid

2947
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,219
content those are equal for me and then

2948
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,479
um they both have to be awesome and then

2949
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:07,980
structure

2950
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:09,678
of the plant

2951
01:47:07,979 --> 01:47:12,899
trimmability

2952
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:14,819
that's kind of in that order

2953
01:47:12,899 --> 01:47:18,118
really the trimmability and structure

2954
01:47:14,819 --> 01:47:21,179
are equal and you know uh cannabinoid

2955
01:47:18,118 --> 01:47:22,380
inter reality are equal to me they

2956
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:24,179
should be taken in account equally

2957
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:26,699
that's just my perspective

2958
01:47:24,179 --> 01:47:28,920
yeah nice nice list of traits there that

2959
01:47:26,698 --> 01:47:31,138
you look to work into your lines I

2960
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:33,239
noticed that you did some Femmes where

2961
01:47:31,139 --> 01:47:35,579
you reversed the hazy Kush onto some

2962
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:37,319
other females what sort of results did

2963
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:39,238
you find from these crosses and did you

2964
01:47:37,319 --> 01:47:41,340
find that the hazy Kush was kind of

2965
01:47:39,238 --> 01:47:43,919
dominating or a bit more passive and let

2966
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:45,360
the other strain shine through

2967
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,100
they're right in the middle of testing

2968
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:49,198
right now I think I'm about five five

2969
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:50,400
five five six weeks in flowering right

2970
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:52,379
now so

2971
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:53,939
it's all starting to show

2972
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,980
are there any that have sort of caught

2973
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:56,879
your eye early on or still yet to be

2974
01:47:55,979 --> 01:47:59,279
seen

2975
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,920
there's quite a few what was sad as I

2976
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:03,840
reversed the Luke Skywalker OG

2977
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,699
um and I crossed it by the purple Hindu

2978
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:08,340
Kush thinking I was gonna make this you

2979
01:48:05,698 --> 01:48:11,779
know make the infamous epic Purple OG

2980
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:14,819
instead I got a bunch of Herms

2981
01:48:11,779 --> 01:48:15,670
like everyone almost herbed out of it I

2982
01:48:14,819 --> 01:48:18,118
was like whoa

2983
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:21,840
[Laughter]

2984
01:48:18,118 --> 01:48:23,519
so anyway life yeah right I guess

2985
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:27,060
there's something within those two that

2986
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:28,739
just don't compute but on that topic do

2987
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:32,100
you think that breeding with mothers

2988
01:48:28,738 --> 01:48:34,319
that come from Femme seeds or even s1s

2989
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:36,539
are more likely to make The Offspring

2990
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:38,759
unstable I mean I think it has that

2991
01:48:36,539 --> 01:48:40,560
potential for sure everything everything

2992
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,840
where the potentials there is going to

2993
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,920
give that um give that expression in

2994
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,960
some way or another

2995
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,480
sure in a sort of hypothetical question

2996
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:51,179
I've been asking guests lately is this

2997
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:54,479
let's just say you made a strain and

2998
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:56,279
it's producing the most amazing progeny

2999
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:58,579
you've ever seen like without fail the

3000
01:48:56,279 --> 01:49:02,880
best you've ever seen But the catch is

3001
01:48:58,579 --> 01:49:04,800
there's like 40 Hermes in the line would

3002
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:07,739
you at that point think you know I just

3003
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:09,600
go to 86 this project or do you think

3004
01:49:07,738 --> 01:49:11,879
you know I'd release it I'd just warn

3005
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,340
people what to you is an acceptable

3006
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:16,440
limit of Hermes if it was a really fire

3007
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:17,699
strain

3008
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:19,678
um I don't know I wouldn't release it if

3009
01:49:17,698 --> 01:49:21,359
it was herming that's just me

3010
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:23,520
yeah sure

3011
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:26,099
I just that's just I'm I'm just don't

3012
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,960
want people to experience that I don't I

3013
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:29,579
don't think people are up to par in

3014
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:32,399
their cultivation skills enough to catch

3015
01:49:29,579 --> 01:49:33,960
it so I don't want to put that on them

3016
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,638
um I wouldn't want to be responsible for

3017
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:38,100
that

3018
01:49:35,639 --> 01:49:39,900
sure sure I mean if I were to have

3019
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:42,300
something and 40 of them would be harmed

3020
01:49:39,899 --> 01:49:44,819
just like this lsog where 80 of them

3021
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:47,340
were harmed with the purple Hindu Kush I

3022
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:49,019
think two of them weren't so I'm growing

3023
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:50,159
those two out still you know I'm hoping

3024
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:52,080
they're going to be really sick clones

3025
01:49:50,158 --> 01:49:54,118
you know like clone only Elites or

3026
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:55,439
something you know so they're not going

3027
01:49:54,118 --> 01:49:58,380
to get released but they're going to be

3028
01:49:55,439 --> 01:50:00,178
in the in-house yeah okay sure so maybe

3029
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:02,520
like the middle ground is if you find a

3030
01:50:00,179 --> 01:50:05,340
stable clone release the Clone

3031
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:07,440
yeah if you were to you know cool okay

3032
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:10,319
so something which caught my eye on your

3033
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:12,000
website was that you have a nice

3034
01:50:10,319 --> 01:50:13,559
write-up about the Platinum Girl Scout

3035
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,939
cookies and you kind of talk about how

3036
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:17,639
that's the Girl Scout cookies you

3037
01:50:14,939 --> 01:50:19,678
commonly use and it got me wondering

3038
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:22,199
what is it about the Platinum that

3039
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,560
really draws you towards it as opposed

3040
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:27,799
to the Myriad of other cookie cuts

3041
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:30,000
well I mean the reason I just I'm I'm

3042
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:32,460
using that cookies cut is because it was

3043
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,679
the first cookies cut you know so

3044
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:36,420
and you know I just got it as Girl Scout

3045
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:37,319
cookie I just I just called it Platinum

3046
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:38,279
you know

3047
01:50:37,319 --> 01:50:40,439
um because it was there's a bunch of

3048
01:50:38,279 --> 01:50:42,118
different cookie Cuts going around but

3049
01:50:40,439 --> 01:50:44,638
my friend gave me that cut right when

3050
01:50:42,118 --> 01:50:47,099
cookies came out and um his name's Alec

3051
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,719
Dixon and he owns SC labs and you know

3052
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:50,340
he got that cut from the boys right when

3053
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:53,760
it right when it started going around he

3054
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:55,380
gave it to me so that's that cut so I

3055
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:56,639
just called it the Platinum but it's I

3056
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:58,139
think it's just the original Girl Scout

3057
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:00,300
to be honest

3058
01:50:58,139 --> 01:51:02,460
okay and the are there any traits about

3059
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:04,800
that one which you think make it sort of

3060
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:07,800
stand a little bit ahead of the others

3061
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,360
yeah the tricome production the Vigor

3062
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:12,060
the

3063
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:14,399
um the the smell the funkiness of it

3064
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:17,159
it's just like just rank it was like

3065
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:18,238
rank skunk Fuel and cookies you know so

3066
01:51:17,158 --> 01:51:20,158
it was like

3067
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:21,539
it was like that smell plus it was just

3068
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:24,359
stronger than the other ones that I've

3069
01:51:21,539 --> 01:51:26,579
seen you know so and I noticed that you

3070
01:51:24,359 --> 01:51:29,339
had done a crossover with the illusion

3071
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:32,158
OG which I believe is a strain from

3072
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:33,779
compound genetics what was the story on

3073
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:35,839
that cross and what drawed you towards

3074
01:51:33,779 --> 01:51:38,399
the illusion OG to use that as a male

3075
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:40,020
well just this genetic profile and from

3076
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:43,138
my understanding it's um why use

3077
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:44,639
genetics um Jeff you know Jeff was the

3078
01:51:43,139 --> 01:51:47,819
main breeder for compound before that

3079
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:49,500
debacle happened and um you know from my

3080
01:51:47,819 --> 01:51:51,479
understanding Jeff from why East was the

3081
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:53,460
one doing all the breeding and doing all

3082
01:51:51,479 --> 01:51:55,319
the Fino hunting and doing all the

3083
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:57,179
selecting and throwing all the pollen

3084
01:51:55,319 --> 01:51:58,979
and collecting all the genetics and all

3085
01:51:57,179 --> 01:52:00,539
that so

3086
01:51:58,979 --> 01:52:01,799
um so anyway

3087
01:52:00,539 --> 01:52:04,260
um

3088
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:06,840
so that was actually from um from from

3089
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:07,739
from why East from Jeff from y East you

3090
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:10,800
know

3091
01:52:07,738 --> 01:52:12,359
so yeah even though you know there's you

3092
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,920
know there's always lots of controversy

3093
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:15,899
with this kind of thing but

3094
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,359
for me it's the person that collected

3095
01:52:15,899 --> 01:52:20,279
the genetics through the pollen and grew

3096
01:52:18,359 --> 01:52:22,198
in their house is the owner

3097
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:24,658
so

3098
01:52:22,198 --> 01:52:27,419
all that points to why yeast

3099
01:52:24,658 --> 01:52:29,158
so credit credit to waste I wouldn't

3100
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:31,319
want to not give you credit where

3101
01:52:29,158 --> 01:52:33,479
credit's due well I mean it's just it's

3102
01:52:31,319 --> 01:52:35,759
a it's just you know how it is and this

3103
01:52:33,479 --> 01:52:37,259
this this game where people break up and

3104
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,780
you know

3105
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:41,760
leave people off of trademark apps and

3106
01:52:39,779 --> 01:52:42,899
do different things and try to steal

3107
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,000
different things do different things

3108
01:52:42,899 --> 01:52:47,399
it's an interesting industry you know

3109
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,500
yeah yeah I think it was James Bean who

3110
01:52:47,399 --> 01:52:52,198
mentioned to me the other week that uh

3111
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:54,060
as far as he can recall swamp boys are

3112
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:56,039
the only sort of breeding Duo that have

3113
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:57,659
managed to stand the test of time and I

3114
01:52:56,039 --> 01:52:59,579
think he might be right

3115
01:52:57,658 --> 01:53:02,479
yeah I don't really know but I think

3116
01:52:59,579 --> 01:53:02,479
they're still friends right

3117
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:07,560
you know that's it that's it that's what

3118
01:53:05,939 --> 01:53:09,599
they're still they're still together so

3119
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:11,400
I don't think uh

3120
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:14,280
it's pretty rare

3121
01:53:11,399 --> 01:53:16,439
yeah certainly so yeah I mean shout out

3122
01:53:14,279 --> 01:53:18,599
to Jeff for making that one was there

3123
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:19,859
anything about the illusion OG that Drew

3124
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:22,260
to it I think did you just say it was

3125
01:53:19,859 --> 01:53:23,880
the traits of it like what were they

3126
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:27,539
I mean

3127
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:30,539
the the the ogs and cams all up in it is

3128
01:53:27,539 --> 01:53:32,039
kind of what what uh why why I use it to

3129
01:53:30,539 --> 01:53:34,380
be honest you know that's just those are

3130
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:36,719
my those are my those are my faves some

3131
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:39,239
of those things you know so I just

3132
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:40,260
wanted to use it you know

3133
01:53:39,238 --> 01:53:43,198
um

3134
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:45,659
and there were some um the reasons I did

3135
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:48,000
it too you know what I mean I was pretty

3136
01:53:45,658 --> 01:53:49,500
unhappy with what happened on um with

3137
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
that whole breakup just not that it's

3138
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,380
none of my business but you know I've

3139
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,960
just been treated like that from other

3140
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:58,679
people so you know

3141
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:00,239
the ghost OG Skywalker gsfv chem dog

3142
01:53:58,679 --> 01:54:01,560
sour it's like those are all my

3143
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:04,079
favorites so I was just like yeah I'll

3144
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:05,699
use this and so when I talked to Jeff I

3145
01:54:04,079 --> 01:54:08,819
talked to him I said hey Jeff man what's

3146
01:54:05,698 --> 01:54:11,039
up I said I said I got this

3147
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:13,139
um from Chris uh but who who did this

3148
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:15,000
you know who grew who grew this who grew

3149
01:54:13,139 --> 01:54:17,400
this he said I did I said where who

3150
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,920
selected the strains who selected the

3151
01:54:17,399 --> 01:54:21,960
cuts who who grounded up the genetics he

3152
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:23,880
said I did I said where was it grown

3153
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:26,039
he's all grown in my house my garage I

3154
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:28,980
said who threw the pollen he said I did

3155
01:54:26,039 --> 01:54:30,359
so you know those were enough I did to

3156
01:54:28,979 --> 01:54:32,698
me you know

3157
01:54:30,359 --> 01:54:34,738
yeah and I know yeah so that just you

3158
01:54:32,698 --> 01:54:36,658
know what I mean

3159
01:54:34,738 --> 01:54:39,238
yeah it's just I just gave credit to

3160
01:54:36,658 --> 01:54:40,799
where credit was due in my opinion but

3161
01:54:39,238 --> 01:54:43,678
that's just my opinion it could be wrong

3162
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:45,000
too so I'm not saying I'm right

3163
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:45,719
I'm just saying that's the reason I did

3164
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,859
it

3165
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:50,039
yeah

3166
01:54:46,859 --> 01:54:52,079
so I mean on a similar sort of note I've

3167
01:54:50,039 --> 01:54:54,300
noticed that you know you're a sort of

3168
01:54:52,079 --> 01:54:56,819
friendship and collaborative network is

3169
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:58,980
very expansive and it got me thinking

3170
01:54:56,819 --> 01:55:01,019
you would definitely have access to a

3171
01:54:58,979 --> 01:55:02,879
just a you know plethora of strains

3172
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:05,040
which you know many people could only

3173
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:08,039
dream of getting and it got me wondering

3174
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:10,859
can we ever expect to see any sort of

3175
01:55:08,039 --> 01:55:12,960
old school meets new school strains from

3176
01:55:10,859 --> 01:55:15,179
your work maybe the likes of like a land

3177
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,520
race crossed to one of your males like a

3178
01:55:15,179 --> 01:55:19,679
Malawi or an Acapulco Gold I think for

3179
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:21,600
some reason in my head it just I just

3180
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:23,279
sort of expected to see something like

3181
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,840
that and it got me wondering well maybe

3182
01:55:23,279 --> 01:55:27,960
maybe it's in the works where it's yet

3183
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:30,179
to happen what's your thoughts yeah my

3184
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:31,560
my friend um Bob he gave me some

3185
01:55:30,179 --> 01:55:32,819
genetics he's going to give them to me

3186
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,639
again because some of them didn't make

3187
01:55:32,819 --> 01:55:37,139
the make the make the journey but um you

3188
01:55:35,639 --> 01:55:38,819
know there was some land race stuff that

3189
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:40,980
I was going to collab with him in and

3190
01:55:38,819 --> 01:55:43,559
you know and vice versa

3191
01:55:40,979 --> 01:55:45,178
so yeah there's that's that's in the

3192
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:46,500
works too for sure and I got some stuff

3193
01:55:45,179 --> 01:55:47,940
from um

3194
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:50,399
you know

3195
01:55:47,939 --> 01:55:53,939
yeah it's in the works for sure I'm just

3196
01:55:50,399 --> 01:55:55,500
kind of um honestly a lot of I'm not a

3197
01:55:53,939 --> 01:55:57,118
lot of my stuff I'm making I'm trying to

3198
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:00,300
make stuff that I'm gonna be like oh I'm

3199
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:02,399
so psyched on I'm actually not that's

3200
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:03,960
kind of selfish but I'm not really

3201
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:05,579
breeding for

3202
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,198
you know I'm reading for everyone else

3203
01:56:05,579 --> 01:56:08,880
meaning I'm going to be the one to

3204
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:10,439
select it through my own intuition but

3205
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,359
then I'm just assuming other people will

3206
01:56:10,439 --> 01:56:15,178
like it because I'm the hard-headed in

3207
01:56:12,359 --> 01:56:17,519
the in the um tolerance level you know

3208
01:56:15,179 --> 01:56:19,260
so yeah no I think that's a common sense

3209
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,060
what we've heard from guests on the show

3210
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:23,699
is that they tend to breed for

3211
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:26,960
themselves and you know the the crowd's

3212
01:56:23,698 --> 01:56:28,979
favor tends to follow that that's sick

3213
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:30,840
something I wanted to ask you about

3214
01:56:28,979 --> 01:56:34,859
because I thought it was kind of cool in

3215
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:37,199
a way was the mystery Kush I liked that

3216
01:56:34,859 --> 01:56:39,599
in the sense that I felt like it was

3217
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:41,698
sort of a misnomer of a name because you

3218
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,840
you obviously know what it's made of you

3219
01:56:41,698 --> 01:56:44,698
made it

3220
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:46,679
um what was the story around that one

3221
01:56:44,698 --> 01:56:48,238
and why did you decided to give it the

3222
01:56:46,679 --> 01:56:50,699
name you know the mystery when you know

3223
01:56:48,238 --> 01:56:52,259
it's it's made from hazy Kush

3224
01:56:50,698 --> 01:56:54,118
well like I was saying I didn't know

3225
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:55,020
actually which one which what the mail

3226
01:56:54,118 --> 01:56:56,819
was

3227
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:58,440
I had the seed but I didn't I didn't

3228
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:00,539
actually it wasn't positive you know

3229
01:56:58,439 --> 01:57:02,279
until I tested it all so that's why it

3230
01:57:00,539 --> 01:57:04,139
was mystery but I'm like man this smells

3231
01:57:02,279 --> 01:57:05,939
just like this hazy Kush now I was

3232
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:07,440
calling mystery Haze you know and then

3233
01:57:05,939 --> 01:57:09,238
when I found out it wasn't a mystery

3234
01:57:07,439 --> 01:57:10,799
anymore it was obviously it was it was

3235
01:57:09,238 --> 01:57:13,259
obvious you know

3236
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,179
sure and how would that one differ if

3237
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:17,699
someone was kind of toying between

3238
01:57:15,179 --> 01:57:19,920
getting those two how would you describe

3239
01:57:17,698 --> 01:57:21,598
the differences

3240
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:23,219
um I mean the hazy Kush is much more

3241
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:26,880
complex

3242
01:57:23,219 --> 01:57:28,920
um to me much more desirable

3243
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:31,440
um but the look and the appearance of

3244
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:35,460
the mystery is just so

3245
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:37,079
you know desirable on that end

3246
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:39,359
I don't actually don't like the high of

3247
01:57:37,079 --> 01:57:41,219
the mystery that much personally

3248
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:42,719
um comparatively to the hazy Kush is one

3249
01:57:41,219 --> 01:57:44,219
of my favorites

3250
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:47,340
sure

3251
01:57:44,219 --> 01:57:49,500
so I noticed on your website that it's

3252
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:51,119
kind of geared a little bit more towards

3253
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:53,399
what I felt was sort of like a

3254
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:55,559
management or sort of Consulting role

3255
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:57,359
for potential clientele is that

3256
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:58,739
something you hope to get into in the

3257
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:00,658
future in terms of like helping

3258
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:02,279
facilities with their cultivar selection

3259
01:58:00,658 --> 01:58:04,799
and whatnot and where do you see

3260
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:06,719
yourself in the future in the industry

3261
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,460
oh well that's a big part of our future

3262
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:10,020
to be honest because because you know

3263
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:11,579
we've created the conditions we're

3264
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:14,099
working on this new light that's

3265
01:58:11,579 --> 01:58:15,899
basically um you know I've tested a lot

3266
01:58:14,099 --> 01:58:17,340
of LEDs in the industry now and this one

3267
01:58:15,899 --> 01:58:19,439
pretty much crushes all of them to

3268
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:22,020
Pieces there's not even a comparison and

3269
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:23,279
it's got a pathogen preventative

3270
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:25,260
um

3271
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:27,359
on it too so it's

3272
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:29,460
I mean it's on another level so I'm

3273
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:30,779
really excited to release that

3274
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:33,118
um and then we're going to release that

3275
01:58:30,779 --> 01:58:36,019
with a full spectrum of you know

3276
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:39,299
Consulting

3277
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:40,860
genetics the whole bit and we're we're

3278
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:43,199
positioned pretty heavily to do that

3279
01:58:40,859 --> 01:58:45,179
with our partners and with our group so

3280
01:58:43,198 --> 01:58:46,500
we're just being patient hitting it at

3281
01:58:45,179 --> 01:58:49,679
the right time hitting at the right

3282
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:53,099
moment and in the right way do you see a

3283
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:55,020
day where maybe greenbody genetics are a

3284
01:58:53,099 --> 01:58:56,579
little more rare and harder to find

3285
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:58,260
because you're sort of more wrapped up

3286
01:58:56,579 --> 01:59:00,840
in that side of things or do you hope to

3287
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:02,340
sort of be able to offer both well I'm

3288
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:04,800
hoping to offer both because I think

3289
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:06,659
they go hand in hand and as the markets

3290
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,159
come on and international markets come

3291
01:59:06,658 --> 01:59:09,598
on you know there's going to be a lot of

3292
01:59:08,158 --> 01:59:11,460
things happening we got a lot of stuff

3293
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:13,380
working in Jamaica right now with some

3294
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:14,579
partners and we got a lot of stuff

3295
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:16,139
getting ready to start happening that

3296
01:59:14,579 --> 01:59:17,698
we're going to start potentially doing

3297
01:59:16,139 --> 01:59:19,800
some International seed distribution

3298
01:59:17,698 --> 01:59:21,238
either out of there or out of Canada or

3299
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:22,380
you know it's like there's a lot of

3300
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:24,319
stuff getting ready to start happening

3301
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:26,880
so we're really excited about all of it

3302
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:28,559
that's that's awesome to hear and sort

3303
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:30,779
of exciting stuff

3304
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:33,179
something which I've been talking to a

3305
01:59:30,779 --> 01:59:34,859
lot of guests about recently is there

3306
01:59:33,179 --> 01:59:37,199
seems to be a bit of like a cognitive

3307
01:59:34,859 --> 01:59:39,359
dissonance that like if it's in a fancy

3308
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:41,158
package you know sort of reflective

3309
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:43,139
mylar bag that it's got to be the

3310
01:59:41,158 --> 01:59:45,719
highest quality do you think that people

3311
01:59:43,139 --> 01:59:47,880
will ever maybe learn to dissociate the

3312
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:49,198
packaging from the actual contents or do

3313
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:50,940
you think that's just marketing and

3314
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:52,559
you've got to roll with it

3315
01:59:50,939 --> 01:59:54,059
well I think it's both you know we

3316
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,039
understand how marketing is right now

3317
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:58,020
you know you look at alcohol how things

3318
01:59:56,039 --> 01:59:59,340
are packaged it's you know it makes a

3319
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:03,119
difference you know you look at even

3320
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:05,340
these CBD lines in CVS or any like these

3321
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:07,019
you know these stores you know it's the

3322
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:08,279
one the packaging is what's selling it

3323
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:10,260
it's not the product you know they're

3324
02:00:08,279 --> 02:00:11,579
all the same product so if something

3325
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:12,719
says Charlotte's Web on it versus

3326
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:14,539
something says something it's going to

3327
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:18,359
sell more you know

3328
02:00:14,539 --> 02:00:21,300
yeah sure I mean we see that cookies is

3329
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:23,219
continuing to expand and release more

3330
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:24,840
and more product onto the market notably

3331
02:00:23,219 --> 02:00:27,359
they've been Outsourcing some of their

3332
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:29,819
crops to other producers and we've seen

3333
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:31,439
the odd issue with quality control do

3334
02:00:29,819 --> 02:00:33,359
you think that these companies might

3335
02:00:31,439 --> 02:00:35,579
risk sort of shooting themselves in the

3336
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:37,799
foot by trying to sell an inferior

3337
02:00:35,579 --> 02:00:39,420
quality product or do you think that

3338
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:42,779
their fans are sort of loyal to the

3339
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:44,940
brand and not necessarily the product

3340
02:00:42,779 --> 02:00:46,979
well I think cookies is a unique brand

3341
02:00:44,939 --> 02:00:49,138
in that context because there's a lot of

3342
02:00:46,979 --> 02:00:50,759
brand loyalty and you know it doesn't

3343
02:00:49,139 --> 02:00:52,859
matter what they put in the bag it's

3344
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,060
gonna you know the people are gonna buy

3345
02:00:52,859 --> 02:00:55,799
it because of The Branding they've

3346
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:58,020
pretty much crushed The Branding reality

3347
02:00:55,800 --> 02:01:00,599
you know they did really well

3348
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:02,699
um and you know and they're good guys

3349
02:01:00,599 --> 02:01:04,619
you know so like a lot of people have a

3350
02:01:02,698 --> 02:01:06,658
lot of stuff to say about them but they

3351
02:01:04,618 --> 02:01:08,399
don't know these people you know

3352
02:01:06,658 --> 02:01:10,019
um you know they're good guys so that's

3353
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:11,819
I've met them they're good people you

3354
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:13,139
know they're cool you know so

3355
02:01:11,819 --> 02:01:14,460
um they might have had some hurdles with

3356
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:16,079
some different genetics or different

3357
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:18,000
seed sales or different this that and

3358
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:19,800
the other but you know from what I'm

3359
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,880
seeing their branding level and what

3360
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:22,920
they're trying to do in the industry is

3361
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:25,380
pretty professional and every which way

3362
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:26,940
so you know I don't know it seems like a

3363
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:28,260
bunch of Envy more than anything if

3364
02:01:26,939 --> 02:01:30,059
people are crushing it you're gonna have

3365
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:32,099
haters and that's the big sign you're

3366
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:33,900
crushing it too you know

3367
02:01:32,099 --> 02:01:36,300
um so

3368
02:01:33,899 --> 02:01:38,158
you know I mean we we have some we have

3369
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:39,599
some stuff in in future with cookies and

3370
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:41,158
stuff too so

3371
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:43,020
um I think people should be excited

3372
02:01:41,158 --> 02:01:44,399
about that more than anything that's

3373
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:46,560
happening now you know

3374
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:48,598
once we start throwing you know golden

3375
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:50,639
pineapple to Georgia pie and stuff like

3376
02:01:48,599 --> 02:01:52,380
that and you know

3377
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:53,760
putting putting our Twist on these

3378
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:55,920
things I think that's when people start

3379
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:58,260
getting really excited but you know

3380
02:01:55,920 --> 02:02:00,420
maybe I'm just self-centered in that

3381
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:03,000
perspective

3382
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:04,139
wow that that's really exciting to hear

3383
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,539
that you've got that sort of

3384
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:08,219
collaboration down the pipeline I know

3385
02:02:06,539 --> 02:02:09,779
that you've done collaborations in the

3386
02:02:08,219 --> 02:02:12,420
past are they the sort of thing that you

3387
02:02:09,779 --> 02:02:15,300
want to pursue more going forward

3388
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:17,279
yeah collaborations are fun a lot of

3389
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:18,119
stuff happens and it's good branding you

3390
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:21,059
know

3391
02:02:18,118 --> 02:02:23,039
it's um so all those all those

3392
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:26,460
conditions are kind of the

3393
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:28,738
the conditions you know I like it

3394
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:31,500
sure and I know that I've heard a bit

3395
02:02:28,738 --> 02:02:34,138
recently about a collaboration you have

3396
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:36,719
with Mass medical strains where can

3397
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:38,159
people find those seeds or when can they

3398
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:40,920
expect to be able to get them if they're

3399
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:43,679
after them and what sort of plants do

3400
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:45,840
you feel those crosses offer

3401
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,699
well well-grown seeds is going to be one

3402
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:50,340
of the big the big hubs for that those

3403
02:02:47,698 --> 02:02:52,439
collabs well-grown seeds cool beans um

3404
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:55,560
you know so um

3405
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:56,879
yeah I mean you know masses mass is a

3406
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:59,520
cool kid you know and a lot of people

3407
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,199
have um you know well not a lot of

3408
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,760
people there's been specific few people

3409
02:03:01,198 --> 02:03:04,919
that have tried to bully the kid and

3410
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:06,840
that's one of the reasons I um I jumped

3411
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:09,118
on you know because I don't like bullies

3412
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:11,579
you know and when I was younger I used

3413
02:03:09,118 --> 02:03:13,979
to like beat up bullies you know so now

3414
02:03:11,579 --> 02:03:15,960
I'll just make fun of them on Instagram

3415
02:03:13,979 --> 02:03:18,658
instead you know for being bullies you

3416
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:21,359
know for bullying a kid that's you know

3417
02:03:18,658 --> 02:03:23,279
trying to do good things and he's a good

3418
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:24,779
guy you know and doesn't and he didn't

3419
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:27,899
do the things that these people are

3420
02:03:24,779 --> 02:03:28,679
saying he did so I wanted to make uh you

3421
02:03:27,899 --> 02:03:31,379
know

3422
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:33,239
make it known and that's the reason I'm

3423
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:35,819
collabing with him is because I don't

3424
02:03:33,238 --> 02:03:38,519
like people bullying kids you know it's

3425
02:03:35,819 --> 02:03:40,019
not it's not cool so

3426
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:42,540
um you know I think the collaboration

3427
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:45,000
between us and what we're doing and the

3428
02:03:42,539 --> 02:03:46,859
the the the the strains coming out are

3429
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,079
going to be quite unique you know um

3430
02:03:46,859 --> 02:03:51,299
very colorful

3431
02:03:49,079 --> 02:03:54,118
um obviously rich and Terps on a

3432
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:55,980
multitude of levels and they're just

3433
02:03:54,118 --> 02:03:57,420
gonna be good vibe seeds you know where

3434
02:03:55,979 --> 02:04:00,959
people are just trying to do good things

3435
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:04,500
and you know help people and do good

3436
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:06,000
stuff and so that's kind of um you know

3437
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:07,139
and a lot of those things are going to

3438
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,359
be really neat coming out of those

3439
02:04:07,139 --> 02:04:11,520
crosses I think you know just the color

3440
02:04:09,359 --> 02:04:13,500
the color really is

3441
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:15,840
he's good at bringing in that color and

3442
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:18,238
I think the combo with the with with our

3443
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:21,119
strength and high octane profiles with

3444
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:22,859
his um you know color and terp realities

3445
02:04:21,118 --> 02:04:25,559
are gonna are gonna are gonna make some

3446
02:04:22,859 --> 02:04:27,899
cool combos you know

3447
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:30,360
yeah that's that's exciting to hear that

3448
02:04:27,899 --> 02:04:33,238
the uh the crosses are offering such you

3449
02:04:30,359 --> 02:04:36,299
know desirable characteristics something

3450
02:04:33,238 --> 02:04:38,158
which I heard interestingly sort of

3451
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:40,260
mentioned and I specifically wanted to

3452
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:42,658
ask you about this was that someone said

3453
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:45,000
to me oh you know the the reason why he

3454
02:04:42,658 --> 02:04:48,019
decided to not retire and come back was

3455
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:51,260
because greenbody convinced him not to

3456
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:51,260
that's true

3457
02:04:52,198 --> 02:04:56,098
anyway

3458
02:04:54,118 --> 02:04:58,618
another bit of speculation that I've

3459
02:04:56,099 --> 02:05:00,239
seen from numerous sources was that he

3460
02:04:58,618 --> 02:05:02,759
came back for more or less financial

3461
02:05:00,238 --> 02:05:04,678
reasons you know regardless of whether

3462
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:06,060
that's true or not is not really what

3463
02:05:04,679 --> 02:05:08,039
I'm interested in more so what I'm

3464
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:10,619
interested in is this idea of the ethics

3465
02:05:08,039 --> 02:05:13,920
behind breeders releasing seeds for

3466
02:05:10,618 --> 02:05:15,479
profit intentionally every breeder is

3467
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:17,699
selling their seeds to pay the bills

3468
02:05:15,479 --> 02:05:19,738
like why why is that like a point of

3469
02:05:17,698 --> 02:05:22,138
contention do you feel like at times

3470
02:05:19,738 --> 02:05:23,638
people just pick points to criticize

3471
02:05:22,139 --> 02:05:25,560
because they've just got a bone to pick

3472
02:05:23,639 --> 02:05:28,319
like you know people will sell seeds for

3473
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:30,360
500 a pack and people don't really get

3474
02:05:28,319 --> 02:05:32,639
as up in arms as about you and Mass

3475
02:05:30,359 --> 02:05:34,319
medical selling some seeds for what's

3476
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:36,599
arguably probably a much more reasonable

3477
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:39,299
price do you think that there is this

3478
02:05:36,599 --> 02:05:42,119
sort of vitriol in the community

3479
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:44,579
oh for sure for sure you know it's like

3480
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:46,079
mass will sell out a drop in like one

3481
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:47,698
day you know so of course that makes

3482
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:50,840
these old breeders that can't sell their

3483
02:05:47,698 --> 02:05:54,899
seeds mad and jealous and envious right

3484
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:58,860
I mean just uh I could I can go on for

3485
02:05:54,899 --> 02:06:01,920
days about this kind of topic but um

3486
02:05:58,859 --> 02:06:04,439
so yeah I know um Mass was just um

3487
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:06,000
you know he was getting sick of it you

3488
02:06:04,439 --> 02:06:08,098
know he was getting sick of people just

3489
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,960
hating on him and for no reason really

3490
02:06:08,099 --> 02:06:11,699
you know like because even the the

3491
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:13,980
reasons that were given to me by the

3492
02:06:11,698 --> 02:06:15,960
person stirring up the pot the most

3493
02:06:13,979 --> 02:06:18,178
you know he told me he screwed over

3494
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:20,158
Bodhi this person told me that mass

3495
02:06:18,179 --> 02:06:22,618
screwed over Bodhi seeds you know so I

3496
02:06:20,158 --> 02:06:24,479
asked him I said hey bro what's up is

3497
02:06:22,618 --> 02:06:26,039
this true he's all no that's not true I

3498
02:06:24,479 --> 02:06:28,559
would never put myself in a position to

3499
02:06:26,039 --> 02:06:30,238
be screwed over that's what Bodhi told

3500
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:32,639
me and I said thank you

3501
02:06:30,238 --> 02:06:33,839
and then so then I said ah these guys

3502
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:35,039
are full of it and you know what they

3503
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,560
kept trying to they kept trying to

3504
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:39,840
because this guy you know mass is um you

3505
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:41,340
know he he was um doing this

3506
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:42,960
fingerboarding thing when he was younger

3507
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:44,520
and he started a company he was selling

3508
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:46,260
like fingerboards and stuff and they

3509
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:48,719
kept trying to like pick on him for that

3510
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:51,659
you know oh he's this person he's that

3511
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:53,399
person he's he's like so what you know

3512
02:06:51,658 --> 02:06:54,839
really you guys care that much about

3513
02:06:53,399 --> 02:06:56,339
this kid you know like what's your

3514
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:58,020
problem you know and then it seemed like

3515
02:06:56,340 --> 02:07:00,300
everyone was bullying him so I just was

3516
02:06:58,020 --> 02:07:02,639
like oh yeah well you try and Bully me

3517
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:04,679
then you know so then I jumped on jumped

3518
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:06,060
on board with him you know so if

3519
02:07:04,679 --> 02:07:07,618
everyone wants to bully then they can

3520
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:09,539
bully him they can bully me you know

3521
02:07:07,618 --> 02:07:12,299
that's kind of why I did this you know

3522
02:07:09,539 --> 02:07:15,000
and if anyone wants to bully him or

3523
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:17,520
anyone wants to be that kind of guy well

3524
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:21,359
I'm down to go to my jits gym and we can

3525
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:23,880
have a you know live IG like jits battle

3526
02:07:21,359 --> 02:07:26,158
in the gym and you know we'll see then

3527
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:27,539
you know who's a bully you know I don't

3528
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:29,339
I don't know I'm not a fan of people

3529
02:07:27,539 --> 02:07:31,079
picking on kids you know I'm not a fan

3530
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:33,239
of people picking on each other you know

3531
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:34,618
that's that's BS you know so if you want

3532
02:07:33,238 --> 02:07:35,879
to pick on people then you can pick on

3533
02:07:34,618 --> 02:07:36,960
people that are that are that will

3534
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:39,300
welcome it you know in front of

3535
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:41,460
everybody you know and so I made those

3536
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:44,880
you know I made that very clear in the

3537
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:46,920
industry that I'm you know willing to do

3538
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:48,840
whatever you know and then seemed like

3539
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:49,859
everyone just got kind of quiet then for

3540
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:53,039
some reason

3541
02:07:49,859 --> 02:07:54,598
so it worked yeah I definitely have seen

3542
02:07:53,039 --> 02:07:56,880
a lot of what you mentioned there which

3543
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:59,099
is really interesting and it kind of

3544
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:01,980
raised this broader idea which I really

3545
02:07:59,099 --> 02:08:04,380
disagreed with which was that with that

3546
02:08:01,979 --> 02:08:06,359
fingerboarding comment in mind people

3547
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:08,159
were like you know he's had this

3548
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:09,479
successful company in the past and he's

3549
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:11,519
just come into the Cannabis scene to

3550
02:08:09,479 --> 02:08:13,678
make money and it made me think like is

3551
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:15,840
it not possible to have been successful

3552
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:17,579
in another business Endeavor and then

3553
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:18,900
come to the Cannabis scene because as

3554
02:08:17,579 --> 02:08:20,819
far as I could tell that was what was

3555
02:08:18,899 --> 02:08:22,138
going on but people tried to make it out

3556
02:08:20,819 --> 02:08:23,639
as though like well because you have

3557
02:08:22,139 --> 02:08:25,920
this successful business in another

3558
02:08:23,639 --> 02:08:26,940
industry you're definitely here just to

3559
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:30,239
sell out

3560
02:08:26,939 --> 02:08:30,960
I mean who cares what people think for

3561
02:08:30,238 --> 02:08:33,238
one

3562
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:34,980
I know for sure that mass is in it for

3563
02:08:33,238 --> 02:08:36,959
the right reasons you know and of course

3564
02:08:34,979 --> 02:08:38,939
he's gonna do it and make money too

3565
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:40,319
because that's just normal you know it's

3566
02:08:38,939 --> 02:08:42,118
not bad

3567
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:44,519
um your intention is what makes it bad

3568
02:08:42,118 --> 02:08:46,679
you know if you're doing it just to make

3569
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:48,060
money then that's not the best you know

3570
02:08:46,679 --> 02:08:49,560
but that's not what he's doing it for

3571
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:51,539
I've talked to him for hours and hours

3572
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:52,980
and hours and you know we go back to

3573
02:08:51,539 --> 02:08:55,079
that thing where someone said oh green

3574
02:08:52,979 --> 02:08:57,000
body got him to you know get back into

3575
02:08:55,079 --> 02:08:58,439
the industry well I did I told him that

3576
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,238
he shouldn't have jumped out it makes

3577
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:02,460
him look bad and he's innocent he didn't

3578
02:09:00,238 --> 02:09:05,098
do anything wrong you know there's not

3579
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:06,599
one thing he did wrong not one you know

3580
02:09:05,099 --> 02:09:08,400
no one's been able to prove anything

3581
02:09:06,599 --> 02:09:09,840
they just try to pick on him for this

3582
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:11,819
fingerboarding thing and it's like dude

3583
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:14,099
you guys sound like those bullies that

3584
02:09:11,819 --> 02:09:17,819
I'd like to like knock out you know for

3585
02:09:14,099 --> 02:09:19,860
picking on my friends you know like stop

3586
02:09:17,819 --> 02:09:22,259
you know and I mean that's that's where

3587
02:09:19,859 --> 02:09:23,519
how this whole sale hating thing came in

3588
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:25,139
you know it's because it's basically

3589
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,760
that's a strain that's a collab strain

3590
02:09:25,139 --> 02:09:29,760
the hazy Kush with the putang is sale

3591
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:32,280
Hayden and the reason it came about was

3592
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:34,199
because I got tagged into

3593
02:09:32,279 --> 02:09:36,300
um because someone was like

3594
02:09:34,198 --> 02:09:38,519
well this green boat he's working with

3595
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:40,619
mass and you know this this dude hates

3596
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:43,199
Mass you know and so they tagged me into

3597
02:09:40,618 --> 02:09:45,238
his page and I said ah I said I don't

3598
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:46,678
know all this bickering and all this um

3599
02:09:45,238 --> 02:09:49,259
this uh

3600
02:09:46,679 --> 02:09:51,179
gossipings above my pay grade I said you

3601
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:53,639
know and I said by the way

3602
02:09:51,179 --> 02:09:56,279
I said who cares anyway about what I

3603
02:09:53,639 --> 02:09:58,560
think you know I said my seeds suck my

3604
02:09:56,279 --> 02:10:00,899
genetics suck my weed sucks don't buy it

3605
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:02,039
you know I said I'm the [ __ ] devil

3606
02:10:00,899 --> 02:10:03,960
actually

3607
02:10:02,039 --> 02:10:06,060
and then um that's all the only time I

3608
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:08,639
commented towards all this and then

3609
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:12,060
someone commented a few a few a few uh

3610
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:13,739
comments down and said sail Hayden and I

3611
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:15,119
was like what are they like making fun

3612
02:10:13,738 --> 02:10:16,738
of me I didn't even understand what the

3613
02:10:15,118 --> 02:10:19,079
[ __ ] it meant you know I'm like sale

3614
02:10:16,738 --> 02:10:21,118
Hayden sale hating oh I I took me a

3615
02:10:19,079 --> 02:10:22,380
while to get it you know I was like is

3616
02:10:21,118 --> 02:10:24,559
sale something I thought it was some

3617
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:26,880
type of New Millennium term you know

3618
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:28,139
that's how slow I am sometimes it's

3619
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:29,460
these kind of things you know some

3620
02:10:28,139 --> 02:10:30,719
things I'm not slow at this type of

3621
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:32,939
thing I was kind of slow at this moment

3622
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:36,000
you know and then I was finally looking

3623
02:10:32,939 --> 02:10:38,098
it up and I was like ah it took me and

3624
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,899
then I laughed so [ __ ] hard

3625
02:10:38,099 --> 02:10:41,880
so then that's what we started the sale

3626
02:10:39,899 --> 02:10:43,859
Hayden strain because of that one thing

3627
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:45,719
you know and then so basically I did

3628
02:10:43,859 --> 02:10:47,579
this sale Hayden strain did a shirt of

3629
02:10:45,719 --> 02:10:49,560
this like Buddha image and then this

3630
02:10:47,579 --> 02:10:51,658
raffle daily image like a half and half

3631
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:54,420
and they released you know release

3632
02:10:51,658 --> 02:10:56,158
shirts and then you know we all have our

3633
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:58,199
techniques of trolling people you know

3634
02:10:56,158 --> 02:11:00,479
so

3635
02:10:58,198 --> 02:11:02,339
um that was my technique you know we'll

3636
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:04,439
just create a strain we'll create shirts

3637
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:06,539
you know we'll do our own way if you

3638
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:07,859
want to pick on people then we'll just

3639
02:11:06,539 --> 02:11:09,719
make fun of you for being a bully

3640
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:11,880
instead in our own way you know

3641
02:11:09,719 --> 02:11:13,980
but for me I don't like bullies so if

3642
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:15,539
someone wants to bully someone then you

3643
02:11:13,979 --> 02:11:17,638
know I'm probably gonna

3644
02:11:15,539 --> 02:11:20,158
you know

3645
02:11:17,639 --> 02:11:21,480
try to make them feel like they

3646
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:22,920
shouldn't do that anymore

3647
02:11:21,479 --> 02:11:24,419
it's like people are so uptight right

3648
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:26,639

02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:46,198
energy on focusing on your illusory

3660
02:11:44,819 --> 02:11:47,880
aspects of your mind that creates

3661

02:12:06,658 --> 02:12:12,000
um you know by entangling lots of people

3670
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:13,679
up putting Wells into you know

3671
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,719
poor villages in India that they don't

3672
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:19,020
have water you know

3673
02:12:15,719 --> 02:12:21,060
what a perfect segue because I did

3674
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:23,280
wanted to ask you about the uh the well

3675
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:25,500
project I had a written down as the the

3676
02:12:23,279 --> 02:12:26,698
pump project how did this all get

3677
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:28,618
started

3678
02:12:26,698 --> 02:12:30,719
well um you know first time I went to

3679
02:12:28,618 --> 02:12:32,579
India was in 2011

3680
02:12:30,719 --> 02:12:35,819
um to receive a color chakra initiation

3681
02:12:32,579 --> 02:12:38,158
in buddhaia from his Holiness of dilemma

3682
02:12:35,819 --> 02:12:41,099
um but first I went to dharamasala

3683
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:43,079
um and you know went to his Monastery

3684
02:12:41,099 --> 02:12:45,119
there received chocolate bar empowerment

3685
02:12:43,079 --> 02:12:46,559
there then went to buddhaia so I met

3686
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:47,698
these two boys in the blue guy you know

3687
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:49,440
and they're the classic they just wanted

3688
02:12:47,698 --> 02:12:50,879
to take you around and you know you know

3689
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:52,859
how I would make money off a Westerner

3690
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:54,359
and I told him I said hey man I'm not

3691
02:12:52,859 --> 02:12:56,219
that kind of Westerner I don't need help

3692
02:12:54,359 --> 02:12:57,420
I don't need anything but if you want to

3693
02:12:56,219 --> 02:12:58,679
hang out and you want to hang with me

3694
02:12:57,420 --> 02:13:00,179

3737
02:14:25,618 --> 02:14:29,339
poorest people of this region you know

3738
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:31,380
they call them Untouchables lowest cast

3739
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:33,239
you know in this caste system there so

3740
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:34,618
they don't even have it's all surface

3741
02:14:33,238 --> 02:14:36,959
level water they don't have underground

3742
02:14:34,618 --> 02:14:38,880
water they don't have water you know

3743
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,739
so

3744
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:42,659
um to be able to offer you know these

3745
02:14:40,738 --> 02:14:44,519
people water like this it's just

3746
02:14:42,658 --> 02:14:46,920
something very simple but you know you

3747
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:48,659
can see by the images on these people's

3748
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:50,760
faces and everything how happy they are

3749
02:14:48,658 --> 02:14:51,420
to have water from underground river you

3750
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:53,099
know

3751
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:55,500
and it's very simple you know seven

3752
02:14:53,099 --> 02:14:58,199
hundred dollars to do a hand pump well

3753
02:14:55,500 --> 02:15:00,060
from start to finish you know

3754
02:14:58,198 --> 02:15:01,138
concrete pad everything little you know

3755
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:02,460
so they have a little hand pump well

3756
02:15:01,139 --> 02:15:04,618
there you know so they have a fresh

3757
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:06,480
water now so people just don't

3758
02:15:04,618 --> 02:15:08,819
understand you know what kind of um

3759
02:15:06,479 --> 02:15:10,979
impact that can put on a community you

3760
02:15:08,819 --> 02:15:13,618
know imagine you know now all these

3761
02:15:10,979 --> 02:15:15,238
Villages that were so poor don't have

3762
02:15:13,618 --> 02:15:16,559
fresh water probably using bottled

3763
02:15:15,238 --> 02:15:18,779
plastic water whatever probably just

3764
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:21,060
whatever now they have fresh water from

3765
02:15:18,779 --> 02:15:23,399
underground river you know

3766
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:26,219
um you know maybe 50 hundred persons in

3767
02:15:23,399 --> 02:15:27,960
each Village you know so it's like

3768
02:15:26,219 --> 02:15:29,819
yeah I don't know

3769
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:32,158
I like to do this kind of thing feels

3770
02:15:29,819 --> 02:15:33,779
cool I like to involve lots of people do

3771
02:15:32,158 --> 02:15:37,019
this kind of thing because

3772
02:15:33,779 --> 02:15:38,639
you know from a Buddhist perspective

3773
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:42,060
um since we're doing this project then

3774
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:44,578
anyone that's growing our strains buying

3775
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:47,099

02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:52,980
from buying whatever selling anything

3779
02:15:51,118 --> 02:15:55,078
from a Buddhist perspective they're

3780
02:15:52,979 --> 02:15:56,638
generating good karma because we're

3781
02:15:55,078 --> 02:15:58,380
doing these projects and we're helping

3782

anyone that's a part of our

3787

momentum is also from a Buddhist

3788

3821
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:20,219

3822
02:17:18,179 --> 02:17:22,558

3823
02:17:20,218 --> 02:17:24,299
yeah that's really awesome are you

3824
02:17:22,558 --> 02:17:26,879
planning to do any other sort of

3825
02:17:24,299 --> 02:17:28,018
projects maybe not Wells but similar

3826
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:29,819
sorts of thing or do you think there's

3827
02:17:28,019 --> 02:17:31,859
just still a lot of work to be done with

3828
02:17:29,819 --> 02:17:33,959
getting the pumps in

3829
02:17:31,859 --> 02:17:37,079
well I mean I had um his Holiness

3830
02:17:33,959 --> 02:17:38,938
dilemma had um given 34 color chakra

3831
02:17:37,079 --> 02:17:42,239
initiations and the last one was in both

3832
02:17:38,939 --> 02:17:44,340
Gaia so I wanted to do 34 Wells first I

3833
02:17:42,239 --> 02:17:47,280
want to do 21 Wells because in Buddhist

3834
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:50,040
practices there's a Tara practice called

3835
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:53,460
21 taras there's actually 21 of these um

3836
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:55,920
Tara deities that are you know represent

3837
02:17:53,459 --> 02:17:59,459
Long Live for

3838
02:17:55,920 --> 02:18:01,260
um you know wealthy you know healthy all

3839
02:17:59,459 --> 02:18:03,779
these different aspects of well-being

3840
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:05,880
and fortune in the sense of Health

3841
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:08,340
Fortune wealth Fortune all these things

3842
02:18:05,879 --> 02:18:10,978
they call them Tara you know it's Atara

3843
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:12,599
and there's 21 of these taras so I was

3844
02:18:10,978 --> 02:18:13,978
going to do 21 but then I'm like no

3845
02:18:12,599 --> 02:18:16,679
we're gonna do that really easy we'll do

3846
02:18:13,978 --> 02:18:18,539
34. you know so maybe we do 100 who

3847
02:18:16,679 --> 02:18:21,000
knows you know with as many villages as

3848
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:22,800
we can we'll put them in there maybe do

3849
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,179
something else I'm sure there'll be some

3850
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:27,358
other type of project that comes up

3851
02:18:24,179 --> 02:18:29,040
right after this I'm sure but you know

3852
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:30,899
um it's only as the Dalai Lama's Library

3853
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:33,599
museum projects getting breaking around

3854
02:18:30,898 --> 02:18:36,000
on May so and I potentially will do

3855
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:38,219
something for that also or you know

3856
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,679
again

3857
02:18:38,218 --> 02:18:43,259
sure and do you hope that this sort of

3858
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:45,478
arms giving will continue in the

3859
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:47,939
community long term like after the 34

3860
02:18:45,478 --> 02:18:50,159
Wells are done do you have any projects

3861
02:18:47,939 --> 02:18:51,540
in mind for going forward or do you

3862
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:52,920
think like at that point hopefully

3863
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:55,439
there's enough momentum that people

3864
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:57,719
continued on themselves

3865
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:59,939
well I don't know I mean I'll keep this

3866
02:18:57,718 --> 02:19:01,739
going as long as I can you know

3867
02:18:59,939 --> 02:19:03,179
um I won't I won't stop as long as

3868
02:19:01,739 --> 02:19:04,978
people keep giving me money to do these

3869
02:19:03,179 --> 02:19:06,478
Wells I'll find a place to put it in in

3870
02:19:04,978 --> 02:19:09,299
India

3871
02:19:06,478 --> 02:19:11,398
and that's just how it goes um for sure

3872
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:13,438
there'll be other projects and to to do

3873
02:19:11,398 --> 02:19:14,519
right after this because that's just how

3874
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:17,219
it goes you know there's always

3875
02:19:14,519 --> 02:19:18,840
something to do to help people you know

3876
02:19:17,218 --> 02:19:21,000
there's never there's never an end to

3877
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:25,139
that in this world right now

3878
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:28,019
yeah sure so kind of on that idea of

3879
02:19:25,138 --> 02:19:31,319
paying a forward a bit I noticed that

3880
02:19:28,019 --> 02:19:33,179
recently you've done some CBD work which

3881
02:19:31,319 --> 02:19:35,279
is kind of not as popular with the

3882
02:19:33,179 --> 02:19:37,739
mainstream it's often viewed as sort of

3883
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:41,300
a more medicinal Endeavor what are your

3884
02:19:37,739 --> 02:19:41,299
thoughts on the CBD Market

3885
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:46,380
um well it's pretty open right now so

3886
02:19:44,939 --> 02:19:48,659
you know we're going to get involved in

3887
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:50,279
it just because it's we should but um

3888
02:19:48,659 --> 02:19:52,379
you know I'm

3889
02:19:50,280 --> 02:19:54,479
I like it for what it is it created a

3890
02:19:52,379 --> 02:19:56,759
good Avenue to help everyone be more

3891
02:19:54,478 --> 02:19:58,559
familiar and make it more acceptable but

3892
02:19:56,760 --> 02:20:01,859
you know I'm not I'm not so much of a

3893
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:03,898
fan of the CBD scene I like CBD and THC

3894
02:20:01,859 --> 02:20:04,920
together personally

3895
02:20:03,898 --> 02:20:07,680
so

3896
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:09,840
yeah okay sure and I see a lot of people

3897
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:11,760
discussing how it's really important to

3898
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:13,500
know where you're getting your CBD from

3899
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:15,239
these days and I guess it's sort of

3900
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:18,180
especially pertinent given we're seeing

3901
02:20:15,239 --> 02:20:19,978
a lot of CBD come in from various

3902
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:23,280
markets around the world international

3903
02:20:19,978 --> 02:20:26,039
places like China often get referenced

3904
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:27,659
do you think that most CBD is of good

3905
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:29,160
quality or it really does matter where

3906
02:20:27,659 --> 02:20:31,139
you're getting it from

3907
02:20:29,159 --> 02:20:33,420
I think it matters where you're getting

3908
02:20:31,139 --> 02:20:35,639
it from

3909
02:20:33,420 --> 02:20:38,520
me personally I like cannabis derived

3910
02:20:35,639 --> 02:20:41,099
CBD better personally because it has you

3911
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:43,859
know I I I have a strain AC DC that's my

3912
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:46,500
favorite CBD to be honest and that's got

3913
02:20:43,859 --> 02:20:48,780
THC in it um

3914
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:50,398
so I mean

3915
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:52,140
I'm a fan

3916
02:20:50,398 --> 02:20:54,180
um but I'm more of a fan of THC

3917
02:20:52,139 --> 02:20:55,920
personally it gives me more medicinal

3918
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:58,859
value

3919
02:20:55,920 --> 02:21:02,219
so and I guess an extension of when you

3920
02:20:58,859 --> 02:21:03,720
referenced cannabis derived CBD we've

3921
02:21:02,219 --> 02:21:05,879
heard a lot of discussion recently

3922
02:21:03,719 --> 02:21:07,500
around cannabis derived terpins

3923
02:21:05,879 --> 02:21:10,139
particularly in reference to The Vape

3924
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:12,898
Market where a lot of sort of terpenes

3925
02:21:10,139 --> 02:21:14,459
extracted from various fruits and other

3926
02:21:12,898 --> 02:21:17,099
natural sort of products can come into

3927
02:21:14,459 --> 02:21:18,839
play or even synthetic terpenes you take

3928
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:21,059
the tank the same do you take the same

3929
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:23,460
stance with that in the Cannabis derived

3930
02:21:21,059 --> 02:21:27,619
terpenes are superior

3931
02:21:23,459 --> 02:21:27,619
yes if it's used for cannabis

3932
02:21:28,139 --> 02:21:31,739
um but I'm not really a fan of putting

3933
02:21:29,879 --> 02:21:33,239
other terpenes into cannabis because we

3934
02:21:31,739 --> 02:21:35,459
don't know you know like we do know that

3935
02:21:33,239 --> 02:21:37,139
cannabis

3936
02:21:35,459 --> 02:21:39,659
um you know medicinally

3937
02:21:37,139 --> 02:21:40,978
if you get limonene from Cannabis it's

3938
02:21:39,659 --> 02:21:42,180
going to be at a certain range you're

3939
02:21:40,978 --> 02:21:43,858
not gonna you know but if you're getting

3940
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:45,659
limonene from lemons and then you

3941
02:21:43,859 --> 02:21:47,520
introduce that into cannabis is that

3942
02:21:45,659 --> 02:21:50,639
safe I don't really know

3943
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:53,760
so I would want to say you know

3944
02:21:50,639 --> 02:21:56,818
sure and I guess a more focal point of

3945
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:59,280
discussion more recently has been CRC

3946
02:21:56,818 --> 02:22:00,539
which seems to have really sort of I

3947
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:02,700
don't even know what that is but it

3948
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:04,319
sounds like garbage you know I mean from

3949
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:07,859
what it sounds like people explain to me

3950
02:22:04,318 --> 02:22:10,978
I'm like whoa gnarly yeah I guess it's

3951
02:22:07,859 --> 02:22:12,659
sort of like the uh the the black resin

3952
02:22:10,978 --> 02:22:14,039
you'd get out of the stem of a bong but

3953
02:22:12,659 --> 02:22:16,379
it's the equivalent of what you'd get

3954
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:19,800
out of like a dab rake sort of thing and

3955
02:22:16,379 --> 02:22:21,179
there's been a lot of uh sort of I don't

3956
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:22,559
want to say Evolutions because I don't

3957
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:24,120
want to promote it as a good term but

3958
02:22:22,559 --> 02:22:26,159
people have basically learned how to

3959
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:28,740
process this in such a way that it makes

3960
02:22:26,159 --> 02:22:31,260
it appear sort of more clean

3961
02:22:28,739 --> 02:22:33,420
do you think that it's highlighting the

3962
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:35,398
idea that you know people are going to

3963
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:37,620
any length to make a market like I can't

3964
02:22:35,398 --> 02:22:39,659
help but feel like this idea of people

3965
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:41,340
often push this idea of how you know

3966
02:22:39,659 --> 02:22:42,959
you've got to just trap hard to make a

3967
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:44,760
living do you think this is like the

3968
02:22:42,959 --> 02:22:47,039
next logical step of that where people

3969
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:48,859
are literally polishing a turd

3970
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:51,660
well I don't think there's a logical

3971
02:22:48,859 --> 02:22:53,220
format in this but I do think it's a you

3972
02:22:51,659 --> 02:22:55,859
know an Avenue to make money and that

3973
02:22:53,219 --> 02:22:57,959
they're taking advantage of logic yeah

3974
02:22:55,859 --> 02:22:59,640
you know

3975
02:22:57,959 --> 02:23:01,619
um I'm not a fan of turning [ __ ] into

3976
02:22:59,639 --> 02:23:03,779
gold you know that's not something that

3977
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:07,079
I've ever been a proponent of you know

3978
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:08,939
I'm like you get really high-end

3979
02:23:07,079 --> 02:23:11,579
herb and then you can make really

3980
02:23:08,939 --> 02:23:13,559
high-end water hash with it that's kind

3981
02:23:11,579 --> 02:23:15,420
of where I'm at you know

3982
02:23:13,559 --> 02:23:16,978
yeah so I mean on that let's call these

3983
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:19,859
other avenues all these other avenues

3984
02:23:16,978 --> 02:23:22,139
are out of my league you know

3985
02:23:19,859 --> 02:23:24,479
so you you brought it up yourself water

3986
02:23:22,139 --> 02:23:26,159
hash is this your favorite sort of

3987
02:23:24,478 --> 02:23:28,139
concentrate

3988
02:23:26,159 --> 02:23:30,600
for sure 100 percent

3989
02:23:28,139 --> 02:23:32,939
and why do you think it is that we just

3990
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:35,399
have really seen a sharp falling off of

3991
02:23:32,939 --> 02:23:37,260
it even amongst the connoisseurs we it's

3992
02:23:35,398 --> 02:23:39,478
just so hard to find

3993
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:40,859
well people can't make it because they

3994
02:23:39,478 --> 02:23:43,139
don't have a quality product to start

3995
02:23:40,859 --> 02:23:44,399
with so it's like if you don't have a

3996
02:23:43,139 --> 02:23:45,898
quality product to start with you're not

3997
02:23:44,398 --> 02:23:47,699
going to make a quality product and it

3998
02:23:45,898 --> 02:23:49,318
takes work and effort and love you know

3999
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:51,420
and that's something that's lacking in

4000
02:23:49,318 --> 02:23:53,818
our industry these days you know why not

4001
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:54,960
just like cut your weed down freeze it

4002
02:23:53,818 --> 02:23:57,478
fresh

4003
02:23:54,959 --> 02:23:59,639
put a hydrocarbon to it and make it make

4004
02:23:57,478 --> 02:24:00,898
make a wax or make up diamonds or make a

4005
02:23:59,639 --> 02:24:02,579
whatever that's what people think's cool

4006
02:24:00,898 --> 02:24:04,619
right

4007
02:24:02,579 --> 02:24:07,260
um there's not people that know you know

4008
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:09,120
I just I haven't found anyone yet that's

4009
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:12,540
like oh man I'd much rather have that

4010
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:15,240
BHO than this like really high-end low

4011
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:16,620
temp slow pressed rosin or you know some

4012
02:24:15,239 --> 02:24:18,898
really good hash you know I just haven't

4013
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:20,399
found that yet so something we haven't

4014
02:24:18,898 --> 02:24:22,739
mentioned which I wanted to ask you

4015
02:24:20,398 --> 02:24:24,840
about was you reference file loss

4016
02:24:22,739 --> 02:24:27,359
earlier and I'm wondering do you think

4017
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:29,280
that sort of the scientific and genetic

4018
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:31,318
testing is going to lead the way in

4019
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:33,180
terms of male selection going forward or

4020
02:24:31,318 --> 02:24:35,519
do you think that the Breeders hunch is

4021
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:37,079
still going to rain Supreme

4022
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:39,300
well I think intuition and plant

4023
02:24:37,079 --> 02:24:41,579
relation always runs Supreme personally

4024
02:24:39,299 --> 02:24:43,079
that's just my opinion you know I don't

4025
02:24:41,579 --> 02:24:45,000
think these squares that are like

4026
02:24:43,079 --> 02:24:46,559
jumping into the labs and kind of going

4027
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,719
to play Overlord are going to do Jack

4028
02:24:46,559 --> 02:24:50,519
you know I mean look at how look at how

4029
02:24:48,719 --> 02:24:52,019
well I did for him now you know I think

4030
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:54,420
they let go of my ugly right and

4031
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:56,819
whatever and like you know that's just a

4032
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:58,559
joke you know everyone it's it is what

4033
02:24:56,818 --> 02:25:00,420
it is you know

4034
02:24:58,559 --> 02:25:02,699
so I've seen on your Instagram that

4035
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:04,559
you've worked with some tissue culturing

4036
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:06,780
facilities and I'm just sort of

4037
02:25:04,559 --> 02:25:09,359
wondering what sort of improvements can

4038
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:11,640
we as a community hope to achieve from

4039
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:12,899
the utilization of this technology long

4040
02:25:11,639 --> 02:25:14,639
term

4041
02:25:12,898 --> 02:25:16,699
I think it's going to

4042
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:16,699
um

4043
02:25:16,859 --> 02:25:21,000
um it's going to change the industry

4044
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:24,359
heavily you know because

4045
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:27,420
to offer that consistency across the

4046
02:25:24,359 --> 02:25:29,399
board you just can't do that in seed you

4047
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:32,398
just can't you know you can do that in

4048
02:25:29,398 --> 02:25:34,680
tissue culture you can get acres and

4049
02:25:32,398 --> 02:25:37,500
Acres all to be the same height you can

4050
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:39,540
get acres and acres to be pathogen pest

4051
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:41,398
free you can do all this stuff it's the

4052
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:43,020
future in my opinion but you know

4053
02:25:41,398 --> 02:25:44,760
because often we hear about hop late and

4054
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:46,439
virus and things like that have you seen

4055
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:48,719
strains that have been able to be

4056
02:25:46,439 --> 02:25:51,120
successfully cleaned with this process

4057
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:52,739
not personally but I when I had hop late

4058
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:54,000
in the years back when um dark heart

4059
02:25:52,739 --> 02:25:56,760
Nursery was giving it out to everybody

4060
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,799
before anyone knew what it was you know

4061
02:25:56,760 --> 02:26:00,540
um I got it from them and then I it took

4062
02:25:58,799 --> 02:26:01,920
me two or three years to call out of my

4063
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:03,479
garden you know and I just did it

4064
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:05,639
through sight and through you know

4065
02:26:03,478 --> 02:26:06,840
knowing what to look for and I didn't

4066
02:26:05,639 --> 02:26:08,579
even we didn't even know it was called

4067
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:10,200
hop late and you know it wasn't called

4068
02:26:08,579 --> 02:26:11,818
hop late and then it was not even called

4069
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:13,979
dudding then we didn't even know what

4070
02:26:11,818 --> 02:26:15,539
the [ __ ] it was you know thought it was

4071
02:26:13,978 --> 02:26:16,679
some like tobacco Mosaic or something

4072
02:26:15,540 --> 02:26:18,120
you know

4073
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:20,159
um so anyway yeah

4074
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:21,600
I don't know I mean I called it out of

4075
02:26:20,159 --> 02:26:24,659
all my Gardens we don't have it in there

4076
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:26,280
anymore so yeah wow I did that just just

4077
02:26:24,659 --> 02:26:28,559
personally you know

4078
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:30,359
and how did how did you achieve that I

4079
02:26:28,559 --> 02:26:33,000
think I heard Bob hemple in the past say

4080
02:26:30,359 --> 02:26:34,620
that you can outgrow it is that kind of

4081
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:37,739
what you did like where you would yeah

4082
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:39,660
please explain so basically you take the

4083
02:26:37,739 --> 02:26:41,579
best cuts and you keep taking the best

4084
02:26:39,659 --> 02:26:44,159
cuts growing them in the best conditions

4085
02:26:41,579 --> 02:26:45,959
and you you basically outgrow the hot

4086
02:26:44,159 --> 02:26:49,200
plate and you basically take new good

4087
02:26:45,959 --> 02:26:50,938
Cuts you propagate those you grow them

4088
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:53,939
out you take new good cuts and then you

4089
02:26:50,939 --> 02:26:56,579
just basically call it out you know

4090
02:26:53,939 --> 02:26:58,800
eliminating anything you know any any

4091
02:26:56,579 --> 02:27:02,700
sign that I saw of that I would throw

4092
02:26:58,799 --> 02:27:04,858
the soil pot and plant away completely

4093
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:06,420
yeah wow that's cool to hear that you

4094
02:27:04,859 --> 02:27:09,229
were able to get rid of it

4095
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:11,460
yeah didn't even know what it was then

4096
02:27:09,229 --> 02:27:14,459
[Laughter]

4097
02:27:11,459 --> 02:27:18,478
I just know I didn't like it

4098
02:27:14,459 --> 02:27:20,159
and neither did the plan so on to one of

4099
02:27:18,478 --> 02:27:23,279
our final questions before we jump into

4100
02:27:20,159 --> 02:27:25,318
the Fast Fire ones at the end I've been

4101
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:27,659
asking a lot of guests recently if they

4102
02:27:25,318 --> 02:27:29,579
have any concern about the possibility

4103
02:27:27,659 --> 02:27:32,100
of there being genetically modified

4104
02:27:29,579 --> 02:27:34,978
cannabis specifically in the sense that

4105
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:37,260
maybe it's modified such that it grows

4106
02:27:34,978 --> 02:27:39,599
at a very uniform height or the the

4107
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:41,340
levels are very consistent in terms of

4108
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:43,559
cannabinoids so that it you know it

4109
02:27:41,340 --> 02:27:45,540
doesn't test hot or there's at least

4110
02:27:43,559 --> 02:27:49,639
consistency do you think that's

4111
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:49,640
something to fear not really

4112
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:54,260
honestly

4113
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:54,260
I mean

4114
02:27:58,799 --> 02:28:01,858
I don't know like in the industry I'm

4115
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:03,060
not fearing much in these kind of

4116
02:28:01,859 --> 02:28:04,620
contexts because everything's going to

4117
02:28:03,059 --> 02:28:06,119
play itself out

4118
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:07,620
um I just I guess that's that's

4119
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:09,859
something not something that can really

4120
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:09,859
uh

4121
02:28:09,959 --> 02:28:14,099
you know speak on too much to be honest

4122
02:28:11,939 --> 02:28:15,600
I don't think it's uh something to worry

4123
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:18,420
about

4124
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:21,720
yeah sure so

4125
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:23,700
on to our final quick fire questions

4126
02:28:21,719 --> 02:28:25,199
which we love to ask gold readers to

4127
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:27,780
kind of get their perspective on a few

4128
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:30,300
different things the first question is

4129
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:33,180
what is the most memorable cannabis

4130
02:28:30,299 --> 02:28:36,539
you've ever consumed I mean I had some

4131
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:38,760
Maui Wowie when I was uh a kid and man I

4132
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:41,460
was high for like seven hours or some

4133
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:43,739
hydro weed you know like grown from

4134
02:28:41,459 --> 02:28:45,539
Oregon I think and

4135
02:28:43,739 --> 02:28:47,520
I don't know that put a high on me like

4136
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:49,080
nothing else really that was it was

4137
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:50,040
interesting

4138
02:28:49,079 --> 02:28:51,780
um

4139
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:54,359
other than that I don't have a lot of

4140
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:56,819
memorable moments you know it was like

4141
02:28:54,359 --> 02:28:59,520
the first time I smoked chronic you know

4142
02:28:56,818 --> 02:29:01,680
I was like it made it it made an impact

4143
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:03,659
that was that Maui Wowie is growing

4144
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:06,479
Hydra you know

4145
02:29:03,659 --> 02:29:08,639
yeah that's interesting so on the other

4146
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:10,920
end of the spectrum were there ever a

4147
02:29:08,639 --> 02:29:12,719
specific strain that comes to mind when

4148
02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:14,340
maybe a lot of your friends or

4149
02:29:12,719 --> 02:29:16,438
colleagues were just really hyped about

4150
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:18,478
it loving it and then you finally got a

4151
02:29:16,439 --> 02:29:20,100
chance to try it and you were left a bit

4152
02:29:18,478 --> 02:29:22,619
unimpressed

4153
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:25,380
oh yeah that's happened a lot honestly

4154
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:26,460
multiple times I can't even fix I can't

4155
02:29:25,379 --> 02:29:29,898
even explain

4156
02:29:26,459 --> 02:29:29,898
definitely happened quite a few times

4157
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:33,720
just sort of the more new stuff or the

4158
02:29:31,859 --> 02:29:35,100
older stuff

4159
02:29:33,719 --> 02:29:36,478
um both you know I've had some land race

4160
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:38,760
stuff from people that are like oh man

4161
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:39,959
it's so good you're like okay whatever

4162
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:41,398
um and then some of this newer things

4163
02:29:39,959 --> 02:29:43,858
you're like oh man this is the best and

4164
02:29:41,398 --> 02:29:44,699
you're like nah but then you do you know

4165
02:29:43,859 --> 02:29:46,500
like

4166
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:48,359
then I had smelly Kush cake that was

4167
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:49,799
really good you know when I had some of

4168
02:29:48,359 --> 02:29:52,318
this other strain that wasn't that good

4169
02:29:49,799 --> 02:29:55,858
you know so it's I think it's like

4170
02:29:52,318 --> 02:29:58,139
each person you know each person each

4171
02:29:55,859 --> 02:30:00,180
grower all that it's all it all comes

4172
02:29:58,139 --> 02:30:03,959
into play there

4173
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:05,818
yeah certainly so let's give a desert

4174
02:30:03,959 --> 02:30:07,858
island situation I'm going to drop you

4175
02:30:05,818 --> 02:30:10,318
off on a desert island and you can

4176
02:30:07,859 --> 02:30:11,760
cultivate three strains for the rest of

4177
02:30:10,318 --> 02:30:13,619
time which three are you going to take

4178
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:16,579
with you

4179
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:16,579
wow

4180
02:30:16,859 --> 02:30:20,399
um there was this big sir holy strain

4181
02:30:18,659 --> 02:30:22,020
that was out of Eugene that I first

4182
02:30:20,398 --> 02:30:24,539
started growing that I would take that

4183
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:27,000
one I would take the um purple Hindu

4184
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:29,700
Kush that I just got from Sir Bob

4185
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:33,359
Hemphill and I would also

4186
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:35,280
a good OG or sour basket ever I think

4187
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:36,780
I don't think those those three I'd

4188
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:38,760
probably be good

4189
02:30:36,780 --> 02:30:41,880
honestly

4190
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:43,920
no it's a solid selection there so on

4191
02:30:41,879 --> 02:30:45,659
the other end of the spectrum let's just

4192
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:47,100
say you were going to drop someone off

4193
02:30:45,659 --> 02:30:48,840
to the island too you're not

4194
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:50,520
particularly fond of and you get to

4195
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:54,020
choose which three strains they're left

4196
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:54,020
with which ones are you going to give

4197
02:30:56,478 --> 02:31:00,840
well I think I'd even if I wasn't fond

4198
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:02,520
of them I'd probably want them to have

4199
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:04,439
the strains that I just picked because

4200
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:05,819
I'd want them to evolve their mind you

4201
02:31:04,439 --> 02:31:08,159
know because maybe if I didn't I wasn't

4202
02:31:05,818 --> 02:31:10,799
fond on them because they were like you

4203
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:11,700
know the way they thought or something I

4204
02:31:10,799 --> 02:31:13,079
don't know

4205
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:15,659
um if I wanted to stick someone with

4206
02:31:13,079 --> 02:31:17,159
some bunk strains basically

4207
02:31:15,659 --> 02:31:18,898
is that what you meant yeah yeah

4208
02:31:17,159 --> 02:31:21,180
whatever you want to do I'm happy to

4209
02:31:18,898 --> 02:31:23,719
accept the Diplomatic give them a blue

4210
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:23,720

4212
02:31:25,879 --> 02:31:31,079
poo dream and uh

4213
02:31:28,318 --> 02:31:33,478

better blackberry kush

4218
02:31:41,659 --> 02:31:45,439
blackberry kush was a good strain to

4219
02:31:43,739 --> 02:31:50,159
stick someone you don't like with

4220

there you go there you go okay so uh the

4221
02:31:50,159 --> 02:31:54,659
final question for our interview today

4222
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:56,760
if you could go back in time to any

4223
02:31:54,659 --> 02:31:58,739
place anywhere in history and collect

4224
02:31:56,760 --> 02:32:01,340
some seeds where would you go and what

4225
02:31:58,739 --> 02:32:01,340
would you collect

4226
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:05,760
wow

4227
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:07,559
well I'd have to go back in time to you

4228
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:11,700
know the Tibetan plateau and try to like

4229
02:32:07,559 --> 02:32:14,459
find some of those um you know root

4230
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:16,020
starter strains from way back thousands

4231
02:32:14,459 --> 02:32:18,179
and thousands and thousands of years ago

4232
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:20,819
you know that'd be one you know wouldn't

4233
02:32:18,180 --> 02:32:22,079
mind um you know going to Nepal try to

4234
02:32:20,818 --> 02:32:24,840
find something there I don't know you

4235
02:32:22,079 --> 02:32:26,760
know literally trying to find some of

4236
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:28,079
that Source stuff give that Source

4237
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:30,478
feeling you know

4238
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:32,159
go to Africa maybe go down to Southern

4239
02:32:30,478 --> 02:32:33,659
Africa somewhere

4240
02:32:32,159 --> 02:32:36,020
find some Durban or something I don't

4241
02:32:33,659 --> 02:32:36,020
know really

4242
02:32:37,079 --> 02:32:40,439
so that was what came to my top of my

4243
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:42,960
head I guess you know those three

4244
02:32:40,439 --> 02:32:44,818
through three regions South Africa Nepal

4245
02:32:42,959 --> 02:32:47,879
Tibetan plateau

4246
02:32:44,818 --> 02:32:51,119
yeah fantastic what what nice old world

4247
02:32:47,879 --> 02:32:53,039
soda selections so I think that pretty

4248
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:54,720
much brings us to the end of things were

4249
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:56,100

I'm excited about this and

4256
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:12,600
hope it offers people a little bit of

4257
02:33:09,478 --> 02:33:14,398
perspective and really just want to say

4258

4259
02:33:14,398 --> 02:33:18,539
opportunity really grateful you know I

4260
02:33:16,739 --> 02:33:22,020
do know that um

4261
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:22,800
you know Bodie said he wanted to do a uh

4262
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:25,380
a

4263
02:33:22,799 --> 02:33:28,398
um kind of add-on to this at one point

4264
02:33:25,379 --> 02:33:30,839
so I think everyone can look forward to

4265
02:33:28,398 --> 02:33:32,760
