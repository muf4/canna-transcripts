29
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,519
very much for having me i really

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,359
appreciate this opportunity to visit

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,879
with you today

32
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,239
so we're gonna do a little curveball

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,599
first question what are you currently

34
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,319
smoking on

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,158
uh actually mom gooey he just loaded a

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,118
fresh ball

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,719
is that like just typical or is it

38
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,239
you've been experimenting a little bit

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,840
lately oh no no no

40
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,560
the way that i

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,719
the way that i smoke is

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,719
i

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
this is really hard to explain but

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,079
you

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,320
i always use gui as a reset because gui

46
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,758
for me is really strong it's always been

47
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,639
strong the plant's going to be

48
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,840
35

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,399
years old

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,359
um the seer and so

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,239
uh i i it's a good gauge because then i

52
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,280
can go off of uh that onto the the test

53
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,839
plants that i do because uh

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,719
with so much i need to have a constant

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,439
that i can say okay i like this because

56
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:17,199
i like everything about mom gui and uh

57
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,759
that's why it's such a popular strange

58
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,000
well i guess before we jump into

59
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,840
kind of the the vault of mum gui let's

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
go all the way back to the start what

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
was it like when you first experienced

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
cannabis and what was the cannabis scene

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,759
like back then

64
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:31,759
oh

65
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,959
i i was introduced to it at a very

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,759
tender young age and

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,239
i still remember that date

68
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,039
very vividly

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,759
a friend of mine had

70
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,878
saw his older brother

71
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,878
doing it and laugh and enjoy himself and

72
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,439
have a good time

73
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,120
so he thought it'd be um

74
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
kind of fun to bring it over to us you

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,759
know my friend of mine

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,959
that i hung out with all the time

77
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,000
and

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,000
this guy

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,439
we just call kind of cohorts and we went

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,239
ahead and

81
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,959
we took a one of the old style

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,719
plastic bubble pipes

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,439
and

84
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,759
and some matches and some of this stuff

85
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,519
and he he had had quite a little bit for

86
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,120
i couldn't believe he took what he took

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,480
but i didn't know i didn't know that

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,519
much about it

89
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,079
uh

90
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,319
but it seemed like a lot to me anyway we

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,599
put that in that plastic bubble pipe and

92
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,919
smoked it

93
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,079
it didn't really seem like there was

94
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,639
doing that much but uh

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
we were at the top of this huge grassy

96
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,000
hill and

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,919
i remember just

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,560
running up and down that hill

99
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,359
just go up to the top and roll down

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,360
laughing and laughing and then later on

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,560
we kind of understood that that was that

102
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,760
was the initial feelings but

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,878
then

104
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,039
i

105
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,479
i was an air force brat so i moved

106
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,598
around a lot

107
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,238
and

108
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,318
at that point i realized that you know i

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,319
kind of needed to make sure i could have

110
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,639
it all the time and gosh darn this stuff

111
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,399
has seeds that when i was 13 i thought

112
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,199
hey you know what this has seeds why am

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,519
i

114
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,079
looking for it or why don't i just grow

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,918
it because i come from a agricultural

116
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,000
based family

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:27,120
out here in california and so we

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,519
went ahead and i would get seed and

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,800
mix it in and by the time i was

120
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,918
uh

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,919
15 or so

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,439
i was doing pretty good i was living in

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,918
nebraska at that point and

124
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,360
it grows wild there so i figured out

125
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,279
real quick that you could just kind of

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
hollow out a patch of the wild throw in

127
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,959
the good seed and just let it go through

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
nature's course and come back at the end

129
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,359
of the year and it was there it was

130
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,039
seated with the hemp but who cares you

131
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,520
know it was better than nothing so

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,080
and then moving to england after that

133
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,918
had two years of not being able to grow

134
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,439
because you can't grow much in england

135
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,359
outside

136
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,399
back then

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,720
in the 70s uh it seemed to rain half of

138
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,879
the time after the year it was it was

139
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,280
rainy and dreary and

140
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,038
i didn't have much luck so

141
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,959
but there were some integral parts

142
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,639
before then that made up gooey and you

143
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,038
know we can we can touch on that if you

144
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,120
want i don't i i don't care

145
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,680
but that's those are those are the basic

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,160
you know beginnings uh

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,439
and within that are the beginnings of

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,160
the gui mom that is so popular

149
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,240
so as in you were collecting the seed

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,240
stock over that time period yeah

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,360
absolutely you know what what the fun

152
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,918
here's the fun part about gooey that

153
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,960
i i've told this over the years you can

154
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,599
go on to breed bay i'm sure and find it

155
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,879
at other places too but

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,120
um i there was a short interim time uh

157
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,519
before going over to england where i was

158
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,240
in new york uh city

159
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,000
and i was there for a long enough period

160
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,639
of time that i was able to

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,959
acquire some of the local fare

162
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,960
and

163
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,359
during that time

164
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,719
the founder of high times had smuggled

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,639
in this gold colombian pot

166
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,479
that nobody had ever seen gold pot

167
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,079
before and they were having a real hard

168
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,000
time

169
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,719
getting rid of that so

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,079
they developed this magazine called high

171
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
times to

172
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,478
help

173
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,120
sell that pot

174
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,360
and one of the center folds of the one

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,560
of the very first issue or

176
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,439
the subsequent second issue was this

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,160
huge room full of this

178
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,279
700 pounds of pot with a girl leg on top

179
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
of it smoking a joint

180
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:58,240
i got some of that pot from um

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,919
some friends of mine in in new york at

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,598
that time who were

183
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,159
started seeing this and thought well

184
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,680
okay this is interesting and good and so

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240
that that

186
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,478
turned into the colombian gold

187
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,560
portion of mom gui that started the

188
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,038
whole thing because then

189
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
soon after that the golds became popular

190
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,478
and i had acapulco gold and that went

191
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,918
into it too

192
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,598
and those are the seeds that i tried to

193
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,918
take over to england and i had to hold

194
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,199
on to what i had until i got back to the

195
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,279
united states

196
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,199
and to california because that's where i

197
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:32,000
came back to

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,879
and uh it started developing gui at that

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,879
point

200
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,478
uh it went through other

201
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,399
additions and

202
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,279
it went from there

203
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,318
so

204
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,559
when the colombian gold first hit new

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,520
york it was like no one wanted it i

206
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,759
guess because you were saying they were

207
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,240
having trouble well no but yeah they'd

208
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,080
never seen gold pop before that was odd

209
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,918
and then and and they were having a hard

210
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,199
time with you know

211
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,120
dealers didn't want to see that

212
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,038
everything was brown back then what's

213
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,519
this gold stuff what's what's been

214
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,519
what's been done to it what's you know

215
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,159
er it was just a

216
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,120
it just wasn't turning over and so

217
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,479
they developed high times magazine just

218
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,360
for that reason

219
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,878
yeah wow yeah people can look that up

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,360
and it's all true

221
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,759
and uh that's the very beginnings of

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
gooey you know very beginnings of the

223
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,038
gooey mom

224
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,840
and that's and people really love her i

225
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,360
mean i i have to tell you that i get

226
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,359
more

227
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,158
requests and compliments on that one

228
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,839
plant than

229
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,918
virtually anything else i've done and

230
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,839
that's hard hard to say because there's

231
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,838
some really pretty stuff that folks have

232
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,120
really enjoyed too but

233
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,959
nothing gets in like mom so

234
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,639
so that's what's it's a very important

235
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,719
thing because those are all old school

236
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,199
genetics they're all made up from stuff

237
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
that just doesn't exist anymore

238
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,399
so that's what makes it so important

239
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,079
so when you started to make gooey was it

240
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,759
like an intentional

241
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,800
transition into breeding or were you

242
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,480
just kind of making seed for yourself

243
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,679
oh yeah i was just making seed for

244
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,440
myself but then of course you know i

245
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,239
started to get a little bit more

246
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,240
educated and i started to understand

247
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,440
more that manipulation was within my

248
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,240
grasp

249
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,839
and when i did find something that was

250
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,919
uh

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
out of the ordinary or something that

252
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,599
really turned me on that i wanted to add

253
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,120
i i realized that i could you know build

254
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,080
it in

255
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,679
and

256
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,860
i'm

257
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,958
very blessed to be able to

258
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,839
[Music]

259
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,479
be very picky

260
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
and

261
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,959
you know and so i learned you know that

262
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,839
i could focus in on what i needed and

263
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:50,159
and find how to find it and luther

264
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,440
burbank really helped along with that

265
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,559
luther said

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,160
you know

267
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,039
choose one trait

268
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,079
and

269
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,559
you know shine all the rest and that's

270
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,560
basically how i breed

271
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,000
when you did first start making gooey

272
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,000
and you kind of started to get more a

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
bit cluey about what you were doing

274
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,839
around that time period did you know of

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,839
anyone else who was trying to do it on

276
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,600
that same level like like trying to take

277
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
it real seriously like were there any

278
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
other breeders or you just kind of

279
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,240
really isolated

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,519
you know i i i i in my own little world

281
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,680
as far as that goes i i i i

282
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,799
i'll tell you this is a funny story i i

283
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:34,559
had a point where i was in arizona and

284
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:37,359
i had two plants and i can only have two

285
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,599
plants in this one spot and it was

286
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,720
really hairy in arizona and i was really

287
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,639
scared

288
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
and

289
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,120
due to the heat and all that stuff it's

290
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,919
very challenging and stuff so i ended up

291
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,919
losing one of the plants and and and it

292
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,078
turned out that it was probably the male

293
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,360
that i lost so i only ended up with this

294
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,159
female

295
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,159
and i kept waiting for seeds to you know

296
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,480
coming about and because i was just used

297
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,399
to seeded pod didn't know anything

298
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,278
about any of that and all this thing

299
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,278
just got kept going and going and going

300
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,519
and finally when i picked it it was just

301
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,360
this beautiful seedless

302
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,320
plant that i

303
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,079
just thought wow this is very unusual

304
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,399
and there's no seed

305
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,919
but i like this a lot better what

306
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,240
happened and so then

307
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:27,120
i thought i invented sensamiya i thought

308
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,600
oh my gosh you know what a great thing

309
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,919
then i did some more reading of course

310
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
and then found out that no this has been

311
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,078
going on for

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,440
thousands of years the chinese done it

313
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,120
and so

314
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,600
so anyway that after that humbling

315
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,360
little revelation i i went ahead and

316
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,720
built on that and said well this is

317
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,320
really good and right about that

318
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,959
year or the next year after that

319
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,278
sent to me it became the really big

320
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,719
thing it was it was

321
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,958
the thing and it took off from there

322
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,680
that was right at the very beginnings of

323
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,958
when the seed banks were starting to

324
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,319
advertise and and get out there

325
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,039
from the dutch

326
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,839
it was right in that time so

327
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,360
did this revelation hamper your breeding

328
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,000
efforts at all because like on the one

329
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,159
hand you're making gooey oh no no i have

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,320
more seed i just i just

331
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,879
found out what it was that i had done

332
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,800
you know and and so now i now i could do

333
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,200
it intentionally you know now i know how

334
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,759
to control it and you know it's just

335
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,920
like any other learning process it it

336
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,559
it's a simple thing you know what i mean

337
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,679
in in retrospect you know duh

338
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,559
but

339
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,599
when you're 15 and you're the only one

340
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,479
who's grown intentionally it's it's it's

341
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,680
it's it's a really interesting thing

342
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,519
that really started me my my father

343
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,919
looked at me once and he said you know

344
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,120
why is it you want to know so much about

345
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,360
pot

346
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,879
why you know can't you do something

347
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,039
you know more constructive and

348
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,480
nowadays i bring that up to them now and

349
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,799
i said

350
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,759
you know why

351
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,519
here's why oh no

352
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,319
he gets it now

353
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,399
but

354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,320
you know that's it you know you you

355
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,879
you're drawn to what you're drawn to and

356
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,720
this happens to be what god put me here

357
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,559
for and so i'm trying to do the best i

358
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,839
can yeah i mean the work speaks for

359
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,838
itself right

360
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,440
if we go back if we go back to the mum

361
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
gui for a moment though

362
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
uh-huh how did you get the other parts

363
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,120
of the puzzle there's the uh the thai

364
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
and the the maui we got a lot of

365
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,759
questions about the maui you know tell

366
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,360
us because you say you got it from the

367
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,240
source like what's the backstory behind

368
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
that

369
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
yeah you know well here's the deal i've

370
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,919
known a lot of

371
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,879
friends in the islands for all my life

372
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,278
and

373
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,439
i was turned on to this gentleman who in

374
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,559
1972

375
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,320
developed

376
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,159
what he called wowie

377
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,079
on maui

378
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,078
and um

379
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:04,399
that was a

380
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:08,399
beautiful strain um really

381
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,720
definitely asian genetics um

382
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,480
but with a twist and he

383
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,600
he never really could

384
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,639
tell

385
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,759
me exactly what that other twist was but

386
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,720
in

387
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,039
it's it was obviously now in in looking

388
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720
back at it it was obviously there a

389
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,319
pakistan

390
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,240
that had been brought onto the islands

391
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,600
or it was an afghan

392
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,079
one of those two um i lean more towards

393
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,920
the pakistani just by

394
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:39,120
the way

395
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:42,078
mom stacks from it uh because that's a

396
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,799
lot of where she picked that up from

397
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:48,559
um when most of the genetics that are in

398
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,879
gooey are are

399
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,359
heavily sativa and they were

400
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:56,399
tall and you know

401
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,278
sativas in stature and stuff and then

402
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,919
after the mallory was introduced uh

403
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,360
because that was the second to the last

404
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,319
component

405
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,600
that was introduced into that um

406
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,399
um

407
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,959
[Music]

408
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,839
with the um

409
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,838
tai being the last

410
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,759
um

411
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,480
that really kind of set this

412
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,159
structure in a very

413
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
tight and

414
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,399
completely changed way from what i was

415
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,039
used to for

416
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,958
the years before when breeding in

417
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,439
um

418
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,879
you know with the colombians and and

419
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,160
that so

420
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,480
um i really i i

421
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,159
saw the change actually i really

422
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,600
liked the change because it didn't take

423
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,759
away from the

424
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,240
you know the the central

425
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,879
point but it just made it made the plant

426
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,000
so much easier to grow uh

427
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,879
it quickened it up uh guys dewey's got a

428
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
six

429
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,879
from six and a half weeks on

430
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,560
uh it can be picked and uh it it varies

431
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,639
a lot in the medicine that it produces

432
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,518
because um

433
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,639
you get

434
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,399
radically different stages and i this is

435
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,600
one of the benefits of this plant

436
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,559
because

437
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,120
uh early on it it's good for some

438
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,119
ailments and late stages it's good for

439
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,078
completely different stuff and it's all

440
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,240
from the same plant and i i actually

441
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,879
need to outline that more online and

442
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,799
kind of help people to understand that

443
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,879
um it's been lauded as a a wonderful

444
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,439
strain for nerve pain

445
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,600
um

446
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,600
and for migraines

447
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,480
things like that that are

448
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,159
i i really look forward to

449
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,159
expanding on that

450
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,838
knowledge out there and getting folks

451
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,679
tuned into that so that they can help

452
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,120
themselves

453
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,638
really excited that today i just got a

454
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,560
hold of some

455
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,600
very old

456
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,518
uh pure gooey seed that i had made

457
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
prior to

458
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,000
let's see

459
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
i think these are

460
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,480
2

461
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,079
0009

462
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,400
and that uh

463
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,558
i have two different stages so i i get

464
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,439
to go back and i get to revisit it

465
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:24,240
because i've gone through all my stocks

466
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,720
and uh good old norse stars they had

467
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,519
them you know in their

468
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,519
cold keeping

469
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,360
spots to

470
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,679
keep them fresh and

471
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,918
so he's returned those to me so i'm

472
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,160
looking forward to being able to offer

473
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:44,880
people uh the old-school pure gooey

474
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,600
seed which everybody just absolutely

475
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
loves i can uh

476
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:53,519
give you the description of that there

477
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:57,599
are the stages of gooey that are

478
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,679
using the old s1 uh skunk one as the

479
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,759
cubing mechanism

480
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,120
why did you choose to use the skunk as

481
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,160
the mail

482
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,918
you know i

483
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,440
i did that because

484
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,720
skunk one contained some of those uh

485
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,558
um

486
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,000
sativa

487
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:18,319
strains the same exact ones

488
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,960
um when that when when skunk one was

489
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:23,119
made it's not a it's it's not an indica

490
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,600
it's a combination of

491
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,639
of several things and acapulco gold is

492
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,839
one of them

493
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,960
so i wanted to use that as a as a you

494
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,720
know reinforcer for that and uh

495
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,880
that just seems like the best choice

496
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,919
because when you know

497
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,240
that

498
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,240
um

499
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,519
these

500
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,439
wildly crazy genetics

501
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,599
pools that are out there now that you if

502
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,640
you can trust something even back then i

503
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,279
realized you know i need to trust this

504
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,799
and that was the best place and i've

505
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,319
grown that strain

506
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,519
for years before i i because i just

507
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,359
enjoyed it

508
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,679
and i thought no this is going to be

509
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,079
good because i know both strains very

510
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,519
well so that i can separate what i'm

511
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,918
looking for

512
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,759
and still you know keep the components

513
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,720
that i think are beneficial and that's

514
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,440
exactly how it works so it says online

515
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,038
that the stock you use was from ssc

516
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,600
we've spoken about them a lot on the

517
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,079
show yeah and a lot of the breeders

518
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,119
regard them really highly do you feel

519
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,918
the same

520
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:33,759
oh yeah sssc was

521
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,759
a really really good company i really

522
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,919
really say is that they were

523
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:42,240
really professional

524
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,520
i i enjoyed everything you know

525
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,880
early on

526
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,558
i i was

527
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,440
into them

528
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,440
when they first started to go ahead and

529
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,000
sell in high times and

530
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,600
i was all over it and i found that they

531
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,279
were excellent

532
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,480
excellent in the quality that they put

533
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,599
out and you could trust it uh to some

534
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,519
extent

535
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,599
there were some things that that were

536
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,158
you know in retrospect that i would go

537
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,678
yeah yeah maybe you know

538
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,480
but overall

539
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,038
i would just say you know kudos thank

540
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,960
you very much they benefited the world

541
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,480
really as far as that goes they really

542
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,640
did

543
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,640
well interestingly i've never really

544
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,000
heard anyone with who didn't like their

545
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,440
stuff so i'd love to know what did you

546
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,679
think was a bit miss from them

547
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,679
well

548
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,960
there were a couple of things like

549
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,439
the purple rain

550
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,240
you could never get

551
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,000
um

552
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,558
it was all

553
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,960
i think they must have had it like once

554
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,879
and then it never would you never were

555
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,919
able to get it again that was

556
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,840
frustrating uh i i had a

557
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,600
little bit of

558
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,279
germination

559
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,319
problems with

560
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,319
a couple of their

561
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,798
lines but you know i i i gotta hesitate

562
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,399
as to what which ones they were it was a

563
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,200
long time ago

564
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,038
um

565
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,960
and i don't want them i don't want to

566
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,919
really muddy their reputation with

567
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,919
something

568
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
silly like that but there were a few

569
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,400
times where

570
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,400
some of the seeds i got i questioned and

571
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,960
you know but that was

572
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,200
i ordered a lot so

573
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,440
everybody deserves a swing and a miss

574
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,279
now every now and then i hold no grudges

575
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,000
at all

576
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,119
yeah no totally and and so just as a

577
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,200
final little question on them

578
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:39,479
specifically what was the favorite

579
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,480
strain you grew out from them

580
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:46,079
[Music]

581
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,919
you know i'm just gonna have to say the

582
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,678
skunk one

583
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,080
yeah i i you know

584
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,038
because it really just had

585
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:57,519
overall what i really enjoyed about

586
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,440
a plant you know that

587
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,480
you could get phenos that were a little

588
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,440
bit more uh sweet you could get phenos

589
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,279
that that had a little bit more uh

590
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,720
hashy flavor

591
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:13,759
um but the profiles were all basically

592
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,079
like really tight and really well done

593
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,720
and i just i i just found that to be a

594
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:22,558
very consistent line the the same thing

595
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:26,400
with the afghan one it was the same way

596
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:30,558
really nice really dark leaves wide

597
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,280
beautiful perfect indica structure

598
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,720
really quality quality work that's

599
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,038
interesting because we don't actually

600
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,960
see as far as i can tell a lot of afghan

601
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,480
one pop up in your stuff is that

602
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
something which never really interested

603
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,759
you

604
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,679
there's a reason for that because i

605
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,480
gravitate more to the sweets and that

606
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,480
thing

607
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,360
those things that just stink the place

608
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,720
up and see uh

609
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,240
most of my breeding was always for

610
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,720
clandestine use and and

611
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,120
so it i leaned towards that sweet smell

612
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,600
because it doesn't

613
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,479
tend to permeate the way that

614
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,918
that

615
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,279
the the pure indicas go they just they

616
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,559
you know you could smell them a block

617
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,759
away

618
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,000
yeah

619
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,480
you know so that that basically is and

620
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,679
i'm just a sweet pot kind of guy you

621
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,360
know i i just that that's where i go

622
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,640
yeah and so it's always fun to try other

623
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,158
things but

624
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,640
one thing i've noticed when you go into

625
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,840
dispensaries nowadays and stuff

626
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
everything smells

627
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,520
like everything else

628
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,720
and i hate that and that's why i can't

629
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,879
exotics goes and tries to split that up

630
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,558
and and to to make the

631
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,600
the savory

632
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:51,359
flavor you know of whatever i'm trying

633
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:53,678
to express the flavor and make it really

634
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,399
unique and i i've been very lucky to be

635
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
able to to achieve some of that you know

636
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,679
for folks

637
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,759
because it really does make a difference

638
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,600
to set the brand apart

639
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:07,278
it doesn't taste like ordinary pot then

640
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,199
that gets people's interest people are

641
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,200
more into flavor than

642
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,120
they used to be

643
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,038
without question

644
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,319
so just on what you said there

645
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,240
it's an interesting point you raised

646
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,759
about the differentiation of the flavors

647
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,880
do you think that cannabis has the

648
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:26,000
ability to produce any possible smell

649
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,320
you know given the right genetics

650
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
well

651
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,599
i i i let's just say that i think that

652
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,880
the cannabis

653
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:39,759
can go a very wide range

654
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,278
i don't know that it can go to any smell

655
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:46,720
but i mean it's demonstrated you know

656
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:49,119
everything from sweet tropicals to you

657
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,480
know gas

658
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:57,359
um so it's got a potential uh

659
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:01,120
i i i i don't know how people

660
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:04,399
see with science being the way it is now

661
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,158
with them extracting these turpins and

662
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,120
then going ahead and putting them back

663
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,520
on in copulus amounts that muddies the

664
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,558
waters a little bit but for straight-up

665
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,480
breeding

666
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:18,960
i think that if you find a flavor

667
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,679
you can amplify it

668
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,558
and i i let's just put it like that

669
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,759
because that's what i do i use some

670
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,038
strains

671
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,000
as

672
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:32,720
amplifiers for another flavor that's not

673
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,359
like that it's just a

674
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,120
a a totally different flavor but maybe i

675
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,278
want to bring it out more

676
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,119
so there are certain strains that i use

677
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,278
to do that because they act like

678
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,599
loudspeakers and and

679
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,640
and then you just look for those phenos

680
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,439
that

681
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,440
the target

682
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,918
taste

683
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:57,919
is uh predominant and you just use that

684
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,320
and bring it forward so would you

685
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,000
kind of say that your primary attribute

686
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,759
you breed towards at the moment would be

687
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,119
specific flavor or is each project a

688
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,480
little different oh no yeah

689
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,678
no no no

690
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,480
there are tons of projects i'm dealing

691
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,798
with

692
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,400
a a a company

693
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,359
in colorado

694
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
that

695
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,678
for legal reasons i can't

696
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,558
give them any details but this company

697
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,759
has asked me to develop a line

698
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,319
for them

699
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,919
for mechanical harvesting because

700
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,038
they're developing a mechanical

701
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,360
harvester

702
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,759
to do things on a large scale and they

703
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,959
have discovered that of course

704
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,240
if you

705
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,840
have a specific type of structure built

706
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,880
into a plant

707
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,240
that

708
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,440
it makes a difference in how the

709
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,839
machines

710
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,159
do their job and so

711
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:55,278
i've been asked to develop a

712
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:57,520
very strict type of plant that uh

713
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,400
accomplishes this for them and so we're

714
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,200
in the

715
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,840
uh they just have gotten the second

716
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,080
series of prototype

717
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,519
target plants to see if they work for

718
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,678
them

719
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,119
the first couple were

720
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
just what they wanted and then they just

721
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,038
wanted to add some different

722
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,960
different components

723
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,440
namely purple

724
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,440
they wanted them purple

725
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,200
wow that's it's some really kind of

726
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,720
specialized breeding do you do that type

727
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,000
of thing a lot

728
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,120
well yeah um as a matter of fact we do

729
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,200
um

730
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,239
that's kind of where

731
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,679
i think

732
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,079
i think there's a couple of different

733
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,399
things that are going to be

734
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,240
crucial for people to keep in mind in

735
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,599
the coming years where the

736
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,880
um

737
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,079
industry is going and and targeted

738
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,559
uh

739
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,879
skills and and

740
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,759
industries like that are going to be

741
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,120
more

742
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:57,119
apt to be around longer um the

743
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,879
the good old days of people just being

744
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,359
able to grow and do

745
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,559
what they want and make but make do with

746
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,079
what that

747
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,319
are basically

748
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,798
going to go away and

749
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,918
it's only going to be the people that

750
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:13,038
really i think having a long history

751
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,080
uh

752
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:15,359
or

753
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,480
are

754
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,240
highly skilled at a specific part of the

755
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,599
industry that are going to be around for

756
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,399
the duration

757
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,038
um big big money's going to eat a lot of

758
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,239
this up it's going to be a problem

759
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,398
um

760
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,839
and so you know

761
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,759
one of the things that

762
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,599
we target is

763
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,798
these specialized

764
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,678
portions

765
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,480
plus

766
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,519
going on the exotic end because that has

767
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,880
mass appeal and we're hopefully going to

768
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,240
target

769
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,480
the mom and pop

770
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,798
who want to grow you know six plants in

771
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,000
the backyard here in california you know

772
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:56,960
we'd like to capture that market as well

773
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,759
um but we have several different avenues

774
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,840
that we are exploring besides

775
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,558
the seed industry the seed industry is

776
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,558
really just a

777
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:10,398
my own

778
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:12,398
specific little thing

779
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,000
just because it's what i enjoy doing i

780
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,959
enjoy manipulating

781
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,079
um yeah and

782
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,399
to that end what i'd like to uh

783
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,879
to try and do is is do more

784
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:28,558
professional breeding for you know the

785
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,880
industry is uh on request uh

786
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,000
you you i don't know whether you guys

787
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,240
know about bps or not but bps is the

788
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,720
black platinum society and

789
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,798
it is um

790
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,880
i i probably the most expensive

791
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,440
um

792
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,919
seed bank company in the world and i i

793
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,480
it is ours and it's an invite only

794
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,240
people can't just join they have to be

795
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,679
invited to join

796
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,200
and it and it's all

797
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,120
private

798
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,278
and

799
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,678
the only thing i can say is is that

800
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,159
probably some of the largest names in

801
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,600
the industry are members

802
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,480
so um

803
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,678
it's we've got that to deal with

804
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,200
um

805
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,919
in this

806
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,679
as well as all the specialized breeding

807
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,278
and all the all the other things that

808
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,519
we're into and going into are also

809
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,599
pretty interesting as well i

810
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,079
i i can keep going and going and going

811
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,918
so you better stop me here

812
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,599
well i mean if we just jump back to a

813
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,840
little reference you made a second ago

814
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,439
about how exotics in general are on the

815
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,199
rise i think what's really interesting

816
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,440
is that the majority of your work would

817
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,200
widely be considered really exotic

818
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,558
really tropical that type of thing do

819
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,720
you think it's just a matter of time

820
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,079
before the masses really pick up on your

821
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,519
strains and run with it because as you

822
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,519
reference it is the current hype

823
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,599
well

824
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,080
here's i'm hoping to give you uh to

825
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,599
actually get ahead of that

826
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,558
i've been trying to work to get ahead of

827
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,398
that

828
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:08,720
um what what we target in is i like to

829
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,278
target the very high end of the scale if

830
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,200
you were to look at liquor i'd like to

831
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,000
be the high-end

832
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,840
liquor you know person that i want to be

833
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,720
that

834
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:20,879
that

835
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,200
i want to be that rolex you know in the

836
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,278
in the and and and i've always strived

837
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,960
to be that way because

838
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,798
i it's important to me to be

839
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,880
there for the customer and give the

840
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,639
customer the ultimate that i can give

841
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,919
them and

842
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,960
because like i said i'm so picky uh

843
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,399
and it's been a real curse actually

844
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,440
um

845
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:48,798
that that really allows me to be able to

846
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,120
focus in really tightly and with that

847
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,319
couple that with the micro breeding that

848
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,199
i do

849
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,480
um

850
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,960
we it it allows me to move and advance

851
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,038
on these things really fast

852
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,360
uh in

853
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:06,079
relation to other people who are you

854
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,199
know doing different styles of breeding

855
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,918
and so i'm hoping to get ahead of all of

856
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,919
this because our

857
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,120
company plans

858
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,679
involve

859
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,959
really go getting into where this

860
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,120
industry is going at least in california

861
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,640
i envision within the next few years

862
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:29,278
you're just going to see large-scale

863
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,080
production and oh

864
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:35,200
a lot of that is going to wipe out the

865
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,960
mom and pop specialty little stuff that

866
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,640
people adore so much

867
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,120
and i don't want to see that happen to

868
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,519
my company and so as a result that's

869
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,759
where we want to try and

870
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,440
partner with large

871
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,359
scale producers and and keep the brand

872
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,759
you know on the high end

873
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,519
for people to be able to get

874
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,599
i've spoken to a few different breeders

875
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,839
about this exact subject you're tapping

876
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,959
on and i guess one of the sentiments

877
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,558
i've heard expressed from a few

878
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,480
different people is that there's always

879
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,639
going to be a demand for the ultra high

880
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,399
end and the presumption is that a lot of

881
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,919
these big corporations are probably not

882
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,158
going to be putting out the absolute

883
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,000
best of the best so with that in mind do

884
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,440
you feel like a black market environment

885
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,278
for that will always be kind of

886
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,080
inevitable and there may be a spot for

887
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,440
these

888
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,879
people who look as though they might be

889
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,038
wiped out if they were willing to go

890
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,760
black market type thing

891
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,038
of course of course you know yeah

892
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,960
there's always going to be that

893
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,319
component i mean there's still a

894
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,038
component in california for moonshine

895
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,720
you're

896
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,720
you could you know

897
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,880
there are people that still make

898
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,519
moonshine in california i mean even to

899
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,760
this day so there's no

900
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,919
there's no reason to think that

901
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:47,679
this is going to quell it

902
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,600
to the

903
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,278
full extent that it

904
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:55,839
that they want to do

905
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:59,200
but what i do feel is is that

906
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:02,398
our industry has the ability at this

907
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,519
early point to manipulate it to the

908
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,798
proper

909
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,719
perspectives and keep everything in line

910
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:12,239
with the way that we want the industry

911
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:14,158
to to evolve and i i think it's just

912
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,158
incumbent upon

913
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,440
individual producers

914
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,599
to you know

915
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,079
show up to their best game

916
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,039
make sure the customer is taken care of

917
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:29,519
make sure that everybody plays by the

918
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:31,199
rules and i i i just think that it's it

919
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,119
because you're going to be able to

920
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,799
manipulate it so much the government's

921
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,079
going to do what it's going to do and

922
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,359
the state's going to do what it's going

923
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,440
to do

924
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,598
and you have to

925
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,559
be light on your feet and be right on

926
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,079
your feet when you do it and it's

927
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,918
just the way it is

928
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,159
so so now you're going to have a

929
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,519
component yeah that is illegal you are

930
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,320
going to have that

931
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,559
but

932
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,559
you know

933
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,519
overall you can still have this

934
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,358
wonderful legal

935
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,079
exotic

936
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:06,639
at the same time and it's done right and

937
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,400
done fair and done beneficially to the

938
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,319
society and that's where we're going

939
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,960
that's what we want

940
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,838
so what would be your advice in terms of

941
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,039
how as a community we can get to the

942
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,679
kind of

943
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,358
uh goal that you're describing whereby

944
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,960
you know there's a self-regulation and

945
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,480
the mom and pops haven't been forced out

946
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,199
like what would be your plan for us to

947
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,519
get there ideally

948
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,159
well i think that that the people need

949
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,239
to speak up they need to make that uh

950
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,000
call to their representatives they need

951
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,479
to make sure that

952
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,039
um their voices are heard as far as that

953
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,800
goes i don't want to see people edged

954
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,320
out i just think that you're looking at

955
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,240
huge money

956
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,200
and you're looking at people with deep

957
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:54,719
pockets who don't care give a damn about

958
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,519
the industry all they see is the green

959
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,439
and

960
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:01,280
those people have a way of of

961
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,760
edging into this

962
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,400
whole thing and and i got you know i i'm

963
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,160
very very cautious of that but i think

964
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,760
the way around that has been shown just

965
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,440
just in the political climate that

966
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,320
you're seeing right now

967
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,240
yeah you're seeing a resistance to that

968
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,400
kind of thinking that that kind of

969
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,639
controlling and i think that that just

970
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,480
needs to transpose on over into this

971
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,440
industry too and we need to keep our

972
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,358
voice heard we need to keep

973
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,720
them understanding that

974
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,598
you're talking

975
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:37,759
about monumental shifts in

976
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,838
in local economies

977
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,000
in some areas i you know i'm in northern

978
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,119
california i know

979
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,079
what

980
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,400
the economy is based on around here and

981
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,280
to disrupt it to the point that they're

982
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,599
talking about disrupting it is going to

983
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,680
be a detrimental thing for a lot of

984
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,680
people it's going to be very scary and

985
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,759
that needs to be worked out that needs

986
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,358
to be taken care of and considered when

987
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,320
they're doing this

988
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,880
so

989
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,880
the the local municipalities and stuff

990
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,720
they have to you know come together on

991
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,000
all this and find a way to work with

992
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,838
these people

993
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,559
and the subject i mean that's that's

994
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,000
just how it has to work out

995
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,400
getting there

996
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,800
i i you know

997
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,880
it all depends on how organized the

998
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,960
voices are

999
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,760
i i think i think if

1000
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,720
and i've railed on this for years

1001
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,599
don't come off like stupid stoners don't

1002
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:36,078
portray yourself in in the hippie garb

1003
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,400
of the old days don't you know be

1004
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,839
professional be smart come off

1005
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,160
intelligent

1006
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,920
and you know don't be the one with a

1007
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,879
bong in your hand when there's people

1008
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,039
are interviewing you on a television for

1009
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,358
a particular issue or whatnot don't be

1010
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,679
that guy you know

1011
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,920
we need to project a new image and it

1012
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,519
needs to be one that you know society is

1013
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,358
going to accept

1014
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,920
you know i used to have really long hair

1015
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,159
and finally it got beaten into me that

1016
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,000
you know what people judge you by what

1017
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,838
you what they see they don't judge you

1018
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,079
by your character

1019
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,838
i finally ended up cutting my hair and

1020
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,119
that's what pop smokers need to do they

1021
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,119
need to uh

1022
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,559
cut their hair

1023
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,320
that's i like that that's a good

1024
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,039
metaphor

1025
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,240
well it works i mean it it is really

1026
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,800
true

1027
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,479
so i mean just with that word of wisdom

1028
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
in mind if we could just jump back to a

1029
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,599
different topic we spoke about i just

1030
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,519
want to touch back in on something you

1031
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,680
mentioned a fair bit earlier you were

1032
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,280
talking about how you harvest gooey at

1033
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,598
different times she's got different

1034
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,680
medical properties something which i had

1035
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,240
recently noticed is

1036
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:46,399
the gui cross c99 crosses that duke

1037
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,000
diamond did some of those phenos

1038
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,480
particularly one that a friend of mine

1039
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,239
has grown quite high in cbd and that was

1040
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,079
a bit of a surprise to me because it

1041
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,719
doesn't seem apparent that there's a ton

1042
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:01,440
of cbd in either of those parents or am

1043
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:04,799
i wrong is the gui cbd rich

1044
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,800
very yeah especially early on

1045
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,079
sure you know

1046
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,119
you're looking at um

1047
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,519
yeah yeah you're looking at a wonderful

1048
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,119
array of things it gets kind of racy at

1049
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,599
that point you know

1050
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:24,240
it's a little racy uh

1051
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,920
early on but it really hits the pain uh

1052
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,799
at that point too

1053
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,599
but then when as it progresses

1054
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,440
the couch lock and the and the and these

1055
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:37,680
sedative qualities really come forward

1056
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,599
and then i noticed that the

1057
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:44,078
um if you let it go a really long time

1058
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,680
and then age it or let it age for you

1059
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,800
know six months in a jar or something

1060
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,838
like that

1061
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,800
yeah the cbd is really predominant and

1062
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:56,639
very nice and very palatable too the the

1063
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,640
flavor changes to this rich

1064
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,240
maltiness that's

1065
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,480
quite intriguing and totally different

1066
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:08,318
from fresh gooey

1067
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,119
fresh gooey is really sweet and tropical

1068
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:15,679
the cured stuff is

1069
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:18,240
a lot more complex and uh i enjoy it too

1070
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,838
so yeah no you you've got a lot of

1071
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,239
really good

1072
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,599
stages and i think that what i always

1073
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,919
recommend to people when they're growing

1074
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,280
gooey is just start picking

1075
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,880
you know early on when when you see uh

1076
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,920
when you see about an eighth of the

1077
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,400
hairs

1078
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,800
on there pick it and try it and see what

1079
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,639
you think and then then as it goes and

1080
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,480
you get half of them are gone you go

1081
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,639
ahead and try it there because usually i

1082
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,639
i'm used to describing this to people

1083
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,920
maybe who have never grown bot before

1084
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,639
and i use the

1085
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,079
the pistols as a as a gauge for them so

1086
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,679
they don't have to think too hard

1087
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,200
because i usually use a loop or a

1088
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,399
microscope

1089
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:56,159
yeah

1090
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,760
so i think something which is

1091
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,199
interesting what you just said there is

1092
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,359
you know just start picking the buds off

1093
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:04,318
at different times in order to do that

1094
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,759
you'd have to be an organic grower right

1095
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,000
yeah you know

1096
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,960
all you're doing is gauging and that i

1097
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,440
mean it's not perfect you know of course

1098
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,358
you can make it better but you're not

1099
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,599
looking for that right then

1100
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,480
see i'm a very purposeful person and

1101
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,400
everything that i do as far as the what

1102
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,599
i'm trying to get done i'm looking for

1103
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,559
an exact thing and in that point i'm

1104
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,200
looking at what the effect is it because

1105
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:34,559
it's a little harsh or whatever is not

1106
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,480
the focus i expect that you can move on

1107
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,880
you know you focus on what you need to

1108
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,280
focus on and not

1109
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,039
try to judge the thing at that point

1110
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,480
because you can go ahead and flush it

1111
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,519
and then

1112
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,039
you know yeah i i would i would think

1113
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,358
that you would already start to be

1114
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,679
flushing at that point anyway

1115
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,679
you know only because you know six and a

1116
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,879
half weeks you're almost there it's time

1117
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,519
to start

1118
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,960
yeah that is true are you what type of

1119
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:05,280
uh nutrient regime juice

1120
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,280
you know

1121
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,039
i i grow every way you can think uh i

1122
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:16,639
use everything and i'm very stingy

1123
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:20,000
because what i try to do is develop

1124
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,759
strains to not need a lot of fertilizer

1125
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,079
and that if you put

1126
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,359
even mom gooey if you try to give her

1127
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,039
too much

1128
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,119
she'll

1129
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,960
she'll reject it and be really pissed

1130
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,519
and you'll be very upset

1131
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,400
so you know i always target

1132
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,759
to try and have strains use as little as

1133
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,000
possible because

1134
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,560
i'm thinking of the customer

1135
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,559
nutrients are expensive let's try and

1136
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,358
make them go as long as you can

1137
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,039
so

1138
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:51,039
there's i always try to breed towards

1139
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,039
responsive plants that don't need a lot

1140
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:57,358
i get a lot of gripe for that actually

1141
00:42:53,039 --> 00:43:00,480
people people are so used to you know

1142
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,318
pumping their plants up and was you know

1143
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,800
if it spread properly towards that you

1144
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:06,800
don't need to do that but i'm not real

1145
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,000
good about getting that info out i guess

1146
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,280
maybe i i need to do more of that

1147
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,039
yeah and it certainly seems like a good

1148
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,359
trade to have

1149
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,960
well i one would think but i get i get a

1150
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,279
lot of grief for it because i think

1151
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,559
people just think that

1152
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,200
it's going to

1153
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,719
produce better and it's not necessarily

1154
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:27,838
true and

1155
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:31,358
also too it is what it is

1156
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,358
if you're trying to you know get

1157
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,920
huge

1158
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,240
thick

1159
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,000
things you can do it but you need a huge

1160
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,039
thick plant in order to have it come

1161
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,880
from you're not going to get it from

1162
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,400
this little bucket

1163
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,519
yeah totally

1164
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,559
i've seen i've seen gooey mom

1165
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,759
with

1166
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,078
um

1167
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,640
that 13 feet tall

1168
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,880
with a top bud

1169
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:58,480
larger than your head

1170
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,240
and with bottom branches as large as a

1171
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,400
man's thigh and six feet out

1172
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,239
it can get huge

1173
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,680
but um

1174
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,679
you know people

1175
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,039
they expect certain things and you know

1176
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:14,719
they go into it with preconceived

1177
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,559
notions so

1178
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,199
um you know we try and

1179
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,639
educate as much as possible but

1180
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,879
sometimes you

1181
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,799
you're surprised i don't know

1182
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,960
i don't know

1183
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,359
no it's a good point i i think another

1184
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,039
thing which just popped into my mind is

1185
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,880
you mentioned that the tie was the last

1186
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,358
thing you crossed into the gui do you

1187
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,039
think that the end result of the gui

1188
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:40,000
does have a lot to do with that like

1189
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:42,079
does the tie account for a lot of it oh

1190
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,199
no i don't know i

1191
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,359
no

1192
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,519
it doesn't account for a lot of it but

1193
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:48,559
it accounts for

1194
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:52,480
the

1195
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:55,440
i think the specific type of high that

1196
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,519
this plant gives you see

1197
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,720
all

1198
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:03,199
i look at i look at resin as a vehicle

1199
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:06,480
and that's why i wanted to build really

1200
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,559
resiny plants with really large glands

1201
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,039
because of course the epidermal layer is

1202
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,920
where the thc is and so i wanted more of

1203
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,318
that epidermal layer on that gland

1204
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,920
and so the bigger the gland the better

1205
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:21,679
off it is and so

1206
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,318
in targeting that

1207
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,559
you can go ahead and then build in

1208
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:29,199
whatever you want

1209
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:31,838
and you've got this huge vehicle

1210
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:34,719
of this huge these huge glands to work

1211
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:37,440
in and so when i did the

1212
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:40,399
and the tie is an interesting story and

1213
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,838
it's a fun story

1214
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,160
this tie

1215
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,519
had washed up on the shores of northern

1216
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,879
california

1217
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,838
in these

1218
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,838
aluminum canisters it was dumped off

1219
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:54,000
offshore and

1220
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:58,559
got discovered and we were able to get

1221
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,039
some of that and it had this most exotic

1222
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:04,639
chocolate thai flavor

1223
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:07,519
there were some really amazing um

1224
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:11,039
sticks that were with that

1225
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:12,239
uh but the best stuff were these flaky

1226
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,119
kind of

1227
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,118
brownish cinnamon

1228
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,838
reddish cinnamon

1229
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,760
thai that had the chocolate

1230
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,920
flavor to it but it also had this really

1231
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,359
bright

1232
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,680
strawberry note to it and that was the

1233
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,719
tie that we used

1234
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:38,159
in gooey and on the very last portion of

1235
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:41,199
it and it it just really finished the

1236
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:44,719
flavor off and gave it that little

1237
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,679
psychedelic edge that i love so much

1238
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,559
uh

1239
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,838
and that that tie was

1240
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,159
it was just a

1241
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,000
uh it was one of those things that you

1242
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,639
remember all your life

1243
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,159
and to be able to smoke gooey and to be

1244
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:02,480
able to go oh there it is it's just a

1245
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,759
wonderful thing

1246
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,400
yeah wow

1247
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,640
i mean you just mentioned the uh the big

1248
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,960
trichome glands which is interesting

1249
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,799
because a lot of people you know kind of

1250
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,960
the more knowledgeable sources have

1251
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,200
traditionally said that your more

1252
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,960
equatorial sativas tend to have thinner

1253
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,279
glands did you find it to be like a bit

1254
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,280
of an uphill battle trying to make them

1255
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,440
thicker or did it come easily

1256
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,000
now you see that's where that you see

1257
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,880
that's where the maui came in because

1258
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,280
the maui i am sure

1259
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:38,000
had pakistani and i think and pakistani

1260
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,519
glands are huge they're they got large

1261
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,519
glands

1262
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,519
and and and

1263
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:44,719
um the tie

1264
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,960
had

1265
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:49,118
man you know they were they were almost

1266
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,358
surface you know almost

1267
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,640
uh without any stock but but just

1268
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,639
fairly

1269
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:59,920
fairly noticeable and very you know

1270
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,679
fairly good size themselves but not as

1271
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,480
big as

1272
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,799
the

1273
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,559
the component that the maui added from

1274
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:13,280
before that oh you know

1275
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:16,160
the cambodian had a nice dusting

1276
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,720
but it wasn't like it was after the maui

1277
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,118
component and i really think that that's

1278
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,838
and it just carried over the tie didn't

1279
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,838
didn't reduce the size it carried into

1280
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,279
it and that's what i mean you use things

1281
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,519
as a vehicle

1282
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,960
and you select for it this

1283
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,358
this plant

1284
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,000
happened to be the only one that

1285
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:39,279
was like this it was a

1286
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,800
the resin that it made was a mutation

1287
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,040
that it was

1288
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,359
easily a third again as resny as

1289
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:48,000
anything else that was in that

1290
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:50,000
at the time and that's why i selected it

1291
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,358
and kept it going and

1292
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,719
you know it's just become such a

1293
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,639
favorite that i've just kept it going

1294
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,318
so i mean you just kind of touched on it

1295
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,558
then when you when you did first pop the

1296
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,880
gooey seeds how many did you pop to find

1297
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:06,800
the mum

1298
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:09,838
that was uh let's see

1299
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,200
that was a long time ago

1300
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,199
and probably

1301
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:20,558
knowing in that in that particular

1302
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:24,880
instance there was a greenhouse

1303
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:27,440
so we had probably maybe 30 plants

1304
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,440
of this going i it was sharing it with

1305
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,200
another

1306
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,200
grower and he had one side of the

1307
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,519
greenhouse i had the other

1308
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,719
and i was

1309
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,719
doing it

1310
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,039
tests and stuff and i had everything in

1311
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,039
pots so that when it came time to do

1312
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,279
seedings and stuff i could move them out

1313
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,519
and not you know get his

1314
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,280
stuff seated because he was not seeding

1315
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,440
anything of his

1316
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,839
so i would i would

1317
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,039
i can't remember exactly numbers because

1318
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:59,119
i don't pay attention to that

1319
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,199
it's just however many females that i

1320
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,838
was going forward through that at the

1321
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:07,039
time and i would guess

1322
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:09,440
from vague memory about 30. and so was

1323
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,639
this before the advent of indoor

1324
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,440
lighting like how did you keep the

1325
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:16,400
strain going at that point oh

1326
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:20,559
oh yeah no this was this was at the very

1327
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,400
beginning stages of that i remember uh

1328
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,839
one of the buying one of these really

1329
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,720
incredibly silly little

1330
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:31,119
hydroponic uh kits and we would just

1331
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,679
use that and root

1332
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,599
cuttings in that because i had a bubbler

1333
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:37,838
in there and it had

1334
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,240
um kind of like i think

1335
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:42,558
kind of like a hydrocorn kind of a thing

1336
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:43,838
it wasn't hydrocorn because that was

1337
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,119
much later

1338
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:46,239
but it had

1339
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,720
something

1340
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,719
you know what it was the old lava rock

1341
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,039
the red lava rock

1342
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,558
that people used to use that was what it

1343
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:55,358
was and we would

1344
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,040
just

1345
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,199
root in that

1346
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:01,759
and keep things going that we like

1347
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,759
because i learned early on that cuttings

1348
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,200
were amazing thing i learned it was

1349
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,559
called cutting a slip back in the day

1350
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,679
and uh taking slips was the way that you

1351
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,519
had

1352
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:16,318
to preserve things and i learned that

1353
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:19,039
that from the old lady who was doing uh

1354
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,239
roses and she was taking slips and then

1355
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:22,800
rooting them

1356
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:25,919
so i thought wow that's interesting then

1357
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,640
i learned how to root with the

1358
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,440
moss on while it's on the plant you know

1359
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:34,719
you wrap it in gauze and moss

1360
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,400
with a rooting compound and you can grow

1361
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:39,598
roots while the plant's still growing

1362
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,358
and then just cut it off and plant it

1363
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,720
that's always a fun trick

1364
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,279
that's certainly something i haven't

1365
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,000
seen done regularly these days

1366
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,640
oh no that and burying the branches you

1367
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,880
know part way having it serpentine

1368
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,719
up and down and then you bury the

1369
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,838
and tie down the things and it grows

1370
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:00,399
roots right there and feeds the the

1371
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:04,000
the branches you can do it that way too

1372
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,079
wow i like doing that on on uh certain

1373
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,880
types of sativas because they do grow

1374
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,039
vine like and and that works out really

1375
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,838
well it feeds the plant and makes for a

1376
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:15,759
lot better meal

1377
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,279
so the last little part of gooey in

1378
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,680
terms of the makeup that we haven't

1379
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,519
spoke about the backstory the cambodia

1380
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,279
how did you get that one

1381
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,358
that came from a

1382
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,519
gentleman who was stationed over in

1383
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:29,039
vietnam at the time and had brought back

1384
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,719
seed

1385
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,480
that he

1386
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:36,159
had with he actually brought back pot

1387
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,760
smuggled it in some way they weren't

1388
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,239
really looking for it back then so he

1389
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,359
had quite a little bit

1390
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,679
and

1391
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,440
he dug some of this out

1392
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,279
when i was

1393
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,519
with a friend of his

1394
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,119
and i happened to notice that he was

1395
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:54,639
just throwing the seeds away and i said

1396
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,400
oh you can i have those he said sure and

1397
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,239
i said can you save

1398
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,960
those seeds that you get off of that for

1399
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,078
me sure so i actually gave him 20 bucks

1400
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,480
and

1401
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:09,119
he saved all the seeds from probably i

1402
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,000
think about three or four ounces

1403
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,920
and i used those to

1404
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,800
find the ones that i wanted and that was

1405
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,240
a really

1406
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,720
spicy

1407
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:22,639
delicious pot just had a really nice

1408
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:25,039
spicy flavor to it i really enjoyed that

1409
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:28,239
i missed that

1410
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:30,400
i miss all of these

1411
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,759
do you think that cambodians kind of one

1412
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,119
of the land races which doesn't get

1413
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,880
enough of a good rap because you don't

1414
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,640
see it come up a lot compared to some of

1415
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,200
the other ones

1416
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,358
you know i'll tell you right now

1417
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,399
all the landers

1418
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,920
you can't hardly trust landers's anymore

1419
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:50,000
anywhere in the world

1420
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,639
uh the days of these types of pot

1421
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,599
are just basically gone either they've

1422
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:58,879
been eradicated they've been torn away

1423
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,400
in drug uh not drug in war

1424
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,880
torn areas

1425
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,880
uh they've been uh

1426
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,960
infiltrated by

1427
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,960
other types of strains that have been

1428
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,400
brought from outside and they've

1429
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,559
polluted the

1430
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,960
the gene pools that way

1431
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,359
it's just a real sad commentary but i

1432
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,960
mean obviously i'm sure there are places

1433
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:22,239
in the world where there are still pure

1434
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,358
lines but

1435
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,399
they are

1436
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:28,400
few and far between and i've

1437
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,639
i'm sure if you talk to bodhi tell you

1438
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,639
the same thing he travels a lot

1439
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:35,358
and he can you know

1440
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:37,920
he can see that there's a uh

1441
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:41,119
a trend that is not not very good

1442
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,838
because people are you know sharing see

1443
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,519
even if you go and you share seed

1444
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:47,838
with somebody you know just out of a

1445
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,400
gesture of kindness you're doing it

1446
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:51,440
a disservice in that area towards this

1447
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,838
end

1448
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,440
and uh you know it's just a sad

1449
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:59,358
commentary so i

1450
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,679
landers anymore are are so

1451
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:05,039
difficult that you really need to

1452
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:06,879
when you acquire one i i can perfectly

1453
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,719
use an example here

1454
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:13,440
uh from the emerald cup uh

1455
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:16,879
badger who works for sub cool

1456
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,200
gave me some seed from a gentleman from

1457
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,838
australia who said that

1458
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,838
he was

1459
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:27,679
growing this stuff that

1460
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:31,358
this is what the aborigines grew

1461
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:31,358
and it was a fourth generation

1462
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:35,838
back cross

1463
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,039
uh

1464
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:39,279
and

1465
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,440
i i don't know anything about it other

1466
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,920
than that the ones that i've got growing

1467
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,559
off of it right now

1468
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,960
are supposed to be landers but

1469
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,519
they have one of them has an autoflower

1470
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,720
under 24 7.

1471
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:57,440
so i'm kind of

1472
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,598
disturbed about that as far as that goes

1473
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,838
it's and i don't know if you've ever

1474
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,838
heard it it's called reindeer syrup

1475
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,880
yeah so anyway

1476
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:12,639
um yeah i i in just using that as a

1477
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,119
fresh example

1478
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,879
uh you know i highly doubt that there's

1479
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,920
flowers like that because this is

1480
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:23,039
supposed to be a 13-week sativa

1481
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:27,599
yeah i would expect that or more

1482
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,679
yeah so so i i i am skeptical at best

1483
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,798
and i use that as an example you just

1484
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:31,759
don't know

1485
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:33,599
um

1486
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,760
especially

1487
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,440
it's almost like the the game telephone

1488
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,280
where you know you send a message around

1489
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,880
the group and it changes by the time it

1490
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,880
gets to the other end

1491
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,920
you just never know anymore what you're

1492
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,960
getting i i stay within

1493
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,680
my gene pool that i have now

1494
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,440
almost exclusively there are a few

1495
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,159
things and i always list them and tell

1496
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,280
people where where and what

1497
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:59,598
um

1498
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,160
i have and what i've used but for the

1499
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,200
most part i i don't use other people's

1500
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,679
work

1501
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:06,798
i just stay away from it

1502
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:08,798
that's interesting because i was going

1503
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,880
to ask you that question like would you

1504
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:12,880
ever consider it at all or it's just a

1505
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,640
no i'm not interested

1506
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,720
oh it's not that i'm not interested it's

1507
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,318
just that i look at it this way and i've

1508
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,639
always said this

1509
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,759
i i want i want the customer to have a

1510
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,558
wide range i i don't want intermixings

1511
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,960
and stuff like that to get in the way of

1512
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:33,680
the customer experience and if the

1513
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:36,559
customer wants an ak-47 to get an ak-47

1514
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:37,679
i don't want to give them an ak-47 times

1515
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,920
mom

1516
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:41,838
because you know that's some of the same

1517
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,159
genetics that they're getting and and

1518
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:48,078
while it may be fine

1519
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,078
and or it may be wonderful who knows

1520
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,680
i guess

1521
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,480
i've always just wanted the customer to

1522
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:59,519
have a wider experience and to blend

1523
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,318
this stuff and muddy it and delude it

1524
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:05,119
uh is not the en not not

1525
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:08,480
something i'm attracted to and i i just

1526
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:11,039
think that that i think it's better that

1527
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,798
if they if the other breeders do that

1528
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:14,798
that that's you know that's what the

1529
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,400
young breeders are for you know that's

1530
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:19,358
what who i'm breeding for it's those

1531
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:22,318
young people coming up who want to do a

1532
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,400
uh a a mix like that i just don't want

1533
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,558
to see people do it by name you know so

1534
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,358
they can have a cool name that that's

1535
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,798
dumb you know that's just dumb

1536
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:33,119
yeah totally

1537
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:35,679
yeah breed for purpose don't breed for

1538
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:38,160
you know stupid stuff like that

1539
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,399
and the other thing too and i'm guilty

1540
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,078
as anybody is is that you know we need

1541
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,880
to start

1542
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,039
um you know putting positive

1543
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,559
connotations to this product and not

1544
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,759
negative ones

1545
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:54,160
yeah no more green crack

1546
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,319
yeah you know i'm like i said i'm guilty

1547
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:57,199
of it you know the double death stuff

1548
00:58:56,318 --> 00:59:00,079
and

1549
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:02,239
uh you know the dementia's edge

1550
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:05,200
i mean it goes on and on

1551
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:07,838
uh you know but

1552
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:10,879
all those things actually had a

1553
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:13,838
a purpose for a point a pointed purpose

1554
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,760
for medical use because like double

1555
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:17,440
death was for actually terminate

1556
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,640
terminally ill people

1557
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,119
to make it a little easier on them

1558
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:25,279
and the dementia was to help sharpen the

1559
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:27,200
brain

1560
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,839
yeah that's interesting because i

1561
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:31,919
actually saw double death uh pop up and

1562
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:33,440
as well as a death grip um i was you

1563
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,280
can't find a lot of information about

1564
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,000
them except for the you know like dark

1565
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,240
related to dark desire what what's the

1566
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,719
makeup of double death and how come

1567
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:44,399
everyone online oh i think what i found

1568
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,838
was someone guessing the lineage online

1569
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,920
but it looked wrong so i was just hoping

1570
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:50,000
to get like a clarification

1571
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,280
well double death is uh is the death

1572
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,960
grip times the gui 96 percent

1573
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,640
there you go yeah the thing i found said

1574
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,679
it was like there was zin and lava in

1575
00:59:56,639 --> 00:59:59,358
there as well i was like that doesn't

1576
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:01,838
sound right

1577
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:04,318
no no they're

1578
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:05,920
what they're probably referring to let's

1579
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:06,880
see

1580
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,920
what

1581
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,920
would that be

1582
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,838
i'm trying to remember oh oh i wonder if

1583
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,760
they're thinking about dark desire

1584
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:23,358
maybe because dark desire has double

1585
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:27,280
death times in times gooey times the uh

1586
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:31,920
the uh african uh which lava was built

1587
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:33,680
from and uh the gui not 84

1588
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,400
from what i remember

1589
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,480
so what was it about the gui 84

1590
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,920
male that made you choose to use it in a

1591
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,199
few different crosses like what stood

1592
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,680
out about it

1593
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:47,919
i missed that mail you know of all the

1594
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:54,078
stages and of all the gui progressions

1595
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:56,159
that male just had everything and i i

1596
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,400
i get focused on different things at

1597
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:02,960
times and i get i should have kept that

1598
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:05,519
male i really miss him he had

1599
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,679
he basically looked like mom

1600
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:08,880
he basically had that really tight

1601
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:11,279
structure

1602
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,960
he had a

1603
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,960
a really great uh

1604
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,000
capacity to put pump out pollen

1605
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,920
and

1606
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,480
his resin content

1607
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,960
you could smoke a bowl of him and

1608
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,358
you just get so stoned

1609
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,400
uh he was he was a real good

1610
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:34,159
a good one the only thing i and i think

1611
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,838
this is what made me

1612
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:38,558
get away from him

1613
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:42,318
was he seemed to pass on

1614
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:45,519
a greater pensions for powdery mildew

1615
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,960
and i was trying to breed away from that

1616
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:49,759
and uh

1617
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,639
the good part about this is is that

1618
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,240
the seeds that i got today

1619
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:55,639
uh

1620
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:57,838
i have the

1621
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:59,038
72 percent

1622
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:00,400
and they

1623
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,960
will

1624
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,960
go to mom and then that will build that

1625
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,960
84 again

1626
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,240
and so we have a chance to be able to

1627
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,240
find

1628
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:13,279
a male that's somewhat like that in that

1629
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:16,719
because he had a lot of body to the to

1630
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:18,480
the to the high that i liked it wasn't

1631
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:21,679
you know all head

1632
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,519
uh it had a i like a balance i like a a

1633
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,759
little bit of each and so

1634
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,400
he had that and that's what we're gonna

1635
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:31,119
target for in this next round

1636
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,798
uh bring those back and uh

1637
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,680
with a lot of uh

1638
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:38,719
of hope and a little bit of luck

1639
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:40,879
we're not going to get away from

1640
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:44,078
producing those seeds on a large scale

1641
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,920
those will be a a fixed entity when i

1642
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,680
find the right ones if i find the right

1643
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,440
ones

1644
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,279
so kind of touching on the issue of

1645
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,960
germinating old seeds do you have any

1646
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,680
techniques for doing that and what's the

1647
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,599
oldest seeds you've ever germinated

1648
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:59,759
oh boy yeah

1649
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:02,000
you know

1650
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,960
i did germinate a couple of seeds that

1651
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,400
were probably 10 years old anything more

1652
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,838
than that

1653
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,798
it's pretty iffy

1654
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:10,078
and

1655
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:13,199
um

1656
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,119
you can try a little gilbrick acid uh

1657
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:16,960
you know like a two or

1658
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,358
four percent

1659
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,519
solution of gabric acid because that'll

1660
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:22,558
be the component that gets lost in the

1661
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,519
age

1662
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,720
and uh soaking them in a solution of

1663
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:28,880
that

1664
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,480
increases the chances of

1665
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,720
being able to come back

1666
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,838
kubrick acid is uh

1667
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:39,519
responsible for that explosive growth

1668
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:42,000
that comes out of a seed when it first

1669
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,838
comes out of the shell and it you know

1670
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,480
it quadruples and

1671
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:49,038
and more in size in an amazingly short

1672
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,760
period of time and that that component

1673
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,760
is

1674
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,079
what's responsible for that

1675
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,520
yeah great advice

1676
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,240
yeah so

1677
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:59,920
and it's readily available online no big

1678
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:02,318
deal

1679
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,559
the other thing about germinating old

1680
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:06,639
seed what another thing that i've found

1681
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:10,079
that can help is to probably stick them

1682
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:11,838
in the refrigerator for a few days

1683
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,519
some people

1684
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,239
have even tried maybe putting them in

1685
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:18,079
the freezer like a deep freeze and then

1686
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:19,038
bring them out and try and germinate

1687
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,519
them there

1688
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,079
um because that kind of simulates a

1689
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:26,880
winter kind of situation and you know

1690
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,960
some strains respond to that

1691
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,079
so it's just a suggestion

1692
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,798
i've heard of that working as well

1693
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,440
so

1694
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:38,159
something i wanted to ask you was seeing

1695
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,880
as you have kind of alluded to hawaii

1696
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:42,798
and the maui was you know some asian and

1697
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,960
some pakistani and whatnot how do you

1698
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:47,199
feel about what would generally be

1699
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,559
regarded as land race hawaiian is that

1700
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:49,759
what it is or is that a different thing

1701
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,839
in your mind

1702
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,760
there's no such thing as land as

1703
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:55,519
hawaiian

1704
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,599
there's no such thing

1705
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:00,400
there's no such thing

1706
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,559
landis's need to be

1707
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,838
inbred in in

1708
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:08,640
microclimated areas for

1709
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:11,519
for generations upon generations in

1710
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:14,239
order to be real landers landis's don't

1711
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:16,880
exist in hawaii everything is important

1712
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:19,439
um everything that you see in hawaii

1713
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,400
from pineapples to the trees to

1714
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:25,519
everything in hawaii is imported and so

1715
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,000
there are no such there is no such thing

1716
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:29,679
now there are

1717
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,559
long-standing strains

1718
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:34,480
that you can find in hawaii but even a

1719
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,519
lot of those have disappeared over the

1720
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,039
years

1721
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:39,759
uh due to

1722
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,160
you know just the raids and and and you

1723
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,960
know growers dying off and

1724
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,879
uh you know all kinds of stuff uh

1725
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,039
but no there are no such things as

1726
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,559
landorus hawaiians

1727
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,359
okay yeah

1728
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:53,039
so

1729
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,719
another quick little pop question i

1730
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,400
wanted to ask was the gui has got to be

1731
01:05:54,719 --> 01:06:01,318
one of the oldest clones i've ever heard

1732
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,318
of what's the oldest clone you know of

1733
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,318
uh

1734
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,440
hmm

1735
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:16,639
i don't know

1736
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:19,519
i

1737
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,798
have to hold the muse on that

1738
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,038
there's been so

1739
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:26,480
there's been you know there's been so

1740
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,480
much over the years i i

1741
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:29,920
uh

1742
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,440
hmm

1743
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,440
yeah let's get back to that one here

1744
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,119
i'll have to think about that

1745
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,519
yeah too easy

1746
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:39,440
so zinn is another one to me which has

1747
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:41,519
got an extremely interesting makeup most

1748
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,880
because it's such a wide eclectic pool

1749
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,199
of genetics

1750
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,798
why was there so many kind of different

1751
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:48,318
parents like did you just kind of keep

1752
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,159
working until you felt it was finished

1753
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,199
and that's kind of why

1754
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:53,199
well

1755
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,798
you know

1756
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:57,759
zinn

1757
01:06:54,798 --> 01:07:00,480
you know it it really all started with

1758
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:03,359
i was pissed off at soma

1759
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,480
uh as far as the rock bud

1760
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,880
the way that

1761
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,960
it was so inconsistent

1762
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:13,599
and uh i i i just

1763
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:16,000
needed to work on that so i hit it with

1764
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:18,160
gooey uh with

1765
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,239
with with a male gui

1766
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:22,639
back then it probably would have been a

1767
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:25,919
50 50. um

1768
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:30,000
that was probably the first

1769
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,000
attempt at at uh starting in on on the

1770
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,440
goo cubing so

1771
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,838
back then that would that would have

1772
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,119
been it so um

1773
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:39,679
i hit

1774
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,519
the only

1775
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:43,199
halfway decent

1776
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:46,159
rock bud

1777
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:48,558
from soma that i i could find in

1778
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:49,920
like two packs

1779
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:53,680
and

1780
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:56,639
at the time i also had a sub

1781
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:58,719
uh had sent me some uh

1782
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:02,639
seeds that he was getting ready to sell

1783
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:04,000
the the the uh sputnik 1.0

1784
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:07,199
i uh

1785
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,719
sub cool and i basically started

1786
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:15,759
breed bay a long long long time ago with

1787
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,759
pistols and and doc bob and

1788
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,440
we were among the very very first people

1789
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,158
to sign up

1790
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:24,719
and so we have a long

1791
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:26,960
relation even though we have radically

1792
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,838
different breeding techniques

1793
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,158
um

1794
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:33,439
and so i had tried some of that and

1795
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:37,759
there was one pheno in there that

1796
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:40,238
oddly enough didn't express any color

1797
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:43,838
but was a nice flavor i enjoyed the

1798
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:43,838
flavor and and so i hit

1799
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,798
a male from that group

1800
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,839
that i thought

1801
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:53,838
was pretty close to the female that i

1802
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:57,039
liked and uh

1803
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,920
hit a gooey mom with that

1804
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:00,560
and

1805
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,880
that really kind of seemed to to be a

1806
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,880
nice

1807
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:08,798
segue into the into the

1808
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,039
rock bud you know because the rock bug

1809
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:12,158
was able to stay pronounced and pretty

1810
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,399
hard

1811
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,960
um

1812
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:18,639
and then i went ahead and i used

1813
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,798
something that was

1814
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,560
given to me was called a very berry

1815
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:26,000
surprise

1816
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:28,319
and very very surprised i had

1817
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,079
a mail from that i used on

1818
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:33,359
gooey as well

1819
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:36,479
and i put that into that mix

1820
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,400
and then the whole last component after

1821
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,879
that was the

1822
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,358
84

1823
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:46,640
percent male gooey

1824
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:49,359
and it it and it culminated in this

1825
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,759
purple bud that that really none of the

1826
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,838
other things that expressed but i had to

1827
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,560
think it came from the

1828
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:58,238
the sputnik

1829
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,400
yeah okay

1830
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:02,799
you know it could have been the

1831
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:06,079
the very very surprise but i i never saw

1832
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,520
any plants that expressed color in that

1833
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:11,039
so um

1834
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,840
but i know that the sputnik had had a

1835
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:15,439
a purple component in the genetics and

1836
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,800
it just came out in that particular

1837
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:19,519
pheno

1838
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,119
and uh boy that was yeah i got i

1839
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,960
actually got rid of

1840
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:28,399
zinn and i did away with it because

1841
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:32,880
over time genetically it

1842
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:35,519
starts to have recessive stuff come out

1843
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,880
that i don't like and uh one of them is

1844
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,840
hermaphroditism

1845
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,840
it comes out about the fourth generation

1846
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:45,039
in certain

1847
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,400
mixes you know in certain uh when people

1848
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:49,279
are trying to grow

1849
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:51,198
and even even within my strains if you

1850
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:53,039
mix it with certain things like you know

1851
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:53,759
tyburn fairs or something like that it's

1852
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:55,198
gonna

1853
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,679
it's going to

1854
01:10:55,198 --> 01:11:01,119
give you a hermaphrodite city it's awful

1855
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:02,880
like that so i i aced it out

1856
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,399
um because i don't want that in the

1857
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,480
genetic pool

1858
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:07,839
but people love the earlier stuff and as

1859
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:08,799
long as they you know

1860
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,960
you know

1861
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,679
are growing those things out

1862
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,760
and

1863
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:16,319
testing their work

1864
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,119
they'll be able to screen that stuff out

1865
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:19,119
and so uh

1866
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:24,158
we allow the ones that exist now to be

1867
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,360
out there but that's it

1868
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:27,198
yeah okay

1869
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:28,880
so the very very surprise that's an

1870
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:30,879
interesting one you briefly touched on

1871
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,640
it it's not very well documented what is

1872
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,920
your speculation as to the genetics of

1873
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,119
it

1874
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,158
i really don't know i grew it for two

1875
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:43,439
years and it had some

1876
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:46,158
a wide range of phenotypes but the most

1877
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:47,678
desirable ones were

1878
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:51,039
pretty much uh

1879
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:53,199
uh expressed in kind of a sativa fashion

1880
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,479
with a nice full

1881
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:59,279
bud structure and a very sweet nice

1882
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:01,039
smell that i enjoyed never saw a color

1883
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:04,000
though um

1884
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:06,479
and i think anything that is named berry

1885
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,719
needs to be colored like a berry that's

1886
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:10,238
just me

1887
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,319
that makes sense

1888
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,359
so if we just jump over to lava for a

1889
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:14,479
second

1890
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:16,639
um

1891
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:18,639
why did you make that one and we were

1892
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,640
looking to make it purposely or was it

1893
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,679
kind of a bit of an accident

1894
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,360
oh here's what when la

1895
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:28,480
the the original

1896
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:30,479
african excuse me hold on hmm

1897
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:33,279
entertain your drink

1898
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,238
the lava uh african

1899
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,359
is

1900
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:36,399
um

1901
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:40,238
really

1902
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:43,119
it's a really exotic tasting plant i i i

1903
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:45,359
like i love the color color

1904
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:48,079
was really dark when i saw

1905
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:49,439
the small amount of examples that i saw

1906
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:52,719
of it

1907
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:54,158
but the seed that i got from it

1908
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,079
um

1909
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:58,319
when i grew it

1910
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,600
every single thing was purple on the

1911
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,079
plant even

1912
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,600
with a really dark expression to the

1913
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:06,158
leaves

1914
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:09,520
here in northern california it was they

1915
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:10,879
were green but they had this dark look

1916
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,600
to them that was different than that

1917
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,279
like an indica look uh to it and then

1918
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,480
when they flowered

1919
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:20,158
the the deep purple that it had was just

1920
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:24,479
awe-inspiring

1921
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:27,359
and it and the high was crap

1922
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,000
and i knew that going in because i had

1923
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,119
tried some of this stuff before but it

1924
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,439
the high was

1925
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,760
it was just crap but i didn't care

1926
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,678
because that can be fixed

1927
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,640
i i just wanted that component of the

1928
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,880
color

1929
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,560
and so um

1930
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,920
i mixed

1931
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,600
that

1932
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,600
and with an old indica that

1933
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,120
it was just it was just a gorgeous

1934
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,320
indica uh

1935
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,319
and

1936
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:55,519
there was also a hawaiian part of it

1937
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,319
that

1938
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,120
this

1939
01:13:56,319 --> 01:14:01,439
gentleman friend of mine that

1940
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:02,479
grew this beautiful

1941
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,439
i want

1942
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:07,039
the closest thing i would say is like a

1943
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:10,079
kawhi electric

1944
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:12,399
kind of a a a a plant although that

1945
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:15,119
wasn't it it was just something that he

1946
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:17,119
had grown himself over on the islands

1947
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:19,039
which is what i like is is you know

1948
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,640
little stuff that people don't get

1949
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:21,439
released and stuff

1950
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,880
uh

1951
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:27,599
that got added in with this old indica

1952
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:31,119
that used to be um

1953
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,039
illegal when i i got a hold of the seed

1954
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:34,719
here in california before they made

1955
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:36,640
indica is illegal

1956
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:40,000
uh it was called the

1957
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,840
cabbage bud and it looked like cabbage

1958
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,719
it didn't have a lot of structure to the

1959
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:48,560
bud and stuff it was mostly leaf but it

1960
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:51,920
was just crusted as all get out with

1961
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,039
this incredibly skunky

1962
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,960
smelling

1963
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:57,679
just really whoo

1964
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,840
it was it was something it was a fun fun

1965
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,840
plant and i had that for many many many

1966
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,279
many many many many years

1967
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,319
and i used

1968
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:05,279
the

1969
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,399
um

1970
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:11,439
a male from the african on that

1971
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:13,279
and then i added the hawaiian in last on

1972
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:14,719
that and

1973
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,000
lava

1974
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,560
i wanted

1975
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,039
to make was actually almost exclusively

1976
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,760
for the hawaiian market i sent that

1977
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:26,238
back and and my uh

1978
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,280
my uh honolulu rep

1979
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:29,519
um

1980
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:30,639
had rights over that for a long time and

1981
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,920
had

1982
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,840
uh

1983
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,800
many islanders grew that because it

1984
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:39,520
purples up no matter what and it really

1985
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,600
was a a big hit over there because they

1986
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:45,520
loved it because i had the uh

1987
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:48,800
the um photograph you know

1988
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,000
look and it also had this exotic taste

1989
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,840
that

1990
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,119
i kind of looked like a moroccan spice

1991
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,279
bizarre

1992
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:00,399
kind of thing

1993
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:02,319
to it that everybody just really enjoyed

1994
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:05,279
and uh yeah i still

1995
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:07,359
i still enjoy some of the types of lavas

1996
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:10,000
i'm working with some lavas that i'll

1997
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:12,479
bring out later on that kind of build on

1998
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,880
that more and bring more of that out

1999
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:18,238
to the foreground uh even more than lava

2000
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,480
did but yeah that was uh

2001
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:24,479
that was something that

2002
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:27,759
i i i of course the the

2003
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:30,559
thc levels were you know in the middle

2004
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,800
but i could build on that and make it

2005
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,320
it uh much better and so

2006
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,800
we're working on that and we're going to

2007
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:38,399
bring those those old favorites back to

2008
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,239
goo thunder as well

2009
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:42,079
wow that's really exciting and something

2010
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:43,519
to look forward to you mentioned the

2011
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:45,119
purple and how you know it's really

2012
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,320
pronounced in that one i remember

2013
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:48,000
reading an article you wrote you

2014
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:50,000
discussed how you bred the dark desire

2015
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,640
as an attempt to breed a better purple

2016
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,319
strain what to you is a better purple

2017
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,280
strain is it just an aesthetic thing or

2018
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:58,960
is it more of like in the medical sense

2019
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,198
no well

2020
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,119
there are several components to that of

2021
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:05,599
course the medical sense

2022
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:08,238
is first and foremost and i've given

2023
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,600
a number of my purple

2024
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:12,238
lines to

2025
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,360
researchers who are back east

2026
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,439
i

2027
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:16,960
don't want to really expose them or

2028
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,879
anything like that because they're

2029
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,719
they're working kind of you know

2030
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,359
underground but they are actual real

2031
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:25,679
researchers who are uh

2032
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,759
exploring the components of the

2033
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:30,399
the uh

2034
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:32,800
the antioxidant qualities that come from

2035
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,719
that and what their

2036
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,520
what their interplay is when we're

2037
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:39,760
smoking them uh i i have a

2038
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,480
an inkling and i've gotten

2039
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,480
you know some

2040
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:49,279
vestiges of of of them saying yes

2041
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,400
i think what you're on to is right and

2042
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:52,960
uh

2043
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:54,799
we're excited for that because

2044
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:58,119
um

2045
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,119
the anti-inflammatory

2046
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:01,919
things that it brings to the table

2047
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,600
really you know are

2048
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,199
key when you're smoking you know that's

2049
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,520
you're causing inflammation to your

2050
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:09,919
lungs so if there's another key

2051
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:12,080
component to smoking purples that

2052
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,119
fights that inflammation i think that

2053
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:14,960
that's a

2054
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,640
incredible plus

2055
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,880
and needs to be explored more and that's

2056
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:21,760
what's exactly what they're doing

2057
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:24,719
so we're excited about that

2058
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:26,640
and i work towards that but also too of

2059
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,520
course it's aesthetically there i mean

2060
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,199
people

2061
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,880
look at that and go wow that's pretty

2062
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:32,000
i'd like to try that

2063
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,000
but

2064
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,800
my biggest thing in the past has been

2065
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,800
that people

2066
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:42,480
smoke purples and

2067
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:45,678
and it has this musty flavor of the

2068
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:48,000
the purple component itself the actual

2069
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,279
chemical has a taste

2070
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,479
and

2071
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:54,559
if it's not masked and overridden it

2072
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:57,359
it's not palatable it's not very good at

2073
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:59,679
all and so what what

2074
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:03,119
i have always strived to do is to build

2075
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:06,560
in a much more flavorful component and i

2076
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:08,719
think that when people start

2077
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,039
getting more exposure to stuff like

2078
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,880
midnight snow and those crosses right

2079
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:16,238
there they're going to be overwhelmed

2080
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:18,000
with how much purples can taste uh

2081
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:20,319
different than what they're probably

2082
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,679
used to or exposed to in traditional

2083
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:27,759
purple lines so we're always excited to

2084
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:30,399
do that but oh yeah i i i love midnight

2085
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,840
snow it's just delicious

2086
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,359
it certainly seems to be one of the

2087
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:36,000
newer ones which i don't think the

2088
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:38,000
public have fully picked up on yet do

2089
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,079
you attribute that to just you know he's

2090
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,640
just kind of not out there yet or do you

2091
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:45,119
want to kind of push it a bit more

2092
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,320
oh no there's more work i want to do but

2093
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:48,719
here's the deal

2094
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:51,039
i've purposefully kept

2095
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,198
this market of mine

2096
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,279
very limited for a very

2097
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:57,759
simple reason of

2098
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,840
future marketing

2099
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,079
the more that you you know

2100
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,000
i could release seeds at a number of

2101
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:06,238
places and you've seen that they've been

2102
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,880
in attitude before and they've been

2103
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,079
at other seed banks before and right now

2104
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,800
they're at

2105
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,279
um

2106
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:18,560
[Music]

2107
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:19,920
a james bean seed company the jbc.com

2108
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,920
and that's the

2109
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,840
about the only place right now other

2110
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:26,719
than my private reps

2111
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,760
and uh the vps folks that are getting

2112
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,560
seed

2113
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,280
and that's by design because i like i

2114
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,320
said i want to be able to hook myself

2115
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,639
into the

2116
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:39,759
larger production market

2117
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:43,119
and part of that is creating

2118
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,199
quite frankly a a high-end product that

2119
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:46,880
you can't get a hold of readily it's

2120
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:48,319
it's hard

2121
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,199
and that just

2122
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:50,079
keeps

2123
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:52,638
you know

2124
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:53,600
that status and that's where i want to

2125
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,440
be

2126
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,960
uh doesn't mean i don't want everybody

2127
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:59,039
to have it

2128
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,439
it's just that up until

2129
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:03,679
you know now this is how i built the

2130
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,839
product to be

2131
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,440
yeah and i understand that so just

2132
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,119
referencing back to the article i

2133
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:11,119
mentioned where you spoke about breeding

2134
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:12,800
the dark desire for the proper purple i

2135
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,800
think a little later in that article i

2136
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,199
you said something along the lines of

2137
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,880
non-true genetic purples generally occur

2138
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:20,158
due to like the cold maybe a few other

2139
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,920
little factors

2140
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:23,439
but this isn't quite the case with your

2141
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,039
ones which are like the true purple it

2142
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:29,039
got me thinking what do you think are

2143
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:30,719
the mechanisms which make that occur

2144
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:32,238
oh you mean as far as

2145
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,000
as

2146
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:36,079
the other ways other than being

2147
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,079
genetically built in

2148
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:40,158
no no for so like traditionally people

2149
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:41,920
would argue that the cold induces purple

2150
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,920
but your lions would argue that that's

2151
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,440
not exclusively the only way so i'm kind

2152
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,880
of thinking well if it's not the cold

2153
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:50,319
like what what does do it

2154
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,079
i think you even reference something

2155
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:54,000
along the lines of like slower movement

2156
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,000
of carbohydrates

2157
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,079
oh yeah well as far as the sugars and

2158
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,079
stuff moving as far but those are that's

2159
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:03,359
what that's what happens in the in the

2160
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:05,359
fall and winter but for i i i i

2161
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,279
reference trees like a maple tree or

2162
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:10,639
something like that when when those

2163
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:13,920
things stop moving through the the um

2164
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:16,639
the plant then these pigments come out

2165
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,000
that's they're always there it's just

2166
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,359
that they're always masked by

2167
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,920
chlorophyll

2168
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:24,319
and and and and now all of a sudden

2169
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,639
without the the chlorophyll in the in

2170
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:30,719
the mix all of a sudden they're visible

2171
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:33,359
and that's just basically what happens

2172
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,359
that's with a cold induced thing it's

2173
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:39,439
things are moving slower in the plant

2174
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:40,960
and and you're not able to uh to express

2175
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:42,879
those uh

2176
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,000
it's just a different time of the year

2177
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,840
you know

2178
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,079
it's just their cycle they're going

2179
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,119
through it and it's the same thing with

2180
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,079
pot

2181
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:54,399
uh some strains don't purple at all they

2182
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,319
never will no matter how cold it gets

2183
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:58,879
they'll just stay green

2184
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,479
there's others that have this pensions

2185
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,319
for

2186
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:04,319
the

2187
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,319
sugars moving slower through the plant

2188
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:08,158
and as a result the chlorophyll doesn't

2189
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:09,920
get moved and

2190
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:12,879
they start to die off and as a result

2191
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,920
they express these purples

2192
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,239
then there's

2193
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:19,039
my type of purples which

2194
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:23,439
are genetic mutation that

2195
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:25,920
probably was developed in response to

2196
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:28,158
high levels of

2197
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,079
uv exposure

2198
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:31,839
it was just another way of protecting

2199
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:35,198
the plant

2200
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:37,440
much like resin uh in high altitude uh

2201
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:39,039
things that's it's speculated that

2202
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:40,719
that's why the plant developed it

2203
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:42,319
initially

2204
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,198
and then other

2205
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:45,759
other

2206
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:46,960
theories come into play like you know

2207
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,039
insect

2208
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,000
deterrence and whatnot

2209
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:51,920
uh

2210
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
i one would argue that

2211
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,520
the plant kind of hooked on to human

2212
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,920
nature

2213
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,320
long ago and probably built itself

2214
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:02,239
around us more than anything since we do

2215
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:05,119
have receptors in the brain that are

2216
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:05,119
just for that

2217
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:09,599
yeah

2218
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:11,198
so just finally referencing back to that

2219
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,280
article one last time well not really

2220
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:14,879
that one specifically but in general do

2221
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:16,158
you plan to do more articles going

2222
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,079
forward because it feels like they're

2223
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:20,399
quite informative the community seems to

2224
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:22,639
engage quite well with them

2225
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:22,638
i

2226
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:27,439
you know i don't i

2227
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,079
i don't know

2228
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:32,479
i am what i am trying to do right now is

2229
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:33,359
i'm in the beginnings of writing a book

2230
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:36,399
about

2231
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:38,639
my particular method of breeding

2232
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:41,198
because i think it's a good time to

2233
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:43,359
bring this out to keep people

2234
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:44,479
on the straight and narrow the only

2235
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:47,519
problem

2236
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,519
mine's a numbers game and it's really is

2237
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,360
truly a numbers game but there's ways to

2238
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:53,040
manipulate that

2239
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:55,198
uh that i would like to share with

2240
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:56,880
people so that they can do this and

2241
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,439
ultimately this can be used in an

2242
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,600
industrial setting but uh you know other

2243
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:04,079
than that i really haven't

2244
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,039
even been approached

2245
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,439
other

2246
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:09,840
other folks that are skilled with

2247
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:12,960
photographers uh you know

2248
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:15,360
skills and stuff like that have have uh

2249
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,639
presented my work very

2250
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,119
eloquently

2251
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:22,400
in magazines and that's about the extent

2252
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:23,279
of the exposure that that's gotten but

2253
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:25,599
you know

2254
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:28,559
god bless them and and that's fine and i

2255
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:31,600
of course i would do more i'm really

2256
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,600
really hoping that

2257
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:36,158
i can advance

2258
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:39,119
this brand here uh with the laws

2259
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:40,479
changing the way they have in california

2260
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:42,880
it's made this

2261
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:45,279
much more complicated and what i'm

2262
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:48,079
hoping to

2263
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:51,119
that will come about is that i can

2264
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:53,439
partner with some individuals who've got

2265
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:55,760
facilities and we can

2266
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,919
move the brand forward at that

2267
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,880
at that rate a little faster than what i

2268
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,480
can do on my own with just my company

2269
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,000
alone

2270
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:07,279
yeah um

2271
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,840
yeah it's it's it's an interesting time

2272
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:11,599
so i guess maybe an interesting question

2273
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,679
then would be for someone who's just

2274
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,840
starting out what would be your advice

2275
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:18,000
to kind of the aspiring breeders like

2276
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,440
without necessarily giving in to what

2277
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,279
you referenced earlier where you're just

2278
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:22,799
making a whole bunch of you know f1

2279
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:23,920
hybrids with not a lot of intended

2280
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,600
purpose

2281
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,760
no see that's the whole thing that's

2282
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:31,199
what i want people to not do i want

2283
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:33,039
people to start focusing in on targets i

2284
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:34,879
want them to pick a target i want them

2285
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,639
to understand

2286
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,480
their

2287
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,199
parent plants

2288
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:42,319
before they do any breeding you should

2289
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:45,839
know

2290
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:48,158
that plant inside and out and that means

2291
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:51,440
growing it more than once

2292
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:54,479
that means growing it in more than one

2293
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:56,879
fashion and in one situation and putting

2294
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:58,638
it through stresses everything that we

2295
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,960
do is

2296
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:03,039
is has goes through a lot of different

2297
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,039
steps before it ever hits

2298
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:06,880
the market because

2299
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,639
you need to know these answers you need

2300
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,800
to be able to tell people what's going

2301
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,760
on and you need to be able to

2302
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,440
understand the pitfalls that then you

2303
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,840
can give them to be able to make sure

2304
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:20,319
that they don't have a problem

2305
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:22,719
everything that i grow

2306
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:24,719
is based in

2307
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:28,719
the way that i describe everything that

2308
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:29,520
i describe is based on a one gallon pot

2309
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:30,880
with

2310
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,480
potting soil

2311
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,039
water

2312
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:37,519
and that's it maybe a little cow crap

2313
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,600
and that is it

2314
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:42,400
that's how you get a base standard

2315
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:44,239
because i always gear myself in my

2316
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:46,799
instructions for the

2317
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:48,718
beginning grower who's never had a seed

2318
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,840
in the ground before

2319
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,000
and

2320
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:55,199
everything that everybody sees is kind

2321
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,920
of based off of that

2322
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:59,919
yeah i get what you mean so i guess

2323
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,199
how do you feel about

2324
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,760
breeders who

2325
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:06,479
put out seeds without testing them not

2326
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,239
not so much that in itself but more so

2327
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,559
when people get asked about that these

2328
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:12,479
days they'll say yeah but the market

2329
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:15,120
just moves so fast these days you can't

2330
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:18,638
test it like there's not enough time

2331
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:21,279
well no no no and that's not and in my

2332
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:23,279
life that's not proper breeding

2333
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:25,759
i'm sorry you can call yourself a

2334
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:29,039
breeder you can you can throw pollen

2335
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:31,360
around sell seed and you can you know a

2336
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:34,479
clock is always right

2337
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:37,920
twice a day even if it's broken it's

2338
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:40,000
right twice a day but that doesn't give

2339
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,560
people a license to be

2340
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,279
called a breeder a breeder is someone

2341
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,840
who

2342
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:49,759
picks a goal

2343
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:51,920
designs to that goal meets that goal

2344
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:55,600
tests that goal to ensure that

2345
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,880
subsequent breeding with that

2346
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,360
is okay

2347
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,520
and doesn't have a little built-in time

2348
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:03,599
bomb

2349
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:06,320
and then you release it to the public

2350
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,239
because it and it also it really also

2351
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:09,279
depends upon the market that you're

2352
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,919
going for

2353
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:14,000
again i that's my mindset because i'm

2354
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:16,480
breeding for breeders i'm not

2355
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
most of the people that buy my work

2356
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:20,638
aren't

2357
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,319
mom and pops growing in the backyard

2358
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,319
they're people with a purpose they're

2359
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:25,679
doing it for a reason either it's for

2360
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:28,799
production

2361
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:30,000
or it's for further breeding they've got

2362
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,039
an idea

2363
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,920
and

2364
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:34,639
so

2365
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,158
in my mindset it has to be the way that

2366
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:37,600
i just said

2367
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:38,799
now if you're just a

2368
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,000
you know

2369
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,840
providing seed for folks and stuff and

2370
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
you're not trying to sell them pie in

2371
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,760
the sky websites with all these

2372
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,880
beautiful pictures and oh my god and

2373
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,719
then you grow it it doesn't look

2374
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:55,520
anything like that

2375
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:57,359
then uh then no i i'm against that and

2376
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,280
you're always gonna have the bad apples

2377
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:01,198
what are you gonna do

2378
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:03,198
i just think that it's better to be an

2379
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:04,238
example that people want to go by but

2380
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:05,839
then to

2381
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:08,079
be an example of

2382
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:10,560
somebody that ripped somebody off and

2383
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:13,119
you're scorned and

2384
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,719
and that that's a short-lived life right

2385
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:16,559
there what

2386
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:18,079
what good is that you saw you make a

2387
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,840
couple of bucks

2388
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,359
it doesn't last

2389
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:24,639
yeah

2390
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:24,639
that's just not the way we do it

2391
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,760
so i guess on the opposite end of the

2392
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:29,359
spectrum who are some of the breeders

2393
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,440
whose work you know you're really fond

2394
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:32,719
of and and i guess you would be willing

2395
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:35,839
to recommend to other people if they

2396
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:37,520
wanted stuff outside of your lines

2397
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:40,159
well um

2398
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:42,239
of course north star genetics i really

2399
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:43,519
am proud of because of course they use

2400
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:44,879
my work

2401
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,239
in some of their stuff but they also

2402
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,840
have their own

2403
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:53,279
uh distinct ideas and and they breed

2404
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:55,520
much the same way as i do very very very

2405
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:58,079
well tested and and

2406
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:00,000
i enjoyed their attitude

2407
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:03,760
uh

2408
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,279
i like bodhi's attitude i i i have to

2409
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,600
really admit

2410
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:09,439
i don't grow a lot of other people's

2411
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:12,400
stuff um

2412
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:15,759
the stuff that i do tend to grow

2413
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:17,519
more than anything is uh

2414
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,520
these little

2415
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,719
nobody's ever heard nobody will ever

2416
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,800
hear

2417
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,719
kind of people that have got something

2418
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,000
that they've demonstrated to me is

2419
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,760
interesting that

2420
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,399
that i want to follow through and see if

2421
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:32,800
i can either replicate or if it was just

2422
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:34,479
a fluky thing or whatever those are the

2423
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:38,719
kind of things that usually get my

2424
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:42,559
outside attention other than that i have

2425
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:44,639
years of backlogged seed that still need

2426
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,679
to be tested gone through

2427
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,520
and

2428
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:49,440
cataloged and stuff and so i really

2429
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,840
don't have time for

2430
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:55,678
to enjoy other people's work the way

2431
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:55,679
that i should er er

2432
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:02,399
i i just i i of the stuff that i have

2433
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:04,800
tried from other folks i get a little

2434
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:07,759
frustrated with how much it tastes the

2435
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,719
same as other people's and there's not a

2436
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,560
lot of distinction to a lot of it

2437
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,079
every now and then i'll try something

2438
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,320
from somebody that has a lot of

2439
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:19,039
distinction to it and i um that's

2440
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:20,880
interesting and then i feel good about

2441
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:22,719
that that that's another choice for the

2442
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,880
customer to have

2443
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:26,880
but i really you know i've got to

2444
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:29,119
confess that i don't have a lot of

2445
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:32,560
exposure with other people's work these

2446
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:34,960
days i got so frustrated with it

2447
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,080
back in the day

2448
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,319
and

2449
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:39,439
i didn't see a lot of testing with

2450
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:42,319
people

2451
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:44,319
doing that work and i started to harp on

2452
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:45,519
breeders all the time and calling them

2453
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:47,519
to the carpet

2454
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,280
and there's people that are no longer

2455
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,360
around because of

2456
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:53,439
people like me you know voicing my

2457
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:55,279
opinion about hey look

2458
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:56,638
you need to know your before your

2459
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:58,719
gets out there because people are

2460
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,319
spending real money

2461
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:02,800
and they're you know they're they're

2462
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:04,719
spending a lot of months

2463
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,279
hoping that this is going to work out

2464
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:08,880
for them only to be disappointed that's

2465
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:10,559
not right

2466
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,719
yeah yeah so

2467
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,800
that's just that's how i look at it and

2468
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:17,359
i always tell young breeders

2469
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:19,679
get a target

2470
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:22,079
don't

2471
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:24,158
not know what you're doing as far as

2472
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:26,639
what you're breeding with know it inside

2473
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:29,198
and out and then be honest with the

2474
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:31,840
people and be helpful be

2475
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:31,839
be um

2476
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:36,559
giving more than anything else be giving

2477
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,440
don't

2478
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:42,159
don't depend upon every little sale to

2479
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:43,599
of 10 pack of seed

2480
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,359
that that's it and then your

2481
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,360
responsibility ends as soon as the

2482
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:48,639
customer has it in their hand no that's

2483
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:51,119
not right

2484
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:52,560
carry them through when they're grinning

2485
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,039
with the whole

2486
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,920
beautiful plant standing before them

2487
01:33:55,039 --> 01:33:58,880
that they just can't wait to dry and

2488
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,880
smoke

2489
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,880
then then you can smile and say okay i

2490
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,480
did a good job

2491
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,639
especially when they after they dry and

2492
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:09,359
they smoke and they go oh my gosh

2493
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:11,840
that's that's the real the real gift

2494
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:13,839
from god that's that's the best thing

2495
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,360
you can have

2496
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,880
and i look forward to that more than

2497
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:19,198
anything

2498
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,039
so do you feel like in general maybe the

2499
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:23,279
onus on breeders to take that customer

2500
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:26,960
service to the next level needs to kind

2501
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:29,599
of increase to match the times we're in

2502
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:32,079
in this day and age especially what's

2503
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,880
going to set you apart from joe blow i

2504
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:35,039
mean

2505
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,279
now all the days all he needs this fancy

2506
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:39,279
website you know

2507
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:43,198
you can post a gazillion pictures just

2508
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:45,519
stole all over the place and and

2509
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:47,039
you know you just gotta

2510
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,000
no be

2511
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:48,960
be

2512
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,719
that

2513
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,639
person that they want to call on for

2514
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:55,600
their genetic needs

2515
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:57,039
just just work towards that end and it

2516
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,600
you know what it's not going to happen

2517
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:01,118
overnight breeding is not

2518
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,840
it's taken me

2519
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:06,799
my whole life

2520
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:10,000
to get this far

2521
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:13,920
and there's still a lot i want to do

2522
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:16,238
but it it's no easy road it's a road

2523
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:19,520
that can be done and can if it's done

2524
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:22,399
properly you can enjoy success

2525
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,080
but if you don't do it properly in this

2526
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:25,839
day and age

2527
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:29,600
it's not going to work

2528
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:31,679
the internet never forgets the internet

2529
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:35,039
always will be

2530
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:37,679
and the internet has the last say

2531
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:40,158
so have it say something good don't have

2532
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:41,199
it say something bad

2533
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:43,039
yeah

2534
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:44,399
so i mean just to kind of change topics

2535
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:45,760
for a second i remember reading one of

2536
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:47,920
your descriptions and it read something

2537
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:50,159
along the lines of if it has the word

2538
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,920
gooey in it it better be gooey what does

2539
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:54,638
that mean to you you know like what what

2540
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,719
what embodies gooey overall

2541
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:59,520
sticky it's got it

2542
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:02,079
the resin's got to just be proliferous

2543
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,360
you know that's a that's that's the

2544
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:05,760
trait that

2545
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:06,559
she's best known for

2546
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,280
and

2547
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:11,199
that's it you know if if it says it it

2548
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,519
it needs to be it

2549
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:15,919
just like like i was saying about you

2550
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:18,639
know a berry needs to really kind of be

2551
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,800
purple i think okay or

2552
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:23,118
damn near because

2553
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,679
it should be like a berry

2554
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:28,799
build stuff that's going to be

2555
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:30,719
like it says and you know if it's yeah i

2556
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:33,840
i one of the

2557
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:36,840
examples i use is the old mendo haze

2558
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,600
because that stuff has this

2559
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:41,760
absolutely overpoweringly

2560
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,719
wonderful

2561
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,480
lime vodka

2562
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:47,760
uh taste

2563
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:51,198
that people

2564
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,520
it just it whips their head around it

2565
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:56,319
what is that

2566
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:59,440
that is what you want to do as a breeder

2567
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:01,759
you want to bring out that stuff now

2568
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:04,158
that was one plant that i found in a

2569
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,920
group of seed that was given to me

2570
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:08,238
and none of the other plants were like

2571
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:09,600
that but that's what you have to do is

2572
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:11,118
you have to

2573
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,800
find that

2574
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:15,920
particular

2575
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:19,039
amazingly different

2576
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:21,679
plant and bring it forward and then use

2577
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:25,118
it and and midnight snow

2578
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:27,679
is beautifully purple but it tastes like

2579
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:29,759
old mendo haze and

2580
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:32,079
people love that

2581
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,560
so on the topic of haze did you ever get

2582
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:36,158
to sample the original stuff and how

2583
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:38,880
different is the mendo haze from the

2584
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:40,879
original i think the old mendo haze is

2585
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,279
from that original work because those

2586
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,880
seeds originally came from

2587
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:46,800
santa cruz

2588
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:49,760
and then they were grown for

2589
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:52,560
i think probably over 30 years up in

2590
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:54,880
mendocino by one guy who said he never

2591
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:56,800
released him he just interbred

2592
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,920
back and forth but he never claimed that

2593
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,560
they were

2594
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,719
the original but he called it mendo

2595
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:06,239
hayes

2596
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:07,600
so he you know he he said they came from

2597
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:10,399
down there

2598
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,960
and god rest his soul

2599
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:13,920
i was lucky enough that he gave me a few

2600
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,840
of them

2601
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:19,279
and it was only because he said well

2602
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:21,600
take these and make them famous

2603
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:21,599
okay

2604
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:29,840
and sure enough he i found this one

2605
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:32,880
plant and it's like oh yahoo buckaroo

2606
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,000
it has the the haze kind of a look to it

2607
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,159
it looks

2608
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,520
i mean if you looked at a plant of this

2609
01:38:36,158 --> 01:38:40,399
it you'd swear to god it was haze

2610
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:44,000
and

2611
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:47,039
the flavor is just

2612
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,359
so wonderful i just can't wait to have

2613
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:51,519
more people enjoy it

2614
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:53,519
so if we take a look at one of your

2615
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:55,440
other strains one that had always caught

2616
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,440
my eye and kind of made me had a bit of

2617
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:58,799
a laugh was the psycho patch i actually

2618
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:00,719
grabbed the pack of it i liked it so

2619
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:03,119
much because it's the af gooey and the

2620
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:05,279
gooey was that just like a little funny

2621
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:06,479
kind of i wouldn't call it like a pun or

2622
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:08,238
like a play on words but you know like

2623
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:09,759
they both got the goo in the name was

2624
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:12,479
was it just kind of like a fun thing or

2625
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:14,639
do you really like the af gui

2626
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,399
no i'll tell you

2627
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:18,800
and this is this is probably going to

2628
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:21,839
get people more riled up than anything

2629
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:25,440
but unfortunately for them

2630
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,360
the genetic dna has been tested

2631
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:28,719
and

2632
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:31,118
confirms what i've been telling people

2633
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:36,079
for years

2634
01:39:31,118 --> 01:39:38,639
my partner made half gui and i made gui

2635
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:43,519
and we both they were both made

2636
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:43,520
basically at the same time with a year

2637
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:48,560
18 month i think it was spread between

2638
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:52,239
the two

2639
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,960
and the af gui got its name because it

2640
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:55,439
was

2641
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,840
the afghan one

2642
01:39:55,439 --> 01:40:00,319
that was crossed into gooey

2643
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:02,319
and gui was first

2644
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:04,559
by about 18 months and it was grown in

2645
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:05,599
an indoor situation

2646
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,480
and

2647
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:11,039
i've seen people say that it was

2648
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:14,079
you know an indica and hawaiian and

2649
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:14,960
stuff well yeah that was the component

2650
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:17,039
that

2651
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,880
people focused on in gui was the

2652
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:20,079
hawaiian part

2653
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,960
and uh

2654
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:25,519
there's been a big debate over this for

2655
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:28,079
years and i've heard of other people's

2656
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:31,520
saying that uh

2657
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:34,000
you know that it was this guy and

2658
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,480
a surfer guy over in hawaii that

2659
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,639
originally developed yada yada

2660
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:41,599
well you know i got

2661
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:43,279
examples of of uh

2662
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:46,000
af gui and i

2663
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:47,759
they were tested against gui and it

2664
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,679
showed a clear

2665
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:53,920
genetic relation to the between the two

2666
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:58,079
and which is what i knew already because

2667
01:40:53,920 --> 01:41:00,800
my partner sold after clones

2668
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:03,760
all through the 80s

2669
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:06,560
when we made it in the late 80s

2670
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,239
when we made it and locally and it just

2671
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,600
took off because

2672
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:13,039
it was really a a nice plant it was

2673
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,960
really a good plant

2674
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:16,319
i didn't like it as much as i liked

2675
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,118
gooey

2676
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:18,639
so

2677
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:22,399
we agreed that he would go ahead and

2678
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:25,199
take that and i actually even

2679
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:27,839
out of deference to him for many a year

2680
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:29,439
i didn't mention it just because i was

2681
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,480
kind of hoping that he would come into

2682
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:32,559
the

2683
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:34,000
the scene and be able to start

2684
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,560
spreading some of his other breeding

2685
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,639
that he did that was really wonderful

2686
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:41,440
uh but he uh

2687
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:43,840
never has and he's actually local and

2688
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:45,039
kind of lost touch with him i miss him

2689
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:48,239
but um

2690
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:50,479
yeah it's confirmed that uh

2691
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:53,118
those two are related so i thought well

2692
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:55,279
you know why don't i just go ahead and

2693
01:41:53,118 --> 01:41:56,079
cross it back to each other because i

2694
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:58,719
don't

2695
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:00,479
ever recall ever doing that

2696
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:02,480
and uh

2697
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:04,718
the resulting plants

2698
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:08,319
have a you know they have a

2699
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:11,118
squat structure of about five feet

2700
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:12,158
six feet tall maximum but they're really

2701
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:14,158
wide

2702
01:42:12,158 --> 01:42:16,559
and uh

2703
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:19,198
they are just some of them are just

2704
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,400
really deliciously tropical smelling and

2705
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:23,599
i really

2706
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:27,279
really enjoy that part of it but overall

2707
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:28,400
um it's not my favorite smoke

2708
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:30,238
yeah okay

2709
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:32,638
so what traits are you looking for in

2710
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,959
males are you looking for gooey traits

2711
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:37,199
in like most of the males or is it

2712
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,840
different for each i i look for the

2713
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:42,399
target trait that i'm using for for that

2714
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,679
for the target of the breeding yeah

2715
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:46,559
again

2716
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:50,079
everything is specific to what the

2717
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,960
target is and you want the males

2718
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:53,600
to

2719
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:55,279
have dominant traits

2720
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:58,639
that

2721
01:42:55,279 --> 01:43:00,399
also you know are going to have when

2722
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:02,400
they're recessive they're going to stay

2723
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:04,799
recessive they're not going to get

2724
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:06,960
passed on and expressed

2725
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:10,320
in that next set

2726
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:13,359
and i look for males that perform that

2727
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:16,639
way and how do i do that i've already

2728
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:18,880
tested them with other stuff

2729
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:21,840
before i use them for the particular

2730
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:23,359
project i already know how they're going

2731
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:26,000
to pass on

2732
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:29,039
their traits in different scenarios

2733
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,039
sometimes i'll use

2734
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,279
strains that have

2735
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,520
some of the same

2736
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:37,920
genetics as the targeted one

2737
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:41,360
so that i can go ahead and i can

2738
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:44,079
see how the interplay is and once i am

2739
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:46,639
happy with that then i go ahead

2740
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:47,679
and use that mail for the targeted

2741
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:50,400
purpose

2742
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:52,319
and then i fill through those plans

2743
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:54,079
a kind of a common idea expressed by a

2744
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:54,880
few different breeders is that they'll

2745
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:56,960
have

2746
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,960
one particular mother for you might be

2747
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,800
the obvious one maybe the mum but

2748
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,480
they'll use a lot of their males on that

2749
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,159
because they know predictably how the

2750
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:07,279
mum breeds is that something you do or

2751
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:09,359
do wide variety of pollination

2752
01:44:07,279 --> 01:44:12,719
that's one of that's one of the things

2753
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:15,039
it depends again on on the breeding goal

2754
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:16,639
if you're breeding for a wide spectrum

2755
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:18,880
of expression you're going to want to

2756
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:21,039
use more than one male

2757
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:24,639
you're going to want to you use multiple

2758
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:25,920
males on on targeted plants

2759
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:28,400
because you're going to get a wider

2760
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,639
expression that would also be if you're

2761
01:44:28,399 --> 01:44:32,719
doing pure landers that you want to

2762
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:34,960
maintain you're going to want to use

2763
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:37,439
more than one male on more than one

2764
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,439
female

2765
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:44,799
again mine's a numbers thing and

2766
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:46,000
bigger is better in this game as far as

2767
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,199
numbers go

2768
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:51,279
you want to have as many as you can grow

2769
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:54,158
and maintain

2770
01:44:51,279 --> 01:44:56,399
as you can possibly can and

2771
01:44:54,158 --> 01:45:00,158
then you want to be ultra picky about

2772
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:02,158
what it is you select so the male

2773
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:04,799
you have to stick with that target

2774
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:05,839
people get distracted they get they get

2775
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,000
to where

2776
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,000
they

2777
01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:11,679
you know they see this and they go oh

2778
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:13,440
well that's interesting and it's a does

2779
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:15,199
it fit your target

2780
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:17,839
you know if it's interesting put it

2781
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:20,319
aside if it's another thing that that

2782
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:23,119
you want to do

2783
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:26,479
but it's on its own

2784
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:29,759
thing off to the side it's not what your

2785
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:32,079
target is stick with your target

2786
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,159
and that's what dictates what the males

2787
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:38,079
are are all about if

2788
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:40,079
if i'm trying to breed out uh uh

2789
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:42,559
recessive uh

2790
01:45:40,079 --> 01:45:42,559
um

2791
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,719
hermaphroditism or something like that

2792
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,800
i'm going to test the nails to make sure

2793
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:51,679
that that's what happens you know that

2794
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:53,119
i'm not breathing that in or or

2795
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:55,520
or what

2796
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:57,359
genetics triggers it

2797
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:00,320
and all this stuff takes time and it

2798
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:02,319
takes numbers but that's the beauty

2799
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:06,000
about this company that i've made is

2800
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:08,079
that i i do that and the breeding method

2801
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,800
the micro breeding that i do

2802
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:12,800
allows me to be able to do this on a

2803
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,920
scale

2804
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:18,239
that allows me the luxury of the numbers

2805
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,840
without having to get all carried away

2806
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:21,039
and i'm going to explain that in the

2807
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,279
book

2808
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:25,760
so i i think it's going to be a very

2809
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:28,158
valuable thing and it will touch on all

2810
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,320
of these types of uh

2811
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:33,279
of things that that people are wondering

2812
01:46:30,319 --> 01:46:34,960
and how to avoid uh i think that that's

2813
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:37,279
just the next step and the next

2814
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,719
progression towards making this a better

2815
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:40,960
industry

2816
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:43,840
you just reference the book when when

2817
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:46,800
would such a thing ideally be finished

2818
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:49,679
i'm hoping within the next year

2819
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:52,000
because i really want to add a lot of

2820
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:54,560
examples and color to it i've already

2821
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,560
got a lot of them too but i i really

2822
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:59,039
want to show there's a couple of

2823
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:01,039
instances that i haven't got pictures of

2824
01:46:59,039 --> 01:47:03,600
that i want to show people

2825
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:05,118
uh progressions and what i'm talking

2826
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,159
about and what it

2827
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:09,759
what

2828
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:11,118
it entails uh and why it's important

2829
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:13,600
uh and

2830
01:47:11,118 --> 01:47:15,439
and it's just a refining thing and i'm

2831
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,600
probably gonna release it as an e-book

2832
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:19,678
so people can just download it

2833
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:22,239
you know and get it right away i don't

2834
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:24,000
even know if it'll be a physical book it

2835
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:25,599
seems to me that people don't do that

2836
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,520
much anymore

2837
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,760
as far as traditional books plus you

2838
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,639
know killing trees yadda yadda i'd

2839
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,480
rather

2840
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:34,800
yeah rather make it difficult i think

2841
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:36,479
makes it easier for people to have and

2842
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:39,760
carry around and

2843
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:42,238
so i'm looking forward to that and i and

2844
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,520
i do all that stuff myself so

2845
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:46,000
you know

2846
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:48,639
it takes a little time

2847
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,600
so you just reference you know dealing

2848
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,359
with

2849
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:54,239
is probably recessive have you ever

2850
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:56,399
found a line where it had just outright

2851
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:57,839
herme issues but you were so into it you

2852
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:00,399
were like i'm going to breed this out

2853
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:03,119
over a few generations

2854
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:04,638
you know i started too with a line

2855
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:07,039
called zinfal

2856
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:10,880
and um

2857
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:13,920
i i i i i just started to get obsessed

2858
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:15,679
with doing this because zinfal had

2859
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,039
had has it all

2860
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,639
it has

2861
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:22,479
a

2862
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:24,880
beautiful dark presence beautiful colors

2863
01:48:22,479 --> 01:48:28,559
beautiful

2864
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:33,279
berry deep berry smells

2865
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:35,840
uh a nice heavy heavy yield

2866
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:36,479
doesn't take much nutrient to grow it

2867
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,400
and

2868
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:42,399
and it's really forgiving in a lot of

2869
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:45,439
ways but every now and then it expresses

2870
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:47,679
hermaphroditism on some of the buds

2871
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:49,118
they can be you know sporadic manners

2872
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:52,880
here and there

2873
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:54,399
but um that's just i just can't do that

2874
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:56,319
you know and

2875
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:57,759
what i found is that if you let that

2876
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:01,359
stuff go

2877
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:04,480
then it tends to get more and more i

2878
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:07,039
attribute it to the thai the thai

2879
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:08,319
traditionally had that and i bred away

2880
01:49:07,039 --> 01:49:10,560
from it

2881
01:49:08,319 --> 01:49:10,559
um

2882
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:14,560
within the tie

2883
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:17,198
whenever when i was growing that tie

2884
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:20,719
uh the pure tie was just wonderful

2885
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:22,799
but uh some examples of it did

2886
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:24,079
raphor die is really easy

2887
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,000
and

2888
01:49:24,079 --> 01:49:28,639
a couple of them didn't and those were

2889
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,679
the ones that were i was able to

2890
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:35,279
to use like in making gooey so

2891
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:38,480
i i you can you can get away from it but

2892
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:40,719
it's lurking there always and all it

2893
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:42,638
takes is that trigger gene to be able to

2894
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:45,039
you know bring a

2895
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:48,000
recessive into a dominant

2896
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:48,960
and that's what testing's all about

2897
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,279
so

2898
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:53,359
there like i said there is no shortcuts

2899
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:56,880
if you're doing it right

2900
01:49:53,359 --> 01:49:59,198
there's only shortcuts if you don't care

2901
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,880
so how do you feel about filial breeding

2902
01:49:59,198 --> 01:50:02,559
versus say back crossing because i've

2903
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,159
noticed you do do filial breeding but

2904
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:06,719
there's not a lot of back crossing as

2905
01:50:04,158 --> 01:50:09,118
far as i can see

2906
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:11,520
the only back well again it depends on

2907
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:13,439
whether i want to cube the line if if

2908
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:16,320
i'm cubing the line you always go back

2909
01:50:13,439 --> 01:50:17,198
to the the target plant

2910
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,359
and

2911
01:50:17,198 --> 01:50:20,879
you go to the from there

2912
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:23,359
um

2913
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:26,639
but other than that it's just selective

2914
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:28,079
males uh from for targeted traits and

2915
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:31,199
i'm looking for

2916
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:33,279
i really try to stay with one trade only

2917
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:34,879
you know i really want to target just

2918
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:36,800
one trade

2919
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:39,760
there's been times

2920
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,000
where i'll say well this has both

2921
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:44,079
okay we'll set it aside and do further

2922
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,560
testing hopefully that's the case and

2923
01:50:44,079 --> 01:50:50,079
that has worked out sometimes but for

2924
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:53,440
the most part uh you know when i'm doing

2925
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:56,158
uh lines like pure gooey

2926
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:59,519
every every succession goes back to mom

2927
01:50:56,158 --> 01:51:01,839
because i want that's the target plant

2928
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:04,239
and it's just that simple i mean if

2929
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:06,800
you've got this beautiful plant and you

2930
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:08,319
want to make seed of that plant the best

2931
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,440
thing to do is to

2932
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:12,559
find a

2933
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:15,759
another opposite type of plant

2934
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:16,880
or one that has some of the genetics in

2935
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:19,599
it

2936
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:23,118
that are exactly the same

2937
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:25,679
but the rest differs so much like uh an

2938
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:28,000
indica sativa hybrid and you're looking

2939
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,679
for to mate it with another sativa and

2940
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,118
you're just going to bring away all the

2941
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:32,800
all of the indica

2942
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:35,359
expressions

2943
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,960
and just target target the other plant

2944
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:39,759
and then that's you just go through it

2945
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:41,599
and in succession until you've got it

2946
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:42,560
and that's when you have to be the most

2947
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:45,440
picky

2948
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:46,639
so yeah there is back crossing is is

2949
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:48,879
important

2950
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:51,118
you know in certain instances again it's

2951
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:54,000
the target of your goal

2952
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:56,158
and that's what i hear more and more

2953
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,639
in questions like these and stuff like

2954
01:51:56,158 --> 01:52:00,000
that is that that's what's lacking in

2955
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:01,199
breeding

2956
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,679
in general

2957
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,919
to a large extent is people don't think

2958
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:09,520
far enough ahead they're just still

2959
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:12,000
stuck in the next very next seed plant

2960
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:13,760
that comes off of the very next seed

2961
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,920
and they're not going very much further

2962
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:18,320
than that that's not that's in my book

2963
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:20,319
that's not breathing

2964
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:22,639
is there any circumstances in which you

2965
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:25,439
would opt to use the

2966
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:26,880
like a gooey mum you found from the the

2967
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:29,598
seeds you created out of the cube

2968
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:32,079
project over the mum gui or would you

2969
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:34,079
pretty much always opt for the mum gu

2970
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:36,000
i have in the past

2971
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:38,319
i have

2972
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,719
it would be a separate project always of

2973
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:43,759
course but yeah i mean i have in the

2974
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:46,800
past there there's uh there was a it

2975
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:47,920
comes to mind a few years ago many years

2976
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,599
ago

2977
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,920
um

2978
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,119
there was a version that was uh

2979
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:57,279
um

2980
01:52:53,118 --> 01:53:00,079
more resonant mom uh was the focus of it

2981
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:03,359
and and it had there was a mother plant

2982
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:07,198
that i had for a few years that

2983
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:09,198
i was using as a as a balancer for mom

2984
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:12,238
and

2985
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:13,919
ultimately i got rid of it

2986
01:53:12,238 --> 01:53:17,118
because i found that

2987
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:18,880
it was too dominant in crosses

2988
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:21,759
and it would it would just overwhelm

2989
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:23,599
everything and when you're a breeder

2990
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:26,560
that's not good

2991
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:28,560
so so after a while i got rid of it but

2992
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,679
yeah the more resonant mom one yeah i'm

2993
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:32,159
sure you could probably look that up

2994
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:32,960
there's probably somewhere on breed bay

2995
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:36,319
and

2996
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:38,399
it had it it was it was resin on top of

2997
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:40,719
resin it was beautiful

2998
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:42,799
just beautiful so yeah i mean there are

2999
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:45,279
certain instances where of course i'll

3000
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:47,840
you know it's all about

3001
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:50,559
what you see and and

3002
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:52,639
whether it is right or not whether it

3003
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:55,119
it's something that is going to

3004
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:57,039
be useful and targeted

3005
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:58,000
targeting is always the thing

3006
01:53:57,039 --> 01:54:00,319
it is

3007
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,719
so i mean given the specificity of your

3008
01:54:00,319 --> 01:54:04,960
goals and kind of often

3009
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:07,439
implied again it would be a separate

3010
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:10,719
project it would have you'd have to set

3011
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:12,319
it aside and have a separate thing no it

3012
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,319
would not

3013
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:16,960
immediately step in

3014
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:20,479
and be the substitute quarterback in the

3015
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:22,560
game no yeah the quarterback state so

3016
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:24,319
given that a lot of your australians are

3017
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,560
using a lot of different

3018
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:28,559
steps you've made along the way have you

3019
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:30,320
ever had any projects where it's just

3020
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:32,639
worked on the straight f1 and you've got

3021
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:34,279
exactly what you wanted

3022
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:37,359
oh yeah oh

3023
01:54:34,279 --> 01:54:39,039
absolutely uh one of those examples a

3024
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:41,519
really good example

3025
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:43,118
uh at the time would be the purple

3026
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,080
mayhem

3027
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:46,079
yeah

3028
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:47,760
that the purple mayhem was exactly what

3029
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:51,279
i wanted for a shot

3030
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:53,760
and it didn't have i mean i i it i'm

3031
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:54,960
sorry it was exactly what i expected

3032
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:56,159
first shot

3033
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,560
uh

3034
01:54:56,158 --> 01:55:00,559
what i want from it now

3035
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:02,960
and with lines that i'm working from

3036
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:05,199
that is i want to add more power into it

3037
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:06,880
i think it needs to have a heavier hit

3038
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:07,919
to it

3039
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,400
but

3040
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:12,399
a lot of people just love the state

3041
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:15,279
where the high is right now

3042
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:17,439
uh and you get those wonderful flavors

3043
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:20,399
that it has oh yeah that would that was

3044
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:22,000
a that was a blessing right off the bat

3045
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:24,399
and do you ever get to try any of the

3046
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
more modern strains you know the current

3047
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:27,598
f1 hybrids being released have you ever

3048
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,399
been blown away by any of them or it's

3049
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:33,199
all just much the same

3050
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:35,359
you know what no that's that

3051
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:37,678
no

3052
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:41,359
i don't i don't get high off a lot you

3053
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:42,880
know i mean i am my tolerance is

3054
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:44,158
incredibly high

3055
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:46,800
and uh

3056
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:49,198
i i complain about this to breeders all

3057
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,639
the time that you know okay when's

3058
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:53,359
when does it start

3059
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:55,199
if i do find something what i

3060
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:57,679
find more and more

3061
01:55:55,198 --> 01:56:00,079
nowadays is bottle rocket bot

3062
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:01,840
where you feel this incredible rush and

3063
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:03,439
then boop it's gone

3064
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:05,119
where'd it go

3065
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:06,638
ten minutes later where the hell is the

3066
01:56:05,118 --> 01:56:08,960
high

3067
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:10,639
no i want that i want something that

3068
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:13,439
lasts and has a nice

3069
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:16,960
longevity to it with a steady feel

3070
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:18,479
i don't want a lot of peaks and valleys

3071
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:21,520
that's that's

3072
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:23,759
yeah yeah i don't like power a lot of

3073
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:25,920
previous guests have referenced that the

3074
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,920
closer you get to land race if not land

3075
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,599
race itself generally you get a higher

3076
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:31,359
more akin to what you're talking about

3077
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:33,760
you know very unique no ceiling it's

3078
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:35,759
just long legs what do you think it is

3079
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:38,159
about hybridizing strains which has

3080
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:40,400
caused us to lose like to almost put a

3081
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:43,559
ceiling in place as to how good the high

3082
01:56:40,399 --> 01:56:43,559
can be

3083
01:56:44,238 --> 01:56:48,158
well

3084
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,158
i think that that's almost like art you

3085
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:52,799
know where beauty is in the eye of the

3086
01:56:50,158 --> 01:56:52,799
beholder

3087
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:59,598
i hear i hear all kinds of different uh

3088
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:01,039
references to

3089
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:02,960
older pot

3090
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:05,439
given by people who

3091
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,319
have the knowledge of it

3092
01:57:05,439 --> 01:57:08,158
and

3093
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:11,118
with younger people they have no way of

3094
01:57:08,158 --> 01:57:12,479
expressing that

3095
01:57:11,118 --> 01:57:14,719
insofar as

3096
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:18,479
because the knowledge just isn't there

3097
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:18,480
and i i find that

3098
01:57:20,238 --> 01:57:23,238
maybe

3099
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:31,840
life experience has more to it than than

3100
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:33,760
they give it credit you know as far as

3101
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:36,239
this goes in in

3102
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:38,719
so far as this particular question goes

3103
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:40,319
you know i i think the more references

3104
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:41,920
you've got

3105
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:43,759
the more

3106
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:47,760
you're able to draw off that and you can

3107
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:49,039
conclude better and i i just i i just

3108
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,150
like the old

3109
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:51,359
the old feels

3110
01:57:50,149 --> 01:57:53,519
[Music]

3111
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:55,759
i think have uh

3112
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,960
a better presence and that's why people

3113
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,880
like

3114
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:02,000
like gooey for instance they really find

3115
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:05,440
it to be a unique thing these days

3116
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,760
when it it it uh

3117
01:58:05,439 --> 01:58:08,960
it isn't unique to me at all

3118
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,760
obviously

3119
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:12,639
but

3120
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:14,560
it's what i expect and it's kind of like

3121
01:58:12,639 --> 01:58:16,880
one of those signposts

3122
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,480
uh in life and that's why i'd like to

3123
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:19,679
get it out there more is to have people

3124
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:22,079
understand

3125
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:24,399
the way it used to be and how it

3126
01:58:22,079 --> 01:58:25,599
it was back in the day when it was

3127
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:29,118
really

3128
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:31,440
unique to have all these different

3129
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:33,118
strains that

3130
01:58:31,439 --> 01:58:35,519
don't taste like

3131
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:38,319
the next strain that's that that you

3132
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:41,199
today i they're just too much too close

3133
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:43,439
they're just all too close

3134
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:45,359
so there is this kind of topic we've

3135
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:47,118
referenced in the past on the show where

3136
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:48,960
you know although there is this this

3137
01:58:47,118 --> 01:58:50,559
idea you're putting forth it comes up

3138
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:52,399
all the time and everyone agrees with it

3139
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:54,159
for the most part but there is a few

3140
01:58:52,399 --> 01:58:56,238
strains where people kind of say they

3141
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:58,559
are kind of undeniably elite you know

3142
01:58:56,238 --> 01:59:00,000
some of the cushes some of the chems and

3143
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,239
all that type of thing how do you feel

3144
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,520
about those ones which the public still

3145
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:05,439
hold as some of the best are they just

3146
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:07,920
same same category feuds still not

3147
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:07,919
interesting

3148
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,039
well you know no i mean i of course

3149
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:17,118
there's been there's been a few

3150
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:18,800
really interesting ones that really

3151
01:59:17,118 --> 01:59:22,079
catch your eye like

3152
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:23,440
a a a nice east coast sour diesel that's

3153
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:26,319
really

3154
01:59:23,439 --> 01:59:28,719
gassy i mean that's really neat

3155
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:29,759
that's really an amazing thing

3156
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:34,480
uh

3157
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:34,480
the the the different um

3158
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:40,000
oh gosh

3159
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:41,679
the different sativas that that

3160
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,479
i i find more

3161
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:45,760
more of palatable flavors and and more

3162
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:48,799
uniqueness

3163
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:53,199
in stuff like that uh and

3164
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:56,719
i really just don't find as much

3165
01:59:53,198 --> 01:59:59,279
pleasure in the cushes and and

3166
01:59:56,719 --> 02:00:02,880
and the the the

3167
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:04,880
og everything's uh

3168
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:05,760
i i just don't i just don't get it as

3169
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:08,319
much

3170
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,280
it all tastes generic whenever it starts

3171
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:12,880
to

3172
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:15,519
taste like a pot shop smells then

3173
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:17,599
i i don't i i'm i'm just not into it and

3174
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,560
that's where i put a lot of that

3175
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:20,960
uh

3176
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:22,560
stuff that's out there now is

3177
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:24,399
i

3178
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,840
even though there are these elites and

3179
02:00:24,399 --> 02:00:28,319
stuff

3180
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:30,800
they aren't what attract me

3181
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:33,519
let me put it that way

3182
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:35,679
yeah fair point so just i guess to kind

3183
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:37,840
of maybe answer some of the curiosities

3184
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:39,359
some people might have although indicas

3185
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:42,239
aren't your favorite which one has left

3186
02:00:39,359 --> 02:00:45,439
the best impression on you

3187
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:47,759
uh well of course the old the old indica

3188
02:00:45,439 --> 02:00:49,598
is like like afghan one

3189
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:52,560
uh and the old

3190
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:54,079
cabbage indicas if if anybody i know

3191
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:55,760
there are certain people that are nod in

3192
02:00:54,079 --> 02:01:00,399
their heads when they're listening to

3193
02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:02,800
this that remember that old 70s indica

3194
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:03,759
before it was illegal

3195
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,800
that

3196
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,920
had

3197
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,119
this

3198
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:11,840
absolutely it was a skunky taste but yet

3199
02:01:09,118 --> 02:01:13,439
it was sweet at the same time

3200
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,480
very unique

3201
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:18,479
those

3202
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:20,479
types of the high was just

3203
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:23,439
deep and

3204
02:01:20,479 --> 02:01:26,238
soul reaching almost uh

3205
02:01:23,439 --> 02:01:27,198
it it was quite something

3206
02:01:26,238 --> 02:01:29,198
and

3207
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:31,519
those are the kind of things that i

3208
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:34,158
gravitate to engage

3209
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:34,159
my ex

3210
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:39,598
indica off of

3211
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:41,198
are things of that nature the old

3212
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:43,840
pakistani

3213
02:01:41,198 --> 02:01:46,960
those were incredible too uh those

3214
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:48,840
really had body to them they had flavor

3215
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,920
they had presents and they grew

3216
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:53,920
wonderful plants that just they were

3217
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:54,639
just a pleasure to view

3218
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,760
some

3219
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:58,319
would have

3220
02:01:55,760 --> 02:02:01,119
uh ph issues that would allow the

3221
02:01:58,319 --> 02:02:03,279
pistols to turn this bright magenta

3222
02:02:01,118 --> 02:02:05,519
color and they were just

3223
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:07,118
gorgeous to look at just

3224
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:09,760
really something else those are the

3225
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:11,359
things that i remember and and

3226
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:14,320
gauge

3227
02:02:11,359 --> 02:02:16,559
all the work today on and

3228
02:02:14,319 --> 02:02:19,198
i just don't see a lot of it i just see

3229
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:22,239
a lot of hybridization uh different

3230
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:24,479
expressions i i'm guilty of it just like

3231
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:27,198
everybody else i'm i'm the stuff i'm

3232
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:30,000
making isn't like the old stuff you know

3233
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:32,319
it's just not but that's progression

3234
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,800
this is how it is

3235
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:37,039
so you referenced the cabbage bud was

3236
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,480
quite skunky just on that topic i like

3237
02:02:37,039 --> 02:02:40,238
to throw it by everyone did you ever get

3238
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:42,079
to try what people kind of call the

3239
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:44,638
roadkill skunk

3240
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:46,639
oh yeah oh yeah it

3241
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:49,359
was it that has a different kind of a

3242
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:52,000
smell to it that's a lot has a lot more

3243
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:54,960
of the gassy qualities

3244
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,079
mixed in with that heavy indica

3245
02:02:54,960 --> 02:03:01,840
uh

3246
02:02:56,079 --> 02:03:01,840
smell and and presence of the dead skunk

3247
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:06,960
so it really made it pronounced a lot

3248
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:09,599
more and that's what i was speaking to

3249
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:10,880
earlier where people can make strains

3250
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:13,440
that make

3251
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,560
a completely different

3252
02:03:13,439 --> 02:03:16,079
smell

3253
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:19,679
more pronounced

3254
02:03:16,079 --> 02:03:21,359
just by adding a louder voice to it

3255
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:23,440
it's like the vehicle

3256
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:25,359
uh that that shares and and gets

3257
02:03:23,439 --> 02:03:27,919
expressed from

3258
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:30,238
and that's that's exact that's a good

3259
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:34,560
example of that right there

3260
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:35,919
yeah very very strong very smell

3261
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,840
the highs was

3262
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,039
pretty much a body high as far as i

3263
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:43,360
remember

3264
02:03:39,039 --> 02:03:46,800
um tried some of that up in mendocino

3265
02:03:43,359 --> 02:03:50,799
yeah nice yeah no yeah a lot of friends

3266
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:51,679
up in mendocino it's a good place

3267
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,599
so

3268
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:55,118
i just wanted to a bit of a random

3269
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:56,239
question but one i was kind of

3270
02:03:55,118 --> 02:03:58,479
personally interested in getting

3271
02:03:56,238 --> 02:03:59,919
answered i've noticed a few people i've

3272
02:03:58,479 --> 02:04:02,559
seen posting

3273
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:04,078
um photos of what they have is the mom

3274
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,520
gui i believe

3275
02:04:04,078 --> 02:04:07,439
and they say things along the lines like

3276
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:09,440
they got it from you maybe one step

3277
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:11,759
removed from you is that true like are

3278
02:04:09,439 --> 02:04:13,598
you do you give cuts out pretty freely

3279
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:14,560
or you kind of keep it quite close to

3280
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:16,639
chest

3281
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:18,239
nope i've always given it away as much

3282
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:19,520
as possible

3283
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:20,959
yeah because i mean a lot of these

3284
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:22,239
people i had no reason to doubt them but

3285
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:24,158
i was kind of like yeah it seems like

3286
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:25,039
he's definitely happy with it being out

3287
02:04:24,158 --> 02:04:27,359
there

3288
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:29,599
oh absolutely

3289
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:31,920
again you have to understand the method

3290
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:33,599
that i use yeah

3291
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:36,399
the more people

3292
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:38,480
that understand the breeding and stuff

3293
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:40,238
i'm hoping that maybe they will be

3294
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:42,238
attracted to

3295
02:04:40,238 --> 02:04:43,759
other stuff that i've done and maybe

3296
02:04:42,238 --> 02:04:46,238
they'll want to try other things that

3297
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:47,920
i've developed if they like this

3298
02:04:46,238 --> 02:04:48,718
you know and and

3299
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,399
and

3300
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:53,198
not only that

3301
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:55,118
julie's probably one of those plants

3302
02:04:53,198 --> 02:04:57,359
i i

3303
02:04:55,118 --> 02:04:59,359
let's say i wanted to file a patent on

3304
02:04:57,359 --> 02:05:02,238
it i can't do it

3305
02:04:59,359 --> 02:05:04,639
um if if a plant has been out in the

3306
02:05:02,238 --> 02:05:07,919
public for more than a year

3307
02:05:04,639 --> 02:05:08,880
then it's considered pretty much open

3308
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:10,239
source

3309
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:11,440
that's it

3310
02:05:10,238 --> 02:05:14,078
and uh

3311
02:05:11,439 --> 02:05:15,039
so you can't patent a thing like that

3312
02:05:14,078 --> 02:05:18,319
well

3313
02:05:15,039 --> 02:05:19,760
it's a signature plant and i i think

3314
02:05:18,319 --> 02:05:21,599
that people

3315
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:24,400
really need a gooey plant in their

3316
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:27,279
garden because it's one of the more

3317
02:05:24,399 --> 02:05:29,598
enjoyable plants that they will ever

3318
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:31,519
ever own in their life

3319
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,239
and i

3320
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:35,840
am

3321
02:05:32,238 --> 02:05:37,039
a testament to that at it being 35 years

3322
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:40,319
old

3323
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:42,719
you know this plant is is a keeper and

3324
02:05:40,319 --> 02:05:44,399
there's reason for it and it and when

3325
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:47,198
they try it

3326
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:49,839
though they want it and and

3327
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:52,319
that was one of the main motivations of

3328
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:54,800
creating the pure gooey seed

3329
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:58,479
was the fact that people i couldn't i

3330
02:05:54,800 --> 02:06:00,960
can't give enough of gooey away

3331
02:05:58,479 --> 02:06:02,959
i just can't i can't do it i haven't got

3332
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:04,319
the capacity but you know if i made a

3333
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:05,679
seed that

3334
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:07,599
mimicked mom

3335
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:09,760
as much as possible

3336
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:11,679
i can that i can do i can get it out to

3337
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:13,440
a lot of people and so that was the

3338
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:15,599
motivation and it always is the

3339
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:17,519
motivation to everything i do

3340
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:19,679
you know is that this is the best way i

3341
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:21,599
can do it and help people that's why i

3342
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:23,440
don't charge

3343
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:26,800
whatever the reps are charging i don't

3344
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:29,118
know i don't i don't keep up on them

3345
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:30,400
whatever they're making is fine with me

3346
02:06:29,118 --> 02:06:32,799
whatever they can get

3347
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:34,479
but believe me i don't charge a lot to

3348
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,480
them because

3349
02:06:34,479 --> 02:06:38,959
i want them i try and encourage them to

3350
02:06:36,479 --> 02:06:41,678
keep the price low to keep it affordable

3351
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:43,279
because i want people to have this

3352
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:46,719
absolute deal

3353
02:06:43,279 --> 02:06:49,198
where they they buy this stuff and so

3354
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:51,279
many times in this industry they'll buy

3355
02:06:49,198 --> 02:06:53,598
something from a picture that looks so

3356
02:06:51,279 --> 02:06:56,158
wonderful online and they get it and

3357
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:58,560
it's not what they wanted i want them to

3358
02:06:56,158 --> 02:07:01,519
be surprised i wanted to be overwhelmed

3359
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:04,400
i want him to be wow you know i got my

3360
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:07,280
money's worth out of this and i'm so

3361
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:09,920
happy that i spent this money

3362
02:07:07,279 --> 02:07:11,118
that's what i want and in giving gui

3363
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:13,920
away

3364
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:17,359
it just shows people that

3365
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:18,560
the real intent of canada exotics is not

3366
02:07:17,359 --> 02:07:22,399
money

3367
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:25,199
as much as it is their satisfaction and

3368
02:07:22,399 --> 02:07:26,799
their happiness but because life's short

3369
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:28,479
let's let's let's make it the best it

3370
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,320
can be

3371
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:31,118
yeah good motto

3372
02:07:30,319 --> 02:07:33,198
so

3373
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:34,719
wanted to run the idea by femmes what do

3374
02:07:33,198 --> 02:07:38,479
you think about them will we ever see

3375
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:38,480
some mum gooey s-ones

3376
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:41,840
no

3377
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:45,439
you there was a time where i did produce

3378
02:07:44,479 --> 02:07:48,879
that

3379
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:51,759
uh and the genetics on the s1 side are

3380
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:54,000
gone so um

3381
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,360
i didn't keep them

3382
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,800
and did you find the results just

3383
02:07:55,359 --> 02:07:59,279
weren't particularly good anyway or

3384
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:02,079
would you consider doing no i i yeah you

3385
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:04,399
know i i found that mom completely

3386
02:08:02,078 --> 02:08:07,039
overwhelmed it it would just completely

3387
02:08:04,399 --> 02:08:08,719
overwhelm it uh almost

3388
02:08:07,039 --> 02:08:10,158
90 to 90

3389
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:12,399
percent of the time

3390
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:15,598
with very few

3391
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:17,118
of the really super desirable components

3392
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:20,000
coming through

3393
02:08:17,118 --> 02:08:22,319
from the from the s1 it just didn't work

3394
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,000
um

3395
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:25,840
uh i think

3396
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,679
the reason that is well i know the

3397
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:29,599
reason why it is and the reason why it

3398
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:31,440
is because goo is composed of mostly

3399
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:32,319
landers works

3400
02:08:31,439 --> 02:08:34,000
uh

3401
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:36,639
by and large so

3402
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,560
um their genetic chains are

3403
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:41,359
very dominant

3404
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:44,079
and uh people have to be wary of that

3405
02:08:41,359 --> 02:08:47,279
when they're using it that that's where

3406
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:49,679
it's going to go as far as

3407
02:08:47,279 --> 02:08:51,118
genetics go

3408
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:53,840
genetics are like water it's going to

3409
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:55,679
take the easiest path

3410
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:57,599
and if people know their then

3411
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:59,039
they're going to be able to

3412
02:08:57,599 --> 02:09:01,119
know where that path is going to go

3413
02:08:59,039 --> 02:09:02,238
before they even breed with it they'll

3414
02:09:01,118 --> 02:09:04,639
have a good

3415
02:09:02,238 --> 02:09:07,839
reasonable expectation of what to expect

3416
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:10,000
if they know their stuff inside now

3417
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,960
and landorus is when you're when you're

3418
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,279
working

3419
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:14,960
on old landers is like that

3420
02:09:13,279 --> 02:09:16,639
you have to know that those are going to

3421
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:18,880
be dominant

3422
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:21,440
and especially in

3423
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:23,118
heavy hybrids like today

3424
02:09:21,439 --> 02:09:24,638
where there's hybridization upon

3425
02:09:23,118 --> 02:09:27,039
hybridization and

3426
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:28,800
you know all this stuff is related and

3427
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:30,800
whatnot

3428
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:33,039
the the the

3429
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:36,480
more truer dominant lines from the

3430
02:09:33,039 --> 02:09:37,439
landers are going to overwhelm that

3431
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:39,279
yeah

3432
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:42,078
totally understandable

3433
02:09:39,279 --> 02:09:44,559
so on the topic of land races durban

3434
02:09:42,078 --> 02:09:46,719
poison one durban poison is one which i

3435
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:48,000
find is always kind of peripherally

3436
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:49,279
present on the scene you know people are

3437
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,198
always kind of talking about it maybe

3438
02:09:49,279 --> 02:09:53,039
never in the limelight but the thing

3439
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:54,319
which i wanted to ask you is

3440
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:56,000
have you ever tried it and how do you

3441
02:09:54,319 --> 02:09:58,639
think it compares to the african ones

3442
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:01,198
you've been experienced with

3443
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:03,760
it's a lot different um

3444
02:10:01,198 --> 02:10:06,559
but then again

3445
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,679
i've i had exposure to

3446
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:10,719
um

3447
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:10,719
some of the older

3448
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,480
um

3449
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,639
like

3450
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:16,638
red africans and stuff like that that

3451
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:18,319
were back in the day back when i lived

3452
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:20,719
in england

3453
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:23,198
there was uh

3454
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:25,279
i can't remember what exactly where but

3455
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:26,839
which region it came from but

3456
02:10:25,279 --> 02:10:30,000
um it was

3457
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:31,039
just really really really interesting

3458
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,679
and

3459
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:35,920
the durbins are a lot better structured

3460
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:38,319
they're a lot more look

3461
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:40,719
like they've been

3462
02:10:38,319 --> 02:10:40,719
bred

3463
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:45,520
for

3464
02:10:42,399 --> 02:10:48,238
production and and for producing

3465
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:52,560
rather than the stuff that i was have

3466
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:55,279
been exposed to which is gathered

3467
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:57,920
mostly gathered wild

3468
02:10:55,279 --> 02:10:59,599
i have a producer friend who

3469
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:02,960
does a lot of

3470
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:05,599
generic photographing for hollywood

3471
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:07,039
and he has been able to get me a lot of

3472
02:11:05,599 --> 02:11:10,319
these things and he was one of the ones

3473
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:13,198
that got me that purple african

3474
02:11:10,319 --> 02:11:16,399
where they called it weak heads

3475
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:16,399
because it wasn't very strong

3476
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:22,879
those are the kinds of africans that

3477
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:25,360
i've been exposed to back in the day the

3478
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,719
african black i did

3479
02:11:25,359 --> 02:11:30,719
try

3480
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:32,480
a couple of times and that was stunning

3481
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:33,599
um

3482
02:11:32,479 --> 02:11:36,718
but

3483
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:40,560
the durban poison i find to be a little

3484
02:11:36,719 --> 02:11:43,198
bit more um

3485
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:44,639
commercialized i guess is the best word

3486
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:47,759
for it

3487
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:49,920
um i i enjoy it i mean it's it's it's a

3488
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:51,679
nice hi it doesn't seem to last that

3489
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:54,960
long for me

3490
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:58,480
but um i i'm i'm i'm a hard nugget to

3491
02:11:54,960 --> 02:12:01,760
please so unfortunately

3492
02:11:58,479 --> 02:12:04,000
i i i've grown i would never incorporate

3493
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,840
it in anything i do

3494
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,880
yeah

3495
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:08,239
okay so

3496
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:10,639
just kind of jumping out of the land

3497
02:12:08,238 --> 02:12:12,959
race for a second berry mania it's an

3498
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:15,279
interesting one because it incorporates

3499
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:17,198
the tga line lemon freeze which is a

3500
02:12:15,279 --> 02:12:18,880
rather obscure one hasn't been around

3501
02:12:17,198 --> 02:12:20,399
for a while what was it about the lemon

3502
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:22,319
freeze which attracted you to it because

3503
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:24,158
it pops up in a few places

3504
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:26,639
yeah lemon freeze

3505
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:29,519
wasn't sub cool's work

3506
02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:32,880
uh it was a subordinate of his that made

3507
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:35,760
that and he didn't really care for that

3508
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:38,078
but what i found about it

3509
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:40,400
was that it had a

3510
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:42,799
it was a good vehicle

3511
02:12:40,399 --> 02:12:44,559
it had

3512
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:46,880
the ability to

3513
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:48,800
pass on

3514
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:51,440
its structure

3515
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:52,480
along with some of its lemon

3516
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:55,678
flavor

3517
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:57,039
but you could easily overwhelm it with

3518
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:58,000
other traits

3519
02:12:57,039 --> 02:13:00,800
and

3520
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,760
like let's say frozen lava was a good

3521
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:07,440
choice for that because

3522
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:07,440
it allowed me to build this

3523
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:13,760
deep purple with a crusty

3524
02:13:10,319 --> 02:13:14,960
beautiful dusting of heavy resin

3525
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:17,920
and

3526
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:21,840
still bring that lava forward

3527
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:23,520
and uh it didn't it didn't

3528
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:25,119
overwhelm it with

3529
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,760
the typical

3530
02:13:25,118 --> 02:13:30,960
lemon turbans that

3531
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:32,159
is so typical of subcool's work

3532
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:35,760
and uh

3533
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:38,799
so i i found it to be a better use than

3534
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:41,039
anything i i never i i you know i love

3535
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:42,480
sub as far as a person goes he's a

3536
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:46,319
wonderful guy

3537
02:13:42,479 --> 02:13:48,799
um i enjoy him uh as a person i never

3538
02:13:46,319 --> 02:13:49,759
really found much of his work that i

3539
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:54,079
could

3540
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:56,239
get behind as far as that goes but this

3541
02:13:54,078 --> 02:13:57,439
wasn't made by him it did the selection

3542
02:13:56,238 --> 02:14:00,078
wasn't done

3543
02:13:57,439 --> 02:14:02,799
but it's one of his most asked about

3544
02:14:00,078 --> 02:14:02,799
strains

3545
02:14:03,198 --> 02:14:07,359
unfortunately sunny was the one who made

3546
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:08,880
it so you know um

3547
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:10,559
that's interesting because i think the

3548
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,719
common sentiment is that a lot of the

3549
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:14,560
more memorable lines from tga did come

3550
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:15,840
from sonny's work and the whole tga

3551
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:16,800
canada crew

3552
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,920
yeah

3553
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,320
i know

3554
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:21,840
i i never really wanted to step on sub

3555
02:14:20,319 --> 02:14:24,840
like that because i've known him for so

3556
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:27,520
long and i i do

3557
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:30,159
appreciate what he's built

3558
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:33,280
uh but sonny really

3559
02:14:30,158 --> 02:14:34,799
was a very very key component

3560
02:14:33,279 --> 02:14:36,639
and i

3561
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:39,520
liked

3562
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:41,440
that particular thing

3563
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:42,480
probably more than anything else that i

3564
02:14:41,439 --> 02:14:44,399
ever tried

3565
02:14:42,479 --> 02:14:46,238
from tga

3566
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:47,359
yeah yeah

3567
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:49,359
so

3568
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:51,839
something i wanted to ask i've seen a

3569
02:14:49,359 --> 02:14:53,920
lot of kind of support from you for a

3570
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:56,560
few specific forums over the years

3571
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:57,920
however you're noticeably not present on

3572
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:59,679
instagram do you feel there's a big

3573
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:02,800
difference between the platforms and how

3574
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:03,760
come you're not so present on instagram

3575
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,920
well

3576
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:07,440
um

3577
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:10,078
i had

3578
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:12,078
uh pistols from breed bay set me up an

3579
02:15:10,078 --> 02:15:14,559
account on instagram

3580
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:17,599
and i do have one

3581
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:19,599
but in all honesty i

3582
02:15:17,599 --> 02:15:20,860
i

3583
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:22,719
i'm an older person

3584
02:15:20,859 --> 02:15:23,839
[Laughter]

3585
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:26,639
and and

3586
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:29,520
social media to me is

3587
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:32,960
its own thing and its own time consuming

3588
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:36,239
thing and i've got to do

3589
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:37,279
and and i don't i just don't have time

3590
02:15:36,238 --> 02:15:40,559
to

3591
02:15:37,279 --> 02:15:44,238
i i leave that up to other people and

3592
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:45,760
and and they're busy too uh and so

3593
02:15:44,238 --> 02:15:48,158
instagram to me

3594
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:50,719
i should i know i should be on it more i

3595
02:15:48,158 --> 02:15:52,319
know i if you look up gooey reader on

3596
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:55,359
instagram there's a shitload of

3597
02:15:52,319 --> 02:15:56,559
beautiful pictures of

3598
02:15:55,359 --> 02:15:58,639
stuff that

3599
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:01,920
people have grown out

3600
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:05,840
uh and i've only just recently started

3601
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:05,840
to comment on some of that stuff

3602
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:10,159
and to address maybe an issue or two

3603
02:16:08,479 --> 02:16:14,319
that i saw on there

3604
02:16:10,158 --> 02:16:16,799
i just i just don't spend a lot of time

3605
02:16:14,319 --> 02:16:20,399
i'm a very private person i don't have a

3606
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:22,159
facebook account i don't have

3607
02:16:20,399 --> 02:16:24,158
very much at all

3608
02:16:22,158 --> 02:16:25,598
out there i mean

3609
02:16:24,158 --> 02:16:27,359
i

3610
02:16:25,599 --> 02:16:29,440
i guess it would benefit me and maybe i

3611
02:16:27,359 --> 02:16:31,279
should do that more

3612
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:33,840
but i'll probably end up just hiring

3613
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:34,959
people to do that pr work for me instead

3614
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:36,719
and

3615
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:40,000
give them the information to post or

3616
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:41,919
whatever because i just don't have time

3617
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,318
yeah understandable

3618
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:46,478
you know it's just more that

3619
02:16:44,318 --> 02:16:49,920
the work is more important than than

3620
02:16:46,478 --> 02:16:52,000
that i i can't i can't do anybody any

3621
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:54,558
good if i'm sitting online

3622
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,000
posting pictures and being self

3623
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:58,398
gratifying

3624
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:00,799
that's not me that's not what that's not

3625
02:16:58,398 --> 02:17:02,638
what this company's about this company

3626
02:17:00,799 --> 02:17:04,318
is about the customer and i'm not doing

3627
02:17:02,638 --> 02:17:06,718
them any good by sitting there posting

3628
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:10,079
crap online that's what other people can

3629
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:11,678
do uh and they do and then they do it

3630
02:17:10,079 --> 02:17:14,398
quite well they do it much better than i

3631
02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:14,398
could ever do

3632
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:21,359
well you know hey uh go with your

3633
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:23,679
strengths i i i don't claim to be

3634
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:25,920
you know good at very much but i do try

3635
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:28,719
to be the best of of

3636
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:31,120
what my capabilities can do

3637
02:17:28,718 --> 02:17:32,718
in what i do so you know

3638
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:34,559
let those people go with their own

3639
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:35,438
strengths

3640
02:17:34,558 --> 02:17:38,558
yeah

3641
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:41,519
so there seems to always be a bit of a

3642
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:43,920
call that demand is always exceeding the

3643
02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:45,439
supply for your seeds do you tend to do

3644
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:47,200
that on purpose like do you limit your

3645
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:50,079
seed releases or is it just simply you

3646
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:52,479
know all you can do for the moment

3647
02:17:50,079 --> 02:17:54,558
well no i i mean i could produce much

3648
02:17:52,478 --> 02:17:57,199
more but

3649
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:59,199
most of

3650
02:17:57,200 --> 02:18:01,120
most of the reason that i keep the the

3651
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:03,519
seed restricted

3652
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:05,679
is because i'm

3653
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:06,800
the bigger picture of what my company is

3654
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:10,799
all about

3655
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:12,318
is development for the mass market when

3656
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:13,119
it comes time

3657
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:14,000
and

3658
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,479
the

3659
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:18,558
the seed business is an ancillary

3660
02:18:16,478 --> 02:18:19,760
offshoot of that

3661
02:18:18,558 --> 02:18:22,840
um

3662
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:26,239
that one generates the

3663
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:27,599
the necessary buzz to keep the product

3664
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:29,119
in demand

3665
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:31,120
but it also

3666
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,359
i do want

3667
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:35,599
i do want to share this with people and

3668
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:35,599
so

3669
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:41,200
you know

3670
02:18:36,718 --> 02:18:44,879
i'm getting to a point now where

3671
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:48,159
i'm trying to do both where i i i do

3672
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:50,159
want to expand enough to give people

3673
02:18:48,159 --> 02:18:52,799
the ability to be able to get a hold of

3674
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:55,519
the work if they want it but i also want

3675
02:18:52,799 --> 02:18:58,558
to have and capture those

3676
02:18:55,519 --> 02:19:00,318
very very specific phenotypes that i'm

3677
02:18:58,558 --> 02:19:01,279
looking for

3678
02:19:00,318 --> 02:19:03,519
and

3679
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:04,960
the primary reason why i'm making all

3680
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:09,599
the seed

3681
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:11,839
is for myself for that particular goal

3682
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:13,760
but yes i mean along the way other

3683
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:16,639
people should be able to share it and

3684
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:19,280
enjoy it and if i find really good

3685
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:21,438
plants i'll give them away just like i

3686
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:23,679
always have

3687
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:25,679
if they're interested enough in it and

3688
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:27,760
they want it and they need it for a

3689
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:29,280
particular reason or they just want it

3690
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:30,639
because they've seen it and they fell in

3691
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:32,479
love with it

3692
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:33,598
well that's reason enough let's give it

3693
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:35,519
to them

3694
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:38,000
you know because it doesn't change my

3695
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:39,840
work my work is is

3696
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,840
there's always going to be

3697
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:43,679
somebody wanting something from me in

3698
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:45,840
some way shape or form

3699
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:47,359
i just hope i can give it to them and be

3700
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:49,359
it one way or another whether it be

3701
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:51,520
providing seed to the public

3702
02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:54,159
or providing that one little plant for

3703
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:55,920
that person who really needs it because

3704
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:57,840
maybe they're bedridden and they you

3705
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:59,840
know they need it for pain or whatever

3706
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:03,520
it is that

3707
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:05,359
that's what god put me here for

3708
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:08,880
yeah that's what a you know kind of

3709
02:20:05,359 --> 02:20:11,680
great message to abide by

3710
02:20:08,879 --> 02:20:13,519
who are some of breeders from years gone

3711
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:15,120
by who are no longer putting out stuff

3712
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:16,640
and you know you really wish they were

3713
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,399
still around or you had some of their

3714
02:20:16,639 --> 02:20:20,719
stock

3715
02:20:18,398 --> 02:20:20,719
oh

3716
02:20:22,478 --> 02:20:27,358
you know

3717
02:20:24,478 --> 02:20:30,239
i would probably say just for the

3718
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:31,680
experiences that i've had

3719
02:20:30,239 --> 02:20:34,799
i would

3720
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:37,280
i kind of maybe would say

3721
02:20:34,799 --> 02:20:39,759
if i had to choose any one person it'd

3722
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:42,000
probably be reefer man

3723
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:45,359
just by virtue of the

3724
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:48,318
spread that he used to offer

3725
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:51,840
with some fairly predictable results

3726
02:20:48,318 --> 02:20:52,959
overall every time i i appreciate his

3727
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,960
work

3728
02:20:52,959 --> 02:20:56,159
yeah nice nice selection

3729
02:20:54,959 --> 02:20:58,639
so

3730
02:20:56,159 --> 02:21:00,959
sorry go on i'm sorry there are there

3731
02:20:58,639 --> 02:21:03,119
are very few

3732
02:21:00,959 --> 02:21:05,279
i mean i've tried the the

3733
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:07,040
barney's farm and and

3734
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:08,479
all the

3735
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:11,840
the ones that

3736
02:21:08,478 --> 02:21:15,358
were big names over in in europe and

3737
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:17,760
that's what pissed me off enough to

3738
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:19,680
to start really getting serious about

3739
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:20,559
getting this work out

3740
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:23,120
was

3741
02:21:20,559 --> 02:21:24,959
just the the lack of

3742
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:29,520
caring and the lack of

3743
02:21:24,959 --> 02:21:30,959
of consistency and the lack of of uh

3744
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:33,760
expression

3745
02:21:30,959 --> 02:21:35,919
versus sales you know what what was said

3746
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:39,120
isn't what i see and

3747
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:41,520
and that sort of thing so i i really got

3748
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:43,760
soured on growing other people's stuff

3749
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:45,280
there isn't a lot of stuff that i grow

3750
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:47,920
from other people

3751
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:49,439
you know it has to it usually it makes

3752
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:51,439
its way to me

3753
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:54,800
from people i trust

3754
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:56,559
who do grow other people's stuff and

3755
02:21:54,799 --> 02:21:58,318
they say hey you know you need to look

3756
02:21:56,559 --> 02:21:59,439
at this

3757
02:21:58,318 --> 02:22:00,959
yeah

3758
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:02,639
basically it

3759
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:03,839
so i don't grow a lot of other people's

3760
02:22:02,639 --> 02:22:05,439


3761
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:07,280
yeah i mean you had to learn the hard

3762
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:09,600
way right

3763
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:11,520
well you know ever

3764
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:14,479
yeah everybody has their own path and i

3765
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:17,120
would rather i've got like i said years

3766
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:18,398
of stuff that i still have to to go

3767
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:21,040
through and

3768
02:22:18,398 --> 02:22:23,840
and you know it never stops it's like

3769
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:25,920
the mail it never ends

3770
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:28,000
there's always something else to do

3771
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:30,079
always something else to check

3772
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,439
i'm looking at a pile of seed right now

3773
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:33,840
that

3774
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:35,680
is in a box

3775
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:38,478
that i need to go through that's just

3776
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:41,600
from this last year

3777
02:22:38,478 --> 02:22:43,920
that the box is like

3778
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:46,159
seven eight inches deep

3779
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:48,318
two feet wide and

3780
02:22:46,159 --> 02:22:50,398
about 32

3781
02:22:48,318 --> 02:22:52,398
33 inches long

3782
02:22:50,398 --> 02:22:53,439
and it's full

3783
02:22:52,398 --> 02:22:56,159
too much

3784
02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:57,840
that's just one

3785
02:22:56,159 --> 02:23:01,840
i need i need a

3786
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:03,520
bunch of acreage i got work to do

3787
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:05,520
so i mean that's the kind of thing that

3788
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:08,720
i you know i i just

3789
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:11,280
i i'm too focused in with my own stuff

3790
02:23:08,719 --> 02:23:13,760
to worry about other breeders and like i

3791
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,960
said i want the public to have as wide a

3792
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,478
variety

3793
02:23:14,959 --> 02:23:19,438
to choose from

3794
02:23:16,478 --> 02:23:21,840
as possible so i'm not going to mix it

3795
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:22,880
up and and and explore a lot of other

3796
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:25,920
breeding

3797
02:23:22,879 --> 02:23:28,719
because that's for the public to do and

3798
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:30,960
that's i'm i'm just here to serve the

3799
02:23:28,719 --> 02:23:33,279
public and that's not serving the public

3800
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:35,759
if i'm wasting my time growing other

3801
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:37,680
people's stuff that is ultimately not

3802
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:40,719
gonna i'm not gonna use because i just

3803
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:42,880
don't do that that is why i do

3804
02:23:40,719 --> 02:23:44,959
yeah understandable so i mean question

3805
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:46,959
on the similar lines as the last one

3806
02:23:44,959 --> 02:23:48,079
maybe going to be a bit of a hard one

3807
02:23:46,959 --> 02:23:50,959
because you may not have thought of this

3808
02:23:48,079 --> 02:23:53,920
but which one person has had the most

3809
02:23:50,959 --> 02:23:55,679
impact on your life in terms of cannabis

3810
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:57,439
luther burbank

3811
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:59,520
quick answer

3812
02:23:57,439 --> 02:24:01,200
well it's the only answer to that i

3813
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,120
think i've expressed that

3814
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:04,880
off and on throughout the interview is

3815
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:08,000
that that

3816
02:24:04,879 --> 02:24:10,159
you you've got to look at at a master

3817
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,680
craftsman who has

3818
02:24:10,159 --> 02:24:13,840
a

3819
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:17,760
very f

3820
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:21,359
fine view of what his goals were and

3821
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:24,398
the extent and the breadth and width of

3822
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:26,399
his work is staggering i mean i'm

3823
02:24:24,398 --> 02:24:28,478
working with one plant

3824
02:24:26,398 --> 02:24:30,000
that man worked with

3825
02:24:28,478 --> 02:24:31,760
amazing

3826
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,799
amounts of plants

3827
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:36,800
amazing amounts he he developed things

3828
02:24:34,799 --> 02:24:38,478
that

3829
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:40,398
are just

3830
02:24:38,478 --> 02:24:42,959
mind-boggling

3831
02:24:40,398 --> 02:24:45,119
and he did it all in a very short period

3832
02:24:42,959 --> 02:24:47,039
of time in his life really

3833
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,479
it's pretty amazing you gotta really

3834
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:51,359
respect him

3835
02:24:48,478 --> 02:24:52,959
and so yeah i i would say if people

3836
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:55,200
you know

3837
02:24:52,959 --> 02:24:57,279
did a little bit more reading about the

3838
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:58,960
basics that he would teach

3839
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:01,280
they could benefit quite a bit from the

3840
02:24:58,959 --> 02:25:03,119
breeding

3841
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:04,479
yeah great answer and i'm sure everyone

3842
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:06,079
probably has a little bit of homework to

3843
02:25:04,478 --> 02:25:08,478
do now

3844
02:25:06,079 --> 02:25:12,959
oh yeah well i think they'll be amazed

3845
02:25:08,478 --> 02:25:15,199
when they figure out like i said i mean

3846
02:25:12,959 --> 02:25:17,759
the the the potatoes that we know and

3847
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:20,399
love and he's the one who made them the

3848
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:21,520
blackberries the girl alongside

3849
02:25:20,398 --> 02:25:24,159
of the

3850
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:25,840
the roads here in northern california

3851
02:25:24,159 --> 02:25:28,398
and beyond

3852
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:31,040
they're all because of luther

3853
02:25:28,398 --> 02:25:33,680
it's it goes right on down the line it's

3854
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:35,040
it's absolutely incredible

3855
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:37,280
yeah without a doubt

3856
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:39,439
so we'll move on to getting towards the

3857
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:41,280
end of it we've now got some questions

3858
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:43,359
from the fans i think you saw that post

3859
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:45,439
so hopefully you haven't gone ahead and

3860
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:46,479
seen too many of them but the first one

3861
02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:47,920
is

3862
02:25:46,478 --> 02:25:50,879
where can we expect to see your work

3863
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:53,600
available in 2018

3864
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:55,279
well i'm working uh

3865
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:58,559
on trying to

3866
02:25:55,280 --> 02:26:00,239
do some refining of releases so

3867
02:25:58,559 --> 02:26:02,879
uh i the

3868
02:26:00,239 --> 02:26:05,600
the one thing that i'm hoping to do

3869
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:08,719
is to be able to late summer

3870
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:10,159
be able to release the next stage of the

3871
02:26:08,719 --> 02:26:13,358
pure gui

3872
02:26:10,159 --> 02:26:17,039
uh and that's being optimistic

3873
02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:18,960
but i i'm thinking it's doable

3874
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:21,520
and

3875
02:26:18,959 --> 02:26:24,719
as far as where to get them

3876
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:27,439
uh jbc.com is probably going to be

3877
02:26:24,719 --> 02:26:28,639
carrying a lot of lines of my individual

3878
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:29,680
reps

3879
02:26:28,639 --> 02:26:33,680
um

3880
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:37,840
in various places uh hawaii

3881
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:40,398
down in l.a in nevada

3882
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:42,960
those folks will be posting stuff

3883
02:26:40,398 --> 02:26:46,159
individually online that people can find

3884
02:26:42,959 --> 02:26:47,279
i what i try to do is give everybody

3885
02:26:46,159 --> 02:26:49,039
different

3886
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:51,120
sets of genetics

3887
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,960
so that

3888
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:56,319
they're not offering the same things so

3889
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:56,318
they overlap and everybody

3890
02:26:56,478 --> 02:26:59,840
is able to benefit that way and then

3891
02:26:58,398 --> 02:27:01,358
there's just

3892
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:03,600
more of a spread

3893
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:05,520
so that's the goal for

3894
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:08,960
2018 along with

3895
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:12,720
what i'm hoping to find is somebody in

3896
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:14,799
the northern california area who's got

3897
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:17,358
growable land

3898
02:27:14,799 --> 02:27:20,000
with a building on it

3899
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:24,079
that we can move into and and start

3900
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:26,398
developing some stuff under a state

3901
02:27:24,079 --> 02:27:26,398
um

3902
02:27:26,478 --> 02:27:33,199
guided licensing and uh

3903
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:35,359
all completely legal 100 that's our goal

3904
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,760
to get that set up

3905
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:39,920
and uh we're looking forward to uh

3906
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:42,960
hopefully making that happen we've got

3907
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:44,960
some leads we have a lot of uh

3908
02:27:42,959 --> 02:27:46,478
folks who are ready to invest in this

3909
02:27:44,959 --> 02:27:48,239
company

3910
02:27:46,478 --> 02:27:51,199
uh they're just waiting for those

3911
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:52,398
hurdles to be uh jumped over and so

3912
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,560
that's

3913
02:27:52,398 --> 02:27:56,159
what we're working on and once we do

3914
02:27:54,559 --> 02:27:59,600
that

3915
02:27:56,159 --> 02:28:01,600
people can look forward to

3916
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:03,760
a um

3917
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:06,318
a faster release time

3918
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:08,559
of materials because

3919
02:28:06,318 --> 02:28:10,239
the more space i've got i've got a lot

3920
02:28:08,559 --> 02:28:12,559
of space now

3921
02:28:10,239 --> 02:28:13,359
i have a lot of space now

3922
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:17,840
but

3923
02:28:13,359 --> 02:28:20,000
to get into a legal situation uh we need

3924
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:21,280
you know we needed another facility

3925
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,200
that's different than the ones that

3926
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:24,319
we're working with now

3927
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:26,479
so um

3928
02:28:24,318 --> 02:28:28,879
we're looking forward to that and that's

3929
02:28:26,478 --> 02:28:31,519
gonna really benefit everybody because

3930
02:28:28,879 --> 02:28:34,478
then i'm gonna try and bring the seed

3931
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:37,040
prices down that's my next goal

3932
02:28:34,478 --> 02:28:38,879
i think they're too high and i think you

3933
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:40,479
know people ought to be able to get a

3934
02:28:38,879 --> 02:28:43,119
beautiful result

3935
02:28:40,478 --> 02:28:44,478
that's fantastic for a really reasonable

3936
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:46,240
price and that's what we're looking

3937
02:28:44,478 --> 02:28:47,679
forward to

3938
02:28:46,239 --> 02:28:50,239
yeah sounds like a good outcome for

3939
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:53,280
everyone the next question

3940
02:28:50,239 --> 02:28:55,359
yeah sorry um the next question was

3941
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:57,200
someone said that they heard you pop

3942
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:58,640
beans in relation to the phases of the

3943
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:59,920
moon if that's true what are the

3944
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:03,039
benefits

3945
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:03,040
well you know i do

3946
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:06,319
yeah

3947
02:29:04,478 --> 02:29:09,519
in reality

3948
02:29:06,318 --> 02:29:11,920
there's very little benefit

3949
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:16,399
uh it's a fun little thing to do

3950
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:18,079
sometimes i will do that uh i have found

3951
02:29:16,398 --> 02:29:21,358
that you get a little bit of

3952
02:29:18,079 --> 02:29:24,559
acceleration especially with super moons

3953
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:25,840
but those are few and far between and a

3954
02:29:24,559 --> 02:29:27,840
lot of times they don't fall in the

3955
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:29,280
right times of the year but i have a

3956
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,680
tendency to just

3957
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:31,680
plant

3958
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:34,559
at least a couple of beans during super

3959
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:36,800
moons

3960
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:38,719
just because it's

3961
02:29:36,799 --> 02:29:41,759
been a long held

3962
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:44,318
belief that that accelerates things and

3963
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:47,200
gets them going whether i have not

3964
02:29:44,318 --> 02:29:47,199
found that to be

3965
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:55,439
really true insofar as a final outcome

3966
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:56,960
but it's a fun little thought and it's

3967
02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:58,639
just one of those things it's like

3968
02:29:56,959 --> 02:30:00,639
groundhog day you know thinking that the

3969
02:29:58,639 --> 02:30:02,879
groundhog coming out of the out of the

3970
02:30:00,639 --> 02:30:04,318
ground is gonna predict what kind of you

3971
02:30:02,879 --> 02:30:05,920
know forecast you're going to get the

3972
02:30:04,318 --> 02:30:07,920
next six weeks

3973
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:09,840
it's just it's along the same lines you

3974
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:10,879
know it's an old farmer's almanac kind

3975
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:12,318
of a thing

3976
02:30:10,879 --> 02:30:14,559
yeah no cool

3977
02:30:12,318 --> 02:30:16,799
so what are some of the techniques you

3978
02:30:14,559 --> 02:30:19,039
use for keeping such old clones in

3979
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:20,799
healthy condition

3980
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:23,920
well you keep healthy mothers and you

3981
02:30:20,799 --> 02:30:24,639
just keep you just keep flipping them

3982
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:26,719
and

3983
02:30:24,639 --> 02:30:28,799
producing the mothers off of that the

3984
02:30:26,719 --> 02:30:31,679
gooey mom that i have now is not the

3985
02:30:28,799 --> 02:30:33,519
original very original plant although it

3986
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:36,479
is

3987
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:38,720
it's the same exact plant and

3988
02:30:36,478 --> 02:30:39,920
for it

3989
02:30:38,719 --> 02:30:42,478
since i keep

3990
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:45,760
the the lights on 24 7

3991
02:30:42,478 --> 02:30:47,840
on mother plants like gooey

3992
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:50,398
all the time plants don't know how to

3993
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:52,159
tell time and to them it's just one long

3994
02:30:50,398 --> 02:30:54,159
day

3995
02:30:52,159 --> 02:30:55,840
and so it doesn't know

3996
02:30:54,159 --> 02:30:58,318
and i just keep

3997
02:30:55,840 --> 02:31:00,880
clones going and and make

3998
02:30:58,318 --> 02:31:02,719
mothers off of those and then clip those

3999
02:31:00,879 --> 02:31:07,679
and you just keep on going

4000
02:31:02,719 --> 02:31:07,679
and it is the same plant

4001
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:12,478
but you just have to be diligent about

4002
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:16,000
keeping your clones going through all

4003
02:31:12,478 --> 02:31:17,760
those years and that's what i've done

4004
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,200
i have other plants that are very old

4005
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:21,200
too

4006
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:22,800
yeah like like the

4007
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:25,040
stock you're using around the same time

4008
02:31:22,799 --> 02:31:28,000
type of thing

4009
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:30,560
not quite that old but no but uh you

4010
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,000
know there's some i have a few

4011
02:31:30,559 --> 02:31:34,559
jamaicany

4012
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,398
uh varieties that are just wonderful

4013
02:31:34,559 --> 02:31:37,519
spearmint gum kind of things that i'm

4014
02:31:36,398 --> 02:31:39,119
developing

4015
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:41,280
they're

4016
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:42,800
they've always proved to be you know

4017
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:44,880
those

4018
02:31:42,799 --> 02:31:47,039
bright speaker kind of plants you know

4019
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:50,079
the the carrier plants

4020
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:53,840
um uh and uh

4021
02:31:50,079 --> 02:31:55,200
now dark desire is getting older uh

4022
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:57,840
that that's

4023
02:31:55,200 --> 02:32:00,560
at least seven years old now

4024
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:02,239
and it just goes so fast time just goes

4025
02:32:00,559 --> 02:32:04,559
by so fast

4026
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:07,280
ain't that the truth d have you have you

4027
02:32:04,559 --> 02:32:09,519
noticed any of your older clones

4028
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:11,760
uh kind of degrade in any regard because

4029
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:13,600
some people have said that

4030
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:15,760
even despite best efforts yeah it

4031
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:20,239
happens

4032
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:22,719
yeah what the i i am always skeptical of

4033
02:32:20,239 --> 02:32:26,079
genetic drift i think it i think it

4034
02:32:22,719 --> 02:32:28,478
would take a long time

4035
02:32:26,079 --> 02:32:31,439
i mean i used tomatoes as an example

4036
02:32:28,478 --> 02:32:33,199
there's there's tomato heirloom tomatoes

4037
02:32:31,439 --> 02:32:35,200
that are plants that have been growing

4038
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:36,079
for over 100 years

4039
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:38,640
and

4040
02:32:36,079 --> 02:32:40,959
their fruit is just as tasty and

4041
02:32:38,639 --> 02:32:42,639
delicious as it always has been

4042
02:32:40,959 --> 02:32:46,079
but

4043
02:32:42,639 --> 02:32:50,159
genetic drift is really i think what

4044
02:32:46,079 --> 02:32:50,159
you're seeing is an expression of micro

4045
02:32:50,799 --> 02:32:56,239
climates and

4046
02:32:52,398 --> 02:33:00,799
very small changes in environment be it

4047
02:32:56,239 --> 02:33:02,959
soil conditions uh nutrient levels ph

4048
02:33:00,799 --> 02:33:03,759
all these different things come into

4049
02:33:02,959 --> 02:33:05,279
play

4050
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:08,159
and can

4051
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:11,600
deceive people into thinking that

4052
02:33:08,159 --> 02:33:14,559
a genetic drift is happening it

4053
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:16,239
for the cosmic forces to come along and

4054
02:33:14,559 --> 02:33:18,398
degrade

4055
02:33:16,239 --> 02:33:21,119
genetics to that point

4056
02:33:18,398 --> 02:33:23,199
takes a long long

4057
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:25,280
long long time

4058
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:27,920
and i just don't think people are are

4059
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:31,280
alive long enough to really notice that

4060
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:33,040
in a given example and i use gui as a

4061
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:35,359
perfect example because

4062
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:38,720
i it's been around so long that there's

4063
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:40,640
people that i have not seen for decades

4064
02:33:38,719 --> 02:33:42,719
that when i hand them a joint of this

4065
02:33:40,639 --> 02:33:44,000
they look at me and and they just look

4066
02:33:42,719 --> 02:33:45,599
at me and they go

4067
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:49,359
this tastes

4068
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:51,120
exactly the same and this feels exactly

4069
02:33:49,359 --> 02:33:51,920
like i remember it

4070
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:53,120
and

4071
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:55,840
that's

4072
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:59,359
that to me just says well yeah i know

4073
02:33:55,840 --> 02:34:01,040
yeah it's grown in exactly the same way

4074
02:33:59,359 --> 02:34:03,520
that you remember it

4075
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:05,439
you know using the same mediums like i

4076
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:06,560
always tell people with gooey

4077
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:09,040
uh

4078
02:34:06,559 --> 02:34:11,039
i like gooey the best grown in

4079
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:12,960
rock wool with general hydroponics

4080
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:18,319
nutrients

4081
02:34:12,959 --> 02:34:20,799
it has a particular flavor out of that

4082
02:34:18,318 --> 02:34:22,478
and eat the only other variable i would

4083
02:34:20,799 --> 02:34:24,478
say is

4084
02:34:22,478 --> 02:34:26,879
that i do

4085
02:34:24,478 --> 02:34:28,478
like the flavor of a metal halide in

4086
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:31,279
that situation

4087
02:34:28,478 --> 02:34:34,000
better than a high pressure sodium

4088
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:35,840
but i'm growing more

4089
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:39,439
towards leds

4090
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:43,200
as they develop and get better

4091
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:45,760
so um but a specific

4092
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:48,640
heavy blue light that comes from the

4093
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:50,318
metal halide has a particular flavor

4094
02:34:48,639 --> 02:34:53,039
enhancer

4095
02:34:50,318 --> 02:34:55,760
in gooey that brings more of the sharp

4096
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:57,359
sweet flavors forward and i really like

4097
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:59,200
that

4098
02:34:57,359 --> 02:35:00,079
the next one is we've got someone who

4099
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:01,600
says

4100
02:35:00,079 --> 02:35:03,520
they've got an old pack labelled

4101
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:06,159
superstar and they're just wondering

4102
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:06,159
what's in that

4103
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:11,600
oh gosh

4104
02:35:10,159 --> 02:35:15,039
i think they said one of the parents

4105
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:15,040
might be old men do hayes

4106
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:22,639
i cannot remember that i i i remember

4107
02:35:20,159 --> 02:35:24,000
that the name i don't remember what

4108
02:35:22,639 --> 02:35:26,079
what's in it

4109
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:29,359
um

4110
02:35:26,079 --> 02:35:31,359
i remember it being a bright

4111
02:35:29,359 --> 02:35:33,359
gosh i'd have to look at my notes and i

4112
02:35:31,359 --> 02:35:35,600
don't have them with me

4113
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:35,600
um

4114
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:42,080
no that escapes me

4115
02:35:40,959 --> 02:35:43,839
that one

4116
02:35:42,079 --> 02:35:46,639
that's so good the old mine just isn't

4117
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:48,880
clicking for that one i'm sorry

4118
02:35:46,639 --> 02:35:50,799
uh we've got one question here it's

4119
02:35:48,879 --> 02:35:52,559
what would be your recommendations for

4120
02:35:50,799 --> 02:35:55,599
breeding against recessive auto

4121
02:35:52,559 --> 02:35:57,680
flowering traits

4122
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:58,559
testing

4123
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:00,639
male

4124
02:35:58,559 --> 02:36:03,760
male selection and testing it's just

4125
02:36:00,639 --> 02:36:05,599
that simple it's like any other trait

4126
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:09,600
that you're trying to breed away from or

4127
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:12,318
breed too it's testing you know

4128
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:13,280
do it till you're satisfied

4129
02:36:12,318 --> 02:36:16,000
i mean

4130
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:18,560
i i don't i don't

4131
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:22,239
nine times out of ten any problem that

4132
02:36:18,559 --> 02:36:24,959
people have with this stuff can be fixed

4133
02:36:22,239 --> 02:36:27,600
with just doing the proper testing and

4134
02:36:24,959 --> 02:36:28,719
that means proper testing involves

4135
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:31,200
stress

4136
02:36:28,719 --> 02:36:33,519
it involves different situations it

4137
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:34,560
involves putting the plant through its

4138
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:37,040
paces

4139
02:36:34,559 --> 02:36:38,799
that's how you get strong plants that

4140
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:41,439
are well developed and can be

4141
02:36:38,799 --> 02:36:44,639
predictable and can take a punch you

4142
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:46,239
know is by do and and and

4143
02:36:44,639 --> 02:36:48,398
to me if it's

4144
02:36:46,239 --> 02:36:51,520
if if you're

4145
02:36:48,398 --> 02:36:53,840
if you have have that genetic in there

4146
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:56,560
you get rid of it and and get rid of the

4147
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:58,639
whole line i can use zinn as the example

4148
02:36:56,559 --> 02:37:01,039
like i said i got rid of zen because of

4149
02:36:58,639 --> 02:37:05,279
that it had a recessive that i couldn't

4150
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:08,319
get rid of that it just it would appear

4151
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:11,280
not in the first couple of of cross

4152
02:37:08,318 --> 02:37:12,799
backs or or even with other stuff

4153
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:15,600
but it would come out in the fourth

4154
02:37:12,799 --> 02:37:18,000
generation and it would be really

4155
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:19,040
prevalent well that's not acceptable get

4156
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:21,280
rid of it

4157
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:23,439
so that's how you deal with it you get

4158
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:26,479
it out of the gene pool

4159
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:27,680
but you can't know that until you test

4160
02:37:26,478 --> 02:37:30,478
yeah

4161
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:32,880
so when you select males do you like to

4162
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:34,559
leave them all kind of untopped

4163
02:37:32,879 --> 02:37:36,000
untrained and just see the natural

4164
02:37:34,559 --> 02:37:36,959
expression

4165
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:41,760
yeah

4166
02:37:36,959 --> 02:37:41,759
oh everything i do is not all natural

4167
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:46,719
what good is what good is changing the

4168
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:51,439
shape gonna tell you what what good is

4169
02:37:46,719 --> 02:37:53,679
ch is is allowing a plant to develop in

4170
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:54,720
a different way other than the way that

4171
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:56,720
you

4172
02:37:54,719 --> 02:38:00,318
bred it to grow

4173
02:37:56,719 --> 02:38:02,398
i i i don't understand that i ha that

4174
02:38:00,318 --> 02:38:03,600
doesn't tell you anything

4175
02:38:02,398 --> 02:38:05,439
what you

4176
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:07,120
how can you speak intelligently about

4177
02:38:05,439 --> 02:38:09,760
how big a plant is going to get if you

4178
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:12,960
interrupt that and send it sideways

4179
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:15,840
yeah good point good point so

4180
02:38:12,959 --> 02:38:18,239
yeah no no you leave everything natural

4181
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:19,520
that's why i said before

4182
02:38:18,239 --> 02:38:21,840
all of my

4183
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:24,560
all of the stuff that people see

4184
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:27,920
all the stuff that

4185
02:38:24,559 --> 02:38:29,680
i tell people how it is is based on a

4186
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:30,639
one gallon pot

4187
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:33,280
with

4188
02:38:30,639 --> 02:38:35,760
a store-bought soil and a little cow

4189
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:38,960
poop and water

4190
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:41,280
yeah that's it i mean because you you

4191
02:38:38,959 --> 02:38:42,559
need to have a standard

4192
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:46,000
it's it

4193
02:38:42,559 --> 02:38:48,719
in basic science it's controls and

4194
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:51,439
that's the control that you're using

4195
02:38:48,719 --> 02:38:53,199
that way the only if everything is

4196
02:38:51,439 --> 02:38:55,760
getting the same light they're getting

4197
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:56,800
the same water they're getting the same

4198
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:57,680
air

4199
02:38:56,799 --> 02:38:59,840
and

4200
02:38:57,680 --> 02:39:01,920
and they've got all got the same soil

4201
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:04,960
the only thing that's left is now is for

4202
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:07,600
them to express what the genetics have

4203
02:39:04,959 --> 02:39:11,358
and that's what you want to find out

4204
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:14,079
so it's basically that simple

4205
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:17,120
yeah so we've got another question here

4206
02:39:14,079 --> 02:39:19,520
which says do you know if any of your

4207
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:21,280
current strains you've made are notably

4208
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:24,239
good for migraines

4209
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:27,760
yeah gooey is good for migraines like i

4210
02:39:24,239 --> 02:39:30,079
said before the uh nerve pain uh it's

4211
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:32,800
been notably you know like multiple

4212
02:39:30,079 --> 02:39:33,920
sclerosis and stuff uh patients really

4213
02:39:32,799 --> 02:39:36,799
report a

4214
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:40,000
really good relief from from that and

4215
02:39:36,799 --> 02:39:42,000
that's why i'm really hot to get that

4216
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,239
strain back out on the market

4217
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:47,680
because it overall it's just a good

4218
02:39:44,239 --> 02:39:50,840
medical strain it has multiple uses a

4219
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:54,398
very wide spectrum

4220
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:57,040
of effects that are that can serve a lot

4221
02:39:54,398 --> 02:39:59,920
of people and migraines are one of them

4222
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:02,800
uh another one

4223
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:04,239
uh that would be currently available for

4224
02:40:02,799 --> 02:40:07,279
that

4225
02:40:04,239 --> 02:40:09,840
would probably afguay island

4226
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:12,159
um because it's got a lot of it's a it's

4227
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:14,478
it's our cbd

4228
02:40:12,159 --> 02:40:16,639
dominant strain

4229
02:40:14,478 --> 02:40:17,760
um and it's really good for pain that

4230
02:40:16,639 --> 02:40:19,680
way too

4231
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:22,800
there's not a lot of it out there but i

4232
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:22,800
know that um

4233
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:28,079
jvc right now has it in stock

4234
02:40:26,799 --> 02:40:31,199
so

4235
02:40:28,079 --> 02:40:33,039
and if you were to look to pursue a cbd

4236
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:34,800
project further would you want to look

4237
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:36,640
within the lines you have now to find

4238
02:40:34,799 --> 02:40:39,119
cbd or would you consider bringing like

4239
02:40:36,639 --> 02:40:41,439
you know a charlotte's web type thing in

4240
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:42,720
oh i've got plenty of stuff to work off

4241
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:45,920
of including

4242
02:40:42,719 --> 02:40:47,438
uh hemp uh you know from the midwest

4243
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:50,879
that is just

4244
02:40:47,439 --> 02:40:53,840
really it has copulus amounts of it

4245
02:40:50,879 --> 02:40:56,478
just wonderful to work with him to be my

4246
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:57,840
first choice

4247
02:40:56,478 --> 02:40:59,039
yeah that's that's an interesting point

4248
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:00,559
which hasn't really been mentioned

4249
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:02,960
before

4250
02:41:00,559 --> 02:41:05,600
yeah i think it's i think it needs to be

4251
02:41:02,959 --> 02:41:08,478
um you know exploited more because

4252
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:11,680
um what my company and the website

4253
02:41:08,478 --> 02:41:14,239
details is that there's a

4254
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:17,520
component that we want to develop

4255
02:41:14,239 --> 02:41:21,119
where we utilize the

4256
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:23,520
refuse of the of the uh

4257
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:26,240
industry and turn it into

4258
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:27,840
different products and and

4259
02:41:26,239 --> 02:41:30,239
be able to serve the

4260
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:31,680
making the use of the whole plant right

4261
02:41:30,239 --> 02:41:33,840
on down to the

4262
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:35,840
the stocks with making it turning in

4263
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:38,559
building materials and that sort of

4264
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:41,279
things textiles and and all that stuff

4265
02:41:38,559 --> 02:41:43,278
and and part of that is the cbd

4266
02:41:41,279 --> 02:41:46,399
production because you're going to find

4267
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:48,000
that i think whole plant

4268
02:41:46,398 --> 02:41:51,519
material

4269
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:53,840
works the best in certain instances and

4270
02:41:51,520 --> 02:41:56,399
people who using cbd i think would

4271
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:58,398
benefit more from whole plant production

4272
02:41:56,398 --> 02:42:00,000
than just targeted

4273
02:41:58,398 --> 02:42:02,159
um

4274
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:04,478
extraction like that right i think

4275
02:42:02,159 --> 02:42:06,639
there's a lot more benefits to it

4276
02:42:04,478 --> 02:42:09,278
that way than than people

4277
02:42:06,639 --> 02:42:11,680
are crediting and i think hemp would be

4278
02:42:09,279 --> 02:42:14,159
the the target for that because it's

4279
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:16,800
just already so rich and

4280
02:42:14,159 --> 02:42:17,840
well within government compliant you

4281
02:42:16,799 --> 02:42:20,318
know

4282
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:22,000
regulations for thc and stuff

4283
02:42:20,318 --> 02:42:24,318
it's really low

4284
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:28,000
so you know that's just a quicker avenue

4285
02:42:24,318 --> 02:42:30,478
to go by is is is using hemp i i've even

4286
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:34,318
found that when you buy

4287
02:42:30,478 --> 02:42:36,559
bird seed that is supposedly sterilized

4288
02:42:34,318 --> 02:42:38,559
30 percent of that

4289
02:42:36,559 --> 02:42:41,760
bag of big

4290
02:42:38,559 --> 02:42:44,318
bird seed will will germinate and uh

4291
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:46,318
generally it comes from hemp and so

4292
02:42:44,318 --> 02:42:48,719
if people want a little tip they can go

4293
02:42:46,318 --> 02:42:50,318
out there and get that and try it and

4294
02:42:48,719 --> 02:42:51,599
they'll find that they get a percentage

4295
02:42:50,318 --> 02:42:53,278
of them to grow

4296
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:56,318
and then they can use that as a whole

4297
02:42:53,279 --> 02:42:57,920
plant source to be able to

4298
02:42:56,318 --> 02:43:00,719
do the treatments and i think they'll

4299
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:02,719
really benefit from it

4300
02:43:00,719 --> 02:43:04,639
wow because we i've been interested in

4301
02:43:02,719 --> 02:43:07,358
getting more information on things like

4302
02:43:04,639 --> 02:43:08,398
the the fico like the full extract and a

4303
02:43:07,359 --> 02:43:10,399
lot of people are just not that

4304
02:43:08,398 --> 02:43:12,398
experienced with it

4305
02:43:10,398 --> 02:43:14,159
no i mean you're going to run into that

4306
02:43:12,398 --> 02:43:18,079
because it's so new

4307
02:43:14,159 --> 02:43:20,478
um but there's such a focus on it and

4308
02:43:18,079 --> 02:43:22,719
in here in california there's so many

4309
02:43:20,478 --> 02:43:24,639
people there are focused on that it's

4310
02:43:22,719 --> 02:43:27,039
really fast developing

4311
02:43:24,639 --> 02:43:28,639
uh people are getting better refinement

4312
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:29,920
they know what they're

4313
02:43:28,639 --> 02:43:32,079
they're doing

4314
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:34,398
they've got specialized people

4315
02:43:32,079 --> 02:43:36,559
that are working on these products and

4316
02:43:34,398 --> 02:43:38,719
you're you're really seeing a lot of

4317
02:43:36,559 --> 02:43:40,478
good results gosh yeah

4318
02:43:38,719 --> 02:43:43,358
i'm seeing more and more of it all the

4319
02:43:40,478 --> 02:43:45,920
time it's just wonderful

4320
02:43:43,359 --> 02:43:47,279
yeah nice so we're on to our last little

4321
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:49,279
part of the interview now which i like

4322
02:43:47,279 --> 02:43:51,200
to call the quickfire questions that

4323
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:52,319
hopefully a little more short response

4324
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:55,120
ones

4325
02:43:52,318 --> 02:43:58,079
so first one what was the last strain to

4326
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:58,079
really blow you away

4327
02:44:02,478 --> 02:44:07,199
from other people and anything could be

4328
02:44:04,639 --> 02:44:10,719
your homework anything you know i have

4329
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:12,000
to always go back i i i love

4330
02:44:10,719 --> 02:44:14,799
pearl tie

4331
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,719
pearl tie is one of my favorite ties

4332
02:44:14,799 --> 02:44:19,119
um and

4333
02:44:16,719 --> 02:44:20,639
i i think the the last time that i had a

4334
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:22,880
good pearl tie

4335
02:44:20,639 --> 02:44:25,760
was several years ago but

4336
02:44:22,879 --> 02:44:28,959
it it's one of those

4337
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:31,040
strains that sticks with you

4338
02:44:28,959 --> 02:44:32,719
uh and gives you

4339
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:35,200
a perspective that you just don't

4340
02:44:32,719 --> 02:44:39,278
usually get from pot and that's

4341
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:41,920
that's one of them i i love pearl ties

4342
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:44,720
the pearl ties that are around today i

4343
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:49,120
know barney's farm has a tie that looks

4344
02:44:44,719 --> 02:44:49,119
like it i think it's the grinspoon

4345
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:52,318
strain

4346
02:44:52,559 --> 02:44:57,199
it isn't quite up to par

4347
02:44:54,959 --> 02:45:00,000
i know bodhi has

4348
02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:01,040
a a better example he had some at the

4349
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,879
cup

4350
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:04,560
uh there this last

4351
02:45:02,879 --> 02:45:07,920
year he actually was handing out

4352
02:45:04,559 --> 02:45:10,239
handfuls of it and as soon as i he

4353
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:13,680
he i took a look at it i said oh darn

4354
02:45:10,239 --> 02:45:15,359
tai hon he goes ooh yeah you know huh

4355
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:17,680
yeah i like it

4356
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:19,279
uh and so actually i there were some

4357
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:22,720
seeds in that and i've got them growing

4358
02:45:19,279 --> 02:45:25,760
right now so we'll see if that continues

4359
02:45:22,719 --> 02:45:27,840
on but it's kind of like bodhi said it's

4360
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:29,359
kind of one of those highs that makes

4361
02:45:27,840 --> 02:45:30,960
you sit there and stare at your feet for

4362
02:45:29,359 --> 02:45:33,279
a while

4363
02:45:30,959 --> 02:45:34,639
yeah so it's so funny

4364
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:36,159
sorry i was gonna say it's it's so funny

4365
02:45:34,639 --> 02:45:38,559
you mentioned that because

4366
02:45:36,159 --> 02:45:40,398
of the trip i most recently did that tie

4367
02:45:38,559 --> 02:45:42,239
from bodhi the pearl tie was definitely

4368
02:45:40,398 --> 02:45:44,079
the stand out to me and i can attest

4369
02:45:42,239 --> 02:45:46,000
it'll stay with me it was

4370
02:45:44,079 --> 02:45:48,079
unlike anything and just to touch on

4371
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:50,398
that point you made about um barney's

4372
02:45:48,079 --> 02:45:52,079
farm i think the information that's come

4373
02:45:50,398 --> 02:45:53,760
out recently is that you're right it's

4374
02:45:52,079 --> 02:45:55,760
not a tie what they're offering they're

4375
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:58,800
actually offering an s1 of funnily

4376
02:45:55,760 --> 02:46:01,439
enough a reefer man strain and it's his

4377
02:45:58,799 --> 02:46:04,000
one called senor garcia which was the

4378
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:06,318
oregon blue tie cross

4379
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:07,600
yeah so that's why it's got that look

4380
02:46:06,318 --> 02:46:10,079
but you're right it's very much the

4381
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:12,559
poster child for that kind of pearl thai

4382
02:46:10,079 --> 02:46:16,639
alternating calyx look isn't it

4383
02:46:12,559 --> 02:46:19,119
right right with the old days

4384
02:46:16,639 --> 02:46:23,278
that pearl the pearl tie that was like

4385
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:26,560
that had a very strawberry presence to

4386
02:46:23,279 --> 02:46:29,840
it its flavor and you the stems were

4387
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:32,000
just covered in resin it was just this

4388
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:33,680
big space of stem

4389
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:36,799
covered in resin and then a couple of

4390
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:40,318
little poofs of flour and then a leaf or

4391
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:43,039
two and and then but oh it was just so

4392
02:46:40,318 --> 02:46:44,159
good and the eye was just so

4393
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:47,680
um

4394
02:46:44,159 --> 02:46:50,879
uh satisfying and rich and the flavor

4395
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:53,920
was just overwhelming i that's what i

4396
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:55,599
really enjoy i i i miss that pot

4397
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:57,520
probably more

4398
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:59,920
than just about anything other than

4399
02:46:57,520 --> 02:47:02,720
maybe an old congolese

4400
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:05,200
that i tried in england uh

4401
02:47:02,719 --> 02:47:06,559
that was actually quite frankly the same

4402
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:09,520
structure

4403
02:47:06,559 --> 02:47:11,920
uh just really red

4404
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:13,439
yeah wow have you looked into coastal

4405
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:15,600
seeds work at all i know they've got

4406
02:47:13,439 --> 02:47:18,479
access to some nice congolese

4407
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:20,079
uh you know i did try that and as a

4408
02:47:18,478 --> 02:47:22,159
matter of fact and i didn't find it to

4409
02:47:20,079 --> 02:47:25,520
be anywhere close to what i remember

4410
02:47:22,159 --> 02:47:28,398
what the the original stuff was

4411
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:30,640
i was actually quite disappointed but uh

4412
02:47:28,398 --> 02:47:31,519
you know you can't i like i said i'm

4413
02:47:30,639 --> 02:47:34,079
really

4414
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:36,399
really picky and it's not it's not fair

4415
02:47:34,079 --> 02:47:39,439
to them because that work you know may

4416
02:47:36,398 --> 02:47:41,840
be fine uh it's just not

4417
02:47:39,439 --> 02:47:43,359
what i would have targeted no not

4418
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:45,920
i i wouldn't

4419
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:47,439
gravitate towards it as a result of my

4420
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:48,879
knowledge but like i said that's what i

4421
02:47:47,439 --> 02:47:52,960
was saying before

4422
02:47:48,879 --> 02:47:54,799
your your history really colors what you

4423
02:47:52,959 --> 02:47:57,519
what you know and and

4424
02:47:54,799 --> 02:48:00,079
quite frankly i'm a dying breed you know

4425
02:47:57,520 --> 02:48:02,720
pretty soon i'll be gone and

4426
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:04,639
that memory of those types of ties will

4427
02:48:02,719 --> 02:48:07,278
go with me and

4428
02:48:04,639 --> 02:48:09,439
unfortunately i hate to see that for

4429
02:48:07,279 --> 02:48:11,840
young people because gosh

4430
02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:13,040
the the history is so rich and so

4431
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:15,680
delicious

4432
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:18,640
i'm sad that that that more people can't

4433
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:20,318
experience it the way i remember it

4434
02:48:18,639 --> 02:48:22,079
yeah undoubtedly

4435
02:48:20,318 --> 02:48:25,760
so next question is

4436
02:48:22,079 --> 02:48:25,760
what's your favorite smoke right now

4437
02:48:26,799 --> 02:48:32,959
um

4438
02:48:28,639 --> 02:48:36,799
well if i was to pick an outside

4439
02:48:32,959 --> 02:48:37,919
source right now north star's um

4440
02:48:36,799 --> 02:48:39,599
moon

4441
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:40,799
shadow

4442
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:43,600
uh has

4443
02:48:40,799 --> 02:48:44,398
he used the old mendo haze in it and he

4444
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:46,399
did

4445
02:48:44,398 --> 02:48:50,159
he mixed it in with something else that

4446
02:48:46,398 --> 02:48:52,799
i don't know what it is but it's just

4447
02:48:50,159 --> 02:48:56,318
really really really flavorful and

4448
02:48:52,799 --> 02:48:58,559
really nice and i i really

4449
02:48:56,318 --> 02:49:01,278
am enjoying that

4450
02:48:58,559 --> 02:49:02,239
as far as a smoke i only have it in full

4451
02:49:01,279 --> 02:49:04,640
melt

4452
02:49:02,239 --> 02:49:07,680
but um

4453
02:49:04,639 --> 02:49:10,079
it's it's good i normally don't smoke

4454
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:11,040
concentrates and extracts

4455
02:49:10,079 --> 02:49:13,439
but

4456
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:15,040
that one i make an exception

4457
02:49:13,439 --> 02:49:17,680
so

4458
02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:18,800
i'm enjoying that work other than that

4459
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:23,279
i just

4460
02:49:18,799 --> 02:49:24,840
i i constantly smoke old mendo haze

4461
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:27,600
gooey

4462
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:28,639
um dark desire

4463
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:30,880
and

4464
02:49:28,639 --> 02:49:30,879
um

4465
02:49:31,439 --> 02:49:36,000
midnight snow

4466
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:37,359
as as as ones that i will

4467
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,200
go to

4468
02:49:37,359 --> 02:49:40,880
day in and day out

4469
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:43,120
the jamaican

4470
02:49:40,879 --> 02:49:45,599
if i want a kind of a spearmint gum kind

4471
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:46,640
of a flavor i will go to that

4472
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:48,479
um

4473
02:49:46,639 --> 02:49:49,519
and if i want to have something that's

4474
02:49:48,478 --> 02:49:54,159
nice and

4475
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:57,120
and cerebral that i have a few uh

4476
02:49:54,159 --> 02:49:59,200
individual plants that

4477
02:49:57,120 --> 02:50:00,720
their their origin escapes me at the

4478
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:03,279
moment

4479
02:50:00,719 --> 02:50:06,478
um but they are sativas one of them is a

4480
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:08,800
mexican-based one that i smoke that i

4481
02:50:06,478 --> 02:50:11,840
really enjoy too but

4482
02:50:08,799 --> 02:50:12,639
for the most part again i i've got too

4483
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:14,799
much

4484
02:50:12,639 --> 02:50:16,239
material to go through

4485
02:50:14,799 --> 02:50:18,719
and i

4486
02:50:16,239 --> 02:50:20,478
the most the smoking i do

4487
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:23,438
isn't for pleasure it's

4488
02:50:20,478 --> 02:50:26,478
basically for research to find out what

4489
02:50:23,439 --> 02:50:27,279
i want to go to next

4490
02:50:26,478 --> 02:50:29,278
so

4491
02:50:27,279 --> 02:50:31,520
i know you're not that big into kind of

4492
02:50:29,279 --> 02:50:33,040
you know strain of the month type things

4493
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:34,720
but out of everything you've tried over

4494
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:36,880
the years what was the one thing where

4495
02:50:34,719 --> 02:50:38,318
it was the least memorable to you but it

4496
02:50:36,879 --> 02:50:40,959
seemed to get quite a lot of traction

4497
02:50:38,318 --> 02:50:40,959
with the public

4498
02:50:41,379 --> 02:50:48,920
[Laughter]

4499
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:48,920
oh gosh

4500
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,239
wow

4501
02:50:52,559 --> 02:50:56,559
jack the ripper comes to mind

4502
02:50:54,079 --> 02:50:58,879
immediately um

4503
02:50:56,559 --> 02:51:01,039
but beyond that

4504
02:50:58,879 --> 02:51:01,039
the

4505
02:51:01,279 --> 02:51:04,640
the old bubble gums i was always

4506
02:51:02,959 --> 02:51:08,398
disappointed in those because i never

4507
02:51:04,639 --> 02:51:08,398
could find a good bubble gum fino

4508
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:14,959
and i was disappointed

4509
02:51:12,159 --> 02:51:16,239
quite frankly in the northern lights

4510
02:51:14,959 --> 02:51:18,799
varieties

4511
02:51:16,239 --> 02:51:20,000
i i thought that i never could really

4512
02:51:18,799 --> 02:51:22,318
understand

4513
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:24,478
why they were as popular as they are and

4514
02:51:22,318 --> 02:51:26,719
the white widows i i never could

4515
02:51:24,478 --> 02:51:27,599
understand that either i always thought

4516
02:51:26,719 --> 02:51:28,959
that

4517
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:30,960
they lacked

4518
02:51:28,959 --> 02:51:32,639
huge

4519
02:51:30,959 --> 02:51:36,159
yeah interesting answers

4520
02:51:32,639 --> 02:51:37,920
so the next next question oh sorry gun

4521
02:51:36,159 --> 02:51:40,318
well i just i don't want it like i said

4522
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:43,840
i don't downgrade other people's work i

4523
02:51:40,318 --> 02:51:45,519
as a as a rule it's just that i'm really

4524
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:48,398
picky and i'm

4525
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:50,720
it has to have it all in order to

4526
02:51:48,398 --> 02:51:52,159
impress me

4527
02:51:50,719 --> 02:51:54,398
yeah no doubt

4528
02:51:52,159 --> 02:51:56,639
so if you could only pick either indoor

4529
02:51:54,398 --> 02:51:58,840
growing outdoor growing or greenhouse

4530
02:51:56,639 --> 02:52:02,318
growing which would you

4531
02:51:58,840 --> 02:52:02,318
pick oh

4532
02:52:04,639 --> 02:52:09,519
i do all of those i uh and each one has

4533
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:13,359
their purpose

4534
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:15,760
uh i i i would have to say if i was

4535
02:52:13,359 --> 02:52:17,279
on a desert island and i could only have

4536
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:18,478
one

4537
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:19,279
you know

4538
02:52:18,478 --> 02:52:22,799
i

4539
02:52:19,279 --> 02:52:22,800
unfortunately i'd have to say

4540
02:52:23,359 --> 02:52:28,479
i'm torn between greenhouse and indoor

4541
02:52:26,478 --> 02:52:29,679
only because

4542
02:52:28,478 --> 02:52:31,840
um

4543
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:34,880
and i would probably if i had to choose

4544
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:37,760
between those two i'd have to say indoor

4545
02:52:34,879 --> 02:52:40,719
and the only reason is is control

4546
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:42,960
environment completely

4547
02:52:40,719 --> 02:52:45,358
and and and

4548
02:52:42,959 --> 02:52:46,959
for my purposes i like a controlled

4549
02:52:45,359 --> 02:52:49,120
environment

4550
02:52:46,959 --> 02:52:51,039
doesn't mean i don't use the outside it

4551
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:53,680
doesn't mean i don't use greenhouses

4552
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:54,840
because i love greenhouses and i love

4553
02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:58,318
growing

4554
02:52:54,840 --> 02:53:00,000
outside but if i only had one

4555
02:52:58,318 --> 02:53:02,079
it would have to be that that's the

4556
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:04,159
indoor

4557
02:53:02,079 --> 02:53:06,318
so do you have any land race varieties

4558
02:53:04,159 --> 02:53:07,920
that you know you yet to crack into but

4559
02:53:06,318 --> 02:53:10,639
you're kind of thinking to do it in the

4560
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:14,318
future

4561
02:53:10,639 --> 02:53:17,199
yes i still have work to do on something

4562
02:53:14,318 --> 02:53:18,799
some stuff from china

4563
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:21,600
and um

4564
02:53:18,799 --> 02:53:23,599
there's some indonesian stuff that i got

4565
02:53:21,600 --> 02:53:24,960
a hold of a couple of years back that i

4566
02:53:23,600 --> 02:53:27,359
have not

4567
02:53:24,959 --> 02:53:28,879
broke into yet

4568
02:53:27,359 --> 02:53:30,159
so uh

4569
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:32,879
those

4570
02:53:30,159 --> 02:53:34,959
uh and i hopefully have a little guy

4571
02:53:32,879 --> 02:53:36,839
coming back

4572
02:53:34,959 --> 02:53:40,478
bringing me some stuff from

4573
02:53:36,840 --> 02:53:42,159
burma and uh i'm looking forward to him

4574
02:53:40,478 --> 02:53:44,239
handing me those so

4575
02:53:42,159 --> 02:53:47,200
those things you know have to be gone

4576
02:53:44,239 --> 02:53:48,559
through and see if they're viable and

4577
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:50,399
worth

4578
02:53:48,559 --> 02:53:52,239
using and see if they've got anything in

4579
02:53:50,398 --> 02:53:55,119
them so it's going to be a little while

4580
02:53:52,239 --> 02:53:58,239
but yeah i mean there's there's all

4581
02:53:55,120 --> 02:54:00,319
kinds of stuff on the horizon and

4582
02:53:58,239 --> 02:54:02,000
with like i said the advent of being

4583
02:54:00,318 --> 02:54:04,639
able to uh

4584
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:07,520
to get um

4585
02:54:04,639 --> 02:54:09,519
more space and availability to be able

4586
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:12,239
to get this stuff out

4587
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:12,239
we'll get it done

4588
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:17,359
so

4589
02:54:14,398 --> 02:54:19,199
if you could uh sorry sorry different

4590
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:20,880
question um

4591
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:22,479
we've kind of touched on it already but

4592
02:54:20,879 --> 02:54:24,318
just for clarification

4593
02:54:22,478 --> 02:54:26,000
out of all the old world genetics you've

4594
02:54:24,318 --> 02:54:27,519
kind of you know land race you know

4595
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:29,760
close to land race all the stuff you've

4596
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:32,239
been able to try what's been the most

4597
02:54:29,760 --> 02:54:32,239
unique

4598
02:54:32,959 --> 02:54:37,199
oh and

4599
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:40,318
all the asian stuff i could be lumped

4600
02:54:37,200 --> 02:54:43,279
into that the thais the cambodian you

4601
02:54:40,318 --> 02:54:46,959
know those those areas i think

4602
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:50,239
just have the most intense

4603
02:54:46,959 --> 02:54:51,119
presences and the the highs are very

4604
02:54:50,239 --> 02:54:52,639
rich

4605
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:55,040
also

4606
02:54:52,639 --> 02:54:58,959
there's been a lot of areas in mexico

4607
02:54:55,040 --> 02:55:01,520
that i really enjoy the product from

4608
02:54:58,959 --> 02:55:02,639
mexico has a really wide and varied

4609
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:04,319
climate

4610
02:55:02,639 --> 02:55:07,278
and and uh

4611
02:55:04,318 --> 02:55:09,760
environment and a lot of really

4612
02:55:07,279 --> 02:55:11,680
incredible unique stuff

4613
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:13,760
has come from

4614
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:16,639
that area and

4615
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:19,120
even on down you know going into

4616
02:55:16,639 --> 02:55:21,039
brazil and

4617
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:23,439
some brazilian

4618
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:26,319
uh material that i've had before has

4619
02:55:23,439 --> 02:55:27,279
just been stunning

4620
02:55:26,318 --> 02:55:30,879
but

4621
02:55:27,279 --> 02:55:32,640
it doesn't adapt as well going north it

4622
02:55:30,879 --> 02:55:34,719
doesn't it loses a lot in the

4623
02:55:32,639 --> 02:55:37,439
translation so to speak

4624
02:55:34,719 --> 02:55:40,079
but mexico really does seem to be a lot

4625
02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:41,439
more stable and and does tend to do

4626
02:55:40,079 --> 02:55:44,559
better

4627
02:55:41,439 --> 02:55:47,680
up here but i i would say of of those

4628
02:55:44,559 --> 02:55:50,639
the asians and mexicans are are are ones

4629
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:53,760
that i really enjoy the most and i would

4630
02:55:50,639 --> 02:55:55,920
if i had to be on a desert island again

4631
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:58,960
growing indoors that's those the ones i

4632
02:55:55,920 --> 02:56:01,520
would use

4633
02:55:58,959 --> 02:56:03,358
so lucky last question

4634
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:04,960
if you could kind of transfer one

4635
02:56:03,359 --> 02:56:08,000
quality from

4636
02:56:04,959 --> 02:56:09,679
the land races or any strains and you

4637
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:11,359
wish that you know modern genetics would

4638
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:14,239
take on more of this these types of

4639
02:56:11,359 --> 02:56:14,239
traits what would it be

4640
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:22,479
probably that psychoactivity that is

4641
02:56:18,478 --> 02:56:22,478
that that feel of

4642
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:29,359
you have to be old to remember this kind

4643
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:32,079
of thing but

4644
02:56:29,359 --> 02:56:34,000
i mean there's there were strains

4645
02:56:32,079 --> 02:56:37,039
back in the day that would take your

4646
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:38,478
breath away and you would wonder if you

4647
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:40,880
were ever

4648
02:56:38,478 --> 02:56:43,199
ever gonna come down again

4649
02:56:40,879 --> 02:56:44,639
uh though

4650
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:45,600
those are the kind of things that i

4651
02:56:44,639 --> 02:56:46,879
remember

4652
02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:50,559
um

4653
02:56:46,879 --> 02:56:50,559
and and there's been a few

4654
02:56:52,879 --> 02:56:57,039
real expressive ones like the old puna

4655
02:56:56,079 --> 02:56:59,680
rota

4656
02:56:57,040 --> 02:57:03,200
uh was one like that the

4657
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:05,920
the tie sticks of old i used to really

4658
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:09,200
enjoy that even though some of them they

4659
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:11,840
said they were adulterated i don't know

4660
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:14,960
i've the seed that i grew from had a lot

4661
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:18,398
of the same qualities and i i really

4662
02:57:14,959 --> 02:57:20,478
found that to be a presence so yeah

4663
02:57:18,398 --> 02:57:21,599
it's got to go with that

4664
02:57:20,478 --> 02:57:24,159
just

4665
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:25,359
i really miss the psychoactivity of it

4666
02:57:24,159 --> 02:57:26,959
all it's all

4667
02:57:25,359 --> 02:57:29,359
become much more

4668
02:57:26,959 --> 02:57:30,719
uh sedative and

4669
02:57:29,359 --> 02:57:32,479
and or

4670
02:57:30,719 --> 02:57:36,398
racy

4671
02:57:32,478 --> 02:57:38,318
uh without having that that

4672
02:57:36,398 --> 02:57:40,398
quality that

4673
02:57:38,318 --> 02:57:43,119
just makes you say if you were in a dark

4674
02:57:40,398 --> 02:57:45,278
room it would almost be a a kind of a

4675
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:46,800
mushroomy kind of an experience with

4676
02:57:45,279 --> 02:57:48,640
visuals and

4677
02:57:46,799 --> 02:57:49,519
it would you know that kind of thing i

4678
02:57:48,639 --> 02:57:52,318
miss

4679
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:53,760
i i look for that a lot even now in this

4680
02:57:52,318 --> 02:57:55,760
in stuff

4681
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:57,600
because it's there you just got to find

4682
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:59,439
it and bring it out

4683
02:57:57,600 --> 02:58:01,439
but if you do

4684
02:57:59,439 --> 02:58:03,040
and some people report the gui does that

4685
02:58:01,439 --> 02:58:04,960
to them

4686
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:06,880
to some degree if they smoke a lot of it

4687
02:58:04,959 --> 02:58:09,358
because it's really

4688
02:58:06,879 --> 02:58:11,920
got that edge of that tie and the

4689
02:58:09,359 --> 02:58:13,680
cambodian and it that that really had

4690
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:16,079
those qualities as

4691
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:17,840
a predominant part of their high

4692
02:58:16,079 --> 02:58:18,879
it got muddied with some of the other

4693
02:58:17,840 --> 02:58:21,840
stuff

4694
02:58:18,879 --> 02:58:24,159
uh but it can come out and i'm gonna

4695
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:25,840
look for that in the pure gui when i

4696
02:58:24,159 --> 02:58:27,200
make it i'm gonna try and build that

4697
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:29,040
back in so

4698
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:30,399
keep our fingers crossed

4699
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:32,880
fingers crossed

4700
02:58:30,398 --> 02:58:34,239
so i think that one um might bring us to

4701
02:58:32,879 --> 02:58:36,079
the end of it did you have any comments

4702
02:58:34,239 --> 02:58:38,159
