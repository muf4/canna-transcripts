169
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:38,800
the shortcut Variety and the New Horizon

170
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:41,318
Haze some A5 and some nabl Haze that I

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,598
keep around sadly the bandaid Haze 7 is

172
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,039
just finished because that's actually my

173
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:47,560
favorite

174
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,318
one you read my mind I was going to say

175
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,879
is that because the first J to go empty

176
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,400
is the best yeah yeah yeah it's really

177
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,120
good it's really good nc5 of course also

178
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,519
you know usually the best things are

179
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,639
smoked

180
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,758
first so

181
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,439
I love that I I before we touch on some

182
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,919
of those incredible strains you just

183
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,759
mentioned I want to quickly loop back

184
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,159
you mentioned talking about hash and how

185
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,199
the cultures changed a bit what sort of

186
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,879
varieties of hash would you still feel

187
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,240
represent that narrow Leaf drug type are

188
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,360
there any of the uh you know Imports

189
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,280
that still have that old world

190
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,400
effect well it's hard to access them now

191
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,559
because uh yeah you know like the

192
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,478
smuggling uh in these day and ages it's

193
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,360
not an easy thing okay when you for

194
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:35,519
instance for me the best hashes I ever

195
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,960
sampled was a

196
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,240
nepales dry sift from high up the

197
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,239
mountains there you know it was like uh

198
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,038
it blew everybody's mind that stuff get

199
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,319
you so high you smoke it it was like you

200
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,959
know it obliterated your tolerance also

201
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,800
but it was really nice to smoke you know

202
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,000
and taste and everything so it was like

203
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,720
a candy it was like a treasure okay and

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,399
um we don't get that anymore so but uh

205
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,479
hash types like that they have that lld

206
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,758
high too you know what I mean so

207
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,478
Moroccan is different each has their own

208
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,439
unique s so they're very they have a lot

209
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,399
of character that's why I like Hashi so

210
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,598
much so my first joint I ever smoked was

211
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,478
also Hashi because I like the smell of

212
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,918
that came from it okay they were totally

213
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,800
I never was interested in cigarettes

214
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,478
because uh they didn't you know like

215
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,400
smell so nice but as a teenager I I

216
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,519
smelled has shees and I was like wow

217
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,638
this stuff you know like maybe want to

218
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,439
try and yeah I did and it was yeah

219
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,879
revelation of course then you get high

220
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,759
for the first time and the whole world

221
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,799
Paradigm changed so uh but for me it was

222
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,439
mainly hasis it still was and the the

223
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,359
weed the ganja of course I also

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,640
appreciate very dearly but uh it's like

225
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,278
a different league so to speak

226
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,759
okay that that's really beautiful what a

227
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,958
what a cool experience to have been able

228
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,600
to try that nepales hash and I'm sure

229
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,799
many others over the years out of

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,278
curiosity do you find yourself like

231
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,199
interest interested in more modern

232
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,600
representations of hash so like maybe

233
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,480
from the Band-Aid Haze the A5 the C5 or

234
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,600
do you feel the magic really lies in

235
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,320
those Tera coming from the

236
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,120
equators why you then you are comparing

237
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,160
apples and oranges so to speak you know

238
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,799
what I mean because import hasis it's

239
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:24,319
from a yeah it has a very different

240
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,599
connotation than a one strain uh um

241
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,560
extraction so to speak okay which

242
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,320
doesn't mean it cannot be nice but it's

243
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,919
like a infused rocket it's very uh

244
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,760
onedimensional you only get this kind of

245
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,599
type of variety high so it's boost up

246
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,278
and it's really nice so it's really pure

247
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,600
and everything I think concentrates are

248
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:46,519
also really fantastic especially for the

249
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,879
Met uh people like oils and ures also

250
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,879
but in terms of smoke smoking like well

251
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:55,000
if you have nldd cultivar D cultivar

252
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,679
like that they're really strong if

253
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,720
you're going to concentrate that [ __ ]

254
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:03,239
and smoke it wow here seriously good

255
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
luck with that okay so it's like good

256
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,079
for once in a while I think things like

257
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
that but you know I'm not opposed to it

258
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:10,759
but I'm not in I'm not a fan of it I

259
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,719
don't smoke it daily you know I do

260
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,919
occasionally do a dab but I'm not really

261
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,000
so I like my type of smoking let's say

262
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,479
because I'm used to it it's more like a

263
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,399
traditional embedded in our culture here

264
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,519
so to speak

265
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,320
okay yeah sure and you know when when

266
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,919
you're trying some of these like you

267
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,278
know land race origin hash

268
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:36,319
do you ever find that you get an effect

269
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,360
that's quite different to say um the

270
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
varieties of flow that on offer so like

271
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,839
for example a lot of sativas people

272
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,600
think of them as either racy or like

273
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,720
clear and stimulating do you feel like

274
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,399
the hashish from various different

275
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,079
places can offer like a different

276
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,000
dimension yeah absolutely oh yeah it's a

277
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,000
different they're different Realms and

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,159
the that's the beauty of cannabis as a

279
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,200
whole actually so it's such a diverse

280
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:04,278
univer universe actually you know like

281
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,639
you have ganja you have Hashi you have

282
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:08,360
like you know you can do so many things

283
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,440
with these plants there are so many

284
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,320
varieties so there's uh yeah variety is

285
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,680
the spice of life so it's like hard to

286
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,879
compare Moroccan hasis for instance like

287
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,479
the top quality to nepales or Kashmir or

288
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,879
Afghani or like we used to get also

289
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,000
Turkish and lebanes and so it all got

290
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,919
diminished a little bit because of

291
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,120
geopolitical yeah things and um it's a

292
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,919
sad thing I hope in the future with the

293
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,320
change of the legislation with is now

294
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,719
first and foremost aimed that of course

295
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,000
ganja and everything comes with it the

296
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,278
cultivating and such but in time I hope

297
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,679
it will spread further to the countries

298
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,919
where these hashes is traditional still

299
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,399
being made and we can access it again

300
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,799
because you know for me that's the true

301
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,799
richness and the epiphany of cannabis

302
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,159
for me personally because it has this

303
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,919
character that you don't find in modern

304
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,480
extracts not to saying that they're bad

305
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:06,319
or something it's just like you know

306
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,879
it's a different League of of getting

307
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,440
high let's say okay and also I smoke

308
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,480
with tobacco so it's a Milan more so I'm

309
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,240
like a smoker you know we like to smoke

310
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,079
so it's not that be like dabbing you you

311
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,120
it's different thing you know like you

312
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,198
you also smoke but you know in

313
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,039
obliterates it's more direct let's say

314
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:29,240
and we enjoy the smoking Also let's say

315
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:32,360
okay so uh it's a it's a different

316
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:37,240
approach and different uh

317
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,959
yeah methodology to to to get high from

318
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,360
Cannabis so to speak okay so we like our

319
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,919
hash and mainly that's why the reason

320
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,519
why um we smoke with tobacco because it

321
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,439
was like that back in the day you just

322
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,919
you know when the tolerance system in

323
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,800
Holland started it was only Hashi there

324
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,360
was no indoor grown weed so they did it

325
00:12:54,799 --> 00:13:01,719
to separate the market from soft and

326
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,039
hard drugs because the heroin um plague

327
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,639
uh that was across Europe back then well

328
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:09,039
it cost a lot of young people's lives

329
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,799
and so the Dutch were then um separating

330
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:15,120
the market to try to fight

331
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:18,399
the um heroin traffic better and they

332
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,839
were very successful but with that came

333
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,720
the import hasis that was mainly the

334
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,839
thing here in Holland okay and from

335
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,920
there it then grew further into kanja

336
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,920
cultivation and actually it got

337
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,799
completely upside down a little bit

338
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,838
so it's kind of crazy how things can

339
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:38,919
evolve over over 40 years of time let's

340
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,320
say okay or 50 wow what an evolution

341
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,838
look let let's come and touch on the

342
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,480
tolerance system in a moment but I just

343
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,760
want to quickly loop back and ask you

344
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,399
for anyone who's interested you know

345
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,198
there's lots of our listeners who still

346
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,078
visit Amsterdam and Holland regularly

347
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,399
what would you say is your general

348
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,559
hierarchy of the hash that's currently

349
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,360
available is there still generally speak

350
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,518
like for example would you say oh you

351
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,639
know most of the African hash you get is

352
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,240
generally not the highest quality like

353
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,959
how would you describe the current state

354
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,600
of the landscape for anyone who wants to

355
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,879
come to Amsterdam and maybe try some

356
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:15,320
hash well for for my experience at least

357
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,278
so I'm just like I'm not really um

358
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,560
somebody that goes fishing in coffee

359
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,320
shops for Hashi I have my connection so

360
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,679
to speak and you know the the the top

361
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,160
qualities usually reside more in like

362
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,039
smaller quantities know so they cannot

363
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:31,919
put it for sale because it's just so

364
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:36,039
they only have like uh limited access to

365
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:38,958
this kind of material and so um the sad

366
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:41,838
thing is that I found that all Tibetan

367
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,078
made hasis and also Indian like Kashmir

368
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,600
and everything also turkeys like

369
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:50,758
libanese it Al it vanished so we are now

370
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,680
only having uh Moroccan varieties there

371
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,159
is also a big change there of course

372
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,519
with the modern cultivar that are being

373
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:00,159
imported there so it's still TR

374
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,039
traditional made and hasis but they

375
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,639
don't

376
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:08,120
use the necessarily the old cultiv from

377
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,759
um back in the day so to speak okay so

378
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,159
there's also a little bit of change in

379
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,159
that but you know great Hashi is like

380
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,399
it's like it gets you high in a certain

381
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,958
T it's very nice to sit around with you

382
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,759
know like people smoke and have some tea

383
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,000
and you know like talk and discuss about

384
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,959
life philosophy it a little bit it's

385
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,759
more that vibe that it's important okay

386
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:32,198
and also the taste and everything so uh

387
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:34,800
um in coffee shops you know it's hard to

388
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:37,240
really determine the quality I don't you

389
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,639
know I don't visit them so much so I

390
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,959
can't really assess their quality so

391
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,360
much what I do know is that import

392
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,599
hashes is like in the background now

393
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,360
it's all modern Hashi okay whether it's

394
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,240
isolated or whatever and usually they're

395
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,519
also made not from the traditional

396
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,000
cultivar it's like these modern extracts

397
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:01,399
and so the market in that uh sense has

398
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,240
changed lot okay but um for me

399
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,318
personally as a hash favorite from the

400
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,000
hash countries well it's not so a great

401
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:09,958
Evolution but of course we still have

402
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,039
the great ganja so you know one must not

403
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:15,518
complain and uh you know be happy with

404
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:18,439
what we still got and try to increase it

405
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,839
in the future as good as we possibly

406
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,120
can a I love that what a beautiful

407
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,680
sentiment and a few questions ago you

408
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,000
mentioned the tolerance system in

409
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:29,198
Holland and how that sort of played out

410
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,360
over the years how would you give an

411
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,198
overview of the scene currently how

412
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,919
would you describe the Amsterdam scene

413
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,479
to people as it is

414
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:40,318
now well the Amsterdam scene I so I come

415
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,319
from the south of Holland and so I was

416
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:43,278
more like secluded from the Amsterdam

417
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:45,759
scene

418
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:49,399
because yeah what we had here with this

419
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,839
hazes and these Hashi people well so we

420
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,839
we we went frequently to Amsterdam

421
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,680
because it's a nice city to go to okay

422
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,639
and of course we did some coffee shops

423
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,679
but usually the gear that was in our

424
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,240
pocket we found Superior than the gear

425
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,000
that they were offering because yeah

426
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,679
it's a little bit of a Commerce thing

427
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,959
there but there are still nice so in

428
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,798
Amsterdam was always nice things to be

429
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,880
found and it's like yeah you know it was

430
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,519
the capital of cannabis let's say for

431
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,120
many many years about the whole world

432
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,759
was still uh repressing cannabis very

433
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,359
hard the Dutch were the only one to like

434
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,318
yeah like I said tolerate it because to

435
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,639
protect actually their youngsters from

436
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:30,119
uh getting killed by other mean drugs

437
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,120
you know what I mean and um it was a

438
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,159
good thing but yeah over time it changed

439
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:37,798
a lot so now with the legislation Chang

440
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,440
in America of course you had this um

441
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:43,000
wave of like tsunami of more North

442
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,558
American strange the cushies and the

443
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,880
cakes let's say that kind of

444
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:51,079
um yeah come flooding there and uh yeah

445
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,240
it's a popular thing here also so for

446
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,759
the youngsters it's like this now so the

447
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,400
market is in continuous flux also so

448
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,119
it's always is something new and so the

449
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,200
these Hypes will eventually blow over

450
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,000
and uh you know cannabis I think it's

451
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,120
more for the people also it's for the

452
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,359
broad people I hope as many it's it must

453
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,678
be accessible to all you know what I

454
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,319
mean and that's a good thing but I mean

455
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,038
uh the true passionat let's say well

456
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:18,240
they they always steer to the quality of

457
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:19,798
things and not so much the Hypes and

458
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,400
they stick around of course over the

459
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:25,038
years and that's how it

460
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,759
is yeah that's awesome to hear and I

461
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,960
mean would you say in general that uh

462
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,000
the majority of the people involved in

463
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,480
the the scene SL the industry in Holland

464
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,960
are more of the old school sort of he

465
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,200
nature and they're they're looking for

466
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,440
those older effects or is it like most

467
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,679
places in the world where there's still

468
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,880
quite a a strong majority of people who

469
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,159
are into the more newer modern hype sort

470
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,880
of stuff well you know the Amsterdam

471
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,320
Market wasn't so purely Dutch actually

472
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,440
you know for instance a lot of uh people

473
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,240
from other countries are there establish

474
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,840
themselves there to work work this plant

475
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,839
and to you know be a part of the

476
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,678
community that later evolved to become

477
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,279
an industry you know I mean like Neville

478
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,840
also did his work in Holland Sam the

479
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,558
skunkman brought the seeds to Holland

480
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,678
you know I mean everybody came to

481
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,399
Holland and so Amsterdam was actually a

482
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,240
metropolitan that attracted various

483
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,919
people from over the whole world okay to

484
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,038
work this plant and so there are only

485
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,440
few really Dutch people that do this

486
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:27,879
also that still reside from back in the

487
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:32,279
day before actually the indoor um ganja

488
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,720
St seen and the coffee shop uh uh Market

489
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,678
exploded okay and there are still uh

490
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,360
Dutch people in Amsterdam but I wouldn't

491
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:43,159
call Amsterdam uh you know like purely

492
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:46,279
Dutch in that uh P persp perspective in

493
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:48,280
terms of uh who works plants there and

494
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,599
who provides weed to people okay it's

495
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,319
more like an international Collective

496
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:56,519
there and there are a few people from

497
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:59,960
Amsterdam that kind of um um represent

498
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:02,599
the um more d kind of approach to it

499
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,720
let's say okay and the hazes and

500
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,798
everything incorporates with it because

501
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,200
yeah it's the Cradle actually of the

502
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,079
modern hybrids more or like the hybrids

503
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,880
from before where the modern hybrids are

504
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:17,480
made from so Amsterdam is more like yeah

505
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,679
like I say a metropolitan for you know

506
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,839
it it magnetized a lot of people

507
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,200
throughout the world for years to come

508
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,240
to this city to you know to be involved

509
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,720
in the Canabis because they also love

510
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,240
getting higher so it's like this and so

511
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,720
it got like a uh a brewery a mix of

512
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,279
great people that coming about and like

513
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,038
you know like really uh try to grow good

514
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,918
wheat and enhance the Jean Pool and

515
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:44,599
whatnot so you know it's a good thing

516
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,200
but that goes for the whole of Holland

517
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,119
Amsterdam is the heart of it you know

518
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,840
you have also rdam and then the Brant

519
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,839
area and the South limberg and Sealand

520
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,759
where actually also a lot of people and

521
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,158
you have coffee shops there so you know

522
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,599
but Amsterdam has this alluring thing to

523
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,880
it because it's the capital of Holland

524
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:05,119
and it's a nice cozy City you know I

525
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,240
mean coffee shops it's renowned okay so

526
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,959
it's a good thing but I wouldn't call it

527
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,880
necessarily only Dutch this approach

528
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,360
there in Amsterdam considering the

529
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,640
Cannabis Market if you want more Dutch

530
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:18,319
you have to you know go into the country

531
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,038
and maybe go to the South or to the

532
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,879
North and then you have a a better

533
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:26,038
Assumption of what truly Dutch coffee

534
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,640
shops are and what they serve okay I I

535
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,558
must say because um you know I I

536
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,799
encountered these ha so cannabis came

537
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,519
into my life in the late 80s mid to late

538
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:38,960
80s and then I got in touch with Haze in

539
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,759
like 903 in the early '90s and when I

540
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,759
first smoked my haze joint in 93 I was

541
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,919
yeah so impressed by it I was like I

542
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,558
want to have this okay what is it and I

543
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,840
want to meet these people who are like

544
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:55,079
who are what so you know it was so from

545
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,399
that day on I was into Haze and so there

546
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,918
was no rival to it so to speak so we

547
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,720
kept it also in a in a tight group of

548
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:06,400
people in a tight crew because it wasn't

549
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,120
so uh widespread available let's say but

550
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,640
I really felt for the haze and so what

551
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:15,879
else emerged from um other cannabis I

552
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:20,000
followed up on it and uh but once you

553
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,278
like I started cultivating ha 93 also

554
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,200
and so when you start cultivating plants

555
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:28,319
like this these old hair looms and you

556
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,440
try another variety you're like not bled

557
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:34,639
by it at all so you kind of you ditch it

558
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,880
and we stay to the haze like loyal true

559
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,520
Haze

560
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,720
Freaks and so nothing else could compare

561
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:43,079
so whatever the story about the white wi

562
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,319
is I don't know you know I don't know

563
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:49,199
and so but ingamar plays a part in it I

564
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,960
think a very big part and so I think

565
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,840
it's not a bad variety I like all

566
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,278
cannabis let's make no mistake so for me

567
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,359
all cannabis is good but I have my own

568
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:01,079
personal preference and like this MLD

569
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,038
kind of thing first it was the old

570
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,038
hairloom that I encountered and from

571
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:08,440
from there my knowledge also grew and I

572
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,480
got uh yeah interested in the nldd and

573
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,240
the the more psychoactive tropical

574
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,759
varieties okay because these plants yeah

575
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,440
they have character they're jungle

576
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:20,798
plants okay they're not like these yeah

577
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,038
uniform more tweaked plants to I don't

578
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,519
know so it's a different leak so I go

579
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,599
for the jungle plants any and every day

580
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,918
it's like my personal preference

581
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:32,599
I love that what a beautiful sentiment

582
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,000
um I'd love to ask you you know you just

583
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,199
mentioned it what are some jungle

584
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,079
varieties as you put it uh you might

585
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,080
recommend to people who are looking to

586
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,759
expand their Petes but have only ever

587
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:45,558
really had sort of more modern

588
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:48,519
representations of Canabis

589
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:50,359
M well yeah that's that's you know when

590
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:52,839
you start growing these other varieties

591
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,678
and you have to go to Hay well usually

592
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:57,439
they don't well that's a totally

593
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,400
different league so they normally they

594
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,679
Tred once or twice and then they ditch

595
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,559
it because like yeah they're not used to

596
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,798
like having these jungle plants around

597
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,278
so you know if you if you want to

598
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:12,200
cultivate wheed or you're like a real

599
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:15,278
passionist and you usually go for the

600
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,558
varieties you want you prefer yourself

601
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,759
and for me it was the haze so the first

602
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:21,599
seeds I sprouted was actually skunks it

603
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,400
was

604
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,398
1991 and so then I moved to Spain for a

605
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,038
little while and there was not any

606
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,918
marijuana there not anything so I had to

607
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:34,200
grow my own to have some because it was

608
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,919
all hashes there also and so I was in

609
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,399
favor because back then we had some good

610
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,759
grass here in the coffee shops in

611
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:44,398
Holland too but um not the haze and when

612
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,398
I encountered the haze I was like so

613
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:50,558
blown away by it I wanted to you know uh

614
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:52,639
smoke it and I then smoked so much of it

615
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,519
that these people kind of said man

616
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,240
seriously you take so much maybe you

617
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:01,158
should grow some and that's how it then

618
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,000
eventually uh I became then a cultivator

619
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,960
of these varieties and it's hard to go

620
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,679
back you know I mean like we have a

621
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,720
personal preference I like these plants

622
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,600
so much the other plants don't impress

623
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,120
me so much not to say that they are not

624
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:16,839
nice but cultivation is like yeah I that

625
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,239
you I I just love to tame these wild

626
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,759
beasts you know and get them into life

627
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,399
it's it's it's fantastic but it takes

628
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,440
longer and a lot of more care and so a

629
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:30,079
lot of cultivators they also want to

630
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,519
more guarantee their um result so to

631
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:36,639
speak so then um the modern varieties

632
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:40,119
well they're easier to grow so you have

633
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,360
more like um and they don't take so long

634
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:45,839
so in that kind of aspect I can only you

635
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,519
know I encourage any dja growing no

636
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,158
matter what strains they put under the

637
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:53,119
light or the Sun for that matter even

638
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,799
better so all marijuana is good to me

639
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:59,038
but uh personally I would recommend to

640
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:02,079
try some um of these great ganja plants

641
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,640
these Queens they're really

642
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,240
special I love it what a beautiful

643
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,320
sentiment I guess one of the questions

644
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,278
we do get from our listeners very often

645
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,720
is they're sort of after like

646
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,038
recommendations and the the question I

647
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,000
hear a lot is that there are people who

648
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:20,519
are Keen to sort of dip their toes in

649
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,038
the waters of the nld varieties and

650
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,599
they're like look you know I'm happy to

651
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,000
run something that goes a bit longer I

652
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,759
just want to experience the feeling that

653
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,839
you know describe on the show do you

654
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,720
have anything that you might be able to

655
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:37,599
recommend that's like 100 days or

656
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,960
less yeah well it depends on personal

657
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,959
preference also but if you want to have

658
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,200
a haze then you should grow a proper

659
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,200
Haze I think what's available on the

660
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,840
market well there are a lot of people

661
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,278
that doing nice uh small things let's

662
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,599
say okay it's more like in the realm of

663
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,599
the people that really have heart for

664
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,158
cannabis you know when your

665
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:01,759
industrialize

666
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,000
um this our you know passion let's say

667
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,278
you lose something also a little bit

668
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,679
that's only normal I'm not opposed to

669
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:11,278
anything U but you know when you work

670
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,840
100,000 plants or you work 100 well it's

671
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,278
a world of difference let's say okay

672
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,798
it's like with making wines or like the

673
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:21,278
the finest things of Life Cuban cigars

674
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,319
you name it okay single m whiskies

675
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:26,880
whatever Champagnes U whatever you want

676
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,480
there is finesse in in everything okay

677
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,000
if you want

678
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,440
then you have to grow it and so these

679
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,798
hair looms represent it but there are

680
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,558
many other land races for example you

681
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,798
like the tie which actually I think it's

682
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:42,038
more coming from LA or something okay

683
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:44,960
that's also debatable but anyway we all

684
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:48,000
have our personal preference okay and uh

685
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,600
if you can cultivate that well then you

686
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,640
have what you want and so it's it

687
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:56,759
depends what you want okay so

688
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,440
um yeah with like super silver is still

689
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,398
around mango ha I personally find mangu

690
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,399
ha is one of the better varieties and

691
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:08,278
they are also a little bit more uh easy

692
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:11,518
to grow and um so the wildness the Vigor

693
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:14,519
is a little bit um less so they're more

694
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,919
practical for like the average grower so

695
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,759
to speak you know and it's a nice

696
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,840
variety I think I like it very much in

697
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,960
High and um things like that I would

698
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:25,158
recommend and also of course the things

699
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,519
that I'm working on myself you know with

700
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,240
uh what I do now is collaborating with

701
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,759
the original dumping coffee shop in

702
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,839
Holland to make some uh small breeds and

703
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,599
then offer some uh some unique lines to

704
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:40,079
the to the public you know to access and

705
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:42,839
to be able to grow them but they will be

706
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,678
also around 100 days give and take it

707
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,240
depends on the phenotype I like them

708
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,519
wild so I like my seeds to be like the

709
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,839
authentic thing that can have also this

710
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,640
um uh VIP in to them like from the hay

711
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,119
side you know what I mean that's what we

712
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,200
all aim about to enhance enance the haze

713
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,278
or like to preserve it as good as we can

714
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,600
this high this feeling okay because it's

715
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:07,519
a certain unique vibe to it you can't

716
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:11,119
explain it's more deep let's say Okay

717
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:14,519
than any other um high it's a sativa

718
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,398
hybrid or like an nldd hybrid variety

719
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,679
and so what it is it's debatable but

720
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,518
it's clearly like fire okay we all agree

721
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,080
on it and once you love it well you want

722
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,120
it and so but there are Tibetan

723
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,960
varieties for instance that are also

724
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:31,518
really nice also but yeah you have a

725
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,880
land race variety growing indoors well

726
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:38,599
it will change okay you so to have a

727
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,440
harsh cultivar in a harsh uh environment

728
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,839
in the you know in the mountains of

729
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,320
Tibet while there it thrives let's say

730
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:47,599
if you take it out or from SE and it s

731
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,798
here and you put it in you know under

732
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,038
indoor conditions well you get a totally

733
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:55,720
different expression in it and it's

734
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:58,359
therefore not necessarily better okay so

735
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,919
but on what's on the market you know I

736
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:03,678
uh you know look at to the passion I

737
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,200
would always say you know like uh and uh

738
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,399
they're nice things on the market I

739
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,720
think the genan pool by people that are

740
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:12,959
preserving plants and you know bringing

741
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,640
them what they preserved uh making it

742
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,919
available so it enhances the gene pool a

743
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,840
lot and that's uh something very

744
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,919
important I think towards the future you

745
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,240
know like cannabis is going to

746
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,720
revolutionize the world because this

747
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,319
plant is so versatile it's amazing so we

748
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,798
need to the broader Humanity needs to

749
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,519
educate itself a little bit more but it

750
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,599
will come and uh the interest grow and

751
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,159
that's a good thing but like the

752
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:43,519
immaturity of like the market it's some

753
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,519
sometimes saddening okay and that

754
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,200
implify also like things so everything

755
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,880
is in continuous flux like I say so

756
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,480
things evolve and now we have this

757
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,840
latent hemp thyroid that is uh also a

758
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,000
nuisance actually because uh a lot of

759
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,319
things are being shipped worldwide now

760
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,638
and so this latent hemp thyroid it's not

761
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:08,079
really detectable for the average grower

762
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:10,359
let's say but once it's in your plant

763
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,519
and you utilize the same scissors for

764
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:15,719
instance to for you get an infected

765
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,278
plant and you're not aware of it while

766
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,399
it infect your whole library in a year

767
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,398
time you can throw it away and so there

768
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:25,518
are a number of people in the industry

769
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:27,518
that's uh putting their heads into the

770
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,480
sand and don't want to hear about it but

771
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,720
it's a real threat okay and we should

772
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,599
really pay attention and educate

773
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,159
ourselves and um you know to keep it

774
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:40,480
free because this viid well it's a

775
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:45,000
Potential Threat to uh to certain

776
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,798
varieties okay and if we uh don't make

777
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
the good precautions it could be a

778
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,558
threat okay since everything is sent

779
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,960
abroad and not being checked well I see

780
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:56,119
a lot of plants that are infected and

781
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,960
yeah so there's a big discussion and

782
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:00,359
people are not aware of it it's the AIDS

783
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,919
of plants and it's kind of like the

784
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:05,759
similar vibe to it like it's like a

785
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,360
taboo almost okay no it's not it's a

786
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,240
reality and you know it needs simple

787
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:13,359
precautions you just need to clean your

788
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,038
tools with bleach and then you know you

789
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:19,359
can Safeguard it but uh so if you have

790
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,278
uh things sent to you I would say to

791
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,839
everybody in the Cannabis industry pay

792
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:27,638
attention Okay because it can ruin your

793
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:30,240
partials and uh endang endanger

794
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:32,278
preservest and preservation towards the

795
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,319
future

796
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:37,839
okay wow I feel like you must have uh my

797
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,599
list of questions you just touched on so

798
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,278
many great talking points we'll have to

799
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,638
loop back on several of them but I mean

800
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,720
while we're on the topic the hopl envir

801
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:48,319
does certainly seem to have sort of died

802
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,360
down out of the mainstream Zeitgeist and

803
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,678
discussion and feels like it's sort of

804
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,798
like a bit out of sight out of mind

805
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,440
what's what is the state of things like

806
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,679
in the EU at the moment from your

807
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,759
perspective and what's your sort of

808
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,720
biggest fear in regards to the viroid CU

809
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,558
I I too share similar concerns yeah the

810
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,919
problem is that well in most European

811
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:10,398
countries the official legislation to

812
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,799
cultivate Recreation on cannabis is

813
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,278
still not implied so we're still waiting

814
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:18,119
on it and it's only uh like the medical

815
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:21,079
Market that can do it that means that we

816
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:23,518
cannot lab test our equipment you can uh

817
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,918
in Holland is available but it's quite

818
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,919
expensive okay and so a lot of people

819
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,399
don't do it but so there are a lot of

820
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,440
things getting shipped worldwide now and

821
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,959
so it's a Potential Threat and it's

822
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,399
that's why I want to talk about it

823
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,798
because uh people don't want to hear so

824
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,119
much about it and so it's a it's also

825
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:44,119
like powderly Milo and other things it's

826
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,599
visual so you can assess it immediately

827
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:48,798
or like spider knes or any other pest

828
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,240
well this viroid not so it's like you

829
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,398
know you think this plant is healthy and

830
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,960
then it deteriorates over like a half

831
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,759
year say when it put it under vetch then

832
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,360
you will see it but then it's too late

833
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,038
especially if you make seeds with it

834
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,638
because you send it worldwide to make

835
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,679
seeds well its progy will contain at

836
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:09,799
least 30% of it of the seeds will be

837
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,280
also um containing this thyroid

838
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,320
potentially also infecting again other

839
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,000
cannabis uh Gene pools and genomes and

840
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,119
so it's important we keep that a little

841
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,960
bit in check okay especially if we're

842
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,079
going to revolutionize the world with it

843
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,280
well we have to you be prudent about it

844
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:29,200
okay let's say it's not like uh it's

845
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,159
just a p as any other but rinsing your

846
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,878
tools for instance with some bleach it

847
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,800
takes a little bit more effort than time

848
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,199
maybe but it's well worthwhile okay to

849
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,519
keep everything a little bit healthy so

850
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,960
it's like with any other organism right

851
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,119
if you truly love it you want to be able

852
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,639
to that it's you know in the best

853
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:50,079
condition as possible and so it's not to

854
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:53,079
be something underestimated and I see uh

855
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,200
in the industry from top to Z to bottom

856
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,320
let's say people in it that uh you they

857
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,279
preferably not not want to talk or they

858
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,640
say our plants are got clean while I'm

859
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,720
like you know yeah so I'm just giving

860
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,440
out the shout out to everybody like hey

861
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,000
pay attention to this viroid because

862
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,519
seriously okay it's a threat and that's

863
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,358
it uh hopefully um you know we can keep

864
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,838
it out of our Gardens as good as we

865
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:20,440
possibly

866
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,358
can yeah certainly you know I think

867
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,000
everyone obviously you know the goal is

868
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:26,559
to try to stop it from getting into

869
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,760
their Gardens I guess I then wonder do

870
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,199
you think think this will be something

871
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,640
where we may be able to eventually

872
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,799
eradicate it or do you think it'll just

873
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:33,440
become one of those things that like

874
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,280
floats around in the background it's

875
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,639
like the flu like you get it some years

876
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,119
you don't other others well now I see it

877
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:41,920
as a Potential Threat if people do not

878
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,559
you know take this seriously to lose

879
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,440
some potential lines that are available

880
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,599
for instance because the parential once

881
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,960
they're infected well well we cannot

882
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,599
make seeds with it anymore okay or um

883
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,599
you can make seeds with it but then you

884
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,359
have to really lab test it for it

885
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,960
contain so there is

886
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:03,400
we have the technology to um to um

887
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,800
prevent it and you know to fight it it's

888
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,800
all here we just have to do the make the

889
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,400
do the necessary you know put the effort

890
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,440
in and not um like um be light-headed

891
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,280
about it or like rather not hear about

892
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,440
it because it's a it's a it's a thing

893
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,359
that seriously you know if a breeder

894
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,240
makes seeds and send it to people and

895
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:24,239
he's not aware of it itself that it's in

896
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,679
his partials well all these people

897
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,879
accessing these seeds will have um

898
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:34,078
plants that contain this viroids so in

899
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,400
that sense it's like better to um to um

900
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,519
prevent it than to suffer from it okay

901
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,800
so it just it take some prevent prevent

902
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:46,920
um uh you say like uh things to do and

903
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,599
then uh you know you can sleep uh sound

904
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,159
at night okay so it's not in your

905
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,000
library you just have to be uh you have

906
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:56,719
to Ren your tools properly and you have

907
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,639
to like um be aware about it so I would

908
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,759
suggest that everybody just pay

909
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:04,400
attention and educate himself or herself

910
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,280
a little bit about this fire to keep it

911
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,559
out and uh so that will ensure us that

912
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,920
we do not lose uh seed lines or like you

913
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:16,279
know like genotypes in the Cannabis uh

914
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,240
varieties that will then then be

915
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,240
infected and downgraded and we just have

916
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:24,358
to kill it okay it has to be

917
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,000
eliminated 100% 100% and hopefully you

918
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:28,799
know it is something that we are able to

919
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,119
eliminate in the future I want to um I

920
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,400
want to talk about some of your breeding

921
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,160
but you know what I think it'll help

922
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,480
first to lay a bit of the groundwork so

923
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:37,000
why don't we go back to the start tell

924
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,880
me a little bit about your first

925
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,199
experience with

926
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,559
cannabis yeah so the first experience

927
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:46,960
was this hashy it was at the festival I

928
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:49,920
was like uh just 16 or just not just

929
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,760
before I got 16 anyway we were at the

930
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,920
festival and so this guy was rolling a

931
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,680
joint I could see it I see it before but

932
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,000
you know it was now close and it was

933
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:01,960
somebody from my own group of friends or

934
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,719
like people I knew let's say the locals

935
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,599
but he was a little bit older and uh he

936
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,159
saw I was interested and so like you

937
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,318
know he R the joint and then he said

938
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:12,199
yeah you want to try it and so I did and

939
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:13,960
this whole festival got kind of yeah

940
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:15,960
yeah everything enhanced you know the

941
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,400
whole sphere and everything so it was

942
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,199
really brilliant and I really liked the

943
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,480
aroma coming from it okay so it was

944
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,118
mesmerizing and uh so the first

945
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:30,119
experience was a really good one and

946
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:33,160
then uh so you get interested and then I

947
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:35,519
live close at the border with Holland so

948
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:37,960
I not touch myself but I Leed over the

949
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,639
border that say because uh yeah the

950
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,559
tolerance system in Holland I really

951
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:43,679
liked okay and I wanted to get high and

952
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:47,119
all these hashes available I'm like yeah

953
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:49,279
yeah yeah this is great you know so and

954
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,400
uh and then uh it stayed like that and

955
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,280
of course also weed you know we like

956
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,079
both so we smoked wheat and we smoked

957
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,800
mainly Ash and uh the wheed back then it

958
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,280
was used usually skunk or skunk hybrids

959
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,920
uh more or less they were nice but not

960
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,000
really like flabber gasing nice okay but

961
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,400
we smoked it we smoked everything

962
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,159
teenagers you know how it is and then um

963
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,079
like I said I was a little bit older

964
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:15,279
like just before I got 20 I was sitting

965
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,079
in a bar it was a normal bar in some

966
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,040
bars in Holland you could also smoke you

967
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,839
know like uh sticky we call it it's like

968
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,358
a hand roll cigarette but a small one

969
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,759
not really big joint and you just like

970
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:29,279
smoke it and it was also tolerated back

971
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,040
then so to speak okay and in certain

972
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,599
bars anyway and so this guy come sitting

973
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,358
next to me and I knew him you know we

974
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,920
knew him from like going out scene let

975
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:40,679
say okay and so he said you want to try

976
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,400
something what are you smoking I said

977
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:46,440
yeah skunker I said yeah smoke this okay

978
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,920
I say what it is it said it's Haze A5

979
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,720
Haze so I never heard of it so I roll

980
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,000
one and I was like you know you always

981
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:56,679
rival each other I'm thinking this guy

982
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,880
okay we test it okay well I had little

983
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:01,159
drink also and really I went to the

984
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,559
toilet I came back I was like what's

985
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:07,399
this okay seriously I fell in love

986
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,440
immediately with it it was blow I never

987
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,519
had beat like that before okay it was

988
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,440
like it blew my mind in every possible

989
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:17,759
way in every positive way also so I was

990
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,480
like hooked from that moment and so

991
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,480
short after I uh you know I saw

992
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,119
interested and Blown Away by it so I

993
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,000
wanted to meet the people that offered

994
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:31,760
it and so shortly after I did and then

995
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,400
so I got into a whole different um group

996
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,319
of people that held hasis and Canabis in

997
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,200
a very different way than in the coffee

998
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:41,759
shop or like the more commercial scene

999
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,799
in Holland okay these were more also

1000
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,200
they were older than me they were like

1001
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,480
um the age of they were the Dutch

1002
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:53,039
hippies let's say okay and more activist

1003
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:55,039
also uh very politically engaged and you

1004
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,920
know they wanted to also reform Holland

1005
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,519
and they believed in this PL also and

1006
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,760
the hashes and everything and tolerated

1007
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,759
system we all always dreamed in that you

1008
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,839
know in the early 90s that it would be

1009
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,760
legal by 2020 at least okay like 2,000

1010
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:13,599
we thought in the best case scenario and

1011
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,640
it still it's still hasn't happened here

1012
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,200
like what we waiting forever but anyway

1013
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:22,838
this uh completely aside so I was so

1014
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,879
blown away by it so I I I I loved it and

1015
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:26,920
my friends also loved it so I was like

1016
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,599
getting this Haze for every body okay

1017
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,639
they were all like back in the day so

1018
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,519
there was no competition for this weed

1019
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:36,239
because this group of people I

1020
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,599
encountered well they tapped into them

1021
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,078
these cultivar so they were the first to

1022
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:44,119
grow it to really full potential okay

1023
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,200
and that's so then it shines and then it

1024
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:47,760
becomes what it should be you know

1025
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,759
because if you don't know how to

1026
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,240
cultivate it well it can be a stack of

1027
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,599
hay also so you know but these people

1028
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,959
really were the first to you know

1029
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,079
produce this Hast to full potential and

1030
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,119
it was it blew our minds back then and

1031
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,480
we fell in love and so it grew from

1032
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:09,079
there and I started cultivating short

1033
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:11,199
after and so um yeah it was a fantastic

1034
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:14,119
time throughout the 90s there was really

1035
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:16,159
a lot of Hope and prosperity and and

1036
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:18,920
know looking at the future it would all

1037
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:21,078
change in a in a good way and actually

1038
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,920
you know that the legislation got

1039
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:26,680
actually far worse uh with the coffee

1040
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,039
shops booming out and so it kind kind of

1041
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:31,078
got out of control a lot of French and

1042
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,079
Belgium people and German people they

1043
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,079
flooded the Dutch borderlines to get

1044
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,200
their beats and hash there and so like

1045
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:40,599
Europe was facing a little problem there

1046
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:42,279
and so the the Dutch government got

1047
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,800
tapped on their shoulder like hey what

1048
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,800
the [ __ ] is wrong with you you know all

1049
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,839
our youngsters are going buy drugs in

1050
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,960
your country it must stop okay so they

1051
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:54,039
made like crazy legislation then to

1052
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,920
reform the Border areas while Amsterdam

1053
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:59,480
and the rdam area were then in a

1054
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,240
different kind of legislation while the

1055
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,760
whole country was actually under the

1056
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:06,279
same legislation so it's like you know

1057
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,680
it's like the most surreal thing ever

1058
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,960
okay you cannot nobody makes up [ __ ]

1059
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,598
like this

1060
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,880
okay you just got to laugh with it and

1061
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,240
think like all right well we have to

1062
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,160
wait a little bit longer to just like

1063
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,959
cultivate out in the open okay but we

1064
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:25,078
still do we we kept into the hobby

1065
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,280
sphere here also for us it's a passion

1066
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,800
it's not really s it's a lifestyle more

1067
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,160
it's like you know it's not something we

1068
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,720
do for to enrich

1069
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,000
ourselves to sheare MoneyWise you know

1070
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,639
what I mean I mean we all want

1071
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,239
comfortable lives but that's not the aim

1072
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,960
the aim is to get highest [ __ ]

1073
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:44,759
and to benefit from it and to bring

1074
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,039
something to the table for others that

1075
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,480
can say hey man this is really something

1076
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:53,119
unique okay and we try to maintain that

1077
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,719
finesse and and you know it's a nce

1078
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,920
thing it's only for the people that

1079
00:43:54,719 --> 00:44:00,759
really like it okay and uh well so a lot

1080
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,639
of people also they get anxious or

1081
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,480
paranoid from it and they kind of steal

1082
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,639
away from it like they prefer a little

1083
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,240
push cake it's all

1084
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,759
good I don't

1085
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:14,759
mind what an epic story so many details

1086
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,720
I feel like we need to touch on I guess

1087
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,280
the first one is this crew you're

1088
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,879
talking about are they the uh the people

1089
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,760
online referred to as the A5 crew and as

1090
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,920
a followup did they ever tell you like

1091
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,440
the story of getting the cutting

1092
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:33,280
yeah well so these people were pasados

1093
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:37,000
and uh so they lived in same area where

1094
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,640
Neville did his first work and one of

1095
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,559
them there were actually three people

1096
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:43,039
one of them he was uh so nille and him

1097
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:46,160
became

1098
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:49,880
friends and because these people were in

1099
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:51,960
the you know they they they were uh so

1100
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,039
they love psychedelics let's say but

1101
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,760
first and foremost hashes they were

1102
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:59,159
really has lovers okay and uh the top

1103
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,319
quality varieties

1104
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:07,639
so these top shelf quality hasis they

1105
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:11,960
also uh yeah impressed nville okay so he

1106
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:15,239
smoked some of it and uh so they got

1107
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,920
um uh acquinted more better let's say

1108
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:21,919
okay by the hashes and so then they

1109
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,800
became social to each other and so

1110
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,358
nville actually uh provided these

1111
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:31,519
cuttings also like to share them with

1112
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:33,159
also to get a better uh grips on his own

1113
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,119
breedings because these people

1114
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:39,000
cultivated it to um you know to deliver

1115
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:43,119
some Haze on the market and um so that

1116
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,800
helped them also to maintain their uh uh

1117
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,480
top quality has trade so uh it was all

1118
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,280
kind of in that regard that there was

1119
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,519
this exchange was being made back in the

1120
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,839
day okay when the nille did his first

1121
00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:01,318
breedings and these people got handed

1122
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:04,000
out uh five phenotypes of every uh breed

1123
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:05,838
line and so they kept them or like more

1124
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,679
I'm not sure of that you know how many

1125
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:11,039
they actually so these people are older

1126
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:12,879
than me I always kind of looked up to

1127
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,838
them with the greatest respect they were

1128
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,200
really nice lovely you know like regular

1129
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,838
people that did it from their house okay

1130
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:22,519
they didn't have a coffee shop while one

1131
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,318
of them later did have but you know so

1132
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:27,880
it was a different it was more a family

1133
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:30,920
thing like say really a group of friends

1134
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:34,440
that share things with each other but um

1135
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:37,318
so they were the first to really realize

1136
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,440
how important these plants were okay

1137
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:42,558
they were also the initiators of the

1138
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,519
preservation and then uh we in our

1139
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,240
little Collective here and some people

1140
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:49,440
also in a different part of the site

1141
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:52,279
took upon themselves to safeguard it

1142
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,880
when later in uh around the Millennium

1143
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,880
change uh the legislation in Holland

1144
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,640
changed so hard and these people were

1145
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,440
targeted by uh uh justice really hard

1146
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:07,679
okay and so then everything came to an

1147
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,159
end the Glory Days and so then uh yeah

1148
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:14,440
we salvaged what we could Salvage from

1149
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:16,679
uh that um brutal error and uh went

1150
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,760
underground with it okay to save God it

1151
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:22,078
and preserve it for over all these years

1152
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:25,079
because yeah we we always recognized the

1153
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,079
initiators especially but we also the

1154
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,920
smokers that you know like could tap

1155
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:34,359
into it and then later cultivate it we

1156
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,680
all recognize the sheer unprecedented

1157
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:39,838
extraordinary power that resides in

1158
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:42,039
these plants okay and so the high speaks

1159
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:44,000
for itself the plants morphology when

1160
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:48,039
you grow it and you compare it to like

1161
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,838
other breach well it blows most cultiv

1162
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:52,119
away okay but you have to know how to

1163
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:54,719
cultivate them otherwise they just keep

1164
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:58,119
on growing and like you have a lot of

1165
00:47:54,719 --> 00:48:00,358
vegetable of vegetable growth but not

1166
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,039
really the flowers you're looking into

1167
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:06,558
so it's not for everybody I guess I was

1168
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:09,440
privileged and uh I'm blessed to you

1169
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:13,040
know like this happened and it it was

1170
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,880
more like a southern Dutch thing Neville

1171
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,318
with his breeding took it later to

1172
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,280
Amsterdam and so that was his breeding

1173
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,838
but so the preservation of the old

1174
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,800
clones it was done in the South by

1175
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:26,719
people that really you know like love

1176
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,280
these plants so much like I said for me

1177
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:32,480
these plants are like family okay we've

1178
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,839
been keeping them around uh you know it

1179
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,440
initiated from the day n bre them so

1180
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:39,000
it's like mid to end 80s and then later

1181
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,720
like

1182
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,800
1991 and then the exchanges were made

1183
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:48,959
and so like from there on we kept them

1184
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:51,960
around and um when uh uh justice then um

1185
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:55,159
hit these people heart um yeah we took

1186
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,679
it uh we we tried to save what was

1187
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:01,440
Salvage ible and to get underground and

1188
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:04,039
you know preserve it for future and we

1189
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,760
also wanted to in our stash so we so we

1190
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:09,358
love these plants you know what I mean

1191
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,680
so so it's like yeah it's almost like

1192
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:14,078
your children and nobody takes it away

1193
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:17,598
okay you care for it you protect it you

1194
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:20,640
uh you know it's uh it's not uh so it's

1195
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,318
also a collective thing we cannot do it

1196
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,199
anything like that because people get

1197
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,920
raided or you you have pasts or like

1198
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,639
something happens you know we all have

1199
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:33,079
our lives so you know we all have our

1200
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:36,838
dramas in life and whatnot so you know

1201
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:40,318
by this Collective effort we are uh wow

1202
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:44,480
it's been a remarkable Journey keeping

1203
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:47,960
these uh hair looms now uh still into

1204
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,838
our human reality let's say and it's a

1205
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,720
great thing you know every time I talk

1206
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:56,119
on them I'm like

1207
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:58,118
yeah so it was a privilege but also a

1208
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,280
Challenge and it's good that they are

1209
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,798
there and so now they are made available

1210
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,559
for a broad public and you know a lot of

1211
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:08,159
people can access them better and better

1212
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:10,319
in one form or the other okay and that's

1213
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,159
a good thing that's what I for me it's

1214
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:15,480
all about that preserving them meaning

1215
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:17,598
also shipping them to places where you

1216
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,480
know they have legal grounds to have you

1217
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:24,039
know to be preserved for for longer than

1218
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:27,400
just us these plants will be around when

1219
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:28,880
we are not imagine that that's the best

1220
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,039
case

1221
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,559
scenario of course what an epic story I

1222
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:37,239
love that I I've got to ask uh you

1223
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:38,920
mentioned a few times that you've you've

1224
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:42,479
made your best efforts to preserve what

1225
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,838
was salvageable which cuting do you have

1226
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,679
as far as I had heard it was like the A5

1227
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:47,719
the C5 the hash plant Haze were there

1228
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:51,318
any

1229
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:55,199
others yeah there's a G13 cross to the H

1230
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:56,000
A that uh we managed to safeguard thank

1231
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,118
God

1232
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,838
and then there is of course the

1233
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:04,079
Neville's Haze it's also uh one of the

1234
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:08,519
first Neville hazes ever okay that was

1235
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:10,760
selected for it certain uh yeah uh

1236
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,838
morphology and everything from back in

1237
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,680
the day okay but like I said back in the

1238
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:17,119
day it really stood out to other plants

1239
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:19,879
you know like these people that love

1240
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,720
them so much and could tap into this so

1241
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,000
there were people around them with green

1242
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:26,519
thumbs Holland is uh so the Dutch are

1243
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,599
really good

1244
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:32,679
in hyro culture let's say okay like

1245
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:36,559
whatever it is okay like so they are

1246
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:39,000
there University also that is really one

1247
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,280
of the top leading universities in like

1248
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,079
the science behind how to cultivate

1249
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:48,480
crops okay and so they this knowledge

1250
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,880
from the Dutch then and combined with

1251
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,559
the ability to tap into the genetics

1252
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:57,599
properly well so then it could manifest

1253
00:51:53,559 --> 00:52:01,040
it to what it was and uh so like it has

1254
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,039
to be grown to uh to to proper to really

1255
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,679
make it China and that's why the

1256
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:08,079
commercial scene rather stay away from

1257
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,639
it because when you [ __ ] it up well yeah

1258
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:13,318
you're a half year further and you don't

1259
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,719
have any proper return well you can only

1260
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:18,759
do it twice if you [ __ ] up twice yeah

1261
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:21,439
you're a year further well if you have a

1262
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,280
big investment and you don't uh get a

1263
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,519
return in one year you have a problem

1264
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,798
okay so they all go for the more easy

1265
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,119
return it's a commercial thing I can

1266
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:34,159
understand it okay so Haze is not so

1267
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:36,880
easy to be capitalized on except when

1268
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:39,078
it's growing to with Y with people that

1269
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,960
are really can you know that they know

1270
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:43,599
what they're doing so to speak okay and

1271
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,079
then it can manifest itself to something

1272
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,519
really beautiful but you know like I

1273
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:51,359
said it's not for everybody so it's

1274
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:54,119
always a niche market let's say okay but

1275
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:58,199
for me um it's one of the maybe the key

1276
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:00,760
elements also that helps us enable us to

1277
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:03,118
maybe you know have a little influence

1278
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,720
now on human awareness that yeah the

1279
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,160
hasi is okay it's all about that but

1280
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:10,919
people just do not get it so much but

1281
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,960
believe meashi is the Pinnacle of K is

1282
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:17,000
okay once you really understand it you

1283
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:20,039
it's like you understand it okay so

1284
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,760
ganja is great too I mean I love it

1285
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:25,440
don't so but it's a different so it's

1286
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:29,400
more spiritual for me let's say okay has

1287
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:33,920
a deeper level it has a something sacral

1288
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:37,318
to it know something sacred and um ganja

1289
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:41,000
also every cannabis

1290
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:43,159
uh has it okay more or less but these

1291
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,318
are these the ones I love they have it

1292
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:47,719
in a certain higher degree that's why I

1293
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:49,558
love also I love psychedelics myself too

1294
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:52,759
okay I think psychedelics in the future

1295
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:55,720
also will be uh very important to pave

1296
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,559
the way uh in human uh awareness and

1297
00:53:55,719 --> 00:54:00,118
Consciousness because this world

1298
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:01,920
seriously in this day and age people are

1299
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,559
still beating the [ __ ] out of each other

1300
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,400
I'm like hey maybe all smoke a joint you

1301
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:10,079
know seriously and you know seriously

1302
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:13,760
okay so this plant for me is like really

1303
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:16,039
important to bring it uh and to uh yeah

1304
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,079
to make it more accessible to for for

1305
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:23,759
people okay no matter how they take it I

1306
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:26,119
think it's a very good uh um Ally in uh

1307
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,040
in our voy on this planed okay we need

1308
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:31,358
to listen to it really and educate

1309
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:33,639
ourselves and uh yeah put it more on the

1310
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,358
foreground but yeah it's a struggle so

1311
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:37,519
it's a slow process but I'm thinking

1312
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:39,838
we're gaining some momentum finally

1313
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:42,159
that's good I think yeah you hear

1314
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:45,078
ripples about that uh sort of worldwide

1315
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:47,598
currently which is good to hear that was

1316
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:49,839
an epic array of plants that you know I

1317
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,760
think these are probably the only

1318
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,838
remaining plants that like Neville

1319
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,280
selected himself would you agree and as

1320
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:58,159
a follow-up could you give give the

1321
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,760
listeners a an overview or a description

1322
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,318
you know how would you describe each of

1323
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,880
these plants they sound absolutely

1324
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,239
legendary you know I first want to say

1325
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,720
this

1326
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:12,719
so and back in that day when these

1327
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:15,598
plants were first uh created let's say

1328
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:17,719
and exchanged so they were a new thing

1329
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,359
and they were like the yeah it was like

1330
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:23,959
it blew everybody away let's say okay

1331
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:25,920
then like I said nille went then on so

1332
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,119
it was more he was the breeder so for

1333
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,000
him it was making seeds well these

1334
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:32,160
people in the South well they had a

1335
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,838
different approach okay so they embraced

1336
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,038
these plants in a different guard that's

1337
00:55:34,838 --> 00:55:39,358
why they kept them secure and safe and

1338
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,440
also secluded from um the more

1339
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:42,920
commercial Realms in Holland back in

1340
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,480
that day I mean

1341
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,240
okay it was also these people were not

1342
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:50,760
looking for any Spotlight okay they they

1343
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:53,000
didn't want any green Merchant thingy

1344
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,880
going on on them like you know they were

1345
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,760
just wanted to smoke and get high and

1346
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:01,000
like like you know have the best weed

1347
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:03,720
and hush available and so

1348
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,719
um they embrac these plants with a

1349
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:08,759
different attitude so they became the

1350
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:11,000
first reservist of it and then later we

1351
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,359
took it upon ourselves to like I said

1352
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Salvage what Salvage because we also

1353
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:19,639
love these plants by then so much and so

1354
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,400
preserving these plants well it has a

1355
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:25,879
different I didn't know what I actually

1356
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:31,039
was preserving uh I knew that they were

1357
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:34,358
uh like um Haze hybrids and uh for them

1358
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:37,160
they always said that nl5 haste hybrids

1359
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:39,639
were the best so like C5 A5 and nv's

1360
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:42,318
haste or had the highest quality and

1361
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:44,558
potential but also with the G13 and the

1362
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:47,880
has plant they were nice cultivar back

1363
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,640
then you had also Duran cross to ha

1364
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:55,798
these Haze varieties and they so we lost

1365
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:58,078
that also the cg13 we lost that I've we

1366
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:01,280
lost here in the vicinity than the A5

1367
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:04,000
due to mislabeling and uh later I hooked

1368
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,000
up with some people that were

1369
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,760
um

1370
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,880
um had interactions with the same people

1371
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,280
I had interactions with in the Centum of

1372
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,559
the South so to speak and they were

1373
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,680
thankfully able to preserve the A5 that

1374
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:24,880
we lost and so we then were able to

1375
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:28,000
preserve the AG13 the has blant ha uh

1376
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:31,920
the N Haze and the C5

1377
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,599
Haze and um yeah we kept these were the

1378
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,760
best so they were the queens of all so

1379
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,760
over time some hered some were like less

1380
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,400
resilient and you know like uh so over

1381
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,880
time a lot of things happened okay

1382
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,039
they've been cloned so many times a key

1383
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:51,880
element in like keeping them healthy for

1384
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:54,400
us was also you cannot um keep plants

1385
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:57,318
under artificial light continuously okay

1386
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:01,200
so you have to re Revitalize them

1387
00:57:57,318 --> 00:58:03,400
preferably each year and so we take them

1388
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:07,078
like um in the springtime here we have

1389
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,519
an ideal veg climate late spring and uh

1390
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:12,079
early summer and then we can put them

1391
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,679
like two three months out doors in the

1392
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,119
in soil and you know get them sun and

1393
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:18,440
get them you know like in in the

1394
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:20,400
outdoors so they Revitalize and then we

1395
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:25,720
clone them again and take them indoors

1396
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:27,720
to um be able to um keep them um vital

1397
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:29,598
throughout the winter okay because they

1398
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:32,959
won't survive out there and that's how

1399
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:35,720
we do it and kept them in in good shape

1400
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,240
but um the preservation of these plants

1401
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:40,000
well so and usually in the Cannabis

1402
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,558
quote unquote industry there are like

1403
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,920
two streaks they say breeding and uh

1404
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:50,119
cultivation and or okay but I think

1405
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:53,200
preservation is actually the one that um

1406
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:55,920
exceeds or tops these two because

1407
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:58,838
preservation whether it's in seed form

1408
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,079
or especially in plant form well it's

1409
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:02,239
very you know important thing if you

1410
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,480
have an

1411
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:07,199
extraordinary hair Loom that's really

1412
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,880
you know blows your mind let's say or

1413
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,199
you have more of them well you want to

1414
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,358
preserve them of course plant

1415
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:17,038
phenotypical Expressions preserving like

1416
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:18,960
we did is of course different than seeds

1417
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,079
with seeds you never know what comes out

1418
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,318
of it but it's equally important but

1419
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:25,318
plant preservation well it's a living

1420
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:27,558
organism you have to keep Al over all

1421
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:29,318
these years and if you have a multitude

1422
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:31,640
on it well it's not such an easy thing

1423
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:34,000
when you're working in in a climate that

1424
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:36,639
fights grows continuously and harasses

1425
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,599
like you know and consider us to be

1426
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:42,078
criminal and we're like what it's like

1427
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,559
are you kidding me it's a plant okay

1428
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,400
yeah and then by the way here is a

1429
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:47,640
coffee shop you can buy it there so why

1430
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,639
can I not grow it it's like a little bit

1431
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:51,960
strange okay but anyway I'm not

1432
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:54,920
complaining because the duts still are

1433
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,760
tolerant towards it so like the penalty

1434
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,599
for it it's like okay but it's changeed

1435
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,400
also so now your house can be taken away

1436
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:04,760
and stuff like that so it's not really

1437
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,960
getting better and it's time for the

1438
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:10,240
legislation to just change so that and

1439
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,679
they have to learn from like the alcohol

1440
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:15,598
uh industry you have micro breweries and

1441
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:17,798
you have big ones so yeah it's each to

1442
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,519
their own like you like you have single

1443
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:23,199
Ms and that model of doing business with

1444
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:25,960
fit cannabis really good I think okay

1445
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:28,960
especially here in Europe but yeah they

1446
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,960
consider it still as a a drug so it's

1447
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,838
like I don't know what it is okay I need

1448
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,920
they all they all need to smoke some

1449
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:39,159
Haze man that's what I think and then it

1450
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,519
will maybe get a little quicker because

1451
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:44,318
seriously okay so it's a very immature

1452
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:47,000
market and it's a sad thing when you're

1453
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:49,719
a mature smoker in this kind of thing

1454
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
okay but anyway it is what it is and

1455
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:55,480
let's make something beautiful out of it

1456
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,280
okay wow look I can can only imagine all

1457
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,960
the effort it's taken to preserve those

1458
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,599
cuts over the years in the climate you

1459
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,838
describ so kudos to you my friend and I

1460
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,920
mean on that point itself you know

1461
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:07,719
you've just given us a great tip about

1462
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,920
how to store plants longterm you know

1463
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:11,719
with the revitalization we did have a

1464
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,559
lot of listeners chime in and say you

1465
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:16,239
know do you have any other tips you

1466
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:17,960
might have for preservationists to help

1467
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,598
keep Cuts around in the long term are

1468
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,199
there any other little tips or tricks

1469
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:23,480
for keeping them happy maybe in the

1470
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,719
indoor period when you're working on the

1471
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,559
legislation that are unfriendly then you

1472
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:29,159
have to do it in a group Collective

1473
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:31,240
because if you're the only one and you

1474
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:33,639
get raided or whatever in the worst case

1475
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:35,159
scenario or you have a pest and it dies

1476
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:37,759
or something well you don't have any

1477
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:39,480
backups so backups are important if you

1478
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,480
really want to preserve a certain

1479
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,240
cultivar you need to have it at

1480
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,318
different locations you know even in

1481
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:47,519
legal climates by the way because you

1482
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:49,599
know somebody can get like the latent

1483
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:52,119
hire out or what and it's not aware and

1484
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,000
you know like so backups are important

1485
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:56,720
and you know like keep them healthy you

1486
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,079
know like don't overfeed them like and

1487
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:02,000
keep them short and

1488
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:04,480
like make new cuttings regularly so

1489
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,079
everything is optimized as good as

1490
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,440
possible I usually do like two

1491
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:12,000
generations during the winter time and

1492
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:15,200
then that generation uh the third will

1493
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,318
go outside when I make cuttings so to

1494
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,879
keep my moms as fresh and in Min

1495
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:22,639
condition as possible because under

1496
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:25,079
artificial light it deteriorates okay

1497
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:27,358
you cannot keep plants forever happy no

1498
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:29,798
matter in what soil I'm so it sinks a

1499
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:33,318
little bit it gets hard I keep my moms

1500
01:02:29,798 --> 01:02:35,038
usually on soil not on hydro because um

1501
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:38,038
I think it's a better buffer and it's

1502
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,319
also more organic so it's a better way

1503
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:42,960
and

1504
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:45,599
um yeah have multiple cuttings of each

1505
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,720
uh cultiv that you want to protect also

1506
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,960
so not only one because if something

1507
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:54,078
happens with it you lose it and so keep

1508
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,079
good keep him happy okay so keep him

1509
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,559
green let's say and don't overfeed I

1510
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:02,960
usually like rain water for the majority

1511
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:05,000
and like um uh organic fertilizer and

1512
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,720
sometimes I've give them a little salt

1513
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,719
like I do for hydro to give them a

1514
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:11,719
little boost like when I want wanted to

1515
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:14,439
make cutting for instance so then I like

1516
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:17,000
letting them veg a long so I'm I do

1517
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,960
small operations so for me cutting

1518
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
making is not such a a big thing so I

1519
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:26,159
can do it uh like more uh so I can keep

1520
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,960
my things um as vital as I possibly can

1521
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:29,920
and over the years yeah you accumulate

1522
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,599
also a little bit knowledge so I keep

1523
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,920
them also Bonsai styled I don't like big

1524
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:38,640
moms because big moms will only produce

1525
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,880
like uh possible pests you know and they

1526
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:43,719
breed a lot and you know so they damp a

1527
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,838
lot by keeping them smaller and bonsing

1528
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:48,318
them and keeping them like healthy but

1529
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:51,838
in a small miniature version while you

1530
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:54,679
can put more plants also in uh smaller

1531
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,679
locations so it's like a it's a

1532
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:58,838
practicable thing for me as a more

1533
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:00,719
hobbyist let's say okay if you have big

1534
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:04,440
facilities it's like you you have to

1535
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:06,159
work in these layers of frames but um

1536
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,440
the important thing is like yeah keep

1537
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:11,318
them healthy okay and don't overfeed I

1538
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:13,880
see a lot of overfeeding in the business

1539
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:15,798
and uh so you have to really you know

1540
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,358
like it's better that they pay out a

1541
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:19,599
little bit and you give them some extra

1542
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:22,920
so you know what your dose is at least

1543
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:25,720
if you're learning and um by that you

1544
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,480
know you see also what the needs for

1545
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:31,798
instance okay so it's better to

1546
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:33,960
underfeed T see it and then you know um

1547
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:36,759
adapt nutrients than to overfeed it and

1548
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,838
burn it it gives stress to plants and it

1549
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,760
tends to also uh get into the gene if

1550
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:44,318
you stress out a plant too much it can

1551
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,599
make possibly hermite on you or whatever

1552
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:48,639
okay even if it's in the in the mother

1553
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:50,760
plant you're stressing it okay so it's

1554
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,078
not so good keeping your mother plants

1555
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,839
in healthy and Min condition is the

1556
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:58,000
first thing okay so that's why I say

1557
01:04:54,838 --> 01:05:00,400
preserv preservation comes first okay

1558
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,358
and then from there you can you know

1559
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,240
take cuttings and do some breing work or

1560
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:07,038
whatever or cultivate or whatever okay

1561
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:10,278
but first thing is keeping the parential

1562
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:12,599
in M condition that's first and foremost

1563
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:16,838
keeping the moms the parental stock

1564
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:16,838
clean and vital first

1565
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:22,319
thing yeah brilliant sentiment there I

1566
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:25,199
think that's really really important and

1567
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,519
um you know it does take some time to to

1568
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,038
to get a Mastery on keeping those moms

1569
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:30,719
long term I have to admit still

1570
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,799
something I'm always trying to improve

1571
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,798
on while we're on the topic of

1572
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:37,599
preservation I wanted to quickly ask you

1573
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:39,278
you know a topic that regularly pops up

1574
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,039
when we're discussing like some of these

1575
01:05:39,278 --> 01:05:43,079
older World genetics especially in the

1576
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:46,520
context of stuff that's still on offer

1577
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:49,318
today is this idea that you know maybe

1578
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:51,759
some of the older um Amsterdam or

1579
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:54,119
dutch-based cannabis companies have lost

1580
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,319
some of their mothers over the years and

1581
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,798
and they get replaced with different

1582
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:01,400
things you know is this something that

1583
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:03,159
you have experienced yourself and do you

1584
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,400
think there are like any companies on

1585
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:07,519
the market like that are still offering

1586
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,599
sort of that real original old school

1587
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:11,559
authentic

1588
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:14,559
stock well because I have my select

1589
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:16,720
Niche interest Market I do not really

1590
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,079
access these kind of seats so I wouldn't

1591
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:21,798
know but I read some on the boards and

1592
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:24,400
stuff like that and so like you know

1593
01:06:21,798 --> 01:06:26,798
like I say preservation is a hard thing

1594
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,400
when you're working under a climate that

1595
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:32,358
you know doesn't really promote uh ganja

1596
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,000
growing whether it's uh parentals or

1597
01:06:32,358 --> 01:06:36,358
whether it's cultivation because they

1598
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,760
all see it as cultivation the justice

1599
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:42,239
department they see every marijuana

1600
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,160
plant as a possible uh money benefit so

1601
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:47,399
to speak okay that's how they target it

1602
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:49,679
and that's how they also um raid you

1603
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,680
let's say okay so when you're preserving

1604
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:53,679
plants and keeping a library well it's a

1605
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,598
nuisance because they destroy everything

1606
01:06:53,679 --> 01:07:01,118
okay and so

1607
01:06:56,599 --> 01:07:05,039
um yeah so I I I think that a lot of

1608
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:07,880
people in the in the Amsterdam C or

1609
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:10,319
Dutch SE no matter where they are they

1610
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:13,160
got severely targeted and lost parental

1611
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:15,480
for sure okay what kind I could not say

1612
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:17,719
I can only say that we kept what we kept

1613
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,880
and that's that's for sure but what

1614
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:22,598
others do with their parentals well it's

1615
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:25,358
up to their and I see a lot of claims of

1616
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:27,400
this and that so and then I follow up on

1617
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:29,759
the people that access them and then you

1618
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:33,358
can see and establish for yourself which

1619
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:37,200
is what and what is so like uh there's a

1620
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:40,038
wise man once said that uh you know um

1621
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:42,639
people ey plants like people ey plants

1622
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:45,200
nothing they don't lie so the plants

1623
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:48,358
will reveal everything you want to know

1624
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:51,399
about certain pedigrees and plants uh

1625
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:54,880
possible loss of parentals with certain

1626
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:59,440
uh seed brands or whatever but like I

1627
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:02,318
say it's not usually um like they want

1628
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,440
this to to happen it's like because yeah

1629
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:07,318
it's like yeah you still get targeted

1630
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,679
for keeping plants so when a library

1631
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:11,599
gets like raided yeah you lose it and

1632
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:15,199
then you have to tap in some seed line

1633
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:17,759
maybe that holds the the like a sister

1634
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,960
or a brother plant to what you had as

1635
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:22,119
parental but it's done a different

1636
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:24,279
phenotypical expression and that could

1637
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:26,719
tamper possibly the the seed line that

1638
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:29,759
you are making so The Offspring will

1639
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:32,119
then be different let's say and so over

1640
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:34,000
time over all these years that seeds are

1641
01:08:32,119 --> 01:08:36,358
being produced and certain seed lines

1642
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,600
are being offered yeah of course there

1643
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:40,960
will be lots of potentials and

1644
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,400
everything that comes with it but I

1645
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,239
cannot point my finger at anybody that's

1646
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:48,960
doing it because well you know the

1647
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:51,718
privilege of having these plants around

1648
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,079
is also that when I later than went on

1649
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:55,880
the boards and I could understand what

1650
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:58,318
we were actually were

1651
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:01,679
preserving and you then you start

1652
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:05,960
meeting people from the world like uh

1653
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:08,679
and um so you get together and so then

1654
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:11,319
you start connecting to people in the in

1655
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:15,039
the community that are also doing the

1656
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:17,920
same okay passionate uh and so I

1657
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:20,198
interchange with them mostly to tap into

1658
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:23,838
to seeed lines that I find them

1659
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:25,838
interesting so because of uh um AR

1660
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:28,238
restrictions here and under this climate

1661
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:30,880
that we have to work we are also we have

1662
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,838
to keep an eye into our plant counts and

1663
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,000
everything and that's sometimes a

1664
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:39,278
nuisance when you want to tap into seeds

1665
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:42,520
so but um from experience I can say that

1666
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:45,480
you know like compared to these old hair

1667
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:47,759
looms yeah it's hard to find the plant

1668
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:49,639
morphology speaking I mean I don't

1669
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:53,359
necessarily say that there are better

1670
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:56,520
plants uh in potency on the market okay

1671
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:59,880
but um but in morphology speaking like

1672
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,880
the sheer wild Power that is in these

1673
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,679
hairloom well I tried a lot of seeds

1674
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:08,560
there are only few that can stand next

1675
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:11,119
to them and uh or rival them okay so

1676
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,840
they have a special Unique Kind of um

1677
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:18,399
figure in them okay and so um it's hard

1678
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,560
to find that in modern seed breeds okay

1679
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:22,559
it's it's like this because everything

1680
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,320
over the years got over hybridized a

1681
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,039
little bit so

1682
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:28,799
then uh that's why it's important to

1683
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:31,439
have these genetic and pure form still

1684
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,679
so really interesting things can to be

1685
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:36,839
made and cannot wait to tap into my own

1686
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:39,480
seed Vault that I have when the

1687
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,880
legislation will change well there will

1688
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:44,198
be something nice to emerg because like

1689
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:47,319
I say this network of passionat of

1690
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:49,279
people that are you know like uh also

1691
01:10:47,319 --> 01:10:51,399
preserving certain genetics that are

1692
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,920
mind-blowing well it's going to be it's

1693
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:54,559
going to be a great thing towards the

1694
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,719
future on the the legislation will

1695
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,679
change I'm sure so I'm looking forward

1696
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,359
to that cannot wait but meanwhile we

1697
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:04,719
just keep it secluded and do small

1698
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:05,719
operations let's say you know yeah it's

1699
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,079
like

1700
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:11,198
this oh you've you've got my ears perked

1701
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:14,279
up now I want to ask you you know if you

1702
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:16,519
were in that legal climate you describe

1703
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:18,319
what's uh you know some seeds from The

1704
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,320
Vault you'd be interested in being able

1705
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:21,840
to crack you know what's some rare seeds

1706
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:25,039
that you're looking forward to getting

1707
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,960
into oh well you know like uh we reveal

1708
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:29,479
that when it's time but I could say it's

1709
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,800
very nldd leaning and so it's like with

1710
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:34,718
cultivar also that been preserved by

1711
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:37,079
people like you know like uh yeah for me

1712
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:39,760
it's like the anod Vari is okay like we

1713
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:42,479
all know that the haze it's more D from

1714
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:45,360
Colombian Mexican and uh you know like

1715
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:46,238
Southeast Asian and Tha possibly but

1716
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:50,079
there

1717
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:52,198
are yeah abundance of um land races in

1718
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,760
the world that people have tapped into

1719
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:57,238
and also done a little work with to you

1720
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:59,119
know mix with other things and then you

1721
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:01,359
know establish something that's also

1722
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:04,639
remarkable and can stand on its own

1723
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:06,599
let's say okay and so I'm hoping that uh

1724
01:12:04,639 --> 01:12:08,960
when the legislation here in Europe

1725
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,880
starts changing that this transatlantic

1726
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:14,000
and also uh preferably Australia and

1727
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:17,039
actually you know like the global

1728
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,679
hopefully then it will go Global but

1729
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:21,198
let's say you know the countries of

1730
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:24,520
Interest let's say well then we can

1731
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:26,559
establish things that are un precedented

1732
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:29,480
because these two worlds will will then

1733
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:32,280
be able to merge in a better way okay

1734
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:34,839
because um for now well I don't have

1735
01:12:32,279 --> 01:12:37,000
interest into starting an American or

1736
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:39,319
Canadian business let's say okay I grew

1737
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,198
up here this is my world and so I'm

1738
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:45,599
waiting for this legislation to change

1739
01:12:42,198 --> 01:12:48,359
and then uh it will be so the hobby work

1740
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,039
that we do it holds a certain value but

1741
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:51,960
when you throw when you want to throw a

1742
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:54,279
lot of seats that you have you know and

1743
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,239
do selection better also so to establish

1744
01:12:54,279 --> 01:13:00,198
your partials to go through especially

1745
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:02,799
the males well you can only do that in a

1746
01:13:00,198 --> 01:13:04,960
legal framework okay and so that's why

1747
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,480
I'm waiting to do my work here once it's

1748
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,719
allowed and for now yeah we also do nice

1749
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:16,279
work because over the years we were able

1750
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:19,880
to refine a certain um so by you you

1751
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:21,759
start reading uh plants let's say okay

1752
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,760
and you are better aware of the seed

1753
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,480
lines that you want to tap into it I

1754
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:31,560
think the Vietnamese and other Southeast

1755
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:33,839
Asians the LA and like pure Duran from

1756
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,719
South Africa you know there's some fire

1757
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,480
there really that's really remarkable

1758
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:40,679
also and maybe other the Chinese is a

1759
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:43,039
little bit difficult there are certain

1760
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:44,880
Afghan varieties also that I like but

1761
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:47,399
you know because Afghanistan is a

1762
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,600
country that makes a lot of hasis so the

1763
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:53,879
hybridization there is also strong thing

1764
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,920
and so I don't so it's like a little bit

1765
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:58,880
yeah I'm more a traditionalist in that

1766
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,880
kind of way okay I

1767
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,759
don't I do not have anything anything

1768
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:06,319
against

1769
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,600
hybridization because these H hybrids

1770
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:11,679
are also hybrids I mean but over

1771
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:14,239
hybridizing you get then it Blends out

1772
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:16,319
too much okay and you don't go really

1773
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:18,599
for that characteristics that are really

1774
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:20,920
embedded in a certain strain in in like

1775
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,920
pure form let's say you know so it's

1776
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:26,920
diluted and more and that's a little bit

1777
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:29,199
this yeah what I want to steer away from

1778
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,039
and more go to the pure things and cross

1779
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:33,839
pure things that you can actually say

1780
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:37,679
okay this is not life 5 AC for instance

1781
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:39,719
C5 cross to Vietnamese black and then do

1782
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:42,199
a large selection out of that it's also

1783
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:44,679
the parability yeah so you never know

1784
01:14:42,198 --> 01:14:47,198
what the progy will be between two kind

1785
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:49,639
of cultivar how they will inter intermix

1786
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:52,719
and how to yeah the overall so you have

1787
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:55,639
to test it and be aware of it and so you

1788
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:57,800
know uh to do these nldd so they are all

1789
01:14:55,639 --> 01:15:00,480
long flowering varieties it takes also a

1790
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:04,079
little bit more time to do it

1791
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:06,439
properly also the evaluation and whatnot

1792
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,399
so and that's my goal you know to bring

1793
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:10,759
really that finesse to the market once

1794
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:14,319
the market will be ready for it okay in

1795
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:16,560
the meanwhile I do uh work and I

1796
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:20,158
consider that to be the you know like

1797
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:22,000
the forl let's say of uh what's to come

1798
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:24,679
let's hope at

1799
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,840
least uh I love it and I mean I'd love

1800
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:29,880
to hear a little bit about some of the

1801
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:32,400
hybrids you offer through the uh current

1802
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,279
dram King seeds what what are the

1803
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,679
Creations are you responsible for and

1804
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:40,279
how would you describe them well you

1805
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:43,279
know so I made a mail uh so I created a

1806
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:46,399
male that was C5 so I always like the C5

1807
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:48,840
very much um in its

1808
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:51,439
potency I think it's the queen of the

1809
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:54,800
hazes in potency wise okay she also

1810
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:57,319
delivers nice but she's very fin to grow

1811
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,520
so when you don't grow it dial it in it

1812
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:03,359
can be a very leafy cultiv especially

1813
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:05,679
indors so uh it's not the most favorable

1814
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:08,119
cultiv to grow but I like it's high when

1815
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,399
it's really grown to food potential it's

1816
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:12,920
really so it's the only one I can talk

1817
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:15,519
daily let's say Okay A5 or Neville Haze

1818
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:18,719
for me it's like nice for a little while

1819
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:21,280
but then you know like it has this dark

1820
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:23,800
exhaustiveness about it that I

1821
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:26,238
personally for my personal preference do

1822
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:28,039
not like so much in my daily routine

1823
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:29,638
when you smoke that [ __ ] for too long

1824
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:32,359
well it puts you in a different realm

1825
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:35,560
let's say okay not the best one for me

1826
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:38,920
so C5 is more like the more playful one

1827
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:41,320
and I always liked it so then I was um

1828
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:44,960
thinking about what to cross with it so

1829
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:47,279
I did some Crossings with u Malawi first

1830
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:50,719
to see if that brings some um because

1831
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:53,359
the Mala um is a m so it's not really

1832
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:56,039
the most loud strain let's say okay it

1833
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:58,399
has a certain Zang to it but it's not

1834
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:00,719
really loud like kishes or like cakes

1835
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,638
and so I thought this African variety

1836
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:06,560
would allow me to bring some of the C5

1837
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:08,800
into it uh then I made the New Horizon

1838
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,719
Haze with these males so that was my

1839
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:15,039
first interactions with these plants to

1840
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:19,319
make them um outcross them to each other

1841
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:23,479
okay and then uh I became a member of Mr

1842
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:25,279
Nice board and he offered five HC so

1843
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:28,439
it's a different form but it's in the

1844
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:30,279
same family so I thought I tap into

1845
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:33,198
these seats to see if there was an

1846
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:37,000
interesting maale to make uh to cross on

1847
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:39,919
the C5 and then have like an IBL mod so

1848
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,880
so to speak but to select a mail from

1849
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:46,039
that one that could stand to the next to

1850
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:49,400
the C5 in terms of morphology speaking

1851
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:51,960
also how it flowers and you know and so

1852
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:54,439
when I found that I kept it around and

1853
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:57,359
then uh I start started to use it on the

1854
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:59,960
AG13 and these plants that came from

1855
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:02,839
that I test thr them they were amazing

1856
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:07,880
okay so that became the Isaac Cas that

1857
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:10,319
they now offer it's AG13 cross to C55 HC

1858
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:12,960
and then now uh we did some work with

1859
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:15,479
the nville ha we use the same mail so

1860
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,439
it's one mail I preserve for the

1861
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:19,319
original dumpling because I like these

1862
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:21,799
people very much they're a good Cozy

1863
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:24,279
Coffee Shop in the heart of Amsterdam

1864
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,239
and uh so they like the old traditional

1865
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:29,439
Dutch bringing still the H like it was

1866
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:33,638
and I like that you know and so

1867
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:37,638
um by this good uh understanding between

1868
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:39,760
each other I um I favor them to wow they

1869
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:42,600
allowed me they offered me a platform to

1870
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:45,719
do some of my own work so it's actually

1871
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:48,520
nice to make these first steps into like

1872
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:50,960
the more quote called breathing spectrum

1873
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:53,360
because well it's not really breathing I

1874
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,198
consider you know but I can vouch surely

1875
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:58,519
for that's that there will be some fire

1876
01:18:56,198 --> 01:19:02,839
in these seeds okay and that there will

1877
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:05,280
be in the seed lines uh for sure so

1878
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,719
that's my work for now but like I say

1879
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:11,479
okay these long flowering cultiv well

1880
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:14,198
say they take long to test and uh verify

1881
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:16,879
and you know like to really get into

1882
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:19,319
them so but it's good that they are made

1883
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,119
available for the audience so they will

1884
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:24,759
have then you know the PLS will speak

1885
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:27,158
for itself Okay so so that's uh the way

1886
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:30,039
I and I like the C5 so I want to bring

1887
01:19:27,158 --> 01:19:32,679
that more to the foreground like the H C

1888
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:37,039
Spectrum let's say it's a good balance

1889
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:40,600
with the with the H A in it I like it it

1890
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:43,800
gives it more a little bit raciness but

1891
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:46,400
I still select towards the tur so the

1892
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:50,279
turbines coming from the SE line mode

1893
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:53,319
then the a line it's a personal

1894
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:55,960
preference ah beautiful stuff you know

1895
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:57,759
as I mentioned I love that C5 smell so

1896
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,480
I'm I'm on board with that can I just

1897
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:03,600
quickly clarify um did you say that it

1898
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:08,079
was uh you got a haze mail from Shanti

1899
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:13,079
or was it an NL Haze NL Haze yes so an

1900
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:17,279
NL haze from Shanti the the 5 HC which

1901
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:19,920
is then actually uh like a half sister

1902
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:22,840
let's say of um the

1903
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:26,359
C5 okay because he's not a light five

1904
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:29,880
version is uh a different one than the

1905
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:32,000
original one back in the day so then he

1906
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,639
crossed it to the H and that's why I

1907
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,399
thought it was interesting to merge

1908
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:40,719
these two because in effect they are two

1909
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:43,519
times nl5 HC let's say and so from that

1910
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:46,480
it enabled me to you know find a male

1911
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,880
that was really uh worthy and tpin and

1912
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:50,799
you know like lead really to the it's

1913
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:55,840
like more or less a

1914
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:59,079
C5 e IB y male you know and so that was

1915
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:01,600
then my uh that was one I was looking

1916
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:03,719
for and when I tested the progy I could

1917
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,400
see also that I was satisfied with what

1918
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:08,439
came out of it and then this male became

1919
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:11,238
of interest to see what they should

1920
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:14,359
bring there's also the CC Top Line it's

1921
01:21:11,238 --> 01:21:15,959
actually a C5 cross to this mail again

1922
01:21:14,359 --> 01:21:18,238
so it's all C

1923
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:20,719
then you what you

1924
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:23,279
get yeah totally that that sounds like a

1925
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:25,239
really cool mixture of genetics and

1926
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:27,639
there's actually a homie of mine shout

1927
01:21:25,238 --> 01:21:30,198
out to Eli cash he's got um a really

1928
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:33,679
nice Isaac Hayes cutting so there you go

1929
01:21:30,198 --> 01:21:36,198
credit to the work I'm I'm sure a lot of

1930
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:38,119
people are interested in hearing because

1931
01:21:36,198 --> 01:21:40,599
unfortunately you know very difficult to

1932
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:42,840
get samples of these strains but how

1933
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,440
would you describe the A5 and how would

1934
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,360
you describe the C5 for someone who's

1935
01:21:44,439 --> 01:21:48,719
never been able to smoke it or smell it

1936
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:52,119
like what's the smell what's the effect

1937
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:55,760
yeah so C5 there's a lot of fress also

1938
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:57,880
Piney there's some some yeah like a

1939
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,800
chemical undertone under it when it's

1940
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:02,239
grown it's also depends on how it's

1941
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:05,480
grown okay because in living soil for

1942
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:08,799
instance it comes out as a yeah a very

1943
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:11,238
different thing than on hydr based uh

1944
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,719
salts like we grow them okay so it

1945
01:22:11,238 --> 01:22:16,839
depends but it's more like to the fruity

1946
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:20,158
Le side of it you know like uh the the

1947
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:22,960
Tero the the lemon let's say okay it's a

1948
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:26,119
little bit lemony like uh uh I could

1949
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:29,359
also refer like the mango Haze has a lot

1950
01:22:26,119 --> 01:22:31,840
of this uh in it too like you know the

1951
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:34,679
haze SE is more like the perfumey kind

1952
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:38,319
the floral kind let's say okay well the

1953
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:42,119
A5 is more like the liver scented uh you

1954
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:44,639
know like this more meaner kind of um

1955
01:22:42,119 --> 01:22:48,399
dark sometimes a little bit fermented

1956
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:50,600
and uh yeah so it's like a very darker

1957
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:54,000
but it's it's a very nice smoke I think

1958
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:55,920
A5 taste wice it's really delicious okay

1959
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,079
but the effect I do not like so much

1960
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,520
okay because yeah it's

1961
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:04,279
like it's like it puts

1962
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:06,320
you it's just like you know it's like a

1963
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:09,238
I don't know it's it's a unique thing

1964
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:11,719
okay but I like it smok ability like the

1965
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:14,799
that incense Thick Smoke you get from a

1966
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:18,158
good well grown A5 well it stands out

1967
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:21,239
okay and uh it's progy can also be very

1968
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:23,319
good okay so the aine is very well it's

1969
01:23:21,238 --> 01:23:25,238
a very unique special

1970
01:23:23,319 --> 01:23:27,359
hazeline that's being preserved and I

1971
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:29,839
like it so it's good that people can

1972
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:32,439
access it and do their own work with it

1973
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,159
because that also enhances the gene pool

1974
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:37,719
in that regard you know these power

1975
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:41,000
plants they really you know uh yeah

1976
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:43,279
they're changing the the the Cannabis

1977
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,719
industry as we speak don't underestimate

1978
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,119
it but like I say it's for the niche

1979
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,880
it's a niche market it's not for

1980
01:23:46,119 --> 01:23:51,039
everybody but it's good that sparkle up

1981
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:54,520
some other genetics and um so a opposed

1982
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:56,399
to C yes so see is more uplifting also a

1983
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:00,400
little bit soring it's also a little bit

1984
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:02,960
like this uh so they they're all nl5

1985
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:05,719
haes and so what people sometimes say is

1986
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,840
that they have this crash in the end

1987
01:24:05,719 --> 01:24:11,719
let's say from coming from the

1988
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:16,719
nl5 and uh yeah it's true compared to

1989
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:21,560
100% nldd or some of them so some 100%

1990
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:24,760
ND can be very sorting High very uh wow

1991
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:29,039
you know like uh it's a leak above the

1992
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:32,600
haze hybrids still okay but usually they

1993
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:35,880
are not the best plants to grow uh for

1994
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:39,079
like years let's say okay and they also

1995
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:41,679
take F long so the hybrids are like the

1996
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:44,639
middle ground let's say between the

1997
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:48,279
commercial and the non-commercial okay

1998
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:51,359
and so but they still contain that that

1999
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:55,519
strong Haze influence which we like so

2000
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:59,118
much and so A5 is very introspective

2001
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:01,119
okay it's very um yeah it's better that

2002
01:24:59,118 --> 01:25:02,599
you when you're not used to it and

2003
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:05,759
you're going to smoke a really well

2004
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:08,079
grown uh A5 joint for the first time

2005
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:10,960
well do it secluded somewhere like you

2006
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:12,679
know you feel at ease and at home and

2007
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,158
comfortable it's more like a psychedelic

2008
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:17,520
a little bit okay well the C5 is more

2009
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:20,799
friendly and she's more playful but also

2010
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:23,920
not to be underestimated in uh in sheer

2011
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:26,400
potency for uh the novel smoker let's

2012
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:29,679
say okay not for the ones that really

2013
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:31,319
are aware of what cannabis is and uh

2014
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:34,079
they can take it more but when you're

2015
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:36,439
used to cush cushies and cakes and you

2016
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:39,760
smoke your first Haze joint well it can

2017
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:42,158
give you a little smack let's

2018
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,000
say that's a that's a great way to put

2019
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:46,238
it I realized I don't know if I'd

2020
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,039
actually asked you yet have you ever had

2021
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:52,439
much experience with just straight Haze

2022
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:54,840
in the various incarnations it has yeah

2023
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:58,000
well I had the pleasure to uh you know

2024
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:01,560
encounter people that hold yeah also

2025
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,960
special pure Haze lines and tap into

2026
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,880
those to really see what comes out of it

2027
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:09,198
and props to them because yeah yeah

2028
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:11,960
they're really like you these plants are

2029
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:15,319
like but like I say usually they don't

2030
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:17,560
deliver so much so it's like more um so

2031
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:20,118
it's like more for personal usage these

2032
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:23,119
people are that are really into it like

2033
01:26:20,118 --> 01:26:25,198
uh when you grow full hazes

2034
01:26:23,118 --> 01:26:27,279
I don't say they they don't exist there

2035
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:30,719
some phenotypical Expressions might

2036
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:33,319
produce really nice okay but um compared

2037
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:35,359
to these hybrids uh from my experience

2038
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:37,158
they are more finicky and they're yeah

2039
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:40,599
they're they're also different leaking

2040
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:43,479
plants but um the high that it produces

2041
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:46,239
well it's like an amazing thing okay

2042
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:47,279
it's also different so it's more for

2043
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:50,559
really the

2044
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:52,920
Pasion um that um that really uh wants

2045
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,639
to get high from these that truly

2046
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,440
Embraces them and I know of course

2047
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:58,440
because I'm a passionate of myself you

2048
01:26:56,439 --> 01:27:01,118
get to know these people in your

2049
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:03,319
community and uh and and then you travel

2050
01:27:01,118 --> 01:27:05,079
or you go we have a fair PES in

2051
01:27:03,319 --> 01:27:07,039
Barcelona each year so you know like

2052
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:11,880
I've been going there for a lot of years

2053
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:13,880
now and there are other fairs too like K

2054
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,800
and and you know there's some things in

2055
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:20,279
Germany Germany is looking to legalize

2056
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:22,239
it too or like regulate anyway so um I

2057
01:27:20,279 --> 01:27:24,238
see a lot of good things happening in

2058
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:26,439
that regard and you meet a lot of people

2059
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,759
and some people yeah you know like yeah

2060
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:31,759
they have also fire it's great you know

2061
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:33,719
and they're usually not really the the

2062
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,360
yeah like the the biggest names in the

2063
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:37,399
industry or like have the biggest

2064
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:39,279
Instagram Pages or what they're usually

2065
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:41,238
more like yeah the people that really

2066
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:43,840
you know have the passion for it and

like you know they so we sit around the

2068
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,039
table and exchange things and yeah it's

2069
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:51,520
it's it's always a great thing okay to

2070
01:27:48,039 --> 01:27:52,760
meet likeminded and people that yeah and

2071
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,800
especially the

2072
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:58,000
because I'm always looking for that if

2073
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:01,679
there's some with a good piece of really

2074
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:05,118
that good old authentic lianes turkeys

2075
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:07,719
or you know like Nepal the best case

2076
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:10,439
scenario yeah geopolitical there it's

2077
01:28:07,719 --> 01:28:13,198
very tough okay these people live under

2078
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:15,839
so so tight regimes they cannot do what

2079
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:18,198
the Smugglers also not so it's time to

2080
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:21,039
reform the world so that we can access

2081
01:28:18,198 --> 01:28:24,039
this hashes again so shout

2082
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:24,039
out

2083
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:31,759
I love it I love it we are 100% right or

2084
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:33,399
die for hash I love it really seriously

2085
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,039
okay these people been doing it for

2086
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:36,960
thousands of years and you know with

2087
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:39,439
modern technology that we can provide

2088
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,319
them in the west so that was also what

2089
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:43,919
made the nepales that I referred to

2090
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:45,679
earlier as the best smoke I ever had

2091
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,639
that made it so exclusive because there

2092
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:51,039
were people Wester there that were like

2093
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:54,520
helping assisting these families to

2094
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:57,560
produce an extra quality of hashes okay

2095
01:28:54,520 --> 01:29:00,920
like to refine it more pure with modern

2096
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:03,400
techniques okay and that led to a

2097
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:07,520
spectacular Synergy that provided the

2098
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:11,319
best MH I you ever was able to access

2099
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:13,880
for me personally in my uh personal

2100
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:15,719
realm of reality I do not say that other

2101
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,760
people have maybe also Treasures in

2102
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:20,880
their pockets but for me that was the

2103
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:23,600
Pinnacle of GES okay and so I'm sure

2104
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,639
it's possible to make it there but yeah

2105
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:31,760
you know like now Nepal is not such

2106
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:34,118
a stable area sadly so um it's yeah we

2107
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:37,520
hope to change that in time okay let's

2108
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:40,399
hope and pray so we can access this

2109
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:43,400
marvelous thing again okay because it's

2110
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:46,000
really something unique and very know

2111
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:47,879
it's a treasure of humankind also okay

2112
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,439
and we need to learn from it and respect

2113
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:53,159
it but yeah like I say Okay small steps

2114
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:55,839
towards the future man

2115
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:58,519
and hopefully a GI Le

2116
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,880
soon 100% I think we all can get on

2117
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:03,000
board we would all love to try some of

2118
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,039
that nepes hash you describe it sounds

2119
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
like it's uh it's going to be worth the

2120
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,760
wait but I just want to quickly loop

2121
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,198
back because the the listeners will be

2122
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:13,159
very upset if I don't ask you know can

2123
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,599
we grab a quick description in the same

2124
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:17,960
way you describe the A5 and the C5 of

2125
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,639
the hash plant Haze the Neville's Haze

2126
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:22,600
and the

2127
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:25,560
AG13 yeah well the ag3 and the hush

2128
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,960
blant Haze they're more like um Afghani

2129
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:30,760
influenced okay but they are really also

2130
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:33,198
two Haze Expressions let's say the hash

2131
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:36,039
plant Haze it has this remarkable hashy

2132
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:39,158
taste to it and it was very

2133
01:30:36,039 --> 01:30:42,000
stoned Haze okay it was the stonest of

2134
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:43,879
all so it was really like it's a

2135
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,359
different Stone than for you could say

2136
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:49,000
that you get stoned from A52 but it's

2137
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:50,719
like more obliterating like okay but

2138
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,639
this one was really it cracked you down

2139
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:55,480
the Afghan was strong let's say in the

2140
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:57,920
harsh plant Haze and it delivered like

2141
01:30:55,479 --> 01:31:01,359
this giant galaxis also it's like a

2142
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:05,560
unique cultivar very shining very

2143
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:08,079
abundant and resin also um but um harder

2144
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:11,480
to grow so like a little bit more less

2145
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:15,118
power to it than compared to the ANL

2146
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:17,238
hazes in terms of sensitivity because

2147
01:31:15,118 --> 01:31:19,679
when you grow it right it has power but

2148
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:23,959
it's more sensitive let's say uh the

2149
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:27,600
at13 is a it's also a very unique blend

2150
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:32,480
it's more like a Musky kind of type Haze

2151
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:36,039
um to smoke um I I prefer it for me it's

2152
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:38,959
the best hze a hybrid uh in the spectrum

2153
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:42,800
of these old cultivar or at least what I

2154
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:46,480
consider to be the best h a Crossing was

2155
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:49,440
AG13 because the G13 gives more like an

2156
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:51,039
relaxed tone to all this Haze Madness

2157
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:52,319
let's say Okay especially coming from

2158
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:54,719
the side

2159
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:56,679
and so it D it dampers it it's like you

2160
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,239
know it's like it's a really good

2161
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:02,158
combination it's more medicinal I think

2162
01:31:59,238 --> 01:32:03,879
also okay it's like an ideal smoke to uh

2163
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:05,920
to have when you're like not feeling

2164
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:09,000
good and you want to you know first do

2165
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:11,480
something initially it gives you this

2166
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:16,039
flash but then it goes it's more

2167
01:32:11,479 --> 01:32:18,919
relaxing okay it's more kind to to um

2168
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:21,920
compared to A5 so I think it's a better

2169
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:24,719
balanced uh Haze hybrid and all sense I

2170
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:26,760
like that the most from the a side and

2171
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,239
yeah the hash plant H like I say okay

2172
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:31,159
it's a very finicky plant to grow also

2173
01:32:29,238 --> 01:32:33,919
it's not really popular on the agenda

2174
01:32:31,158 --> 01:32:36,039
for most cultivators they all kind of

2175
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:39,079
like it's also what the market demands

2176
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:41,039
so the market usually demands A5 and N

2177
01:32:39,079 --> 01:32:44,319
because that's the two most powerful

2178
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:47,639
ones and so the C5 and then the has

2179
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:50,238
plant are not so much demand for it

2180
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:52,960
because it has to be grown to full

2181
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:56,039
potential to really be appreciated for

2182
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:58,719
what it is and so a lot of Growers

2183
01:32:56,039 --> 01:33:00,319
excuse me that attempt to grow it and

2184
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:02,800
fail a couple of times well they don't

2185
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:08,840
want to grow it anymore so they rather

2186
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:11,239
go to the aines ad13 now says A5 because

2187
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:13,400
um in that sense well it it needs

2188
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:17,319
different parameters to get to full

2189
01:33:13,399 --> 01:33:19,759
potential than the C lines and so

2190
01:33:17,319 --> 01:33:22,079
they're uh more a little bit more

2191
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:25,520
practical I think okay they have other

2192
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:28,559
complications let's say but so they are

2193
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:31,600
also more rock solid in butt formation

2194
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:34,360
and well the sea line tends to go a

2195
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:36,119
little bit more open flowerly when you

2196
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:39,439
not

2197
01:33:36,118 --> 01:33:41,599
uh cultivated it to full potential and

2198
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:44,000
in the worst case it turns to Hay like I

2199
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:46,000
say so if that happens to a cultivator

2200
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,760
paying in like four five months also

2201
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,600
putting in the effort and the cost and

2202
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,119
nothing comes in return because it's a

2203
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:55,119
Hast stack yeah he's not going to grow

2204
01:33:52,118 --> 01:33:56,719
it again let's say or you have to be

2205
01:33:55,118 --> 01:34:00,279
really good

2206
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:02,399
motivated so it's like this so the a

2207
01:34:00,279 --> 01:34:04,599
hybrids they have more appeal also for

2208
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:06,559
the people so they like the Flash and

2209
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:09,840
bank so to speak that obliterating

2210
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:12,000
feeling it's like popular to but to

2211
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:16,079
really delve into the finess Finesse of

2212
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,679
hze I think the the seaside is more um

2213
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:19,960
but over the years it got more

2214
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:22,199
hybridized with like shorter flowering

2215
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:25,039
varieties and so actually they breed

2216
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:27,599
away from the haze instead of enhancing

2217
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:30,279
it more in Dutch terminology then

2218
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,679
because it was more practical to grow so

2219
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:36,079
they want the flower time from going 14

2220
01:34:32,679 --> 01:34:38,760
weeks to let's say 11 weeks 10 weeks but

2221
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:41,719
still bit haesang into it and then um

2222
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:44,239
yeah you start selecting for that and uh

2223
01:34:41,719 --> 01:34:47,520
for commercial purposes more well we are

2224
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:49,759
being we kind of dig it so much and we

2225
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:53,119
also know how to grow it that we keep

2226
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:55,000
these plants to ourselves and cultivate

2227
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:57,839
them and we are like a little bit the L

2228
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:01,679
of the moans I think in that regard

2229
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:04,000
because um but now it shines back again

2230
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:06,118
like I say okay because this is a solid

2231
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,479
value in like the Cannabis Community

2232
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:10,799
these dayses and yeah and they will be

2233
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:13,559
forever there because when you grow it

2234
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:15,920
to full potential well you know you can

2235
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:18,159
throw it on the table and no matter what

2236
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:21,118
anybody carries they will say like wait

2237
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:21,920
this is unique like what that's very

2238
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:23,839
nice

2239
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,520
that's the way how you connect also with

2240
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:29,719
people in the community and uh that's a

2241
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:32,360
great thing you know I uh yeah it's been

2242
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:35,239
been a a Crazy Life over the years with

2243
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:38,479
my uh beautiful cultiv and the people I

2244
01:35:35,238 --> 01:35:40,359
have met by them that's awesome to hear

2245
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:42,519
I think uh you know in the midst of that

2246
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:45,158
epic answer I heard you mention that the

2247
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:46,920
Neville's Haze is one of the more potent

2248
01:35:45,158 --> 01:35:48,679
ones can you give us just a quick

2249
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,319
overview of the smell and the effect cuz

2250
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:52,239
I know that it's it's one you really

2251
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:55,399
don't see a lot in the modern SE and so

2252
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:57,519
people find it very elusive yeah so well

2253
01:35:55,399 --> 01:35:59,920
it depends on also the set and setting

2254
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:02,119
with these smokes so when you are in a

2255
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:05,000
comfortable set and setting it can be

2256
01:36:02,118 --> 01:36:06,599
very uh Pleasant initially let's say

2257
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,359
okay this sorting High you really

2258
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:11,199
connect and you get into something and

2259
01:36:08,359 --> 01:36:13,198
you're like completely in the zone but

2260
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:14,919
if you then have to go to pick some

2261
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:18,158
groceries in the shop and you step

2262
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:20,279
outside you're like what like this

2263
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:23,279
because like then it hits you how how

2264
01:36:20,279 --> 01:36:25,679
you how High you actually are you know

2265
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:27,840
and that can produce some anxiety with

2266
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:31,118
people you know like it's like this when

2267
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:34,039
you're used to smoking it but I found it

2268
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:37,799
very so it does something to your mind

2269
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:40,198
frame um you know like it's an awareness

2270
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:42,480
this plant so it it tampers with your

2271
01:36:40,198 --> 01:36:45,519
awareness like getting high there's so

2272
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:48,000
many varieties in it but these special

2273
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:49,679
varieties well they're unique but I

2274
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,439
think the Neville's Haze and the haze

2275
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:54,639
eight lines they very dark you know

2276
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:57,279
they're like they're nice to indulge in

2277
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:59,440
for a little while but then you kind of

2278
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:01,319
like yeah you lose it a little bit okay

2279
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:03,118
I mean like you because you live too

2280
01:37:01,319 --> 01:37:05,359
much in your own world or something

2281
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:07,679
because yeah you know like it's hard to

2282
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,118
maintain like a daily job and you talk

2283
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:12,679
this weed on daily basis okay because

2284
01:37:10,118 --> 01:37:14,559
you step into this different realm if

2285
01:37:12,679 --> 01:37:16,639
you're an artist then you can produce

2286
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:19,719
art it's maybe nice but when you have to

2287
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:21,520
work as an IT agent and you have to put

2288
01:37:19,719 --> 01:37:23,760
your mind at think it's just nice you

2289
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:27,679
know what I mean

2290
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:29,639
so I wouldn't say Hy um you know for me

2291
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:33,000
it's of course a passion and it's became

2292
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:35,600
my life but so you have to have a little

2293
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,880
bit of this passion also to appreciate

2294
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:41,639
it and to like yeah I don't know like uh

2295
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:44,520
live it like we do okay but uh I would

2296
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:46,679
not Advocate it to smoke um it daily

2297
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:49,280
when you're not ready for it so you have

2298
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:51,800
to really want it in your life and love

2299
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:53,840
it otherwise it can do a doing things

2300
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,360
with you and it still does for me once

2301
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,760
in a while too that's why I love the

2302
01:37:55,359 --> 01:38:03,960
bandid H7 number seven so much because

2303
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:06,560
it has the depth and um um figure it has

2304
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:11,599
all it takes all the boxes but so it has

2305
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:14,320
a more friendly High to it okay so it's

2306
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:16,560
less exhaustive also okay so it's very

2307
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:20,118
dreamy like mushroom wheat but in the

2308
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:22,719
best way possible it's very kind and A5

2309
01:38:20,118 --> 01:38:25,279
and nille say the aren't kind so each

2310
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:27,319
plant has this temperament let's say and

2311
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:31,158
so the temperament of the Neville's ha

2312
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:33,920
and the A5 Well w not so much okay

2313
01:38:31,158 --> 01:38:35,638
that's not my lady to go to to to go

2314
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,719
dancing with every night because she's

2315
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:40,760
rless okay she throws me around like

2316
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:43,719
[ __ ] so i' rather have

2317
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:45,400
like you know like a a different thing

2318
01:38:43,719 --> 01:38:47,760
it's nice little a joint you know you

2319
01:38:45,399 --> 01:38:50,198
get high and a few hours later it's gone

2320
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,480
but still you know so like the A5

2321
01:38:50,198 --> 01:38:54,039
lingers too long you know like it it

2322
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:56,000
puts you a little bit in this uneasy

2323
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:58,479
feel and the Neville ha said well it

2324
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,399
[ __ ] you up in your mind okay you know

2325
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:03,039
what's also the thing is I think with

2326
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:04,920
these more psychedelic or like so

2327
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:06,760
they're more spiritual and bettered and

2328
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:09,719
so they increase your awareness of

2329
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:12,159
things which is not always easy because

2330
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:13,679
well we live in a brutal Society okay

2331
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:15,960
and so when you're [ __ ] high

2332
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:18,118
all the time and look at what the human

2333
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,399
concept is and what we make of it well

2334
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:22,598
it's sometimes mindboggling let's say

2335
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:24,198
like what's smoke a joint and get high

2336
01:39:22,599 --> 01:39:26,199
because then it's nice like I say when

2337
01:39:24,198 --> 01:39:27,879
you sit around the table with a lot of

2338
01:39:26,198 --> 01:39:30,598
people comfortable and you share a joint

2339
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:32,520
like that or at a campfire or a festival

2340
01:39:30,599 --> 01:39:35,199
or like you know in these best case

2341
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:38,040
scenarios it really can you know enhance

2342
01:39:35,198 --> 01:39:40,598
your experience so much okay I once went

2343
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:42,519
to Mexico and I saw the palen ruins

2344
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:44,239
there the first time I went there I was

2345
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:46,199
sober and the next day I encountered

2346
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:48,439
somebody and I could smoked some Haze

2347
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:50,238
and we went back again and believe me

2348
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:53,279
like Mexican I don't know what it was

2349
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:55,598
but it was five okay well it was like a

2350
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:58,079
totally different experience as the day

2351
01:39:55,599 --> 01:40:01,279
before let's say okay and that's the

2352
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:03,639
weed I kind of like like to weed that

2353
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:06,880
that has this it's more a spiritual

2354
01:40:03,639 --> 01:40:09,400
thing okay for me it's like really makes

2355
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:12,279
you pay attention that's why I kind of

2356
01:40:09,399 --> 01:40:15,319
like it okay but indulging in it in our

2357
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:18,840
society well it's not the most easy

2358
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:21,158
thing long I can certainly appreciate

2359
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:23,560
the sentiment and we'll definitely get

2360
01:40:21,158 --> 01:40:25,399
to the the healing Band-Aid Haze very

2361
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,760
shortly I just want to ask you one last

2362
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:29,759
quick question in regards to these cuts

2363
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,440
and more specifically Neville did you

2364
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,119
ever have any interaction with Neville

2365
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:35,238
any thoughts on him and do you regard

2366
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:36,399
him as the the greatest of all time in

2367
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:39,158
terms of

2368
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:41,839
breeding oh well well nille his

2369
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:45,439
influence is indisputed this man created

2370
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:48,239
some things that are extraordinary okay

2371
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:50,960
that's true but you know like so it's

2372
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:53,198
like the story so Neville created the

2373
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,118
hybrids and with that actually you pav

2374
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:57,598
the way of modern cannabis let's say

2375
01:40:55,118 --> 01:41:01,118
okay so we the whole cannabis industry

2376
01:40:57,599 --> 01:41:04,319
and Community owe this man a great deal

2377
01:41:01,118 --> 01:41:07,079
of uh yeah you know like it's like yeah

2378
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:09,079
of course he is what he is and uh but

2379
01:41:07,079 --> 01:41:12,118
that also counts for instance for S

2380
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:15,118
skman who was bringing the seeds from

2381
01:41:12,118 --> 01:41:17,598
America and also then when you go past

2382
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:19,519
that the haze Brothers whoever they were

2383
01:41:17,599 --> 01:41:22,760
and maybe even the beatnet generation

2384
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:26,400
that were initially interested in uh in

2385
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:28,239
getting highlights say okay and so um

2386
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:31,479
then it's all a little bit connected I

2387
01:41:28,238 --> 01:41:34,519
see also his originated in Santa Cruz

2388
01:41:31,479 --> 01:41:39,279
California as far as historics

2389
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:43,719
go if we follow the historical

2390
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:46,719
uh uh uh part and uh

2391
01:41:43,719 --> 01:41:48,800
so then it came to Holland and nille got

2392
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:51,079
in touch with it and made something

2393
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,199
really remarkable for it because he has

2394
01:41:51,079 --> 01:41:56,118
he had a nose for it he had yeah so his

2395
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:59,079
bleeding work is like it speaks for

2396
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:02,039
itself okay we still live in his legacy

2397
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:05,439
for uh and we must be thankful for that

2398
01:42:02,039 --> 01:42:08,118
of course and uh you know we we were

2399
01:42:05,439 --> 01:42:11,479
lucky to um save guard theart from this

2400
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:14,279
man's Legacy and that he okay by being

2401
01:42:11,479 --> 01:42:17,279
preserved by loving them and like I said

2402
01:42:14,279 --> 01:42:22,840
I never really understood who Neville

2403
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:26,319
was it was um later by so we held the

2404
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:29,159
Clones let's say from these people got

2405
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:32,319
into trouble and we took the medip to

2406
01:42:29,158 --> 01:42:35,519
ourselves that was like 1999 the

2407
01:42:32,319 --> 01:42:38,238
Millennium change let's

2408
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:41,520
say then we went underground with it

2409
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:44,399
okay but I lost the A5 and I wanted to

2410
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:46,719
find it back and so internet then came

2411
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:49,839
and it revolutionize the world we can

2412
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:52,560
all agree on that too and so I was uh

2413
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:55,599
going online searching for it and that

2414
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:58,239
brought me then to the M&amp;S board because

2415
01:42:55,599 --> 01:43:01,119
there were similar genetics being made

2416
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:05,718
available so I'm like hey man this is

2417
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:07,920
maybe uh a way of retrieving the A5 back

2418
01:43:05,719 --> 01:43:10,560
and so uh I was a member on the boards

2419
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:12,880
and then Neville so I was reading about

2420
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:16,920
it and by being on an international

2421
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:19,079
board you could start understanding more

2422
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:21,800
about it so it was like a mirror that

2423
01:43:19,079 --> 01:43:24,479
was placed in front of me and I was like

2424
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:27,719
realizing now so we were never really

2425
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:29,959
affiliated with the Amsterdam scene back

2426
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:32,039
when I met these group that were Hing

2427
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:34,319
the hazes okay like I say we went there

2428
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:37,079
for a like to see the city and do some

2429
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:40,759
coffee shops but we never went there to

2430
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:43,880
really as as a cannabis Enthusiast let's

2431
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:46,320
say okay that came later but for us then

2432
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:49,039
it so we didn't have to drive two or

2433
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:52,679
three hours because it was available

2434
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:54,039
like around the corner so um so we held

2435
01:43:52,679 --> 01:43:57,319
it

2436
01:43:54,039 --> 01:43:59,519
here and um by being on the bars then I

2437
01:43:57,319 --> 01:44:01,399
could really beginning to understand

2438
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:03,760
like hey man we have something special

2439
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:05,638
here I knew they were for Neville but I

2440
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:08,400
never really paid attention how this

2441
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:12,279
cannabis Community before the bigger

2442
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:15,879
scheme then was in at play so I was just

2443
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:18,639
my secluded grower at pres preserving uh

2444
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:20,840
preservest of these plants safeguarding

2445
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,719
them by loving them so much and and then

2446
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:27,679
you get this feedback of people and then

2447
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:30,399
later through M&amp;S I got ined in inter in

2448
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:32,800
brief interaction with NVA but then the

2449
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:35,279
whole thing exploded there and yeah well

2450
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:38,480
so it came became like

2451
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:41,719
a something I rather steer away from and

2452
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:45,879
like oh my God okay well so I just love

2453
01:44:41,719 --> 01:44:48,319
these plants and uh yeah man so na may

2454
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:51,239
his soul rest in peace and we owe this

2455
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:53,840
man a really great thing and um because

2456
01:44:51,238 --> 01:44:56,439
he did something remarkable but you know

2457
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:58,560
he did it in Holland and so it's like so

2458
01:44:56,439 --> 01:45:01,279
it's more like so the people that are

2459
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:03,440
not in the spotlight also usually for

2460
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:06,439
preserving these plants well we owe them

2461
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:09,279
like really a ton of gratitude

2462
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:13,879
because uh nille was a great breeder but

2463
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:16,158
he was not a prist okay and so that's

2464
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:18,679
usually breeders are not the best

2465
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:21,238
reservist for one or reason or the other

2466
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:24,199
I don't know why it's used to also with

2467
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:26,279
illegal legislations not being able to

2468
01:45:24,198 --> 01:45:30,519
keep the plant parential clean or

2469
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:34,439
whatnot it can diver like it can have so

2470
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:38,639
many reasons okay why it goes wrong but

2471
01:45:34,439 --> 01:45:41,399
um so I never intended to breed with

2472
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:43,960
these plants until I could assess for

2473
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:47,719
myself how unique they were in the

2474
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:49,960
Cannabis genome okay and uh so then you

2475
01:45:47,719 --> 01:45:53,800
start paying attention but I never

2476
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:56,840
wanted to to you like um exploit them

2477
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:59,639
for any benefit sh for my own you know

2478
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:01,760
it's been part of our lives for so long

2479
01:45:59,639 --> 01:46:04,000
and so by being then on the Bo and

2480
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:06,119
realizing what you had well you know

2481
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,719
some people ask me like I really would

2482
01:46:06,118 --> 01:46:11,679
love to smoke this A5 and you know like

2483
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:14,399
so then we interact and so I give it

2484
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,920
away okay I'm like here grow it because

2485
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:18,279
I love these people

2486
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,880
also and then it's a different thing

2487
01:46:18,279 --> 01:46:21,880
okay and then they can grow it and then

2488
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:25,800
yeah of course it get shared and it's

2489
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:27,239
like how it is so it is what it is

2490
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:29,119
they're out there in the world and I

2491
01:46:27,238 --> 01:46:31,118
think that's a really great thing

2492
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:33,118
because that's where they belong and

2493
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:36,759
that's also why we kept them around for

2494
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:38,839
so many years okay only to yeah first

2495
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:41,320
and foremost be able to access them

2496
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,960
ourselves don't lose them and then in

2497
01:46:41,319 --> 01:46:45,238
the best case scenario that's what

2498
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,198
smokers do we get high together and of

2499
01:46:45,238 --> 01:46:51,039
course if you want it and I really you

2500
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:52,238
know we share that amen of course course

2501
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:54,519
that's how it

2502
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:56,519
happens yeah what what an awesome

2503
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:57,920
sentiment and uh an interesting

2504
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:59,840
observation as well you made about

2505
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,840
breeders and not being able to preserve

2506
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,159
I uh I've certainly lost a plant here

2507
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:06,599
and there I have to acknowledge it I'd

2508
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:09,198
love to ask you what's the uh what's the

2509
01:47:06,599 --> 01:47:11,360
backstory on the Miracle tie that ended

2510
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:13,479
up creating the Band-Aid Haze can you

2511
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:15,839
tell me how that one went down yeah it's

2512
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:18,439
a good question actually because in the

2513
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:21,599
end nobody knows what this medical tie

2514
01:47:18,439 --> 01:47:23,439
supposedly is so so it actually it

2515
01:47:21,599 --> 01:47:26,279
became Miracle because there was a

2516
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:29,439
coffee shop in that area that was called

2517
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:32,158
miracle and so these people that were

2518
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:35,039
providing A5 flowers they had a crop

2519
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:37,679
there and whether it's like I don't know

2520
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:40,519
what it is so something pollinated a

2521
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:42,639
crop and there were some seeds from it

2522
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:45,080
and so these were kept around for Long

2523
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:47,800
by the people there that were the people

2524
01:47:45,079 --> 01:47:51,079
that actually also safeguarded the A5

2525
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:54,840
clone for long well uh in this this area

2526
01:47:51,079 --> 01:47:58,719
got lost and so the seats would then

2527
01:47:54,840 --> 01:48:01,360
sent to the US where they resulted in

2528
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:03,480
this mail that then eventually uh

2529
01:48:01,359 --> 01:48:06,679
produced the bandaid number seven it

2530
01:48:03,479 --> 01:48:09,319
speaks for itself so thankfully we we

2531
01:48:06,679 --> 01:48:11,840
made some seats with that also so we

2532
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:14,000
have it now in our vaults ready to like

2533
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,520
I say when the legislation change all

2534
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,279
these seeds and these genetics were made

2535
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:23,239
available and thank God we have enough

2536
01:48:18,279 --> 01:48:25,039
of them like the A5 crossed to the A5 TI

2537
01:48:23,238 --> 01:48:27,000
which are nice lines so we are

2538
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:30,158
preserving what we can whether it's in

2539
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,279
plant form or seed form to once you know

2540
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:37,598
like uh tap into this genome more

2541
01:48:34,279 --> 01:48:40,039
um uh deeper let's say and see what

2542
01:48:37,599 --> 01:48:42,480
comes out of it because the band 87 it's

2543
01:48:40,039 --> 01:48:45,760
just an example of what to find in that

2544
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:48,519
it's such a unique beautiful cultivar

2545
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,199
but also not easy to grow so it's also

2546
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:53,080
like this when people are used to grow

2547
01:48:50,198 --> 01:48:55,598
going like Haze hybrids that go like um

2548
01:48:53,079 --> 01:48:59,399
12 weeks and they used to chop it around

2549
01:48:55,599 --> 01:49:02,719
let's say the 90day market or like then

2550
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:05,439
well the Band-Aid start then then

2551
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:07,840
producing Beauty so you have to give it

2552
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:09,919
time because it goes like to 15 weeks up

2553
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,560
to 15 weeks and even then you might go

2554
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:16,039
to 16 weeks if you really want to grow

2555
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:19,880
it properly but then she is like wow she

2556
01:49:16,039 --> 01:49:22,279
blows she's like amazing okay wow this

2557
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:24,480
really can stand next to it and so that

2558
01:49:22,279 --> 01:49:27,479
only shows the potential of these

2559
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:29,718
genetics towards the future and so I'm

2560
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:32,959
thankful to be privileged to be working

2561
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:35,239
these uh exclusive genetics in that way

2562
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:38,560
and then you you also see how the

2563
01:49:35,238 --> 01:49:41,039
breeding potential how how high it is

2564
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:43,880
okay but like I say most commercial

2565
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:46,118
Growers don't want it okay because they

2566
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:48,599
have streamline facilities and if you

2567
01:49:46,118 --> 01:49:51,039
are like you know doing a a thousand

2568
01:49:48,599 --> 01:49:53,480
indoor lights and you put it cultiv like

2569
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:56,679
that and it and it goes wrong well you

2570
01:49:53,479 --> 01:49:58,359
are 20 weeks further and well it's a big

2571
01:49:56,679 --> 01:50:00,920
problem let's

2572
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:03,079
say that's really interesting I I

2573
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:06,158
haven't uh been fortunate enough to to

2574
01:50:03,079 --> 01:50:07,800
try the Band-Aid 7 myself but the the

2575
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:09,960
thing I was wanting to ask you was

2576
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:13,039
obviously it was Miracle tie onto that

2577
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:15,520
A5 and then bod crossed it to the Cuban

2578
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:18,359
black Haze the Cuban black Haze that's

2579
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:21,440
suspected of being like a very A5 like

2580
01:50:18,359 --> 01:50:24,279
it is very A5 leaning for heard and then

2581
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:26,359
the A5 itself is in there so it's

2582
01:50:24,279 --> 01:50:28,880
interesting that the Band-Aid Haze like

2583
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:29,920
would you say the effect is like the A5

2584
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:32,760
or not

2585
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:35,199
really it's much better the effect you

2586
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:38,639
know like so it has the deepness of like

2587
01:50:35,198 --> 01:50:41,279
the h a side to it but it doesn't um

2588
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:44,239
[ __ ] with your mindset so much okay it's

2589
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:47,399
not so negative the effects so it's much

2590
01:50:44,238 --> 01:50:50,439
more positive and bright inspiring and

2591
01:50:47,399 --> 01:50:51,638
creative instead of more that kind of

2592
01:50:50,439 --> 01:50:54,678
[Music]

2593
01:50:51,639 --> 01:50:57,440
overthinking things like you know like

2594
01:50:54,679 --> 01:50:59,800
like or you get fixated at something or

2595
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:02,960
like it's hard to describe how it works

2596
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:05,719
actually but it's much more friendly and

2597
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:08,800
it has this A5 progy like you say it's

2598
01:51:05,719 --> 01:51:12,039
actually you know so A5 cross to

2599
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:15,440
question mark this mail and so it would

2600
01:51:12,039 --> 01:51:17,560
be nice to with our modern technology

2601
01:51:15,439 --> 01:51:20,799
like to lab test it further to see in

2602
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:23,800
the future which actually is close

2603
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:26,199
related to whatever the male was that

2604
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:29,880
pollinated this A5 because when you look

2605
01:51:26,198 --> 01:51:32,359
at the B7 well it's exceptional okay and

2606
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:35,199
so it's on the Cuban black ha as you

2607
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:38,439
said now I haven't grown the Cuban black

2608
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:41,678
Hae itself here and I know there are

2609
01:51:38,439 --> 01:51:43,598
many Cuban black haes going around so

2610
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:47,078
it's hard to distinguish actually which

2611
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:50,440
one body used I I I don't know that so I

2612
01:51:47,078 --> 01:51:54,039
cannot confirm it but so it's probably

2613
01:51:50,439 --> 01:51:57,319
also from what I've heard the best

2614
01:51:54,039 --> 01:52:02,158
assumption that I have to make from

2615
01:51:57,319 --> 01:52:06,559
my you limited uh abilities to assess it

2616
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:09,279
let's say it's probably uh a nville haze

2617
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:12,760
that was shipped back then in the early

2618
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:15,198
90s or maybe late 80s when it's these

2619
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:17,000
tester seeds were available maybe back

2620
01:52:15,198 --> 01:52:20,198
then I'm not sure it's just like

2621
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:22,679
speculation okay but the morphology of

2622
01:52:20,198 --> 01:52:25,279
this Cuban black Haze well it's more

2623
01:52:22,679 --> 01:52:28,239
comparable to the NV Haze we have here

2624
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:30,599
than it is to A5 or C5 it has a

2625
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:33,279
different structure okay and I see when

2626
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:37,319
I see pictures of this cultivar of the

2627
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:42,039
Cuban black Haze I see more like um this

2628
01:52:37,319 --> 01:52:45,279
type of um Str morphology structure as I

2629
01:52:42,039 --> 01:52:47,760
can see it in the navel face and that's

2630
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:51,679
different so it has more like

2631
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:53,679
um it's it's very uh but it's Stout so

2632
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:56,078
it's more stouty compared to the hazes

2633
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:59,679
we have but it's branching is more like

2634
01:52:56,078 --> 01:53:02,599
this uh so uh it's also not floting so

2635
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:06,078
long I think it's only 12 weeks or

2636
01:53:02,599 --> 01:53:07,880
something anyway that's what I heard so

2637
01:53:06,078 --> 01:53:11,279
that's the best assumtion I have if

2638
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:15,840
that's the case then it's actually uh A5

2639
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:19,078
cross to AC cross to A5 cross to

2640
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:23,078
question mark okay whatever it is it's

2641
01:53:19,078 --> 01:53:27,000
like a really good um combination and um

2642
01:53:23,078 --> 01:53:28,759
so it's only sad that only the band Haze

2643
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,880
got selected because I think in the seed

2644
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:33,000
light could be more but it's a unique

2645
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:35,239
culer and it's it's really a keep it

2646
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,639
plant this one okay and I have tested

2647
01:53:35,238 --> 01:53:41,598
many seeds I didn't come across uh any

2648
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:44,719
keepers like I tested many hazes other

2649
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:48,319
hazes the Amnesia Haze was also nice but

2650
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:52,279
yeah it didn't really appeal to me uh in

2651
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:52,960
um High and overall plant compared to A5

2652
01:53:52,279 --> 01:53:56,599
or

2653
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:59,800
C5 uh also super silver is not so much

2654
01:53:56,599 --> 01:54:02,800
like like I say okay the mango Haze in

2655
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:07,840
terms of morphology also not but I like

2656
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:10,239
the its um smok ability a lot okay so

2657
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:12,199
it's like this yeah but the Bandit H

2658
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:15,718
really sticks out so whatever the male

2659
01:54:12,198 --> 01:54:19,319
was that hit the A5 well it has it's

2660
01:54:15,719 --> 01:54:22,158
makes a really good Bland let's say they

2661
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:25,000
were all seats also I think they TR them

2662
01:54:22,158 --> 01:54:27,799
all but they only had success to find

2663
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:30,840
one mail in it but sadly it got lost

2664
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:34,480
okay that's also that we come again

2665
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:36,239
preserve preserving okay may like that

2666
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:39,158
well it was for nille also back in the

2667
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:42,118
day h a also got lost very early

2668
01:54:39,158 --> 01:54:46,439
actually so then there was only HC left

2669
01:54:42,118 --> 01:54:49,039
which make the ace a hybrids more like

2670
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:51,559
mesmerizing or like legendary because

2671
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:55,158
they are only few few of them okay well

2672
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:59,440
see then later got that was uh around so

2673
01:54:55,158 --> 01:55:01,799
much later so it was then usable to

2674
01:54:59,439 --> 01:55:03,359
create other hybrids but like I say

2675
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:06,679
usually they steered away a little bit

2676
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:10,000
from the haze side the commercial side

2677
01:55:06,679 --> 01:55:12,599
of the spectrum then because the in

2678
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,520
Practical to cultivate it to full

2679
01:55:12,599 --> 01:55:19,239
potential okay so they had they they

2680
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,239
that two more Streamlight plants because

2681
01:55:19,238 --> 01:55:23,399
it's

2682
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:26,678
more easy to cultivate let's say okay so

2683
01:55:23,399 --> 01:55:28,879
then the hybridation further came and

2684
01:55:26,679 --> 01:55:31,399
you know so the je got a little bit

2685
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:33,960
diluted in the H SE thing but if you

2686
01:55:31,399 --> 01:55:36,479
have it in pure form still well it has a

2687
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:38,960
sheer power and it's more friendly like

2688
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:41,439
I say but on the other hand the Band-Aid

2689
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:43,399
Haze being cubid black Haze which I

2690
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:46,519
think is also leaning more to the haze

2691
01:55:43,399 --> 01:55:48,399
aite definitely in Scent so I had the

2692
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:50,280
privilege to go to New York so I didn't

2693
01:55:48,399 --> 01:55:52,439
grow it I have didn't have a chance to

2694
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:55,880
grow it but then I was able to sample

2695
01:55:52,439 --> 01:56:00,078
some of this cubid black face and it's

2696
01:55:55,880 --> 01:56:03,840
clearly related to uh the aine okay so

2697
01:56:00,078 --> 01:56:06,158
it has the same kind of more seene smell

2698
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:08,920
to it like you know it's not that liver

2699
01:56:06,158 --> 01:56:11,960
I didn't find liver in it so much but

2700
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:14,840
yeah it has that darken rotten fermented

2701
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:17,359
thing to to it in a certain way so I can

2702
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:20,319
see the relation between the Cuban black

2703
01:56:17,359 --> 01:56:23,359
ha and nville work clearly okay it's

2704
01:56:20,319 --> 01:56:25,479
definitely related 100% but when you

2705
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:28,598
then think that the cub in Black Hae

2706
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:32,678
with this A5 cultivar produce such a

2707
01:56:28,599 --> 01:56:34,840
nice um cultivar in morphology I can

2708
01:56:32,679 --> 01:56:38,359
understand it but in smok ability it was

2709
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:41,078
a surprise because it doesn't have this

2710
01:56:38,359 --> 01:56:45,679
um um

2711
01:56:41,078 --> 01:56:49,439
negative so possible negative um sphere

2712
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:51,560
that usually comes from h a hybrids you

2713
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:53,559
you know it's more to the SE side of it

2714
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:55,960
that's why I think the Cuban black Cas

2715
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:58,639
might be a n say okay there's some C in

2716
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:01,118
it or this question mark pollinating the

2717
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:03,639
A5 might also have a play in it who to

2718
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:06,198
know we should also look into lab

2719
01:57:03,639 --> 01:57:09,440
testing it to find out maybe okay where

2720
01:57:06,198 --> 01:57:11,960
it fits into like a but this science is

2721
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:14,118
also emerging we can now test genomes

2722
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:15,439
and whatnot but like this library is

2723
01:57:14,118 --> 01:57:18,839
still a little bit

2724
01:57:15,439 --> 01:57:22,759
debatable like it's like not really

2725
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:25,440
clear yet so we have to investigate

2726
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:28,400
further to see the correlation between

2727
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:30,399
things okay then we can establish to say

2728
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:33,799
it's possibly this I don't personally

2729
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:36,479
think it's a th that pollinated this A5

2730
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:38,920
but who who to know okay who's to know

2731
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:42,678
it's a miracle that's what it is because

2732
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:45,000
it produced the bandaid and yeah so

2733
01:57:42,679 --> 01:57:47,639
fabulous go okay

2734
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,039
unique totally totally speaks for itself

2735
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:51,000
and as you said it'll be awesome one day

2736
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:53,519
if we are able to test these things and

2737
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,039
get an answer one of the questions we

2738
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:58,040
had submitted by a few different

2739
01:57:55,039 --> 01:57:59,960
listeners is uh you know dubie of a

2740
01:57:58,039 --> 01:58:01,039
seeds good friend of the show we'd love

2741
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:03,078
to hear a little bit about your

2742
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:04,519
collaboration with him what were some of

2743
01:58:03,078 --> 01:58:07,479
your thoughts on the crosses and do you

2744
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:10,199
have maybe a favorite yeah well you know

2745
01:58:07,479 --> 01:58:13,519
do we had an interesting Library I think

2746
01:58:10,198 --> 01:58:17,039
in potential plans to make these clones

2747
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:20,360
also uh and more available to the wide

2748
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:23,760
stream audience in a way I saw

2749
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:26,359
more fitting the hair looms itself

2750
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:29,880
because like I said usually they been

2751
01:58:26,359 --> 01:58:33,799
Brad with to away from the haze and so

2752
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:36,960
his more nldd Rich Library sparkled my

2753
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:38,480
enthusiasm to contact him and to say hey

2754
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:41,639
man you know like you have nice

2755
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:44,118
parentals I have some special hair looms

2756
01:58:41,639 --> 01:58:46,199
you know uh what you think you know we

2757
01:58:44,118 --> 01:58:48,719
can maybe you know enhance the Jean pool

2758
01:58:46,198 --> 01:58:50,638
with that and make this wheed accessible

2759
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:52,840
because over Years A lot of people ask

2760
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:55,760
me to please send me the A5 please send

2761
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:58,360
me the C5 and I can understand it but

2762
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:00,599
you know I I I would be mailing like 100

2763
01:58:58,359 --> 01:59:03,118
clones every day just not possible it's

2764
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:05,400
just not doable okay so I have shared it

2765
01:59:03,118 --> 01:59:09,799
with some people that I consider being

2766
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:12,198
part of my intimate sphere okay and it's

2767
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:14,199
it's like this usually that that these

2768
01:59:12,198 --> 01:59:16,638
plants are exchanged also and they

2769
01:59:14,198 --> 01:59:18,279
become friends and then you do it then

2770
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:22,159
of course it spreads out but that's a

2771
01:59:18,279 --> 01:59:25,158
different story but um so with is I had

2772
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:27,920
like so his partials were nice and uh so

2773
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:31,319
we done experimented and got together

2774
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:33,760
and we are still working on um like um

2775
01:59:31,319 --> 01:59:36,118
so it's an R&amp;D phase so he chose the

2776
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:38,239
Malawi because he's in favor of that and

2777
01:59:36,118 --> 01:59:40,519
I did some work previously myself with

2778
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:47,078
Malawi that actually brought me to a

2779
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:49,800
seeds because I had a um a mutual Um

2780
01:59:47,078 --> 01:59:52,158
passion let's say he was working with

2781
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:54,760
this a seeds line and he had poen from

2782
01:59:52,158 --> 01:59:58,279
an excep Mayhill he found in the Malawi

2783
01:59:54,760 --> 02:00:00,199
line so then he we he exchanged pollen

2784
01:59:58,279 --> 02:00:02,479
with me and I did my own little work and

2785
02:00:00,198 --> 02:00:04,879
I was like hey man the progy is really

2786
02:00:02,479 --> 02:00:07,718
good okay the first time I see like

2787
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:10,480
something I'm looking for in like what's

2788
02:00:07,719 --> 02:00:13,279
what was the progy then of these

2789
02:00:10,479 --> 02:00:17,439
meetings and so that's uh by going to

2790
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:20,639
spab Lou is also based in Spain uh yeah

2791
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:23,039
our wells you know connected there so um

2792
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:24,599
we then uh decided to look into it and

2793
02:00:23,039 --> 02:00:28,039
uh do some breedings together I

2794
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:30,360
personally like the super Malawi uh Haze

2795
02:00:28,039 --> 02:00:32,519
or like this yeah what's it called

2796
02:00:30,359 --> 02:00:36,118
Malawi Haze I think it's the nille haze

2797
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:37,760
cross to the Malawi and uh so like I

2798
02:00:36,118 --> 02:00:40,639
said they are long flowering plants so

2799
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:44,480
he has now also released some with

2800
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:47,078
ohakam and uh with Panama and so I

2801
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:49,559
smoked some because we also have a

2802
02:00:47,078 --> 02:00:52,158
collective here of people that you know

2803
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:55,679
like pop some seeds to see what's in it

2804
02:00:52,158 --> 02:00:58,679
and so I liked with the Panama the A5

2805
02:00:55,679 --> 02:01:01,239
Panama liked really nicely and so there

2806
02:00:58,679 --> 02:01:03,679
are some people growing it now it takes

2807
02:01:01,238 --> 02:01:06,118
long to grow it so we are waiting for

2808
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:09,480
actually the people's preferences and

2809
02:01:06,118 --> 02:01:13,439
then there will be a few lines that Ace

2810
02:01:09,479 --> 02:01:15,238
can uh use to enhance his own library

2811
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:17,839
but I think he does fabulous work with

2812
02:01:15,238 --> 02:01:20,439
his own thing and uh he's good guy and

2813
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:22,760
he knows a lot about bre so in that

2814
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:25,879
regard I found it very interesting also

2815
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:28,560
to make so a lot of people beg me for A5

2816
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:30,639
and no know okay so I'm like okay let's

2817
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:33,679
make it accessible for people you know

2818
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:36,440
but in a way I think it's a good way not

2819
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:38,158
uh do another Super Silver ha story or

2820
02:01:36,439 --> 02:01:40,719
like you know Jack har or whatever you

2821
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:43,078
know or also not with cushies because I

2822
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:45,719
think the Kush takes a lot too much away

2823
02:01:43,078 --> 02:01:49,920
from h i mean morphology wise they can

2824
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:52,158
produce really ex extraordinary PL PLS

2825
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:54,880
but you get this Custer pins in it you

2826
02:01:52,158 --> 02:01:57,719
can so it downgrades this haste too much

2827
02:01:54,880 --> 02:02:00,719
it's too overpowering so I rather have

2828
02:01:57,719 --> 02:02:02,920
done a natural blend in it like Thai or

2829
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:05,679
like natural varieties land races that

2830
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:08,039
are also being refined by a breeder work

2831
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:10,560
like Ace is doing and then bring these

2832
02:02:08,039 --> 02:02:12,719
two Wells together to you know allow

2833
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:15,039
people to have you know like an idea of

2834
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:17,960
what it is to smoke an A5 because you

2835
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:20,760
have phenotypes so I

2836
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:22,719
like so I like it very much and I like

2837
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:25,599
get a lot of gratitude from people also

2838
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:28,679
to make it available in this kind of

2839
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:30,360
more sphere okay and we are all yeah

2840
02:02:28,679 --> 02:02:32,520
based in Europe try and we are also

2841
02:02:30,359 --> 02:02:34,639
fighting for better better legislations

2842
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:36,960
here and so we are assisting each other

2843
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:41,840
also to you know enhance our

2844
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:44,880
capabilities to uh yeah you know uh make

2845
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:47,599
the broad awareness here uh that it's a

2846
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:50,359
good B it's a normal thing okay it

2847
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:51,679
should be considered as mind making so

2848
02:02:50,359 --> 02:02:55,759
you know like this

2849
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:58,800
tolerated more or less um wave that that

2850
02:02:55,760 --> 02:03:00,760
has hidden Europe uh while we're not

2851
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:02,719
there yet okay we need better

2852
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:05,360
legislations and then we can do proper

2853
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:09,078
work let's say okay but I think a seeds

2854
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:11,279
is one of the more professional here in

2855
02:03:09,078 --> 02:03:14,039
Europe that has some interesting

2856
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:16,319
genetics and therefore I wanted to cross

2857
02:03:14,039 --> 02:03:19,479
and I would say that thaten to I I

2858
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:22,639
personally like sea lines a lot

2859
02:03:19,479 --> 02:03:24,839
and so usually the people go for the A5

2860
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:27,960
cross to whatever okay because they all

2861
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:30,639
want this A5 Z but I recommend people to

2862
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:33,239
tap into the sea line too because yeah

2863
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:36,599
the sea has something you know like so

2864
02:03:33,238 --> 02:03:39,279
people that want to smoke daily this and

2865
02:03:36,599 --> 02:03:41,719
the the sea line yeah it's a treasure

2866
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:43,319
okay so I can only recommend people also

2867
02:03:41,719 --> 02:03:46,118
to look into that because it's

2868
02:03:43,319 --> 02:03:48,599
worthwhile believe me what an awesome

2869
02:03:46,118 --> 02:03:50,719
answer I love it and uh i' I've sused

2870
02:03:48,599 --> 02:03:52,599
theist this out myself plenty of

2871
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:54,639
mouthwatering options on there I reckon

2872
02:03:52,599 --> 02:03:56,279
that all be killer I'd love to ask you

2873
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:58,800
you know cuz Ace offers and works with a

2874
02:03:56,279 --> 02:04:00,639
lot of land R stuff have you have you

2875
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:02,559
been tracking or got any thoughts on

2876
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:04,319
some of the newer land race genetics

2877
02:04:02,559 --> 02:04:06,840
that have been coming in by way of

2878
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:08,679
places like Indian Land race exchange

2879
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:10,279
and some of these other cool cats in the

2880
02:04:08,679 --> 02:04:12,039
community some of these other guys in

2881
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:13,599
the community who are out there

2882
02:04:12,039 --> 02:04:14,760
collecting land race genetics and

2883
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:17,639
offering them do you have any thoughts

2884
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:20,639
on that yeah well you know it depends

2885
02:04:17,639 --> 02:04:22,840
also what your personal preferences so

2886
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:27,078
land races well

2887
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:29,119
so a land race is usually not the most

2888
02:04:27,078 --> 02:04:31,920
suitable cultiv are to place in an

2889
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:34,279
indoor VAR environment okay then they

2890
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:36,800
have to be exceptional I don't say it's

2891
02:04:34,279 --> 02:04:39,759
not possible but you give and take the

2892
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:42,079
fact that if a plant is produced for

2893
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:44,280
instance in India for like number of

2894
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:46,960
years and you you tap into a seed line

2895
02:04:44,279 --> 02:04:51,719
here well it's a very different cultivar

2896
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:54,118
than let's say uh uh yeah than any other

2897
02:04:51,719 --> 02:04:57,960
cultivar and so it's a personal

2898
02:04:54,118 --> 02:05:02,039
preference taste okay um for

2899
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:04,880
me ganja is ganja so if I want to smoke

2900
02:05:02,039 --> 02:05:06,279
um Indian varieties I smoke their hash

2901
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,199
preferably

2902
02:05:06,279 --> 02:05:12,359
okay and so I'm not really looking in

2903
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:15,238
that but some land races of course are

2904
02:05:12,359 --> 02:05:17,920
different okay so ganja the ganja

2905
02:05:15,238 --> 02:05:20,799
countries uh they have different land

2906
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:23,279
races than the har countries when you

2907
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:26,480
look at the Thai varieties or like their

2908
02:05:23,279 --> 02:05:28,920
regions that these um or like southeast

2909
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:31,839
Asia more generally speaking okay they

2910
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:34,319
they smoke the ganja there and then so

2911
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:36,440
like um from areas where Hashi is

2912
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:39,920
produced well these cultiv they're harsh

2913
02:05:36,439 --> 02:05:42,158
cultiv okay so they're totally different

2914
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:43,520
and to place them in an indoor

2915
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:46,519
environment

2916
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:49,280
well well it's not what I would aim for

2917
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:50,960
or look for you know but ganja VAR ities

2918
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:54,279
land race varieties they are really

2919
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:57,158
interesting to um enhance the Jean Pool

2920
02:05:54,279 --> 02:05:59,238
the ganja Jean pool with okay so I don't

2921
02:05:57,158 --> 02:06:02,598
necessarily say it's bad to have a the

2922
02:05:59,238 --> 02:06:06,198
better variety in your Jean Pool I think

2923
02:06:02,599 --> 02:06:09,520
they could be nice surprising in terms

2924
02:06:06,198 --> 02:06:13,678
of getting high maybe but they're not

2925
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:15,520
really made for um the realm of people

2926
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:18,158
that produce weat I think it's not for

2927
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:20,880
the big Market I think it's also a very

2928
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:23,519
niche market so people will dive into it

2929
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,960
for personal preferences but not

2930
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:28,280
necessarily because they are the most um

2931
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:30,559
yielding and rewarding PLS or out

2932
02:06:28,279 --> 02:06:32,279
speaking so to speak okay so it's all

2933
02:06:30,559 --> 02:06:34,279
about personal preference which is a

2934
02:06:32,279 --> 02:06:36,800
good thing and I only you know like

2935
02:06:34,279 --> 02:06:39,840
applaud these people for doing it but

2936
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:43,360
for me personally it's not the my field

2937
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:46,239
of interest interest in merging um

2938
02:06:43,359 --> 02:06:49,359
Realms of ganja with each other because

2939
02:06:46,238 --> 02:06:51,799
has well like I said they are made but

2940
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:54,558
they are usually has cultiv it says

2941
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:58,079
speak for itself like the has is a very

2942
02:06:54,559 --> 02:06:59,239
good example so it can work for instance

2943
02:06:58,078 --> 02:07:02,479
but

2944
02:06:59,238 --> 02:07:04,319
um so you have to have a so you have to

2945
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:06,359
throw a lot of numbers of seats to be

2946
02:07:04,319 --> 02:07:08,960
able to do proper selection in that

2947
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:11,399
field and so for me it's not a

2948
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:14,118
possibility okay but for people that are

2949
02:07:11,399 --> 02:07:16,558
working business large scale yes of

2950
02:07:14,118 --> 02:07:18,799
course I understand why they do it okay

2951
02:07:16,559 --> 02:07:20,880
you might find that one exceptional

2952
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:23,000
parental that can enhance the Jeep pool

2953
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:24,840
in certain way that it's so that's the

2954
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,880
beauty about cannabis also and working

2955
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:30,000
these plants you know that's why I don't

2956
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:32,719
like uniforming them so much I like to

2957
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,880
so the difference must be there okay

2958
02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:36,920
like uh it must be a good blend so to

2959
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:39,319
speak or good hybrid so you're aware of

2960
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:41,760
it's this and that and you keep also the

2961
02:07:39,319 --> 02:07:44,399
pedigree clear and so everybody knows

2962
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,480
what it is okay because I think the

2963
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:49,439
majority of the market is like the nine

2964
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:51,598
weer cultivation wise okay okay and then

2965
02:07:49,439 --> 02:07:53,598
you have like the finest blends to it

2966
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:55,800
and that can go up to like maybe 20

2967
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:57,960
weeks okay but that's really a niche

2968
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:59,800
market I think and it's not really

2969
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:02,559
something that will be grown in big

2970
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:04,960
facilities I think never okay because

2971
02:08:02,559 --> 02:08:07,960
you don't have the market for

2972
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:09,960
it yeah very true very true you know

2973
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:11,279
it's hard hard to imagine popping some

2974
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:13,359
land race seeds and getting something

2975
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:15,920
out of it the market would be accepting

2976
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:17,558
you did uh you know pick my curiosity

2977
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,399
when you're answering that last question

2978
02:08:17,559 --> 02:08:22,360
is sort of slightly unrelated but mostly

2979
02:08:19,399 --> 02:08:24,479
related um have you ever tried to make

2980
02:08:22,359 --> 02:08:26,118
hash out of any of the you know the

2981
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:28,839
heirlooms you hold or do you feel like

2982
02:08:26,118 --> 02:08:31,039
the magic is within the flower oh no no

2983
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:34,880
no we did you know but it really works

2984
02:08:31,039 --> 02:08:37,920
best from uh outdoor grown so when you

2985
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:41,359
light dep it here in summertime and uh

2986
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:44,440
we were fortunate to do it uh and then

2987
02:08:41,359 --> 02:08:47,479
uh you dry sift uh under the best

2988
02:08:44,439 --> 02:08:50,879
possible condition so traditional also

2989
02:08:47,479 --> 02:08:54,799
well I must say that ag3 it's that's the

2990
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:57,440
winner we sadly hear over now we don't

2991
02:08:54,800 --> 02:09:00,840
we don't can access the has plant Hast

2992
02:08:57,439 --> 02:09:03,558
temporarily due to also the legislation

2993
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:07,119
that's unfriendly so we have to regain

2994
02:09:03,559 --> 02:09:09,400
it uh so it's a little bit tricky but

2995
02:09:07,118 --> 02:09:11,238
that would also be a very good cultiv I

2996
02:09:09,399 --> 02:09:14,799
think to do that you know when you light

2997
02:09:11,238 --> 02:09:16,759
dep it under Sun you know Outdoors W man

2998
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:19,000
yes the hash from it it's really good

2999
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:22,920
okay even if it's a one

3000
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:25,359
um phenotype hashes so to speak okay

3001
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:27,078
well it was yeah it absolutely was blow

3002
02:09:25,359 --> 02:09:30,359
my mind and it's much better than the

3003
02:09:27,078 --> 02:09:32,599
other other concentrates I think okay uh

3004
02:09:30,359 --> 02:09:35,359
Rosen is also of course a very nice way

3005
02:09:32,599 --> 02:09:37,679
to tap into um the thing but you have to

3006
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:39,439
have this machine and it's very sticky I

3007
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:41,679
I kind of like the the dry shift

3008
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:43,960
methodology and then you know like you

3009
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:47,880
uh you press it and you have like yeah

3010
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:51,639
what we like has but yeah yeah 813 wow

3011
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:53,920
the rest wow it's very heavy okay to um

3012
02:09:51,639 --> 02:09:55,679
to have this concentrate yeah it really

3013
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:57,359
blows your mind also people are a little

3014
02:09:55,679 --> 02:10:00,319
bit afraid of

3015
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:03,439
it especially those from Nal ha and then

3016
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:04,960
A5 you know like seriously it's like oh

3017
02:10:03,439 --> 02:10:07,598
you don't want to give it to somebody

3018
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:11,559
that do know what to because that stuff

3019
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:15,639
is it's brutal okay so it's like

3020
02:10:11,559 --> 02:10:18,800
Yeah well yeah but also in so the type

3021
02:10:15,639 --> 02:10:21,639
of hashes so that comes more more to

3022
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:24,480
really that type of Afghan psychedelic

3023
02:10:21,639 --> 02:10:26,520
hashes well the at13 absolutely was the

3024
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:29,879
winner in that regard so yeah yeah we do

3025
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:32,280
make hash we also isolated it we do BHO

3026
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:35,159
we do a little bit of everything okay

3027
02:10:32,279 --> 02:10:37,920
but um my favorite is that kind of thing

3028
02:10:35,158 --> 02:10:40,118
but yeah you have to grow outside so

3029
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:42,559
it's here with this legislation it's

3030
02:10:40,118 --> 02:10:44,598
hard to do it let's say because it's in

3031
02:10:42,559 --> 02:10:46,920
the ey and so you have to have the spot

3032
02:10:44,599 --> 02:10:49,199
and so it's very complicated to get it

3033
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:53,158
done but once it's done well it's

3034
02:10:49,198 --> 02:10:54,759
absolutely uh yeah something unique

3035
02:10:53,158 --> 02:10:57,198
also

3036
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:59,400
definitely oh I can only imagine that

3037
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:02,238
sounds like it would be a real treat one

3038
02:10:59,399 --> 02:11:03,920
of our listeners wanted to ask are your

3039
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:05,759
flowers like sort of or your cruise

3040
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:07,840
flowers sort of consistently available

3041
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:10,239
at Dr King if they were to go visit

3042
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:12,000
Amsterdam or is it like a hot commodity

3043
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:14,519
and you got to sort of be you know there

3044
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,399
at the right moment yeah that's actually

3045
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:19,599
the case because you know I'm not I'm a

3046
02:11:16,399 --> 02:11:22,039
secluded man so I cannot do big things

3047
02:11:19,599 --> 02:11:24,520
okay so I can only recommend the people

3048
02:11:22,039 --> 02:11:27,840
to ask the bartenders like if they have

3049
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:30,320
some semi grown there because it's there

3050
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:33,319
you know it's also like it's not so it's

3051
02:11:30,319 --> 02:11:35,639
hard to to to be to be delivering that

3052
02:11:33,319 --> 02:11:38,558
consistency in that kind of League

3053
02:11:35,639 --> 02:11:41,159
because well I'm not in this commercial

3054
02:11:38,559 --> 02:11:43,960
main frame so and it also it takes a lot

3055
02:11:41,158 --> 02:11:45,719
of time along with these long flowerings

3056
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:49,760
so you know there are some batches of

3057
02:11:45,719 --> 02:11:52,920
course that he uh that they uh uh safe

3058
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:54,760
but you know it's a hard thing okay and

3059
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:58,000
when it's really good like I told you

3060
02:11:54,760 --> 02:12:00,599
it's like quickly sold also so you know

3061
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:03,078
it takes a little time to uh to fill the

3062
02:12:00,599 --> 02:12:05,400
tank again but U yeah we do the best we

3063
02:12:03,078 --> 02:12:08,000
can so I recommend people going there to

3064
02:12:05,399 --> 02:12:10,000
like request the tenders there if

3065
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:13,719
there's anything available and I'm sure

3066
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:15,719
they will uh assist you accordingly so

3067
02:12:13,719 --> 02:12:18,559
yeah I do the best I can with the means

3068
02:12:15,719 --> 02:12:21,439
I have so to speak okay that's how it

3069
02:12:18,559 --> 02:12:23,400
for now at least oh look I don't think

3070
02:12:21,439 --> 02:12:25,158
anyone blames you it's understandable

3071
02:12:23,399 --> 02:12:27,279
with all the parameters you mentioned

3072
02:12:25,158 --> 02:12:29,198
and you know sort of ties into another

3073
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:30,880
question we had from another listener

3074
02:12:29,198 --> 02:12:33,238
which was how do you feel about the new

3075
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:35,400
legal system in Holland and why is it so

3076
02:12:33,238 --> 02:12:37,799
hard to find real ha in Amsterdam

3077
02:12:35,399 --> 02:12:40,638
anymore well because nobody wants to

3078
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:43,760
grow it it's like that okay and also the

3079
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:45,599
Hypes of the of the mod strains like the

3080
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:48,480
cushies and the cakes are like the more

3081
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:50,520
C strains well so they are all also a

3082
02:12:48,479 --> 02:12:53,039
hype here and everybody jumps on it

3083
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:55,000
because it's yeah of course it makes

3084
02:12:53,039 --> 02:12:57,760
more money let's say it's actually crazy

3085
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:00,559
in Amsterdam these squishies like the

3086
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:05,119
Cali strains are often retailed for like

3087
02:13:00,559 --> 02:13:07,239
35 Plus EUR a gram well mine is like 16

3088
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:08,799
or something okay I don't mind about

3089
02:13:07,238 --> 02:13:11,558
that because I think you know it's all

3090
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:13,559
about an honest smoke also but I'm just

3091
02:13:11,559 --> 02:13:15,840
saying they're like nine weekers easy to

3092
02:13:13,559 --> 02:13:18,480
grow and then like you but so the market

3093
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:21,639
is completely upside down but it what it

3094
02:13:18,479 --> 02:13:25,879
is okay and so

3095
02:13:21,639 --> 02:13:29,599
um yeah what can I say about it okay

3096
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:31,800
uh Haze was there was a time in the '90s

3097
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:34,199
when the cultivation was less targeted

3098
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:36,719
and it was still more open that hazes

3099
02:13:34,198 --> 02:13:38,799
were also more frequently grown by the

3100
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:41,480
passionates and you had more hom Growers

3101
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:43,840
let's say okay but when they started to

3102
02:13:41,479 --> 02:13:47,198
Target really the home cultivators well

3103
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:49,239
it moved a little bit to more like uh

3104
02:13:47,198 --> 02:13:51,638
yeah the criminal sphere they pushed it

3105
02:13:49,238 --> 02:13:54,519
in that because yeah you know seriously

3106
02:13:51,639 --> 02:13:57,920
okay so they incriminate the cultivation

3107
02:13:54,520 --> 02:14:00,320
more while they still enhance the U

3108
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:02,679
coffee shop being so it's like a

3109
02:14:00,319 --> 02:14:05,439
complete absurdity but anyway that was

3110
02:14:02,679 --> 02:14:07,520
the sad Evolution and so that was also

3111
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:10,479
the reason why secluded Growers like

3112
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:12,840
myself went deeply underground and then

3113
02:14:10,479 --> 02:14:15,238
like yeah has also have to face the

3114
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:18,199
consequences but in the way yeah we we

3115
02:14:15,238 --> 02:14:21,319
do it with passion and with heart and so

3116
02:14:18,198 --> 02:14:24,519
it got a little bit pushed away by the

3117
02:14:21,319 --> 02:14:27,399
uh transformation of the whole cannabis

3118
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:29,079
culture also the so legalization in

3119
02:14:27,399 --> 02:14:31,719
America and Canada or like

3120
02:14:29,078 --> 02:14:34,078
regularization or like you know I never

3121
02:14:31,719 --> 02:14:36,399
expected in the '90s if somebody would

3122
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:38,679
have told me like it's going to be legal

3123
02:14:36,399 --> 02:14:41,158
or like you know regulated in America

3124
02:14:38,679 --> 02:14:43,039
prior to Holland I was like so you crazy

3125
02:14:41,158 --> 02:14:45,759
okay because we were expecting

3126
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:49,158
legalization within 5 years and then it

3127
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:52,760
became 10 years 15 20 20 53 I'm like

3128
02:14:49,158 --> 02:14:55,519
what and it's like this okay so the haze

3129
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:57,719
got a little bit pushed away and so it

3130
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:59,760
then it kind of reside only in the

3131
02:14:57,719 --> 02:15:02,439
people that kind of treasured it because

3132
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:05,320
everybody yeah was growing Amnesia

3133
02:15:02,439 --> 02:15:08,000
suddenly here because it was a sturdy

3134
02:15:05,319 --> 02:15:10,639
plant easy to grow nine weaker variety

3135
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:13,000
also you know you had different so they

3136
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:16,039
have different types of Amnesia but the

3137
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:19,000
one that's uh kind of grow it's the I

3138
02:15:16,039 --> 02:15:20,639
think the hypr cut well so you it in 9

3139
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:23,639
weeks usually they chop it a little

3140
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:27,279
early at 10 maybe tops and it yields a

3141
02:15:23,639 --> 02:15:29,920
lot and it's potent wheat okay so but

3142
02:15:27,279 --> 02:15:32,039
it's not really it doesn't hold any like

3143
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:35,399
the sacred thing is a little bit breed

3144
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:38,039
away from it and so we want to maintain

3145
02:15:35,399 --> 02:15:40,519
that but yeah we are like the last of

3146
02:15:38,039 --> 02:15:43,279
the moans with this say everybody says

3147
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:46,800
you're totally insane

3148
02:15:43,279 --> 02:15:49,559
okay but anyway insane or not we do it

3149
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:51,320
anyway oh I love it and look you know

3150
02:15:49,559 --> 02:15:54,199
you're referring to like the sacredness

3151
02:15:51,319 --> 02:15:56,000
of the haze high and I guess you know a

3152
02:15:54,198 --> 02:15:59,279
common breeding strategy we see being

3153
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,479
embraced more often is Old School versus

3154
02:15:59,279 --> 02:16:04,880
new school and so I guess what's your

3155
02:16:01,479 --> 02:16:07,399
thoughts on the idea of like uh C5 cross

3156
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:09,159
to gelardo 33 like do you think there's

3157
02:16:07,399 --> 02:16:11,759
any value in that or do you think it's

3158
02:16:09,158 --> 02:16:14,078
just too dominant yeah I think it's too

3159
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:16,360
dominant and the so for my personal

3160
02:16:14,078 --> 02:16:19,479
preference I don't say it will not

3161
02:16:16,359 --> 02:16:22,279
produce really Stell plants and be maybe

3162
02:16:19,479 --> 02:16:25,319
a mergin of Two Worlds okay so bringing

3163
02:16:22,279 --> 02:16:27,559
the haze to the cushies but you know so

3164
02:16:25,319 --> 02:16:29,759
it's like different two completely

3165
02:16:27,559 --> 02:16:31,239
different Two Worlds it was like also

3166
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:33,760
back in the day the people the

3167
02:16:31,238 --> 02:16:35,959
initiators of the preservation they

3168
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:38,159
weren't so fond of skunk line because

3169
02:16:35,959 --> 02:16:40,159
that was overdominant and every kind of

3170
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:43,200
variety almost you found on the Dutch

3171
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:45,840
Market back then so they wanted to keep

3172
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:48,719
the haze as good as possible around and

3173
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:50,880
not intermix it with skunk I must say I

3174
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:54,839
also grow the old school Haze and it's a

3175
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:57,879
great mix of skunk and Haze so it it has

3176
02:16:54,840 --> 02:17:00,239
potential okay but for my personal

3177
02:16:57,879 --> 02:17:02,478
preference I wouldn't go for it because

3178
02:17:00,239 --> 02:17:05,398
I personally I like all cannabis but I'm

3179
02:17:02,478 --> 02:17:08,840
not so in favor of certain cushies so

3180
02:17:05,398 --> 02:17:10,959
from my also limited uh accessibility

3181
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:14,079
also to trying them and to proper

3182
02:17:10,959 --> 02:17:16,839
evaluate them but um I don't say there

3183
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:18,200
are cushies maybe in the field that I do

3184
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:20,799
uh like

3185
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:26,040
smok ability wise and also morphology

3186
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:28,119
wise you know so that um but it's not

3187
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:30,800
something I'm looking for because

3188
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:32,359
usually cushies are short flowering so

3189
02:17:30,799 --> 02:17:34,358
then you will have an offspring that

3190
02:17:32,359 --> 02:17:36,318
will diminish also it will take away

3191
02:17:34,359 --> 02:17:39,239
from the haze experience so to speak in

3192
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:43,799
high usually that's the case and produce

3193
02:17:39,239 --> 02:17:46,638
a less or more yeah sedative kind of

3194
02:17:43,799 --> 02:17:48,959
stone in it like you know what I mean

3195
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:51,598
that's my experience with cushies anyway

3196
02:17:48,959 --> 02:17:53,678
but um so they're more like um sedative

3197
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:55,359
kind of they can be good also a little

3198
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:58,079
bit more relaxing some of them are a

3199
02:17:55,359 --> 02:18:01,040
little bit overpowering like couch Loy

3200
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:03,039
but it's not my type of wheat that uh

3201
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:06,080
that that I would access if I have a

3202
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:09,599
variety on the table also my preferences

3203
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:11,120
was not so we tried it ourselves and I

3204
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:14,439
know I didn't like it so much The

3205
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:17,200
Offspring plantwise wow really amazing

3206
02:18:14,439 --> 02:18:21,679
plants came out of it but I thought the

3207
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:24,599
the flowers were too um so it's it's

3208
02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:27,398
steering away from the haze uh too much

3209
02:18:24,599 --> 02:18:30,079
for my personal taste so I wouldn't

3210
02:18:27,398 --> 02:18:32,159
really um go into that myself but if

3211
02:18:30,079 --> 02:18:35,000
people like pushes and they also like

3212
02:18:32,159 --> 02:18:38,119
hazes yeah man I would say go for

3213
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:40,079
it I love that answer there you go I

3214
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:41,880
guess we're sort of circling around the

3215
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:43,920
idea of this topic of like how do we get

3216
02:18:41,879 --> 02:18:46,398
more people interested in these older

3217
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,519
varieties and one of the sort of ideas

3218
02:18:46,398 --> 02:18:51,159
that pops up is that that some of these

3219
02:18:48,519 --> 02:18:53,280
older heirlooms and just um really

3220
02:18:51,159 --> 02:18:55,959
special strains in general don't

3221
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:57,840
necessarily test that high in THC and it

3222
02:18:55,959 --> 02:18:59,919
seems like a lot of the general

3223
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:02,439
consumers of the market are largely

3224
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:04,280
driven by those values what do you think

3225
02:19:02,439 --> 02:19:06,519
is a way in which we might be able to

3226
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:08,639
get more people aware of you know the

3227
02:19:06,519 --> 02:19:12,599
special effects and nature of these

3228
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:16,119
older plants well it's a Synergy between

3229
02:19:12,599 --> 02:19:18,679
compounds it's not so numbers do play

3230
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:22,519
into account I mean hey also is like

3231
02:19:18,679 --> 02:19:25,879
around let's say 20% THC but now you

3232
02:19:22,519 --> 02:19:28,519
have varieties of 30% THC that produce a

3233
02:19:25,879 --> 02:19:30,799
totally different High than coming from

3234
02:19:28,519 --> 02:19:34,398
these hazes and they are not so

3235
02:19:30,799 --> 02:19:37,318
psychedelic or so I think um the Synergy

3236
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:42,199
between all compounds not only THC but

3237
02:19:37,318 --> 02:19:45,119
also like flavonoid flavonoids and like

3238
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:47,760
terpenoids that is like um give this

3239
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:50,240
wheed its character or its potential so

3240
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:52,478
this whole book let's say if you just

3241
02:19:50,239 --> 02:19:55,799
like read one page of this book well you

3242
02:19:52,478 --> 02:19:58,840
can uh uh extrapolate it and look at it

3243
02:19:55,799 --> 02:20:01,879
and like but there's much more to read

3244
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:05,520
and so that works on each other and so

3245
02:20:01,879 --> 02:20:08,358
to only focus on um THC although it has

3246
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:11,600
its relevance in making us high it's

3247
02:20:08,359 --> 02:20:14,880
like not something that uh will produce

3248
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:17,479
necessarily better high or like a a

3249
02:20:14,879 --> 02:20:19,398
better product okay it's like a little

3250
02:20:17,478 --> 02:20:21,358
with with alcohol it's also like that

3251
02:20:19,398 --> 02:20:23,478
you have this strum kind of varieties

3252
02:20:21,359 --> 02:20:25,559
it's 80% full alcohol I mean you don't

3253
02:20:23,478 --> 02:20:27,799
drink that in pure form it must be crazy

3254
02:20:25,559 --> 02:20:30,039
for that okay so you dilute it with

3255
02:20:27,799 --> 02:20:32,478
something so if you have a strain like

3256
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:35,040
yeah sometimes they make extracts of I

3257
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:39,079
don't know like pure THC and you dab

3258
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:41,880
that well yeah well it's not really so

3259
02:20:39,079 --> 02:20:46,359
it's a cannabinoid but it's very mon so

3260
02:20:41,879 --> 02:20:50,079
it's very mono so it's very yeah

3261
02:20:46,359 --> 02:20:53,079
monistic let say I'm not for that I'm uh

3262
02:20:50,079 --> 02:20:54,639
like you know like like a painting yeah

3263
02:20:53,079 --> 02:20:57,039
you know what I mean it's like the whole

3264
02:20:54,639 --> 02:20:59,719
painting not just a fragment of it and

3265
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:03,640
so to only focus on numbers that would

3266
02:20:59,719 --> 02:21:06,398
be uh it's like you read every not from

3267
02:21:03,639 --> 02:21:10,199
a symphony but you don't hear the music

3268
02:21:06,398 --> 02:21:11,840
of the symphony okay so it's like um the

3269
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:13,760
people that are focused on numbers to

3270
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:15,680
enhance their own profits they're like a

3271
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:18,398
little bit OBS obsessed with numbers too

3272
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:21,318
much I think okay and so they shouldn't

3273
02:21:18,398 --> 02:21:24,199
smoke a good joint and

3274
02:21:21,318 --> 02:21:26,639
reevaluate there you go there you go I

3275
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:27,920
guess in a similar vein I'd love to ask

3276
02:21:26,639 --> 02:21:29,239
you let's say someone's listening to

3277
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:31,079
this episode and they're like you know

3278
02:21:29,239 --> 02:21:33,639
what I'm sold I want to try some of

3279
02:21:31,079 --> 02:21:36,000
these cool heirlooms what sort of

3280
02:21:33,639 --> 02:21:38,519
genetics would you advise someone to get

3281
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,639
if they had to use seeds and they want

3282
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:43,960
to get their toes wet in this sort of

3283
02:21:40,639 --> 02:21:45,760
effect and plan well the the seed that

3284
02:21:43,959 --> 02:21:47,639
we are making available at or little

3285
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:49,439
dumping I would say yeah go for for it

3286
02:21:47,639 --> 02:21:52,519
and then of course what I do with a

3287
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:53,920
seeds also I say also go for it and

3288
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:56,120
there are some people in the business

3289
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:58,439
here in homeand that are working also

3290
02:21:56,120 --> 02:22:02,040
with these hybrids and producing their

3291
02:21:58,439 --> 02:22:03,920
own variety so like you know you just

3292
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:05,960
internet is full of them eh so if you

3293
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:08,439
type in uh certain seed banks are

3294
02:22:05,959 --> 02:22:10,039
offering them now and it's only like the

3295
02:22:08,439 --> 02:22:12,439
beginning I think because there will be

3296
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:15,479
more offerings and more work to be done

3297
02:22:12,439 --> 02:22:17,800
coming future and so for now I would say

3298
02:22:15,478 --> 02:22:19,119
like the AC SE lines are very nice with

3299
02:22:17,799 --> 02:22:24,039
the

3300
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:26,120
hybrid so we collaborated on and um so

3301
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:29,000
the bars are full of it okay I think

3302
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:32,200
Wally for instance also makes like nice

3303
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,040
things available for an yeah there I

3304
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:36,720
think there are some people also that

3305
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:38,800
are working uh to when the legislation

3306
02:22:36,719 --> 02:22:42,920
change a step further out of the closet

3307
02:22:38,799 --> 02:22:45,159
and make their own kind of uh uh nldd uh

3308
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:47,359
Spectrum or bring their own kind of nld

3309
02:22:45,159 --> 02:22:50,119
spectrum to the market which are they

3310
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:52,680
are working already and it's nice to see

3311
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:54,680
people collaborating with passion around

3312
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:57,079
the world you know sharing things and

3313
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:00,239
then you know you bring worlds together

3314
02:22:57,079 --> 02:23:02,318
and you can really make uh extraordinary

3315
02:23:00,239 --> 02:23:04,000
plants if you combine Elite plants with

3316
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:06,478
each other yeah of course the result

3317
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,920
will be something Elite so it's it's

3318
02:23:06,478 --> 02:23:11,119
like this okay and also the good Synergy

3319
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:14,120
between two plants because not

3320
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:17,800
necessarily two hybrids that are really

3321
02:23:14,120 --> 02:23:20,840
Stellar uh you know can enhance uh

3322
02:23:17,799 --> 02:23:23,159
in its progy their parentals so you have

3323
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:25,760
to really test it and know what you're

3324
02:23:23,159 --> 02:23:28,760
doing but a lot of Pion in the in the

3325
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:31,040
world are working and I think once the

3326
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:33,520
legislation in multiple countries will

3327
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:37,080
change well well well it will change

3328
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:40,279
also the accessibility of uh of uh the

3329
02:23:37,079 --> 02:23:45,159
more ha uh dominated spectrum of

3330
02:23:40,279 --> 02:23:45,159
cannabis let's say or nldd for that

3331
02:23:45,439 --> 02:23:51,479
matter totally I hope that definitely

3332
02:23:49,079 --> 02:23:53,760
happens I wanted to ask you one last

3333
02:23:51,478 --> 02:23:56,278
question before we jump into our final

3334
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:58,279
five it's a fan submitted one and they

3335
02:23:56,279 --> 02:24:01,880
said can you ask Sammy what's his

3336
02:23:58,279 --> 02:24:03,399
thoughts on the early pearls silver

3337
02:24:01,879 --> 02:24:08,478
Pearl

3338
02:24:03,398 --> 02:24:11,680
well you know it's like every plant has

3339
02:24:08,478 --> 02:24:14,879
its Unique Kind of um morphology and

3340
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:17,840
Spectrum okay so I was never really um

3341
02:24:14,879 --> 02:24:20,599
fond of it because yeah all it the laps

3342
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:23,239
it lacked Vigor toward to the plants

3343
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:25,680
that we kind of embraced and although

3344
02:24:23,239 --> 02:24:28,799
it's nice to have it around and to be

3345
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:31,880
able to have Growers here in the local

3346
02:24:28,799 --> 02:24:35,358
communities that are still you know also

3347
02:24:31,879 --> 02:24:38,318
busy with uh these other old hair looms

3348
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:41,359
that they are keeping and try to yeah so

3349
02:24:38,318 --> 02:24:43,318
for me these kind of I like it I like

3350
02:24:41,359 --> 02:24:46,000
every kind of cannabis like I said but

3351
02:24:43,318 --> 02:24:48,398
cultivation wise I never really um went

3352
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:50,000
in these kind of spectrums because we

3353
02:24:48,398 --> 02:24:52,639
had the haze handloom and we had our

3354
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,359
hands full so it kind of you know

3355
02:24:52,639 --> 02:24:57,760
enriched me but also limited me in

3356
02:24:55,359 --> 02:25:00,760
tapping into certain seed lines myself

3357
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:03,359
and better evaluate them so my take on

3358
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:06,840
it is like I don't know like original

3359
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:10,399
Norther light for instance five well I

3360
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:13,120
never accessed it and so now it appears

3361
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:15,439
to have Reimer or whatever it is I'm not

3362
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,439
sure if this is all true I'm just

3363
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:20,359
speculating but I have to grow to know

3364
02:25:17,439 --> 02:25:22,318
it and so I never had a chance to grow

3365
02:25:20,359 --> 02:25:24,880
this particular cultiv he's mentioning

3366
02:25:22,318 --> 02:25:27,639
all tap into the seed line so I cannot

3367
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:30,039
really assess it we all smoked it and I

3368
02:25:27,639 --> 02:25:31,639
know some people who grow it but so it's

3369
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:33,760
like a different League everybody has

3370
02:25:31,639 --> 02:25:36,079
his own kind of Niche work here a little

3371
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:39,239
bit and we stick to our own let's say

3372
02:25:36,079 --> 02:25:42,318
okay and we are the hze people and other

3373
02:25:39,239 --> 02:25:45,439
people well they do other things

3374
02:25:42,318 --> 02:25:47,159
okay ah there you go I've never had it

3375
02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:48,840
myself so I really can't comment too

3376
02:25:47,159 --> 02:25:51,200
much but it's certainly one people are

3377
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:54,398
always very very curious

3378
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:56,560
about well brings us to our final five

3379
02:25:54,398 --> 02:25:59,239
the first question I want to ask you was

3380
02:25:56,559 --> 02:26:01,519
what's the single most memorable or

3381
02:25:59,239 --> 02:26:03,119
impactful memory you have with cannabis

3382
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:06,079
doesn't have to necessarily be like the

3383
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:08,680
most potent cannabis but just an event

3384
02:26:06,079 --> 02:26:11,159
where it was incredibly

3385
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:13,520
memorable yeah well I had the number of

3386
02:26:11,159 --> 02:26:17,000
those things okay whether to the good

3387
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:20,359
positive side of to the yeah w wow you

3388
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:23,120
know it enhances your um experience I

3389
02:26:20,359 --> 02:26:26,200
think okay Canabis does and so in the

3390
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:28,359
best kind of moments well yeah it makes

3391
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:31,479
everything more beautiful okay

3392
02:26:28,359 --> 02:26:34,800
everything you you you feel like

3393
02:26:31,478 --> 02:26:37,039
U yeah it's a it's divine feeling okay

3394
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:40,519
that's why I think it's a very spiritual

3395
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:43,600
thing so I was I had a fortunate to do

3396
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:45,800
some traveling and like I say okay

3397
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:48,840
sometimes cannabis can really enhance

3398
02:26:45,799 --> 02:26:51,039
your uh awareness of being there and

3399
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:54,799
feeling the environment tap into it you

3400
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:57,319
know like be in the moment like uh you

3401
02:26:54,799 --> 02:26:59,318
know and it can also take away a lot of

3402
02:26:57,318 --> 02:27:02,239
things you know when you to totally

3403
02:26:59,318 --> 02:27:04,920
obliterate it you know I had so when I

3404
02:27:02,239 --> 02:27:07,559
for instance when I met these people so

3405
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:10,239
it was before GPS and things like that

3406
02:27:07,559 --> 02:27:12,359
so you know sometimes I drove back from

3407
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:14,600
them and I lost away because I was so

3408
02:27:12,359 --> 02:27:16,760
[ __ ] High ending up in the like

3409
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:19,120
in the mid zone of holl while I'm having

3410
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:22,880
to the South like not really realizing

3411
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:25,279
it and suddenly like what where am I

3412
02:27:22,879 --> 02:27:28,159
things like this okay but also the best

3413
02:27:25,279 --> 02:27:31,840
way possible okay you know so um so I

3414
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:34,478
was high on like I'm always high I think

3415
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:37,639
okay since I was 18 years old I kind of

3416
02:27:34,478 --> 02:27:40,239
indulged in in the Cannabis Fe and so

3417
02:27:37,639 --> 02:27:43,199
it's like yeah it enhanced my life

3418
02:27:40,239 --> 02:27:45,159
completely as a whole okay and uh for

3419
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:47,000
the good or for sometimes the the

3420
02:27:45,159 --> 02:27:49,760
challenging one because it's also Al

3421
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,959
confrontational like I say okay it's not

3422
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:55,439
also an easy Legacy to carry when you're

3423
02:27:51,959 --> 02:27:57,000
working under under stigmas like you're

3424
02:27:55,439 --> 02:27:59,600
a criminal or something while you're

3425
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:01,840
really actually loving something and and

3426
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:03,960
you know what it's for okay and when you

3427
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:06,719
make people high from it that's also

3428
02:28:03,959 --> 02:28:09,000
something I like very much about being

3429
02:28:06,719 --> 02:28:11,318
able to treasure something uh that's

3430
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:14,760
really valuable and being able to share

3431
02:28:11,318 --> 02:28:16,639
it okay so people that access my flowers

3432
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:18,960
and sometimes my work they really

3433
02:28:16,639 --> 02:28:21,478
appreciative okay and sometimes I had a

3434
02:28:18,959 --> 02:28:23,959
fortunate and the pleasure also that

3435
02:28:21,478 --> 02:28:26,519
people took their time and effort in

3436
02:28:23,959 --> 02:28:28,519
coming to visit me here okay like people

3437
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:31,000
you meet on the board and then they come

3438
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:33,319
here and Sample your what you have and

3439
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:35,520
then yeah you know like there so the

3440
02:28:33,318 --> 02:28:37,840
Gratitude you get from it it's really

3441
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:40,520
great okay it's like really fantastic if

3442
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:44,000
you have something that really you know

3443
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:47,120
have an effect on people's uh emotional

3444
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:50,879
and mental awareness for the good you

3445
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:53,240
know it's like a very um thankful and

3446
02:28:50,879 --> 02:28:55,599
humbling thing also to be part of that

3447
02:28:53,239 --> 02:28:57,439
okay that's why we do it also so the

3448
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,680
getting high and gathering with people

3449
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:02,318
the deeper connections you make now also

3450
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:04,239
more abroad and everything people coming

3451
02:29:02,318 --> 02:29:06,398
together I think you know this

3452
02:29:04,239 --> 02:29:09,159
likeminded vibe that you share it's

3453
02:29:06,398 --> 02:29:12,639
really great and mizing I think it's one

3454
02:29:09,159 --> 02:29:14,398
big good thing also also medicinal and

3455
02:29:12,639 --> 02:29:19,239
everything okay for me this plant is the

3456
02:29:14,398 --> 02:29:21,278
healing of the nation and so so um yeah

3457
02:29:19,239 --> 02:29:23,559
I guess a lot of people don't want to

3458
02:29:21,279 --> 02:29:25,760
hear it or see it I don't know why okay

3459
02:29:23,559 --> 02:29:29,478
maybe you should drink a little bit less

3460
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:32,159
and smoke a little bit more but

3461
02:29:29,478 --> 02:29:34,840
anyway hi

3462
02:29:32,159 --> 02:29:37,680
digress I love it I love it I love it

3463
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:39,279
okay uh so the next one is what's uh one

3464
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:41,279
situation where you've been really

3465
02:29:39,279 --> 02:29:43,200
excited to try something it's been hyped

3466
02:29:41,279 --> 02:29:45,200
up everyone's telling you it's great a

3467
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:48,560
strain and then you finally get to try

3468
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:51,960
it and you're not really impressed well

3469
02:29:48,559 --> 02:29:55,159
like 99% of everything actually okay I'm

3470
02:29:51,959 --> 02:29:57,599
sorry I might be privileged to comp

3471
02:29:55,159 --> 02:30:01,398
having to compare it with like Elite

3472
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:04,200
cultivos I'm not saying so the Maxa that

3473
02:30:01,398 --> 02:30:07,239
was a variety I tried I got also sent to

3474
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:10,880
by that I really like that one in high

3475
02:30:07,239 --> 02:30:12,920
but I sadly lost it so but Maxa was one

3476
02:30:10,879 --> 02:30:14,920
that stood out for me over the time and

3477
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:17,359
of course the band 87 I said it of

3478
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:20,600
course um

3479
02:30:17,359 --> 02:30:23,318
um well I tried many okay I

3480
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:28,640
also there were many good ones but

3481
02:30:23,318 --> 02:30:30,119
Keepers really only yeah hard to um it's

3482
02:30:28,639 --> 02:30:31,959
also because I work under this

3483
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:34,600
legislation okay so I cannot keep

3484
02:30:31,959 --> 02:30:37,239
everything because I would love to but

3485
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:39,680
uh so it's hard so I'm thinking I'm

3486
02:30:37,239 --> 02:30:43,559
thinking you know I had some

3487
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:45,639
um really yeah so one of the things also

3488
02:30:43,559 --> 02:30:47,959
that blew my [ __ ] mind I went

3489
02:30:45,639 --> 02:30:50,920
to span this year years ago and so this

3490
02:30:47,959 --> 02:30:53,879
D thing came up right I wasn't really

3491
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:57,359
used to it so then another Canadian

3492
02:30:53,879 --> 02:31:00,079
there and had also the T so I took nine

3493
02:30:57,359 --> 02:31:03,479
tabs you know in a row well that

3494
02:31:00,079 --> 02:31:06,439
obliterated me kind of you know

3495
02:31:03,478 --> 02:31:09,358
like since then I'm aware of what D is

3496
02:31:06,439 --> 02:31:12,840
let's say okay just uh to to rephrase on

3497
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:16,000
the on the former question actually but

3498
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:17,200
um yeah what can I say okay about these

3499
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,600
hazes

3500
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:23,000
so I think youve uh you answered it

3501
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:24,640
earlier on it was a good answer for sure

3502
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:26,200
uh the the next question I've got for

3503
02:31:24,639 --> 02:31:28,278
you is I'm going to drop you on a desert

3504
02:31:26,200 --> 02:31:30,079
island and you can take three strains

3505
02:31:28,279 --> 02:31:32,040
with you for the rest of time it can be

3506
02:31:30,079 --> 02:31:33,719
the Clones or a pack of seeds if you

3507
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:38,040
want what three things are you going to

3508
02:31:33,719 --> 02:31:40,920
take with you well you know [ __ ] man

3509
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:43,000
things then that's difficult one to an

3510
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:45,120
island cannabis related things let

3511
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:47,239

3514
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:55,720
to have like a stash full of it so it

3515
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:57,840
lasts a lifetime let's say okay and of

3516
02:31:55,719 --> 02:32:00,239
course good ganja yeah man if I would

3517
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:02,559
choose I would go for C5 because he's

3518
02:32:00,239 --> 02:32:06,119
the queen but you have to you know like

3519
02:32:02,559 --> 02:32:08,519
so C5 was most accessible for us before

3520
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:10,800
we retrieved the other clones we only

3521
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:12,920
had C5 and has BL H for a number of

3522
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:15,438
years here well that's how I learned to

3523
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:17,760
grow it to Finas like because you you

3524
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:20,359
know couldn't has any other things but

3525
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:23,120
this completely aside we had then this

3526
02:32:20,359 --> 02:32:24,960
best C5 but you know when you have only

3527
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:29,200
one thing to smoke no matter how good it

3528
02:32:24,959 --> 02:32:31,839
is you don't have any uh point of to you

3529
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:33,600
know like to compare it with okay so

3530
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:36,120
it's like you get bored with it

3531
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:38,479
essentially okay so variety is the spice

3532
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:40,520
of life only three things so I will

3533
02:32:38,478 --> 02:32:43,879
break the rule I need like more things

3534
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:46,439
okay to go to the you know seriously

3535
02:32:43,879 --> 02:32:50,000
otherwise it will be seriously i' have

3536
02:32:46,439 --> 02:32:52,680
to stay here then I'm not going to that

3537
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,760
Island I'll accept it that's the first

3538
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:57,600
uh answer of that nature I've heard and

3539
02:32:54,760 --> 02:32:59,318
we'll allow it so on the other end of

3540
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,200
the spectrum you're going to drop

3541
02:32:59,318 --> 02:33:03,439
someone else off on the island someone

3542
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:06,439
you're not super fond of they've uh

3543
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:07,960
they've dirtied the Jean Pool what three

3544
02:33:06,439 --> 02:33:09,479
things are you going to leave them with

3545
02:33:07,959 --> 02:33:11,639
on the

3546
02:33:09,478 --> 02:33:14,159
island you know they should really

3547
02:33:11,639 --> 02:33:16,278
educate themselves what can I say okay

3548
02:33:14,159 --> 02:33:18,359
maybe you know I could drop them with an

3549
02:33:16,279 --> 02:33:20,520
educational thing about this whole thing

3550
02:33:18,359 --> 02:33:22,600
and you you make them read and then they

3551
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:25,439
can go back from that island and you

3552
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:27,120
know like uh put in the necessary work

3553
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:29,359
okay it's not that difficult and

3554
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:31,960
complicated you know first they need to

3555
02:33:29,359 --> 02:33:34,318
acknowledge it and take it for a reality

3556
02:33:31,959 --> 02:33:36,919
okay otherwise I wouldn't you know say

3557
02:33:34,318 --> 02:33:39,920
it also it's just like a call out that I

3558
02:33:36,920 --> 02:33:42,639
make because you know as a homeg grower

3559
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:45,159
and Essence imagine you paying like 80

3560
02:33:42,639 --> 02:33:46,719
or 100 bucks or whatever to buy some

3561
02:33:45,159 --> 02:33:48,799
seeds and you get them

3562
02:33:46,719 --> 02:33:50,959
and they are infected and imagine you

3563
02:33:48,799 --> 02:33:52,879
have like a few Keepers there you're not

3564
02:33:50,959 --> 02:33:55,199
aware of it and it ruins your whole

3565
02:33:52,879 --> 02:33:59,239
Library okay for these people it is a

3566
02:33:55,200 --> 02:34:01,880
disaster okay and so maybe pay attention

3567
02:33:59,239 --> 02:34:05,039
and see really if the parential are not

3568
02:34:01,879 --> 02:34:08,358
infected and if they are yeah then you

3569
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:12,399
know like do put in the necessary to not

3570
02:34:08,359 --> 02:34:14,359
spread this because for a lot of Growers

3571
02:34:12,398 --> 02:34:16,478
well it's a nuisance let's say okay and

3572
02:34:14,359 --> 02:34:19,159
that's a sad thing because yeah put in

3573
02:34:16,478 --> 02:34:21,000
the effort and when you plant like theor

3574
02:34:19,159 --> 02:34:24,039
it's on you and you have no awareness

3575
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:26,478
from what it is so the people that are

3576
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:29,040
aware in this business should be aware

3577
02:34:26,478 --> 02:34:32,318
and take precautions so that it doesn't

3578
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:35,439
happen Okay and then everybody's

3579
02:34:32,318 --> 02:34:36,799
happy and that's the notion about it

3580
02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:39,398
okay that's

3581
02:34:36,799 --> 02:34:41,840
all I love it I love it we're changing

3582
02:34:39,398 --> 02:34:44,159
the words not the vibe so the final

3583
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:47,040
question is I've got a time machine for

3584
02:34:44,159 --> 02:34:49,719
you you can go back anywhere anytime to

3585
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:50,960
get seeds clones whatever you want where

3586
02:34:49,719 --> 02:34:51,799
are you going to go what are you going

3587
02:34:50,959 --> 02:34:55,318
to

3588
02:34:51,799 --> 02:34:57,670
get oh my god

3589
02:34:55,318 --> 02:35:00,039
seriously

3590
02:34:57,670 --> 02:35:03,439
[Music]

3591
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:06,319
well in retrospect knowing what we know

3592
02:35:03,439 --> 02:35:09,680
now you know the heritage of what nille

3593
02:35:06,318 --> 02:35:12,680
did there was very important okay but um

3594
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:15,079
I think these seeds how so it's all like

3595
02:35:12,680 --> 02:35:19,159
I wasn't there so I cannot verify any

3596
02:35:15,079 --> 02:35:21,719
story yet but um so imagine the seed

3597
02:35:19,159 --> 02:35:24,600
that he had back then if you would have

3598
02:35:21,719 --> 02:35:27,799
the technology like to sprout them all

3599
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:30,318
and not just get like uh five or six

3600
02:35:27,799 --> 02:35:34,000
firew plants out of it but like you know

3601
02:35:30,318 --> 02:35:36,278
like maybe a 100 a thousand well you

3602
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:39,120
know that would be a world of change and

3603
02:35:36,279 --> 02:35:41,600
difference so it's hard to kind of you

3604
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:44,359
know like I don't know it all originated

3605
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:46,318
also somewhere in in in various places

3606
02:35:44,359 --> 02:35:49,559
on the world and brought has brought

3607
02:35:46,318 --> 02:35:52,680
together so like um you know I think in

3608
02:35:49,559 --> 02:35:55,519
the 60s what happened there was kind of

3609
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:58,279
really revolutionary also in um

3610
02:35:55,520 --> 02:36:02,279
spreading awareness around the Western

3611
02:35:58,279 --> 02:36:04,120
World about being more tolerated towards

3612
02:36:02,279 --> 02:36:06,200
this plant you know with the bnck

3613
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:08,240
generation starting it and then the

3614
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:12,560
hippie momentum and everything that

3615
02:36:08,239 --> 02:36:16,719
resided from there you know over time we

3616
02:36:12,559 --> 02:36:19,199
this plant came so it was cont became

3617
02:36:16,719 --> 02:36:21,760
in the 30s and we all know why it was

3618
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:25,200
for after

3619
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:28,920
the when they ban alcohol and so they

3620
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:31,520
needed another scap goat thing so it's a

3621
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:34,600
RAC it's a racist story it's actually a

3622
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:38,000
very sad story and how this plant became

3623
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:41,120
um demonized let's say but um now that

3624
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:44,680
it's back kind of in our spheres uh we

3625
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:47,079
can normalize it and then um you know it

3626
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:50,079
be becomes another thing okay well what

3627
02:36:47,079 --> 02:36:52,439
seeds I would say the 60s were crucial

3628
02:36:50,079 --> 02:36:54,639
so really these Haze Brothers whoever

3629
02:36:52,439 --> 02:36:57,880
they were well their seed talk yeah I

3630
02:36:54,639 --> 02:37:00,278
would kind of like to access them let's

3631
02:36:57,879 --> 02:37:02,358
say that whoever they were in the 60s

3632
02:37:00,279 --> 02:37:04,560
throughout the 70s these guys seats yeah

3633
02:37:02,359 --> 02:37:07,318
I want to access this access them in

3634
02:37:04,559 --> 02:37:10,799
pure form but like in large numbers and

3635
02:37:07,318 --> 02:37:12,760
do like [ __ ] broad selection out of them

3636
02:37:10,799 --> 02:37:14,679
I think it would be like yeah it's a

3637
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:16,639
dream for everybody I think okay

3638
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:18,840
something like that yeah something like

3639
02:37:16,639 --> 02:37:21,199
that so the haze brother seats I want to

3640
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:24,840
delve into so that would be like late

3641
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:26,640
60s yeah yeah what a brilliant answer I

3642
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:28,639
love it I'm sure there'd be some gold in

3643
02:37:26,639 --> 02:37:30,199
there no doubt so I think that just

3644
02:37:28,639 --> 02:37:31,840
about brings us to the end of it for

3645
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:34,560
this one do you have any comments or

3646
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:37,478
shout outs you want to make yeah shout

3647
02:37:34,559 --> 02:37:39,879
out to my friends here locally and uh

3648
02:37:37,478 --> 02:37:41,599
especially also a tribute to my exwife

3649
02:37:39,879 --> 02:37:44,839
because we were a long time together and

3650
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:47,279
she is still my uh partner in that sense

3651
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:50,040
and also so so the good people I

3652
02:37:47,279 --> 02:37:51,840
interacted with over time you know I

3653
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:54,439
built some really good connection that

3654
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:57,318
I'm really happy with and so I can only

3655
02:37:54,439 --> 02:37:59,800
um hope that we all do our best to um

3656
02:37:57,318 --> 02:38:02,639
kind of change the legislations that are

3657
02:37:59,799 --> 02:38:05,959
still needed and we can then build our

3658
02:38:02,639 --> 02:38:08,398
way to have a an enhanced gene pool so

3659
02:38:05,959 --> 02:38:10,759
we can all have our personal preference

3660
02:38:08,398 --> 02:38:13,478
of cannabis available in our own seed

3661
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:15,920
stash and grow it ourselves okay that's

3662
02:38:13,478 --> 02:38:18,398
what we're aiming for and working for

3663
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:22,239
every and any day in our lives okay to

3664
02:38:18,398 --> 02:38:25,119
liberate this plant and to have a

3665
02:38:22,239 --> 02:38:27,559
widespread um genetically

3666
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:29,720
availability and we do our thing with

3667
02:38:27,559 --> 02:38:32,159
the hazes and with the nldd varieties

3668
02:38:29,719 --> 02:38:34,639
and we will hope to continue to do it

3669
02:38:32,159 --> 02:38:36,559
and everybody that assists me and the

3670
02:38:34,639 --> 02:38:39,398
community around me of these beautiful

3671
02:38:36,559 --> 02:38:41,359
people well you know who you are I would

3672
