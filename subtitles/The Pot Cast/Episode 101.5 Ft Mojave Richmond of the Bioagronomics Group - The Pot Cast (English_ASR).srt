before we do one last thing you

109
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,038
mentioned at the start of that answer

110
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,160
that you had already met Rob by that

111
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:53,759
point tell me a bit about it cuz if

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,520
people weren't aware you know Rob's

113
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,960
going to come back into the story in a

114
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,439
bit more full force what was your first

115
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,918
encounter with Rob like and what was

116
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,560
your relationship with were you just

117
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,198
casually knowing him when you were in

118
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,918
Amsterdam uh yeah no I mean I when I met

119
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,360
Rob we became friends right away I mean

120
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,639
for one he was you know like I I'm the

121
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
young like I said I'm the youngest of

122
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,560
six so kind of my peer group was always

123
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,280
a little older than me um and like

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,680
meeting Rob he's a California guy he's

125
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,599
just loves cannabis like and he's just

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,199
super smart and he's a worldly guy you

127
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,479
know so like we had this kind of

128
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,560
connection I'd say almost Beyond

129
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,359
cannabis to begin with you know I mean

130
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,720
we talked about weed a lot and we

131
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,439
definitely shared a lot of weed but we

132
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,440
used to get together on you know we'd

133
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,600
have these Wednesday Gatherings where

134
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,000
we'd get together and we'd bring bottles

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,120
of red wine and we'd talk about

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,639
anthropology and his trips to China and

137
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,639
Vietnam and stuff and it wasn't so much

138
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,800
me geeking out on meeting Rob Clark

139
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,439
because I didn't really have that

140
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,680
perspective yet not like I do now you

141
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,879
know like I really appreciate what Rob

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,639
has done for cannabis and for our

143
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,000
community and for you know the knowledge

144
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,240
base and all that um at the time he was

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,240
just a cool guy you know he was a cool

146
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,639
guy to hang out with and and you know

147
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,400
share space um and over the time over

148
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,360
years I just come to realize that this

149
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,879
guy has this wealth of knowledge about

150
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,598
not just the plant but the a certain way

151
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,439
of looking at cannabis a certain

152
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:33,759
perspective a big BG ger picture

153
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,959
perspective a perspective that's kind of

154
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,080
outside of any one market or outside of

155
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,239
any one time or outside of any one

156
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:45,560
region you know it's it's it's cannabis

157
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,879
Big C genus cannabis you know um so yeah

158
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,000
it's been you know knowing Rob for 31

159
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,918
years or so and working together over

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,959
the last nine years has been like one of

161
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,478
the greatest privileges of my life to to

162
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:02,120
kind of just intersect with someone as

163
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,560
smart as he is and as you know as um

164
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,280
with such a such a global and big

165
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,759
picture perspective on not just cannabis

166
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,519
but life you know oh yeah so that was

167
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,639
cool and I met a lot of I met a lot of

168
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:15,639
wild characters in Amsterdam I did I met

169
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,038
all the you know wild charismatic

170
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,598
traveling cannabis Road Show dudes who

171
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,639
would come through the Cannabis Cup you

172
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,719
know and some of them were wacky and

173
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,280
weird and strange you know from another

174
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,080
planet and some of them were really far

175
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,959
out and really smart Cutting Edge people

176
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,639
um but the one thing that was weird is

177
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,120
like being an American overseas while

178
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:40,280
prohibition is still like marching on

179
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,959
back home um was was a bit odd you know

180
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,839
to be in Amsterdam when it was so free

181
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,359
and so open but the reality is you know

182
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:51,519
I'd come home every year and it was

183
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,360
still still the way it was you know um

184
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,959
so yeah there's that there that thing

185
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,000
and and that you know the the first wave

186
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,120
of of people who came to Amsterdam were

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
you know they were they called them the

188
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,079
regular refugees you know they were they

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,560
were escaping this incredibly oppressive

190
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,719
drug war you know and trying to find

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,079
somewhere else to live just to feel open

192
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,120
enough to not just grow but to have a

193
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,079
conversation and for guys like um Rob

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,439
Clark and David Watson was to actually

195
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:24,120
do research and work and push everything

196
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,439
forward you know like they really

197
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,079
augured in to like well if you're going

198
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,038
to let me do it what can I do you know

199
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:35,199
and the the stuff that those guys did in

200
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,799
you know a period of 10 or so years is

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,680
just it's amazing and it's still kind of

202
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,399
unmatched today for you know how much

203
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,879
Zeal and motivation and what they were

204
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,399
trying to accomplish um so yeah I just I

205
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,439
always you know give kudos to to you

206
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,839
know those who deserve it because it was

207
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,480
a very different time you know to think

208
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,600
about what they did with hor of farm um

209
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,278
and all the research and all the you

210
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,759
know all the projects that they were

211
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,000
involved with and the books that were

212
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:08,240
written and the you know travels and all

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,799
that stuff it's just it's U you know

214
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,399
will never happen again you know

215
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,958
hopefully hopefully it'll never happen

216
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,559
again because hopefully we'll ever fall

217
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,958
back into prohibition that way but yeah

218
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:21,359
it was a unique time unique

219
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:23,278
guys totally totally and I don't know if

220
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,919
he'll come up again so I want to quickly

221
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:30,120
ask you why do you think Dave Watson has

222
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,319
historically been portrayed is a villain

223
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,959
by some when in my opinion it seems

224
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,000
quite obvious to me he's on the Mount

225
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,119
Rushmore of cannabis why do you think

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,078
some people have such polarized views

227
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,120
about

228
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:45,679
him um well I mean similar I mean think

229
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,278
about the Big Sir Hollywood Story it's

230
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,719
like when you create a vacuum and

231
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,480
there's no information there people just

232
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
fill that vacuum with information that's

233
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
just the way our brains work right you

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,759
can't just say you can't just leave it

235
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,879
open and Rob and David were not trying

236
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,559
to advertise all the work they were

237
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,278
doing they're trying to get it done they

238
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,958
had a lot of they did a lot of work you

239
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,240
know and they also weren't trying to

240
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,199
brag about it and they weren't trying to

241
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,560
defend themselves from people who were

242
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,079
pointing fingers you know creating

243
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,439
stories you know they that didn't that

244
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:16,319
wasn't part of their agenda and they

245
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,120
weren't the guys like they weren't part

246
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,959
of the circus you know of the the

247
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,879
Cannabis Cup circus of people running

248
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,679
around waving flags and stuff um they

249
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,000
were really legitimate research

250
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,319
scientists cannabis enthusiasts guys who

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,240
love weed more than anybody else in the

252
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,839
the world you know and seriously you

253
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,839
know and really trying to do good work

254
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,000
and because of that everyone you know

255
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,120
like well well how does that work how's

256
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,919
that happen and yeah of course it's it's

257
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,078
strange and odd at the time because

258
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:50,639
we're in the throws of prohibition you

259
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:53,519
know what I mean so and there there

260
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,079
wasn't much that you could say back then

261
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,320
right so all the stories and all the

262
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,958
lore that came along over the ages you

263
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,760
know they were just filing in that

264
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:05,039
vacuum you know and now in hindsight

265
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,399
it's pretty clear what all those stories

266
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,958
were you know and there's plenty of

267
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,440
historic record but that doesn't change

268
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,000
people's opinions on the truth much

269
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,160
because it doesn't change I mean think

270
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,679
about how people think think about all

271
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,679
the opinions people have about all the

272
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,599
other things in the world today you know

273
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,679
what I mean so um no it's a shame and

274
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,800
and you know and that's as an industry

275
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,039
and as a community we are all very

276
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,000
guarded and you know we've been we've

277
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,879
had our backs against the wall we're all

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
very

279
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,159
sensitive um and I think that that we we

280
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,200
still feel that we're still very

281
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,799
cautious of Corporations and you know

282
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,519
capitalist influence and big tobacco and

283
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,799
biotech and all this stuff we're really

284
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,480
worried that they're going to do

285
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:55,278
something you know and um so I get it I

286
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,759
get why people you know people are

287
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,838
afraid that someone's out to do

288
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,000
something do harm to Mother C

289
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,519
or the people who follow her you know

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,440
but all I can say having known David and

291
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,240
known Rob quite well is that these guys

292
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,519
love cannabis more than anybody and have

293
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,440
tried harder than anybody to push things

294
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,198
forward in the face of incredible

295
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,240
self-risk you know what I mean just like

296
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:22,519
so and and and and and like what the

297
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,519
what were the Alternatives at the time

298
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,240
you know when someone's out there

299
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,879
spreading rumors about you what what are

300
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,480
your alternatives to go out there

301
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,240
publicly and deny them you know what I

302
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,560
mean so I think part of the strategy was

303
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,799
just like I'm not going to I don't I'm

304
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:38,759
not going to comment on that and that

305
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,399
conspiracy loves a no comment right so

306
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,000
and it's still it's still today you know

307
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,919
it's still people still have that but

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,720
it's just just like you know and that

309
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:50,240
even you know on into you know phos and

310
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,120
you know all these other you know people

311
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,919
worried that Monsanto is going to take

312
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,600
cannabis away from us and that there's

313
00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:00,198
bad players and you know it's like I

314
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,879
mean when science Science and Industry

315
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,639
marches forward you know capitalism

316
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,439
plays a role right it's always there's

317
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,799
always going to be people who take

318
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,639
advantages of things but it's

319
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:14,879
like that you know don't hold anyone

320
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,399
personally responsible for being you

321
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,879
know uh everything for

322
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,240
everybody so well I mean while we're on

323
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,278
the topic of the fos thing what was your

324
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,360
thoughts on that and do you think that

325
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,600
at this point it's sort of inevitable

326
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,440
that for any one who's going to offer

327
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,240
that sort of sequencing like of course

328
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,120
the data collection is going to

329
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:42,198
inherently be like of value and probably

330
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,519
monetized and in a similar sense maybe

331
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:47,078
this time they'll they'll package the

332
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,919
delivery a little more palatable than

333
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:50,799
what we got but you know like do you

334
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,399
think it's essentially to get that

335
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,679
service the same outcome is likely to

336
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,399
occur well I think it's a duplicitous of

337
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,479
the messaging that if you're saying like

338
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,159
hey I mean that's why people are upset

339
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,759
with 23 and me now is because they

340
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,078
finally figured out that the data was

341
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,600
more valuable than the test right that

342
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,439
they gave you this you pay 100 bucks and

343
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,879
they give you a test but really what

344
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,639
what they're really getting out of it is

345
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,320
your data and they're selling that to

346
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,680
you know biotech or whatever um so

347
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,440
that's kind of where philos got thrown

348
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,679
under the bus was that they were saying

349
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,560
one thing and doing another you know

350
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:27,159
but I don't know I mean to me it's it's

351
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,439
just inevitable aspect of of anything

352
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,838
that you know that all the different

353
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,519
Dynamics of Agriculture and horiculture

354
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,240
and capitalism and supply chain Dynamics

355
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,078
are going to play a role in

356
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,079
cannabis and and in a way I I think

357
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,838
there's one Camp there's one camp that

358
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:45,599
feels like cannabis should be held

359
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,360
accountable for that meaning like it can

360
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,959
only be treated with an ethical

361
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,240
perspective meaning if we're going to re

362
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,439
if we're going to normalize cannabis we

363
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,278
should also be normalizing um

364
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,759
regenerative farming and we should also

365
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,600
normalize you know fair trade and we

366
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,199
should also normalize all these other

367
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,519
components that we should for all of

368
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,958
Agriculture but I kind of feel like

369
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,120
that's unfair to cannabis as the plant

370
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,838
it's fair to The Farmer in the community

371
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,039
and the consumer to have that

372
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,759
perspective but to hold cannabis

373
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,559
accountable to say that with this plant

374
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,320
you can't do all the things that you

375
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,319
guys do with all the other

376
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,079
plants like we're not allow you're not

377
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,360
allowed to do this oh you can't do that

378
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,519
it's sacred it's more important it's you

379
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,759
know I think that that's not realistic

380
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,679
and in some ways it's not fair and in

381
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,079
also it's probably irrelevant because

382
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:41,078
back to the whole diversity thing no

383
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,439
matter what their efforts are you know

384
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,919
it's still just going to be some Bag

385
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,880
seed that's the next greatest thing that

386
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,919
some kid pulls out of an e or something

387
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,318
right you know um and and all the

388
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:54,120
genomic data you know is only good for

389
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:57,039
people who can use it right and so far

390
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,240
no one's really created a lot of value

391
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,439
or utility in that data in terms of

392
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,519
creating market products and stuff so I

393
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,160
I I just don't worry about any of that

394
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,440
to be honest and I think like it's a

395
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:12,919
symptom of us being um beat down by

396
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,880
prohibition that we so susceptible to

397
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:19,159
that that you know just let cannabis be

398
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:21,120
like we we went to um we went to these

399
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:25,120
USDA um field

400
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,519
trials and it was it was amazing to go

401
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,799
up in Geneva New York you know in this

402
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,198
collaboration with Cornell

403
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:34,000
um the USDA is doing these field trials

404
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,879
Cornell's doing research and they're

405
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,078
doing breeding for fiber and Grain and

406
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,519
blah blah blah and Drug types and they

407
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:44,638
had this um you know the USDA had I

408
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,000
think it was 500 sessions of you know

409
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,360
land race and feral and all kinds of

410
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,639
stuff open pollinated in a big giant

411
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,519
field thousands of plants and you know

412
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,480
they're just getting they're just

413
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,440
dipping their toes they're like they've

414
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,278
they've collected germplasm and data

415
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,040
years ago that they all lost and they're

416
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,439
all just getting started again or they

417
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,480
destroyed or whatever happened you know

418
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,319
so it's like they're all just getting

419
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,199
started industry is just getting back

420
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,599
into it you research is just getting

421
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,400
back into it you know egg is getting

422
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,759
into it Pharma is getting into it you

423
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,280
know so like I don't think any of us

424
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,720
should not allow anyone no one should

425
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:25,399
get in the way of all that happening you

426
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,240
know and that that is kind of like back

427
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,360
to this you know is it cannabis or is it

428
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,480
a cannabis industry you know cannabis

429
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,479
industry then then Lord knows everything

430
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,640
that happens to all other Industries is

431
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,759
going to happen to cannabis you know and

432
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,720
I mean that's one of the things that

433
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,160
makes it so hard here in California is

434
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,600
we don't treat it like another crop and

435
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,480
Farmers have overly restrictive

436
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,918
regulations that they have to follow

437
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,599
that make it really hard for them to

438
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,038
profit you know licensing is really

439
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,079
difficult um cultivation is difficult

440
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,720
distribution is difficult all that stuff

441
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,240
it's not treated like it is alcohol if

442
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,000
it was treated like alcohol if it was

443
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,359
more normalized like tobacco and alcohol

444
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
then it would be easier for Farmers you

445
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,519
know so it's like let's let's not as we

446
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,519
transition out of you know cannabis has

447
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,279
held hostage and been Shackled for so

448
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,679
long and then we're going to transition

449
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,599
out of prohibition but we're still going

450
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,400
to make cannabis you know responsible

451
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:24,240
for correcting the wrongs of society in

452
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,200
terms of like Commerce I don't think

453
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,000
that that's fair so like I don't have a

454
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,440
problem with people doing criser with

455
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,200
cannabis I don't have a problem with

456
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,480
people doing Gene editing with cannabis

457
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,640
I don't have a problem with people doing

458
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,200
monoculture or whatever all the things

459
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,360
that they do I just have a problem with

460
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,319
they not being really good weed to smoke

461
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,839
you

462
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,399
know that that's that's to me I mean

463
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,720
ultimately I'm like look if you guys can

464
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,480
figure this out and make it work I mean

465
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,919
you know I I try to eat majority organic

466
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,640
produce you know and I try to you know

467
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:59,759
be as sustainable as I can you know but

468
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,759
I'm not holding myself or family you

469
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,359
know responsible for correcting

470
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,798
agriculture by only eating that way I do

471
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,798
it when I can and I think that that's

472
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,359
just let's be realistic about where the

473
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,079
industry is headed I think just taking a

474
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,839
kind of a sober approach to like you

475
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:19,158
know we have a certain amount of social

476
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,759
responsibility to to usher in the right

477
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,240
you know model but at the same time we

478
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,798
got to just accept that things are just

479
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,919
going to happen you know and not not

480
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,319
fight that you know and and that's I

481
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,759
think we have that

482
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,839
resistance built into us because

483
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,440
prohibition made us so resistant so like

484
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,918
there's n there's this kind of weird

485
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,279
cautious like just like I don't know you

486
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,080
guys are G to screw this up you know and

487
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,759
here in in the US we've got like Farm

488
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:51,000
bille hemp you know and we've got the

489
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:53,119
talk about rescheduling into schedule 3

490
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,519
you know at the same time and we've got

491
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:59,038
a patchwork of regulations that are like

492
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,319
are really onerous from state to state I

493
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,000
could see why everyone would be really

494
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,759
skeptical about that we're about to [ __ ]

495
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,159
this up again you know what I mean it's

496
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,519
like there's a lot to figure out before

497
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:10,640
we can move forward here you know and

498
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,480
and I know it's the same with other

499
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,400
countries Australia has a lot to figure

500
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,000
out in order to transition out of

501
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,798
medical into adult use you know other

502
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,839
countries that are still have you know

503
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,918
cannabis is in full prohibition they've

504
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:27,279
got a lot to figure out in order to have

505
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,679
an opportunity to you know earn to make

506
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,399
money in this industry as well so

507
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,640
um I just I I think collectively we all

508
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,798
need to you know be you know ethical and

509
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,559
focused but also be really realistic as

510
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:45,000
much as possible when it comes to like

511
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:48,200
the in the influence of Big

512
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,679
Industry I mean given we are sort of

513
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,080
standing in the face of the highly

514
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,440
likely impeding Federal legalization

515
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,359
what do you think's going to happen if

516
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
things continue to roll out the way they

517
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,439
are and do you think

518
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,079
the reclassification to schedule 3 is

519
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,960
going to change much like I think there

520
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,558
was a lot of discussion about it when it

521
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,400
first came out but it seems like it's

522
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,158
sort of fallen off and I've seen some

523
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,798
people who sort of aren't convinced it's

524
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,080
going to do all that

525
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:19,960
much I I mean well having worked quite a

526
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,038
bit as a consultant in

527
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,120
Australia where in a medical system

528
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,798
where cannabis is prescribed by a doctor

529
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:32,000
and distributed through a pharmacy

530
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:35,079
um I'd be careful what you ask for you

531
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,919
know it's not the best system for making

532
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:40,119
cannabis accessible it's it's great I I

533
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,200
mean and I even think for for Australia

534
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,119
you know it's great that there's a

535
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,159
medical system and it should be even

536
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,319
more robust of a medical system

537
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,600
everywhere there should be more research

538
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,480
and there should be better medical

539
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,959
products for people who really need them

540
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,278
for medicinal and therapeutic

541
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,079
needs but at the same time Canabis

542
00:21:55,278 --> 00:22:00,119
should just be everywhere for everybody

543
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:03,240
all the time you you know so I I

544
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,479
anything that puts limitations on access

545
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm not for that at all you know what I

546
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,159
mean I don't think that that's good you

547
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,079
know but I do think that we do need to

548
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,760
continue to move towards medical

549
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,759
medicinal cannabis because I don't think

550
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,720
we have we have kind of the same thing

551
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,960
under different classifications versus

552
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,519
actual medicinal grade therapeutic you

553
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,360
know safe you know safe to consume

554
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,359
addresses whatever conditions are you

555
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:32,879
know you have like let's really try to

556
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:36,479
make a schedule 3 cannabis but the the

557
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,240
question to me is schedule 3

558
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,200
only right is very different than

559
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,599
schedule three yes like yeah Des schedu

560
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,519
out of schedule one but don't only put

561
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:49,079
it in schedule 3 because if it's only in

562
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,960
schedule 3 then the idea of it being

563
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,278
more accessible at farmers markets or

564
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,240
liquor stores or all that stuff is out

565
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,640
out the out the door and then it becomes

566
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,440
similar to possibly what's going on in

567
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,880
Australia which is a lot of

568
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,360
accessibility but through a very limited

569
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Channel you know and which makes it

570
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,199
really hard also for for cultivation and

571
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,399
stuff because it has to be grown and

572
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,798
processed and packaged and distributed

573
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,640
as medicine versus um

574
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:21,558
produce which makes it a lot more

575
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,400
expensive for the consumer you know so I

576
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:25,079
I would really hate to see that and I

577
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,080
think what's so fascinating here in the

578
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,240
US is that you know the potential path

579
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,199
for

580
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,359
um for being more restricted you know

581
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,600
versus this complete opening up this

582
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:41,158
kind of farm gate open the we open Farm

583
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:44,599
Bill opened the floodgates for cannabis

584
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,679
nationally which is what's happened um

585
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:50,399
which has created this massive um you

586
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,278
know Farm Bill cannabis Market which now

587
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,320
possibly dwarfs the state licens

588
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:59,679
Market um has created conflict between

589
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:02,558
groups you you know and you see now you

590
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,080
got in in Florida you've got an

591
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:08,278
incredibly um conservative Governor

592
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,359
protecting Farm Bill hemp companies

593
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,919
because it's good for Commerce and then

594
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:15,278
in California you've got a considerably

595
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,400
liberal Governor protecting state

596
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,400
license groups and claiming that farm

597
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,120
bill cannabis is bad for the community

598
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,440
and bad for the market and now you got

599
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:27,038
chich and Chong suing the California

600
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,600
state for making their business you know

601
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,720
difficult it's like we've got this

602
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:35,439
upside down model where we really don't

603
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,038
know how to move forward you know and

604
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,320
California being the fifth largest

605
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,319
economy in the world the world's largest

606
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:46,240
cannabis Market I feel like these new

607
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:48,240
restrictions on H derived THC products

608
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,240
are kind of highlighting the path

609
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,079
forward that you can't have two tracks

610
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,200
that are in complete conflict with each

611
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:57,398
other you can't make it really difficult

612
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,558
for one group and completely open for

613
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:02,000
another and it's the same product that

614
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:03,599
they're selling you know which is kind

615
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,519
of what happened here you know you got

616
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,879
thca is

617
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,879
everywhere and it's a loophole and but

618
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,559
it's great I think free the free the

619
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,120
plant make make more loopholes but at

620
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:16,798
the same time you got another group

621
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,479
that's just like look you're killing us

622
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,359
we paid a half a million dollars to get

623
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,720
licensed and we're getting taxed like

624
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:27,479
40% on this stuff and like and then

625
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,440
meanwhile they're selling thca flow at

626
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,319
the head shop

627
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
and it's like how can that exist and

628
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,879
then California steps in and now is

629
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,839
saying regardless of federal law

630
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,360
regardless of a. three THC distinction

631
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:44,599
we're saying all THC no matter what

632
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:48,398
potency is now banned in California I

633
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,879
mean that's weird dude that's like to me

634
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:52,278
like if you wanted to like create some

635
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,919
kind of cannabis science fiction from

636
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:55,679
like 40 years ago and say imagine a

637
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,880
world in the future where chich Chin

638
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,798
chong is suing the government because

639
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,240
they wait I'm like what in the hell you

640
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:07,038
know it gets it gets so bizarre that

641
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,399
it's hard to see a path out of it you

642
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:12,759
know other than just some gnarly

643
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:16,239
Draconian distinction of like this is

644
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:19,720
now what's legal and only this because

645
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:23,319
otherwise it's a patchwork of of laws

646
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,759
and and and support also you know like

647
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,158
all these different states have

648
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:29,319
Congressional support the lobbying on

649
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,200
their behalf nobody wants to see their

650
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,839
model go away Florida just got their

651
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,480
model Alabama is just getting their

652
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,759
model New York is starting their model

653
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,599
they don't want to see interstate

654
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:44,079
commerce just happen and then

655
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:46,079
California sells to the whole country

656
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,798
but every farmer in California wants to

657
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,398
be just like every other crop and say

658
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:53,319
hey the only way we can survive is a

659
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:55,798
garlic or a or a citrus or aroke farmer

660
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:57,038
almond Farmers to sell our produce to

661
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:00,038
the rest of the country and the rest of

662
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,960
the world you know so it's like it's

663
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:05,038
direct conflict with like how

664
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,519
agriculture Works how regulations work

665
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,798
you know what we think cannabis is like

666
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,079
chemically and I mean

667
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:14,240
Jesus yeah look definitely some

668
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,918
conflicting messages there and I

669
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,960
guess sad to say someone's going to end

670
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,759
up sort of being the loser as you said

671
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,038
as as things get federally legalized

672
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,679
while you were talking about that I

673
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,278
couldn't help my mind was wandering cuz

674
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,278
you were talking about Farm bills and

675
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,919
for some reason my mind wandered and I

676
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,079
wanted to ask cuz I saw on your

677
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,759
Instagram recently you're at Atlas seeds

678
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,240
farms and I know those guys they're some

679
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:41,480
pretty serious Auto dudes they're um

680
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,240
like Farmers Farmers you know what I

681
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,079
mean and uh I wanted to ask like what

682
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,880
sort of what was the impression that

683
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,439
left on you like do you as time goes by

684
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,159
I think Autos are going to be adopted

685
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,640
more and more on the sort of that

686
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,440
agricultural scale what was your

687
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,480
impression from being there and uh do

688
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,759
you see is taking a a bigger role in

689
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,319
sort of outdoor cultivation bulk scale

690
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,000
for sure I mean and and those are really

691
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,678
really good guys we worked with them a

692
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,960
little bit did some Consulting work with

693
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,679
them a few years ago with helping them

694
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,759
with their breeding program and they

695
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,159
have really um ramped things up and

696
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,158
they're really nailing it you know and

697
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,760
Autos have come a long way I mean if you

698
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,440
think about the challenges in breeding

699
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,839
autof flowers um in the few years we've

700
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,278
really seen you know potency and Aroma

701
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,519
profile profile and size and everything

702
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:34,798
just really coming out and it's

703
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,880
definitely you know when you when you

704
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,879
see new markets emerging and scaled you

705
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,799
know cultivation especially for you know

706
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,640
API for oil and stuff autoflowers are

707
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,679
the

708
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,960
no-brainer um my only concern about seed

709
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,278
companies and and Seed production itself

710
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:58,240
is just the scalability

711
00:28:54,278 --> 00:29:02,159
of we've we probably have way more seeds

712
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,599
right now than the earth needs right

713
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,320
meaning like there's enough there's

714
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,839
enough seed producers that have produced

715
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,119
enough seed like if they could sell all

716
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:11,558
their seed right now we could grow way

717
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,759
more cannabis than we could ever consume

718
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:15,440
you know and and I think that what I

719
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,798
guess the message I'm getting there is

720
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,759
that that broad acre cannabis which is

721
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,398
an Australian term which I really love

722
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,879
and I hope that Americans and other

723
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,038
countries adopted I think it really

724
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,039
describes what that type of scaled

725
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:30,879
agriculture is when you say Broad acre

726
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,359
it's like not just an acre it's not two

727
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,278
acres it's Acres it's hectares it's

728
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:39,719
hundreds of them you know and when I

729
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:42,599
when I drive through um like wine

730
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,120
country I can assume I can see like a

731
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,240
portion of that Vineyard is I could

732
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,518
consume that with my friends and family

733
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,839
like a big lot a big chunk like we could

734
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,278
all drink for the holidays and stuff

735
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:58,038
like but with cannabis even a big smoker

736
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,159
can't really consume a big portion of a

737
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,679
field there's just not that much

738
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,559
cannabis that needs to be grown to to

739
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,720
meet the needs of the global consumer

740
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:09,960
right so there's not that many seeds

741
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,038
that need to be produced so there's not

742
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,600
that many acres that need to be sewn

743
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:15,879
there's not that many places around the

744
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,759
world that need to grow that have

745
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,278
appropriate climate to grow so when I

746
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,519
think about all these seed producers and

747
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,519
stuff they're kind of like in this R&amp;D

748
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,798
phase of like we're going to make all

749
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,200
the seed we're going to make all these

750
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:29,079
varieties and we're going to sell them

751
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
to all these different people all over

752
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:34,599
the world and they're going to figure

753
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,798
out what works for them and then the

754
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,038
rules are going to

755
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:39,440
change and then we're going to grow only

756
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:42,119
where it really

757
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,120
works right so then we'll do this all

758
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,839
over again it'll be a whole new exercise

759
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,439
in like producing seed because right now

760
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:50,359
for instance you know like I know guys

761
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,919
in Minnesota that are growing acres and

762
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,359
Acres of a of flowers right but they

763
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,519
wouldn't be growing Acres of otter

764
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,558
flowers in Minnesota if you could

765
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,638
purchase flower from California it's

766
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,759
just cheaper and better quality and all

767
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:04,359
that stuff just to you know same thing

768
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,359
with northern areas and they're and

769
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:09,278
they're going through pathogen trials to

770
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,158
kind of figure out what is less

771
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,480
susceptible to powdering Mill do or

772
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,639
susceptible to leaf spot septoria or

773
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,960
stuff like that you know and then the

774
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:20,879
Breeders are are responding oh try this

775
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,639
and do this but it's like ultimately if

776
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,559
you're a seed producer for other crops

777
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:28,000
you grow for the re you produce seeds

778
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:30,599
for the region that's ideal for for

779
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,558
growing that crop right and like right

780
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,398
now we excuse me because of pro you know

781
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:39,960
because of because of the Federal

782
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:41,678
Regulations we can't just grow cannabis

783
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,880
where it's most appropriate to grow it

784
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,759
and distribute the product so instead

785
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,519
we're selling the seeds and the Clones

786
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,919
to places where they're growing it even

787
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,798
though it's not the right place to grow

788
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,519
so that's hard on the seed producers to

789
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:55,798
now like okay I've gota I've gotta I've

790
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,519
got to produce seeds for people to grow

791
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:03,720
at scale in Vermont and New York and

792
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,480
South Dakota and Southern California and

793
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,200
you know all these different places

794
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,558
where I mean how much of your focus

795
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,000
would be on that if we had a real

796
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,839
thriving Market you know and that's I

797
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,720
guess and this is not not anything to

798
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:22,079
say about Atlas seeds or any one seed

799
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:24,798
company but it's just about breeding and

800
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,439
improving you know variety Improvement

801
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:30,839
and and trying to move forward with your

802
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,720
breeding goals is all about the

803
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:36,599
downstream consumer you know the farmer

804
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,798
that's going to sew those seeds so right

805
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:41,439
now it's just a scramble to produce seed

806
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,720
for people all over the world you know

807
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,558
and and you know a really interesting

808
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,079
like where what Atlas is doing that's

809
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:51,839
really far out and I think

810
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,359
compelling um and and interesting you

811
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,119
know if I already said that is the work

812
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:59,158
in Morocco cuz here's a place where they

813
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:01,959
really do grow broad acre cannabis and

814
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,559
they really do you know homogenize and

815
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,639
produce like this big bulk product for

816
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:10,200
large scale export but it's

817
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:12,439
not it's not there yet because it's

818
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,240
still under you know the it's still

819
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,798
under prohibition influence right

820
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,558
Morocco doesn't have a fully mature

821
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:22,079
system yet but they've got a fully

822
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:25,079
mature and functioning hashish culture

823
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,918
and market for decades right so autof

824
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:31,918
flowers and feminized seeds first really

825
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,840
in there right away you know but I mean

826
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,960
then then we could go down a whole

827
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,918
another rabbit hole on like you know

828
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,720
well should should have Moroccan

829
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,519
genetics stayed Moroccan instead of

830
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,399
being influenced by California you know

831
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,880
so it's like seed producers producing

832
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:50,119
seeds for where for what product it's a

833
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,679
it's a big it's a big question you know

834
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,199
and and there's a lot of people I mean

835
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,798
I've just heard stories about like the

836
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,558
volume of seeds that have been produced

837
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,679
in the past couple years by all these

838
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,158
different groups it's just insane

839
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,720
yeah you know it's easy to make seed

840
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,639
It's relatively easy to make seed it's

841
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,720
hard to to sell seed you know that's

842
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:08,799
exactly it isn't it and I can only

843
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,000
imagine how much seed has been produced

844
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,800
in recent Years you'll have to forgive

845
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,320
me I keep pulling us off track take me

846
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,519
back to when you were talking about the

847
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,240
transition back from Amsterdam to

848
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,358
America in the wake of prop

849
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,319
25 what was that move back like what did

850
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,639
you take with you and what did you do

851
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,079
and when you sort of were setting

852
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,079
yourself back up

853
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,919
um when I first came back I just came

854
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,839
back with some seeds and that's it I

855
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:39,759
came back I wish i' kept that female

856
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:43,480
that's the one thing I regret um I came

857
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,240
back with seeds and I had spent um I I

858
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,000
got really into hashish when I was in in

859
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,598
Amsterdam and learning how to make

860
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,358
hashish that was another thing that you

861
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,240
know I had this this Um passion for

862
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:59,519
making hash which is was great no one

863
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:01,639
Rob obviously um so I got really into

864
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,440
that and I realized that I had a couple

865
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,920
ideas the product ideas that I tried to

866
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,400
make some that one that actually got

867
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,280
kind of ripped off it was called a hash

868
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,358
maker it was a little handheld Shaker

869
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,040
thing someone ended up making it they

870
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,519
still sell them today actually but it

871
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:15,519
was a totally different design but they

872
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,838
kind of ripped off my idea and I had a

873
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,480
couple other little ideas for like

874
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:22,719
little hash boxes and just sving gear

875
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,199
and like when I first saw i f saw the

876
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:27,879
before bubble bags and Mila had made her

877
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,399
um isolator bags when I saw that first

878
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,480
hash making device from um what's his

879
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,079
name Reinhardt I just went home that

880
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,119
night and made like my own little water

881
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,920
hash thing and I was like dude this is

882
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:42,160
this is like gamechanging and I knew

883
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,880
from experience in the community back in

884
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,879
Cali that everyone was just throwing

885
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,720
away their trim I mean they were

886
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,240
trimming for one they should have been

887
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:53,039
trimming over screens because they

888
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:55,159
trimmed fully dry material you know and

889
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,639
the resin would just fly through the air

890
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:58,838
I remember just seeing like clouds of

891
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,118
resin with the sun rays shining through

892
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:03,838
the dappled leaves and just resin flying

893
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,280
everywhere and going oh my God but I

894
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,719
would see these trash bags full of trim

895
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,880
and sometimes he like yeah maybe I'm G

896
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:11,039
to sell it to someone who'll make

897
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,760
brownies or something and I'm like dude

898
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,119
there is gold in there so I actually

899
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,359
didn't even buy bags I don't even know

900
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,318
if they're for sale but I just knew of a

901
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:23,920
print supply place and I got loads I

902
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:26,838
would get bulk um bulk um silk screen

903
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,159
and I would stretch my own flat screens

904
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:33,679
and i' make I stitched my own bags went

905
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,679
up to Big Sir and um was making bubble

906
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,239
hash and just kind of splitting it with

907
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:42,838
the farmer and doing that and I had met

908
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:47,679
in Amsterdam before I came back to Cali

909
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:52,279
I had met um a friend who was um buddies

910
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:55,598
with Josh D um and so in like 908 or

911
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:59,319
late 97 maybe early 98 I had met Josh

912
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:02,160
here in La um so right when I came back

913
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:04,000
the Kush thing was just taken off so I

914
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:08,159
was kind of in with those guys hanging

915
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,039
out with them um and also I had met the

916
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,519
the sour guys Sour Diesel guys in

917
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,960
Amsterdam years before too so I came

918
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:19,358
back to Cali and I wasn't growing but I

919
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,920
was in these two Circles of um of of

920
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:24,920
Sour Diesel and OG Kush so there was a

921
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,800
lot of flower going around um and I was

922
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,200
kind of facilitating some of that um and

923
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,079
trying to trying to be a bridge I guess

924
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:35,000
in some way um so yeah so that it took

925
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,680
me a while to get back into growing and

926
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,119
breeding probably about two years before

927
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:40,879
I started doing that

928
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:45,039
again and I mean when you first got

929
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,480
exposed to OG and to S was it

930
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:50,079
immediately evident to you like oh wow

931
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,639
this is the next thing or did it grow on

932
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,119
you um and did you immediately want to

933
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,759
breed with

934
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,800
them um well first the sour I first saw

935
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,079
in

936
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,039
Amsterdam um because those guys came

937
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,839
over right after they had popped the

938
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,838
beans and showed the flour and it was

939
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:10,078
definitely it was super

940
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:12,480
impressive super loud Aroma and I got to

941
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,720
you know I set up a grow for them in

942
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,760
Amsterdam in around

943
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:20,118
96 um that he ended up getting

944
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,119
seized and so I knew there was something

945
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,680
special there it was just the really

946
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:29,519
intense loud Aroma profile to me was the

947
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:32,279
main thing and similar with OG cuz both

948
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,358
to be perfectly honest the effect from

949
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,560
both of those cultivars does not

950
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:39,039
particularly resonate with me so it was

951
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:43,000
always

952
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:47,440
like um this just intense loud Aroma

953
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,838
profile and it wasn't about effect um so

954
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,079
that was that so that was always strange

955
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,039
you know but I knew that there was

956
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,519
something you know alluring about it and

957
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,358
also just the the um the reason I

958
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:01,199
decided to start breeding with OG was

959
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:03,119
just that swollen Brack kind of

960
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,519
structure and that

961
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,240
frostiness um was something that I just

962
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,519
kind of wanted to bring into sage just

963
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:13,519
to chunk it up a little bit and to bring

964
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:16,119
the flower time down a little bit but um

965
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:20,639
but no I it was um it was interesting

966
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:23,559
because for one those two groups sour

967
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,239
and OG they both had this weight behind

968
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,480
them already even they were just young

969
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:29,479
guys and just getting growing and not

970
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,960
producing a lot at the time when I met

971
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,039
him but it was like clear that there was

972
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,440
something bigger than you know the sum

973
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,838
of the parts was bigger kind of thing

974
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,720
because OG and and Sour Diesel were just

975
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,679
like I don't know something about that

976
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:50,519
loud Aroma profile which I think is

977
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:53,639
really interesting because I think Aroma

978
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,759
and the advertising nature of just like

979
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:58,440
these new gassy varieties really took

980
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,119
over cannabis in terms of like what

981
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,760
people expected it to be when they got

982
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,480
that in their in their their catalog you

983
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,079
know and it just it really crept into

984
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,000
the genan pool and it pushed everything

985
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,039
out like you know um so that was that

986
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,800
was trippy for me because I didn't I

987
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:21,480
didn't particularly like smoking them

988
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,800
that much but I saw how huge of a demand

989
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,199
there was in the market and I also saw

990
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,640
how people

991
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:30,239
reacted and it's interesting because

992
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:32,559
when you think about um not that there's

993
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,919
not not that the effect of both of those

994
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:37,159
plants isn't special and unique on its

995
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,280
own but when you think about how we

996
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:44,078
talked about all the difference in wine

997
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,000
and what makes a $50 bottle or a $5

998
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,160
bottle is just the aroma and flavor

999
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,599
profile it's not the drug it's not the

1000
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,480
ethanol with sour and OG that's when I

1001
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,920
first started seeing people's eyes light

1002
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,639
up when they'd smell it and they'd go oh

1003
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,639
my God God and their eyes would light up

1004
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,519
and their jaw would drop because it was

1005
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,559
like and they hadn't even smoked it yet

1006
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:06,639
it was just like this incredibly

1007
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,759
compelling like oh my God I didn't know

1008
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:13,039
weed could smell that way thing and that

1009
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,599
I think started driving the selection

1010
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,559
not just from the consumer but the

1011
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:21,480
breeder the grower everybody was this

1012
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:23,279
new wave of Aroma you know and and it

1013
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,079
just keeps going and now like to me

1014
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
nowadays when people talk about weed

1015
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,160
they just talk about flavors and smells

1016
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,280
they don't talk about how it makes them

1017
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:34,358
feel it's not even a drug anymore it's

1018
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,839
like like we're we're we're like our our

1019
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,639
our our endocannabinoid system is so

1020
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:40,599
maxed out maybe that the only thing we

1021
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,159
can talk about is the way it smells

1022
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,559
because it's hard to feel the effect

1023
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:48,318
because our our tolerance is so high but

1024
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,318
um it really has become the discussion

1025
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:52,719
and when I was a kid and all the way

1026
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,559
through Amsterdam even that wasn't the

1027
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,799
main driver of the selling point it

1028
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:00,078
wasn't like candy

1029
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,079
or things that have flavor or

1030
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,760
carbohydrates were like this is all

1031
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,599
about this and when those two cuts

1032
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,520
entered the pool it just became about

1033
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,680
that it was like dude and that's when

1034
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:16,440
loud that whole concept of loud it was

1035
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:19,159
just like it's like a neon sign saying

1036
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,200
come try me I'm amazing and whether you

1037
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:23,440
even like the high or even feel the high

1038
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:28,039
is probably even not even fully relevant

1039
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:31,358
because the aroma was so intense

1040
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:34,440
I wonder what what is it do you think

1041
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,480
about that Aroma that's so alluring

1042
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,440
because like I

1043
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:44,400
mean it's it's often described as like

1044
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:46,559
fuy Piney sort of thing and while yes

1045
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,119
it's broadly palatable it's not like an

1046
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,839
offensive smell I guess maybe a better

1047
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,480
way to articulate what I'm thinking is

1048
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:55,838
is that I know that we were we were

1049
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,000
talking off camera the other day and we

1050
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:01,639
were saying like sort of comes from the

1051
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,039
cam and the and the Kush is in a way and

1052
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:07,078
I guess with the cam there are some

1053
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:09,400
people who find the flavor profile a bit

1054
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:12,480
off-putting whereas with the Kush it's

1055
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,960
pretty universally enjoyed I wonder I

1056
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,159
wonder what does that exactly you know

1057
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,639
is it just as simple as the tpin profile

1058
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:21,159
is that what you think it is or do you

1059
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,679
think there's like some other sort of

1060
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:25,519
stuff going on under the hood that we're

1061
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:28,519
maybe not aware of yet well well I think

1062
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,000
the I think the um

1063
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:31,679
well I think I try to I try to lean

1064
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,559
towards the word Aroma more because now

1065
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,919
we're finding out all this stuff about

1066
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,000
thol and indoles and you know Esters and

1067
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,318
ketones and pyosin and there's just so

1068
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,639
many different things in cannabis that

1069
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,719
contribute to the aroma and we don't

1070
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,440
really know what plays a role in terms

1071
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:50,159
of effect in terms of Entourage so let's

1072
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,280
I think it's we have to look look at it

1073
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:58,759
that way um but I think that

1074
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,640
we over we under estimate the power of

1075
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,440
Aroma and

1076
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:09,078
flavor in terms of decision making and

1077
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:11,639
in terms of um like Aroma and

1078
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,720
flavor trigger a different response in

1079
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:17,440
our brain right it's like about Mom it's

1080
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,239
about safety it's about like is this

1081
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,440
good or not to consume it smells good I

1082
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,159
think it's safe um it's about beauty

1083
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,679
it's about you know all these things

1084
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:29,799
that are like bigger than a drug

1085
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,279
you know and you think about all our

1086
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,680
decision making we make in life for

1087
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,680
products and how Aroma dictates that and

1088
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,719
the food we eat and the perfume that we

1089
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,039
wear and the shampoo that we put on our

1090
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,838
head and the products we use and it's

1091
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:51,558
just a really powerful

1092
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:53,838
tool and it to some degree all cannabis

1093
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:55,160
is good enough for everybody I think

1094
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:56,519
right like if we just had if we were

1095
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:59,039
just stuck with blue dream it would

1096
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,639
probably be fine for everybody you know

1097
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:04,039
but the idea that these other things

1098
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:06,199
came around that had just this huge like

1099
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:09,000
advertising signal to the world around

1100
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:12,598
them that I am here you know see me

1101
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,559
smell me touch me smoke me um it really

1102
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:18,760
just draws people in and you know like I

1103
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,160
would see like with OG and sour was the

1104
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,720
first time I'd see people when they'd

1105
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,558
take a hit and they'd smack their lips

1106
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,519
afterwards they

1107
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,040
go like that like they were chewing it

1108
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,318
you know what I mean and I was thinking

1109
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:31,719
about that I was like well think about

1110
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:34,480
all the different parts of your brain

1111
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:36,199
that are firing now it's not just like

1112
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,400
taking a substance and waiting for the

1113
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:40,399
effect like eating a aspirin and waiting

1114
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,119
for the pain to go away or you know what

1115
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,400
I mean it's like you are engaged now

1116
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,559
you're like in it you know it's like

1117
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,559
you're in the bubble of experience

1118
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:54,280
because you're chewing smelling tasting

1119
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:56,079
you know like you are in cannabis and

1120
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,640
and that was very new like we didn't

1121
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,800
have that experience erence before like

1122
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,039
these cultivars came on the scene the

1123
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,920
same time indoor cultivation came on the

1124
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,920
scene the same time the proliferation of

1125
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,280
like medical and like dispensaries came

1126
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,519
on the scene so like cannabis went from

1127
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:18,599
this dirty old uh you know dried out

1128
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:22,800
vapid lifeless thing to this Extremely

1129
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:27,079
Loud fresh iny face you know

1130
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:29,318
neon loud cannabis profile um so but

1131
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,680
really just it just took over the market

1132
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:35,119
and I think that it's we're still there

1133
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:38,159
where you know now people really you

1134
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,200
know they're not seeking out um they're

1135
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,519
not seeking out sativas for that reason

1136
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:44,399
for instance are they delivering the

1137
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:49,719
loud that

1138
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:53,720
spicy um that spicy herbaceous woodsy

1139
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:56,159
incense sativa thing doesn't

1140
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:59,759
really fire up the same part of your

1141
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:04,759
brain is that fruity tropical skunky

1142
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,280
dank intense fuel it's like that just

1143
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,960
that's and like I and I I mean I just

1144
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,440
heard a breeder today talking about all

1145
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,039
his breeding selections and what he's

1146
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,358
doing and where is he's Crossing and

1147
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,279
where he's headed and what he wants to

1148
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:18,598
do and the entire conversation was just

1149
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,440
about Aroma and that's it there was

1150
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,559
there was never like oh yeah but this

1151
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,720
one's like susceptible to powdery mildew

1152
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,400
or oh yeah and this one doesn't really

1153
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:28,199
get you high that nice or oh yeah this

1154
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:31,358
one yields really high it's just like

1155
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:34,000
dude Aroma takes and and and to me

1156
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,639
that's fine and I love good flavored

1157
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,800
cannabis and all cannabis should be

1158
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:43,639
great flavor if it could but what the

1159
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:46,000
difference is is it puts the the effect

1160
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:47,318
in the back seat and the aroma starts

1161
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,119
driving the

1162
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:51,920
conversation so and this is my I'll say

1163
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:53,920
it again and this is like I'm just being

1164
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,000
cheeky by saying it but there's

1165
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,880
something somewhat Reckless about

1166
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,719
marketing drugs with with flavors and

1167
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,358
Aroma and I'm just joking but I'm also

1168
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:06,078
serious you know what I mean where it's

1169
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,519
like if you thought about like like if I

1170
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,440
had like and I've done this before when

1171
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,759
my back was out and I'd like I'd take

1172
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,280
some ibuprofen and I'd chew it because

1173
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,839
if you chew up a pill it works way

1174
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,760
faster right but it tastes like [ __ ] and

1175
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:22,599
it's really bitter in your mouth and G

1176
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,319
um but I'll happily chew the bitter pill

1177
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:27,559
if I get the effect that I want and if

1178
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:31,039
if sativas have to be

1179
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:32,760
less loud and less aromatic and less

1180
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,519
whatever in order to give me that

1181
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,960
soaring beautiful you know resonant High

1182
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:41,000
then I'm going to do that all day long

1183
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,400
versus the things that just taste and

1184
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,920
and I people give them to me all the

1185
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,880
time a weed that just tastes amazing I'm

1186
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,000
like Jesus this is so amazing I wish it

1187
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,079
had the effect that I want but what I

1188
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,519
learned years ago is that usually as a

1189
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,440
breeder when you select those Aromas it

1190
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,880
often cancels out the thing that you

1191
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,280
want because it's all tied in and that

1192
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,240
was my experience with making OG Sage

1193
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,920
crosses is that anything that would had

1194
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:10,598
OG nose had no Sage

1195
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,480
effect and I was like oh [ __ ] I love the

1196
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:14,440
way this smells it's intense it's

1197
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,760
Dynamic everyone's going to love it but

1198
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,559
it doesn't deliver the effect so I would

1199
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,079
just kick those to the curb and Destroy

1200
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,519
them because OG was already out there

1201
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,000
sour was already out there there was

1202
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:27,599
already plenty of really loud Dynamic

1203
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,318
smelling weed I want wanted that Sage

1204
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,559
effect and whatever that Entourage thing

1205
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:35,400
is or whatever that blocking effect is

1206
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:39,400
or that ceiling thing whatever if I

1207
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,240
selected OG it came with it you know and

1208
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,440
that was you know pre really

1209
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:45,558
understanding the Entourage effect

1210
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,119
that's when I kind of realized like man

1211
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:50,079
and like like grape is a perfect example

1212
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:52,358
I used to like I love grape flavored

1213
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,280
things but grape flavored weed doesn't

1214
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:57,119
deliver for me so I had to like go like

1215
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,760
[ __ ] I love grape but I can't love grape

1216
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,119
weed because grape weed has an effect

1217
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,200
generally that I don't like so like we

1218
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,079
got to like be responsible about like

1219
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:10,399
what are we really trying to achieve you

1220
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:12,880
know is it are we selling lollipops and

1221
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,240
candy and dessert items that have a drug

1222
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:19,599
back to them or are we selling a drug

1223
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:23,519
that has these Aroma backs to it like

1224
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:27,119
what is in the driving seat and and like

1225
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,480
to me the early you know Rob books and

1226
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,559
stuff they'd always talk about these

1227
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,559
sativas and put them up on a pedestal as

1228
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:35,519
the finest weed in the world and blah

1229
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,480
blah blah but it would never said

1230
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,039
because it tastes

1231
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,039
great you know what I mean that was that

1232
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:44,519
just wasn't a part of the discussion it

1233
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,440
was like no man this is I mean cannabis

1234
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:50,920
is a drug you know or at least that part

1235
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,599
of it is a drug so you know and and I in

1236
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,960
in a way because of you know the way

1237
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:57,160
consumerism works like I understand that

1238
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,679
if you have one variety that that tastes

1239
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:01,480
good and one that doesn't people will

1240
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:04,078
generally choose the one that tastes

1241
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,679
good regardless of the effect you know

1242
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:10,599
it's just but that that to me is about

1243
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:12,639
this like what are we choosing for and

1244
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:15,400
you know what you know and just even on

1245
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:17,838
the Entourage effect a lot of the data

1246
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,720
around like like the effects of LOLOL or

1247
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:22,558
the effects of pining or the effects of

1248
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:24,480
these things come from like aroma

1249
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,960
therapy world and there is good solid

1250
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:32,480
data that just these smells alone create

1251
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,639
a endogenous response from the

1252
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,559
consumer you know so maybe that is just

1253
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:40,639
the Entourage effect it's not about

1254
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:43,040
binding to to receptors it's about

1255
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,838
making you feel good and then consuming

1256
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:50,000
the drug that also makes you feel good

1257
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:52,279
so Aroma is important and I get that

1258
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,960
but like and and there's groups like

1259
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,640
abstracts you know who've done all this

1260
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,559
amazing research on like you know these

1261
00:51:55,639 --> 00:52:01,519
other components like you know Tropicana

1262
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,040
sulfur and stuff and like at some point

1263
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,119
I'd like to imagine we'll figure out

1264
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:08,079
which one of these things are

1265
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,480
contributing to an Entourage or an

1266
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:13,760
ensemble effect and which one of them

1267
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,760
are just things that smell good or

1268
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,160
interesting and then you can start like

1269
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,839
saying like Okay I want weed that does

1270
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:23,598
this in terms of effect but has this

1271
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:26,239
flavor but my experience breeding has

1272
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,359
been that if you go that route then you

1273
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:31,159
can't just layer effect on top of I mean

1274
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:34,199
layer flavor on top of effect without

1275
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:37,239
jeopardizing the effect so it's like

1276
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:40,480
that's why I've just stuck to one lane

1277
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:41,919
for 30 years now which is terpinolene

1278
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,480
dominant

1279
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,440
sage cultivars has been what I've been

1280
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,599
breeding for solely you know no matter

1281
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,920
what goes into it the thing that comes

1282
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,240
out of it is that's what I'm trying to

1283
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,240
do you know and even if it doesn't taste

1284
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,959
that good which it doesn't to a lot of

1285
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,118
people cuz Sage is like you know it's

1286
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,880
like a cooking Herb versus a dessert

1287
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,599
topping you know um but to me that is

1288
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,440
where the magic is and I've tried the

1289
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,760
other crosses that I've made that were

1290
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:15,119
more limine dominant that had more Kim

1291
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:19,480
dog you know upfront and you just lose

1292
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:22,318
the Nuance of the effect so I'm overly

1293
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,000
convicted to staying in that lane

1294
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:26,880
regardless of whether or not it makes a

1295
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,639
more sellable product but that's all Al

1296
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,880
because Sage works for me and it's my

1297
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,838
you know it's like my medicine so I

1298
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,440
don't want to screw it up no I I love

1299
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:38,279
that so much weight to stick to your own

1300
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,519
lane but also to as you said you know

1301
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,798
these things they're not they're not

1302
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:47,358
just easily switched up as sad as it is

1303
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:50,679
to say we're probably never going to be

1304
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:53,358
able to smoke some uh some tie that

1305
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:56,118
tastes like Kush mints and it still

1306
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,880
still feels like tie you know but let's

1307
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:02,039
let's whine back a bit like I wanted to

1308
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,760
ask you what was the progression from

1309
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:08,679
sort of being involved in the early Kush

1310
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:11,240
scene to linking up with Rob and really

1311
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:14,239
getting your feet wet in the legal World

1312
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:17,199
via you know starting the Consulting

1313
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:20,078
work like what was that transition

1314
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:22,480
like um well when I first came back to

1315
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,440
Cali and um I started you know making

1316
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,480
water hash and connecting with local

1317
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,119
Growers and stuff like that um prop 215

1318
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,719
was just getting rolling you know people

1319
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,519
were basically

1320
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:37,000
growing um with a medical card that gave

1321
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:39,880
them a certain amount of you know um

1322
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,599
comfort and then slowly dispensaries

1323
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,039
were popping up and as dispensaries

1324
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:47,519
popped up um I started working with

1325
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:50,239
dispensaries to basically design their

1326
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:53,920
Hydro facilities their indoor facilities

1327
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:56,159
and provide them with um genetics so I

1328
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,760
worked with a few here in La for quite a

1329
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:01,159
few two years training their staff you

1330
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,200
know being their director of

1331
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:07,318
cultivation um doing a little bit of

1332
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:10,719
breeding and selection and got kind of a

1333
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:15,639
a rep um locally I I developed a plant

1334
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:18,159
which was a 75% Sage 25% OG called Zeta

1335
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:20,078
and Zeta was really popular amongst some

1336
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:22,358
of the high-end dispensaries in La it

1337
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,240
was like at one point it was the you

1338
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:29,078
know most expensive flower sold in the

1339
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:31,679
county and I just decided after working

1340
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:33,200
with um after working with dispensaries

1341
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:36,199
for a while and stuff I decided just to

1342
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:40,078
keep it small and produce Boutique

1343
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:44,399
high-end um small scale flower and stay

1344
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:46,839
in my lane and um continued doing that

1345
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:52,559
up until around

1346
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:54,719
2017 and by then you could just feel um

1347
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,519
you could feel prohibition was fading

1348
00:55:54,719 --> 00:56:00,000
away and that there was a transition was

1349
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,838
about to happen um I knew you I was

1350
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,960
already working you know I've been on a

1351
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:06,880
a I'm on Advisory board with the uh

1352
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,358
National Institute of drug abuse study

1353
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,200
here in Los Angeles since

1354
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:13,920
2014 um so I got to see kind of the

1355
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:16,038
other side of the fence talking about

1356
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,400
cannabis and looking at legalization

1357
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,039
started you know talking with people in

1358
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,280
the drug policy

1359
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,480
Alliance um had friends that were in the

1360
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,319
industry who owned companies who are

1361
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,480
lobbying with the state and all this

1362
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:27,960
stuff and you could really see the

1363
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,599
writing on the wall that we're moving

1364
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,079
towards um an adult use market and that

1365
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:37,039
there was going to be a vote

1366
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:40,920
soon um so by 2015 I had started um

1367
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:43,720
bioeconomics group consulting with Rob

1368
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,480
and Rob Clark and um we saw that you

1369
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:49,239
know there was a big transition that was

1370
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:51,440
about to happen and we wanted to provide

1371
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,639
the kind of big picture cannabis side

1372
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,720
because everyone's so focused on you

1373
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:59,558
know the market you know we wanted to be

1374
00:56:55,719 --> 00:57:01,480
the the kind of cannabis side and um so

1375
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:02,920
for the first couple years we just kind

1376
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,519
of we had a company and we were just

1377
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,838
talking to people kind of seeing how

1378
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:09,038
things were going um and then I just

1379
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:12,000
decided to stop cultivating all together

1380
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:15,280
and focus 100% on Consulting in

1381
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,519
2017 and we started working you know

1382
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,280
with the goals of kind of working

1383
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:21,480
internationally we started working in

1384
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:23,798
Australia we got some groups licensed

1385
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,358
there and also worked on license

1386
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:27,519
applications and stuff like that

1387
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:30,519
throughout the US a bunch of different

1388
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:33,358
states and just decided that you know we

1389
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:35,719
could add a a kind of an ethnobotanical

1390
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:38,318
big picture approach to cannabis for all

1391
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:40,199
these emerging companies and it's been

1392
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,279
great you know we've we've had um we've

1393
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:46,000
got to work with a lot of really cool

1394
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:48,760
groups and continue to do so um I still

1395
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,280
think people kind of Overlook the big

1396
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,160
picture more than they should because

1397
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:56,280
they're also focused on making money in

1398
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:58,558
quick returns um that they often don't

1399
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,400
see you know that this is a big it's an

1400
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,880
arc that we're going through you know

1401
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,760
we're slowly transitioning out of

1402
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,160
prohibition and all these models will be

1403
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,119
changing over time and that's kind of

1404
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,920
what we wanted to do is just add like

1405
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:11,440
these perspectives that we often there's

1406
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,039
a lot of great cultivators there's great

1407
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,119
breeders there's great HVAC Engineers

1408
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,680
there's great people who do all the very

1409
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:20,880
specific things but sometimes the the

1410
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:24,798
right hand doesn't talk to the left or

1411
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,559
the CEO doesn't or the CFO specifically

1412
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,759
doesn't speak the same Lang language is

1413
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,400
the grower you know so we wanted to be

1414
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,640
that bridge um and that's worked really

1415
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,880
well you know that's been that's been

1416
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:40,239
kind of what what we do and um yeah so

1417
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,720
I've been solely a consultant for quite

1418
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,598
some time and continue to breed and

1419
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:46,558
continue to work with people and still

1420
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:50,599
I'm in California so I'm I we haven't

1421
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:52,839
worked um really in California um in

1422
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:56,359
terms of like Consulting we've we've

1423
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:59,119
done some licensing stuff um here but my

1424
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:00,798
and my family's here so it's like my my

1425
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,680
narrative is still very much about the

1426
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:04,679
California narrative but it's kind of

1427
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:06,598
weird because for the past eight years

1428
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:07,598
or so I've really worked in other states

1429
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:10,559
and other

1430
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:14,760
countries um but always you know it

1431
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:17,200
always comes back here you know to me um

1432
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,720
so yeah it's uh like I say it's been a

1433
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:20,279
real pleasure working with Rob over the

1434
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:21,879
years and we also you know when we

1435
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,319
started bioeconomics group and started

1436
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,720
Consulting we also started writing for

1437
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:27,960
cannabis business times and we've got a

1438
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:29,759
call on called um growing paints where

1439
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,720
we've written a good couple dozen

1440
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,000
articles kind of highlighting this

1441
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:37,159
transition and a big common themes that

1442
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,760
we talk about are um you know

1443
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:43,118
transitioning to agriculture uh land

1444
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:46,440
race cannabis um hops we've done a lot

1445
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:49,519
of quite a few articles on the kind of

1446
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:52,400
the relationship between um cannabis and

1447
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:55,000
hops in terms of um you know their their

1448
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,440
genetic relationship but also the the

1449
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,599
relationships of the industry The

1450
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,760
Branding the chemistry the aroma um

1451
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,280
stuff like that very fascinated in in

1452
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,119
that kind of co-

1453
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,039
relationship but um yeah no it's it's

1454
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:12,280
it's fun and I like you know as someone

1455
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:15,039
early on I've I came from um from the

1456
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:20,039
Cannabis culture you know from the

1457
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:22,839
Grassroots side and um we were back to

1458
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:25,680
the land you know hippies and you know

1459
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:27,920
lived in my early years off the grid you

1460
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,000
know with no power and no running water

1461
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,200
sometimes but over the years I've been

1462
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,159
fascinated more and more by science and

1463
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:37,000
you know science kind of drives my

1464
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:38,920
opinions in life I'm not a scientist I

1465
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,440
don't have a formal education in any way

1466
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:44,079
shape or form but I've had the privilege

1467
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,880
to work alongside people like Rob who

1468
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:51,318
are very much focused on you know using

1469
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:54,680
science as a tool and it's been kind of

1470
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:56,679
my um how science and the plant they

1471
01:00:54,679 --> 01:01:00,519
kind of they're intertwined for me so

1472
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:04,078
like I it's a big part of um my

1473
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:05,199
perspective and um yeah so that's that's

1474
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,000
yeah that's been the main thing with

1475
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:10,358
bioeconomics group we've have been you

1476
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,960
know just trying to to to be a bridge on

1477
01:01:10,358 --> 01:01:14,838
you know plant science and the

1478
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,720
industry

1479
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:19,639
um that's so awesome to hear you you

1480
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:21,159
touched on like four or five things I'm

1481
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:23,798
going to have to loop back to cuz

1482
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:25,318
there's so much good details in there I

1483
01:01:23,798 --> 01:01:27,199
guess the first thing that I wanted to

1484
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:29,838
quickly ask ask you before we move on is

1485
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,279
as I was writing these questions at some

1486
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,519
point I wondered I wonder what an

1487
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:37,240
average day for you looks like in your

1488
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:39,239
work you know like is it I'm sure

1489
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:41,199
there's a mixture like as much as

1490
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:43,558
everyone might dream that you're sort of

1491
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,399
like you know Indiana Jones at

1492
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:47,798
facilities like with a machete like

1493
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,720
hacking through crops and I'm sure

1494
01:01:47,798 --> 01:01:52,838
there's other facets to it how how would

1495
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:56,159
you describe your work you know is it a

1496
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:59,358
mixture of like theoretical and meeting

1497
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:01,000
and some practical work or what's the

1498
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:02,639
division of labor like between you and

1499
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,440
Rob are you together most of the time

1500
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,598
you sort of tackling projects

1501
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:09,278
individually and then you collaborate

1502
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:12,680
sort of afterwards and bounce ideas off

1503
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:14,519
each other um well I have to say

1504
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:16,480
unfortunately I'd love to I do have a

1505
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:19,719
really cool Indiana Jones hat and I'd

1506
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,719
love to be um running through Fields

1507
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:23,278
more than I do but I spend way too much

1508
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:26,358
time way more time than I'd like in

1509
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:29,239
front of a laptop um

1510
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:31,719
as uh you know as in the new modern

1511
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:34,038
world that's the way we interface with

1512
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:36,480
our clients and Rob has been living in

1513
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:38,359
Sweden for the past few years so we

1514
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,000
generally in the morning we wake up and

1515
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:44,798
you know I my morning his late afternoon

1516
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:47,798
early evening we chat for a while um we

1517
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:50,719
do lots of Zoom far too many Zoom calls

1518
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:52,920
and lots of different um time zones

1519
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:55,480
around the world so it's always a

1520
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,318
challenge trying to you know decide who

1521
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,519
gets to wake up at 6:00 a.m. and who or

1522
01:02:57,318 --> 01:03:02,920
who has to take a call at 11:00 p.m. and

1523
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:04,960
try to be sharp um I do I had I've had

1524
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,358
clients I had a client in Minnesota for

1525
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,358
a number of years and that was more of

1526
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:11,199
an on-site um role where I'd be there

1527
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,400
probably about a week out of every month

1528
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,639
just you know helping with the facility

1529
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,599
design and hiring staff and training

1530
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:21,960
staff and stuff like that um but for the

1531
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:24,960
most part yeah and we do I do a lot of

1532
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,639
and I still um spend a good amount of

1533
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,679
time here in California with the

1534
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:30,879
community here so we have relationships

1535
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:33,038
with different groups like we do with

1536
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,119
the guys at Hayes Valley in Watsonville

1537
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,799
who are running this trials for us so

1538
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,519
I'm frequently up there um checking

1539
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:41,838
things out with them and I try to visit

1540
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,440
as many farms as possible just to keep

1541
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:46,318
my hands on the plant um and I have a

1542
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:49,278
catalog of plants that I have to manage

1543
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:52,318
myself which is challenging because I

1544
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:55,159
try to keep as many things alive as

1545
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:57,480
possible without over you know like like

1546
01:03:55,159 --> 01:04:00,679
my I still have a 30-year-old Sage cavar

1547
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,719
that I haven't flowered it in years but

1548
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:05,679
I just keep it alive and veg over and

1549
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:08,159
over and over again so I've got about 15

1550
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:10,879
to 18 different um cultivars that I'm

1551
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:14,159
perpetually vegging just uh back to that

1552
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,278
whole plant guy like I don't do it at

1553
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:19,759
for my consulting company I don't do it

1554
01:04:17,278 --> 01:04:23,079
as a business I just do it as a passion

1555
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,359
because I love plants um but I should

1556
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:27,680
say actually that's not true some of

1557
01:04:24,358 --> 01:04:29,480
those a couple of those plants are um we

1558
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,838
actually one thing that we have done

1559
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,639
over the past few years is we've got a

1560
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:38,078
um a a United States plant patent on one

1561
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:39,358
cultivar um which is interesting because

1562
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,359
we also work with a group called

1563
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:44,159
breeders best which is a plant IP

1564
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:47,598
company um run by Dale Hunt who's an

1565
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:50,440
amazing guy um and so we have a plant

1566
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,039
patent and we also have a upov plant

1567
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,798
patent um which is more of an

1568
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:55,920
International Plant variety protection

1569
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:58,278
system so we've been dabbling a little

1570
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,079
bit in that in trying to in plant

1571
01:04:58,278 --> 01:05:03,679
licensing so getting full protection for

1572
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:06,160
a plant not just a hypothetical

1573
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:09,159
protection but like full legal plant

1574
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:12,159
protection and um one of those varieties

1575
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:13,759
has been in production with SRA the

1576
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:17,159
tissue culture and Distribution Company

1577
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:19,400
in Canada and they sell and license that

1578
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:21,719
Variety in multiple countries around the

1579
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:25,079
world um so that's cool it's kind of an

1580
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:27,598
exercise of like you know breed a plant

1581
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:29,680
bring it to to you know breed a plant

1582
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,480
get IP on that plant bring it to the

1583
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:33,399
international market distribute that

1584
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,159
plant cultivate it around the world kind

1585
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,639
of thing just as a back to that exercise

1586
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:40,759
of like what would a do what what how do

1587
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:42,358
you treat other plants if you want to

1588
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,559
treat cannabis the way you treat apples

1589
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:46,838
or grapes or tomatoes or

1590
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:50,079
something and like I mean while we're on

1591
01:05:46,838 --> 01:05:52,239
the topic of Pat patents quickly what

1592
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,599
what do you think will be the future of

1593
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:56,598
patents in the sort of global cannabis

1594
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,880
landscape because

1595
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:00,680
I I want I guess the only thing I really

1596
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,039
wonder about is obviously what you're

1597
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:05,239
describing is like you can completely

1598
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,880
understand why it's being used I think

1599
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:11,038
sometimes people get very worried about

1600
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:14,160
this idea like someone is somehow able

1601
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:16,400
to patent some very foundational genetic

1602
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:18,759
breeding block and then there's like

1603
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,358
flow on repercussions for like all other

1604
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,319
genetics or something to that effect do

1605
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,679
you have any concerns about that or do

1606
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:28,798
you think that's like it's not a reality

1607
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:30,960
no that's totally a reality I'm not

1608
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:33,798
concerned about it in terms of how it's

1609
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,679
going to impact the gene pool as much is

1610
01:06:33,798 --> 01:06:37,679
it how it could impact the market but

1611
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:39,519
it's the big difference there is the

1612
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:42,199
difference between an individual plant

1613
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:44,519
patent and a Utility Patent an

1614
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:48,118
individual plant patent is a patent on

1615
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:50,719
one thing it's one piece of art it's one

1616
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:52,440
plant that's it it doesn't overlap into

1617
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:55,159
anybody else's plants and their plants

1618
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,119
don't overlap into you it's this plant

1619
01:06:55,159 --> 01:07:00,879
is my plant that I created and it's

1620
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:02,400
Unique and novel because of X Y and Z

1621
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,278
that's very different and it doesn't

1622
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,480
have a lot of power to you know but a

1623
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:09,838
Utility Patent utility patents can be

1624
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:12,240
quite broad so you could in theory

1625
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,719
create utility patents that and some

1626
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:18,798
have questioned some in previous patents

1627
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:20,959
that could be broad enough to to um you

1628
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:23,838
know impinge on other

1629
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,519
people's um prior art or what they might

1630
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:27,358
assume as prior art so that's those

1631
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:28,880
those are two really big differences and

1632
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,199
I think that's the main thing that

1633
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,880
people need to understand is that one is

1634
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,318
about just an individual plant it's

1635
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,160
literally holding a clone and saying I'm

1636
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:38,960
just telling the world this is mine and

1637
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:41,000
I'm the only one who made it and I'm the

1638
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,199
only one who can have it unless I agree

1639
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,639
to share it with you that's a very

1640
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:48,639
simple kind of just legal protection

1641
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:51,358
utility patents are think of it more of

1642
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:53,199
as a class with overlapping I have

1643
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,078
patented things that have these

1644
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:57,558
attributes whether it's the chemistry or

1645
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:00,798
the ology or whatever and then that

1646
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:02,680
could be interpreted far more broad um

1647
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:06,119
but an individual plant patent is just

1648
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:09,078
an individual plant that's it and and

1649
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:13,160
that's that's the main thing but to me

1650
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:15,039
in terms of patents um they're valuable

1651
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:16,679
and but it comes back to this diversity

1652
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,079
in the supply chain thing they're only

1653
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:21,399
as valuable as they are for one

1654
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:23,679
enforceable and also they're only

1655
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:26,238
valuable if they occupy a portion of the

1656
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,640
market right like if you have a patent

1657
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:31,079
on cotton candy grapes and cotton candy

1658
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:34,239
grapes are 10% of the market then you

1659
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:36,119
have a really powerful tool there right

1660
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,278
but if you have a p patent on a plant

1661
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:40,000
that only has a thousandth of a

1662
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:43,480
thousandth of a percent of the

1663
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,600
market whether it's patented or not is

1664
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:49,559
kind of irrelevant you know

1665
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:52,120
so yes patents are valuable yes they're

1666
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:54,719
good tools and yes IP is important but

1667
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:57,079
it's not the same as other crops just

1668
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,679
because of the sheer your numbers and

1669
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:01,719
the real thing that makes patents less

1670
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,440
valuable or less utility is is that you

1671
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:06,719
don't have a tradem markable name to

1672
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:12,599
attach to that patent application or

1673
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:14,560
that patent number so if I if I breed um

1674
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:18,279
honey crisp

1675
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:20,839
apples but it's just a patent X1

1676
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:24,359
3251 that's doesn't have any bearing in

1677
01:09:20,838 --> 01:09:26,359
Commerce right honey crisp is the brand

1678
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:29,239
so honey crisp the trademark is what has

1679
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:33,279
the value the trademark attached to a PL

1680
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:36,039
a patent is the defendable thing so

1681
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,759
right now in the US anybody can call any

1682
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:41,679
plant anything they want whether it's

1683
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:44,039
patented or not so anyone who has Kim

1684
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,319
can call it Kim gelato they can call it

1685
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:49,519
gelato there's nothing that anybody can

1686
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:51,319
do about it and that creates the

1687
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,520
conflict and that creates the noise and

1688
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:54,719
that creates the

1689
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:56,560
inconsistency and really screws the

1690
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,198
consumer obviously because they're not

1691
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,159
getting a honey crisp apple when they

1692
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:03,039
buy one they could be getting something

1693
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:04,639
totally different um so that's the kind

1694
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:08,000
of weird part that we're in where the

1695
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,440
USP the US PTO will acknowledge the

1696
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,279
patent but the Trademark Office won't

1697
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:16,519
give a name to that patent which gives

1698
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:18,399
it a life in Commerce because trademarks

1699
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:21,120
only work for interstate commerce that's

1700
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:24,759
where they are it's a trade mark a mark

1701
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:29,039
you know so um it's a weird a weird

1702
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:31,719
space to be in but if you flash back 30

1703
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:35,519
years and say well what if Kim dog was a

1704
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:37,679
patented plant with the trademark name

1705
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:41,600
and OG Kush was a patented plant with a

1706
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:43,880
trademark name those two clones only or

1707
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,400
sour diesel or blue dream or whatever

1708
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,880
all of those plants those are all

1709
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:49,639
multi-billion dollar plants in terms of

1710
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:53,000
their value and what they brought to the

1711
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:55,840
market so and does someone deserve to

1712
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,319
own it I mean it depends it depends on

1713
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,960
what you consider deserves or owns or

1714
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:03,479
what but um you know as far as IP works

1715
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,520
if you planted if you took the seed and

1716
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:07,519
it was your seed and you put it in the

1717
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:11,960
ground and it made a new plant then

1718
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:14,239
that's your new plant you know um so it

1719
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,319
is a tool and I think it just like all

1720
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:19,000
the other tools in a it deserves to be

1721
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,279
there but it isn't necessarily what

1722
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,198
people think it is or doesn't

1723
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:26,119
necessarily have the utility that people

1724
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:28,000
think it might have or could

1725
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:29,359
um it's just different than other

1726
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,920
products I mean if there's just

1727
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:33,439
thousands and thousands of cultiv bars

1728
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,800
but there are p i mean there are I mean

1729
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,279
there's look at look at Lemon Cherry

1730
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,119
gelato for instance I mean these are

1731
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,559
these are these are new varieties had

1732
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:43,039
they been patented had they been

1733
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,239
trademarked they would be you know

1734
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:46,800
they'd be the varieties that the

1735
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:49,599
Monsanto would be trying to turn into

1736
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,679
you know the the new you know red

1737
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:56,079
delicious because they can protect it

1738
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:58,239
and they can own it you know so we we

1739
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:01,000
still have a long way to go a long long

1740
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:02,759
way to go yeah look well that's that's

1741
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
reassuring to hear that really like you

1742
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,840
know it's just for individual

1743
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,198
strains before we jumped into that one

1744
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,440
you mentioned that you know you'd done

1745
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:13,759
some writing for cannabis business times

1746
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:15,839
and there's a plethora of incredible

1747
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,159
articles on there I think I I think

1748
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,560
there was like 60 plus or something huge

1749
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,119
amount of awesome information there but

1750
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,320
as you touched on there was some cool

1751
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:25,920
ones you'd written about hops I wanted

1752
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,039
to ask you

1753
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,679
what do you think are some of maybe the

1754
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:32,198
similarities that people aren't aware of

1755
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,119
between like obviously they're related

1756
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:36,879
but in what ways are they sort of more

1757
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:39,039
similar than different and is there any

1758
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,920
Tech that gets used in The Hop industry

1759
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,359
that might make its way to cannabis in

1760
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,679
your

1761
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:48,679
mind yes and vice versa um well they're

1762
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:51,880
really similar in that they're they're

1763
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:53,480
both canaba they're related and likely

1764
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,199
came from you know the

1765
01:12:53,479 --> 01:12:58,678
same um

1766
01:12:56,198 --> 01:13:00,719
ancestor um and they have a very similar

1767
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:03,760
Aroma profile you know the dominant I

1768
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:07,920
mean mine kopine and humulene are the

1769
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:10,920
three dominant tpes and hops and kopine

1770
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,480
and mine are definitely like ubiquitous

1771
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:15,840
and cannabis and oddly enough the two

1772
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:21,279
that seem to have some type of receptor

1773
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:24,960
Affinity um and other than that they're

1774
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:27,759
not that similar you know um because you

1775
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,560
know hops is a perennial and it doesn't

1776
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,679
have all these drugs but the plants are

1777
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,440
similar I mean they they both have they

1778
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:36,158
both create um they have glands that

1779
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:39,719
produce active

1780
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:42,960
ingredients um we we found this

1781
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:44,920
interesting relationship I mean for one

1782
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,880
it was one of our discussions was just

1783
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:50,319
on like I I've always fascinated with

1784
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:52,159
the the chemical similarities and um but

1785
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:54,519
also The Branding similarities and the

1786
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:56,719
co-relationship between you know

1787
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,800
California a craft beer in California

1788
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:01,800
Cannabis I think is an interesting story

1789
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,480
and we could go deep dive into that but

1790
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:07,800
um I'll I'll tell you one thing that was

1791
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:09,959
fascinating um early on um reading this

1792
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:13,320
book I think it's called for the love of

1793
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:15,679
hops um we realize that there's just a

1794
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:17,920
wealth of of um research that's been

1795
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:20,600
done on Hop's

1796
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:25,119
Aroma because they can for years and

1797
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:27,800
they have so we saw in this one book um

1798
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:30,238
that hops have thol for instance and we

1799
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,239
wrote in like 2018 we wrote just kind of

1800
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:33,678
in passing this kind of a cute little

1801
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:37,198
thing about oh you know the thing that

1802
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:38,920
makes hop skunky was Styles but no one

1803
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:41,238
had identified that in cannabis yet

1804
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,920
because no one had done the research but

1805
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:45,079
it was kind of like we were just trying

1806
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,520
to draw these comparisons of like well

1807
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:52,880
if it's in this plant maybe it's in this

1808
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:55,320
plant too you know and um so and I think

1809
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,639
that's really interesting because we we

1810
01:14:55,319 --> 01:15:00,279
don't know you know and we don't know

1811
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:02,719
what you know like for instance I

1812
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:05,639
mean people still talk about like eating

1813
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:07,319
mangos and black pepper and attenuating

1814
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:10,000
or you know modulating the effects of

1815
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:12,639
THC and stuff and and

1816
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,000
modern beer IPA movement definitely

1817
01:15:12,639 --> 01:15:18,159
turned up the volume on Aroma and flavor

1818
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,920
you know with dry hopping and these new

1819
01:15:18,158 --> 01:15:23,039
ipas and hazies where all of a sudden

1820
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,039
you're getting all of these new notes in

1821
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:26,840
beer that weren't there before similar

1822
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:30,399
to cannabis right at the same time when

1823
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:32,440
fresh cannabis is a new thing um and

1824
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:34,479
these dank notes and these like kind of

1825
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:36,799
skunky notes that the beer industry

1826
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:38,439
starts kind of championing this kind of

1827
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,880
relationship with cannabis saying like

1828
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:43,039
no it's actually kind of cool that it

1829
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:46,039
smells like weed and then little little

1830
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:48,198
nods in that direction on the um the

1831
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:50,359
marketing and branding on the packages

1832
01:15:48,198 --> 01:15:53,158
and stuff like that just you know

1833
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:56,198
there's a brand called Bubble stash you

1834
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:59,319
know um and you know and then yakam ma

1835
01:15:56,198 --> 01:16:02,158
Chief hops is like doing cryo hops which

1836
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:04,799
is like their freeze-dried cryo Keef

1837
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:07,039
type thing you know so like there's a

1838
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,520
lot of Co you know in the whole hop the

1839
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:11,679
whole IPA World here in California from

1840
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,600
Sierra Nevada Brewery or really started

1841
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:17,039
with Anchor Steam and then like SI

1842
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,159
Nevada and then Lanas these big brands

1843
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:22,079
that started it they were all drenched

1844
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:24,319
in cannabis culture and growing regions

1845
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:27,279
and you know the S out Nevada Foothills

1846
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:29,439
and in Marine County and like it's been

1847
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:32,238
a thing like there's been a there's been

1848
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:34,479
a a story of of this kind of emerging

1849
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:38,158
new Craft Beer World and this new

1850
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:40,238
emerging cannabis thing um and then when

1851
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:43,319
you see companies like abstracts getting

1852
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:46,359
so deep into the relationship between

1853
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:49,238
these Aroma profiles and how they you

1854
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:50,719
know they they don't just share in the

1855
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:53,279
formulation but they share in the

1856
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:56,920
marketing and the culture and the whole

1857
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:59,639
thing I think it's it's super cool it's

1858
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:03,000
it's really interesting that it's like

1859
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:04,920
um it's plant geek stuff it's like plant

1860
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,520
geek in your can you know what I mean

1861
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:09,359
like when did like when did like I love

1862
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,639
when I buy a beer now and it talks about

1863
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:14,439
the plants that are in the can right

1864
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:16,600
it's got like four different hop varial

1865
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:17,960
on the label it's like saying you know

1866
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,159
what hop varieties they have and I'm

1867
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,920
like dude this is cool it's like it's

1868
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:25,439
not just weed it's not just beer you

1869
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:28,079
know it's plants and it's cool that they

1870
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:31,039
evolved together you know and then they

1871
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:33,439
diverg to become these you know most

1872
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:36,000
common you know enjoyed substances you

1873
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:38,039
know um so it's a it's just an

1874
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,238
interesting relationship that we we've

1875
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:42,800
liked exploring and and and I enjoy a

1876
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:45,759
good beer and I enjoy a good joint so

1877
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:48,920
it's like they go well

1878
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:51,560
together oh Amen to that I I love that

1879
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:54,440
and while we're on sort of the topic of

1880
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:56,719
Aromas in general you know another

1881
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:59,359
article cool that I saw from you guys

1882
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:02,399
was sort of talking about the volatile

1883
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:04,479
and and somewhat costic nature of Turin

1884
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,759
and this was one that resonated with me

1885
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:08,638
because I I think back many years ago I

1886
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:12,440
I worked as a chemist for a little bit

1887
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:14,880
and I saw tpin used as like solvents in

1888
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:16,759
chemical reactions and and I think most

1889
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,039
people have seen that you know they can

1890
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,840
eat through rubber to a certain

1891
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:23,880
extent I guess I want to know you know

1892
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,159
without without uh trying to be too

1893
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,319
hyperbolic and tongue and cheek you know

1894
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:29,559
are we are we subtly killing ourselves

1895
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,479
for the turp

1896
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:35,679
drip I hey you know Rob always says not

1897
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:37,359
all Turpin are good tpin and like we

1898
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:39,760
don't know what contributes to the

1899
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:42,399
effect and what's just a good aroma and

1900
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,560
we've seen I mean you can drop a rubber

1901
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,198
band in a in an ounce of weed and

1902
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,440
certain varieties will eat that rubber

1903
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:52,519
band in like a few weeks it's all

1904
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:55,759
crackled and funky and we really don't

1905
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,920
have we know we um

1906
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,400
we have

1907
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,679
anecdotal information that says cannabis

1908
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:04,158
is safe to consume for a long long long

1909
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:07,000
time but we haven't been consuming it

1910
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:09,359
this way and this turpy and whatever all

1911
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,439
the other things are right like the

1912
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:15,799
fresh volumes of fresh you know rosin

1913
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:17,559
and BHO and there's an effect right

1914
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:20,360
there's turpy weed feels different on

1915
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:22,600
your lungs and it does it's new it's a

1916
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:24,319
new thing hash cultures volatilized

1917
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:27,679
those turps so heavily before it was

1918
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:29,039
consumed assumed um you know I remember

1919
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:32,960
uh hearing stories about when they

1920
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:36,679
switched to Modern um modern um seed in

1921
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:39,119
Morocco and they're exporting um bricks

1922
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:40,399
of hash in the ship holes and they would

1923
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:42,559
hear this

1924
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:45,359
explode they go down the hole and the

1925
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,920
bags were exploding Under Pressure

1926
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:49,439
because they are sealed airtight and the

1927
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:52,039
turps are off gassing and they're like

1928
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:55,599
popping you know because no one's done

1929
01:19:52,039 --> 01:19:58,359
this before it's new so it is a new area

1930
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,400
and I don't not to you know not to be a

1931
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:03,839
skeptic or raise caution so much but it

1932
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:06,359
is new let's just all agree that and and

1933
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,159
the amount you know in and you know then

1934
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:09,880
people are you know adding TPS and you

1935
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:12,719
know there's Botanical turps and there's

1936
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:15,000
just sprayed on weed and all this stuff

1937
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:18,719
it is it's new grounds let's just say

1938
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,359
that um so I I am sometimes cautious

1939
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:24,119
about you know whether or not we should

1940
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:28,119
be consuming so much tpin and what

1941
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:30,238
effect it does have on our body but um

1942
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:31,599
I'm not too worried about it you know I

1943
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:33,559
mean it's not it's not going to stop me

1944
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,639
from consuming but I do just think it's

1945
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,000
always you know the devils in the

1946
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:40,520
details and we should always look really

1947
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,840
careful into public safety stuff and not

1948
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:44,760
just assume because you know we've done

1949
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,639
it in the past that the way we do it in

1950
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:50,520
the future is the right way to do it and

1951
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:52,440
you know um but also just it just comes

1952
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:56,120
down back to that solvent thing of like

1953
01:20:52,439 --> 01:20:58,719
TPS it's like you you know

1954
01:20:56,119 --> 01:21:00,559
um when people started like consuming

1955
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,319
masses amount of turps it's like there

1956
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,120
was a little bit of a solvent huffing

1957
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:06,519
kind of weird thing like are we just

1958
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:09,960
kind of huffing

1959
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:11,840
things you know I don't know I mean and

1960
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,639
I'm not a big Dabber I don't dab a lot

1961
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,719
but I know that when I do dab I feel it

1962
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:18,159
in my lungs in a very different way than

1963
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:21,639
than dry flower smoke or hash smoke it's

1964
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:24,039
like a a different feeling um and I know

1965
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:26,359
lyine you know just as a solvent is just

1966
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:29,399
really really powerful and I I do

1967
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:31,519
remember when when they first I I um had

1968
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:33,799
some friends that were that um the

1969
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:39,560
workshop when they first did the

1970
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:41,320
um um the uh uh first distillate in

1971
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,000
California um when they first started

1972
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:46,000
making distillate you know 10 years or

1973
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,000
so ago 10 11 years ago and the first

1974
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,719
vape pens that were made using

1975
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:54,119
distillate and Botanical turps I was a

1976
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:55,760
total guinea pig where they'd make up

1977
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:57,760
all kinds different batches and like

1978
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,480
here try this one try that one and I

1979
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,639
tell you some of them were like costic

1980
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:04,238
and dangerous I be like dude don't don't

1981
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:07,760
do that to me again you know like just

1982
01:22:04,238 --> 01:22:09,799
really like Whoa man you know because we

1983
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,280
didn't know and like we didn't know what

1984
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:15,159
the safe limits are and some I remember

1985
01:22:12,279 --> 01:22:19,639
at one time one group had these pens

1986
01:22:15,158 --> 01:22:20,839
that were um they were like 80% THC and

1987
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:23,400
then they just realized they could just

1988
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:25,119
keep cutting it down with more and more

1989
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:27,960
TPS to the point where it was majority

1990
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:30,000
turps and minority THC which is like you

1991
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,960
wouldn't see that today right but they

1992
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,600
were doing it just because they could

1993
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:35,359
and people were still getting high

1994
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:39,760
enough off of a vape pen that was only

1995
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:41,880
40 50% THC right so the rest was just

1996
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:45,360
all this heavy duty stuff I was like

1997
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:49,880
dude so now you really are like we're

1998
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:52,439
huffing you know it's crazy yeah yeah

1999
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:54,639
look gosh it's um it's something I don't

2000
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:56,919
want to explore but you're right you

2001
01:22:54,639 --> 01:23:00,520
know those early days and and you know

2002
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:03,079
we all collectively cringe at the the

2003
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,120
questionable dab we've done of uh butane

2004
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:08,119
soup I'm I'm sure we've all got a few

2005
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:09,800
regrets there oh yeah um just to touch

2006
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:11,559
on something that you mentioned a bit

2007
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,119
earlier again you touched on so many

2008
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,719
good points like a few points back that

2009
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,079
we just got to keep looping back you

2010
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:19,319
mentioned breeders best I didn't know

2011
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:22,000
too much about this until I started

2012
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:24,759
doing some preparation for our chat and

2013
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,039
uh I think you really need to to give us

2014
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,159
the low down you know it's uh it seems

2015
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:30,760
like a cool initiative um how would you

2016
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:31,638
explain breeders best for anyone who's

2017
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,920
not

2018
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:36,600
familiar yeah breeders best is a company

2019
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:40,399
founded by Dale Hunt Dale Hunt is an IP

2020
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:45,760
attorney but he's also a plant scientist

2021
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:48,479
um and he had the idea that you could

2022
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,679
create IP for plants in a way similar to

2023
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:52,678
other crops because he's worked with

2024
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:55,279
other crops for a lot of years and um we

2025
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:59,079
also work with Dr Ethan Russo

2026
01:23:55,279 --> 01:24:01,399
um and Nisha Whitley and Rob Clark and a

2027
01:23:59,079 --> 01:24:03,399
few others over time and we basically

2028
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:07,519
started just looking at a lot of

2029
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:10,559
different um unique cannabis cultivars

2030
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:13,120
that had unique properties um mostly you

2031
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,760
know um a lot of like minor canono and

2032
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:17,719
stuff like that and seeing that if there

2033
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,119
was like the opportunity to create IP

2034
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:21,239
and create these relationships with

2035
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,719
farmers and help them get licensing

2036
01:24:21,238 --> 01:24:27,839
agreements um it's been really awesome

2037
01:24:23,719 --> 01:24:29,679
it's been a interesting um journey and

2038
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,840
like there's the challenges around IP

2039
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:33,760
are kind of like kind of what I

2040
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:36,639
highlighted earlier there's it's hard to

2041
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:39,440
create market dynamics or Market you

2042
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:41,840
know um to penetrate the market so it's

2043
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:45,279
hard for Growers any Growers with any

2044
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:48,039
cultivars but some of these guys have

2045
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:50,759
developed some amazing genetics I mean I

2046
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:52,039
guess the one group that I would um

2047
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,800
highlight that we've worked with at

2048
01:24:52,039 --> 01:24:57,000
breeders best is Emerald Spirit

2049
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:59,480
botanical who um have thcv cultivars

2050
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,679
that they developed which are pretty

2051
01:24:59,479 --> 01:25:03,638
amazing and have won loads of awards

2052
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:06,239
anald cups and California State Fair

2053
01:25:03,639 --> 01:25:09,000
cups and just have had a huge response

2054
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:13,198
from consumers and are truly something

2055
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,960
new and different that deserve to have

2056
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:18,919
um all the protections that another

2057
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,560
plant would have in the market so um

2058
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:23,399
yeah so we basically you know acquire IP

2059
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:26,280
for groups and help them enter in

2060
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:28,920
license agreements and stuff like that

2061
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:30,519
um it's been it's been wild and um you

2062
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,880
know working with Dale and working with

2063
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:36,440
Ethan working with Rob is has been

2064
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:41,600
really really um amazing big big big

2065
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:43,279
brain guys you know so yeah that's

2066
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,039
that's really cool and when I took a

2067
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:48,359
look through the site the uh the catalog

2068
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:50,679
of some of the strains on there that are

2069
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:53,118
offered it's it's really unique you know

2070
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:54,760
some of your work popping its head up in

2071
01:25:53,118 --> 01:25:56,559
amongst it all

2072
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:59,159
uh i' I'd love to hear what's some of

2073
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,320
the cool stuff in there that maybe is a

2074
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:04,158
bit off the Beaten Track people less

2075
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:06,759
familiar with um well yeah the pink

2076
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:11,279
boost got us for sure and also um

2077
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:13,119
there's a a wakan wise which is a um

2078
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:14,279
also a tpine dominant variety but it's

2079
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:18,719
also high in

2080
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:20,840
CBG um you know Ethan has always been

2081
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,480
you know trying to get people to look at

2082
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,880
the bigger picture of cannabis and also

2083
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:26,319
help to find those like create those

2084
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,800
lanes for

2085
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:32,719
consumers um and thcv has been one of

2086
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:35,239
them and CBG lately has been a big um

2087
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:39,600
he's done some double blind studies on

2088
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:42,118
CBG efficacy and um you know it's kind

2089
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,239
of weird maybe maybe because of CBD like

2090
01:26:42,118 --> 01:26:46,238
CBD created this whole new world but

2091
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:48,919
then it didn't really succeed as much as

2092
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:50,519
it could have or should have in the

2093
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,158
market and kind of Tanked it went from

2094
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:56,600
you know an

2095
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:59,719
$80,000 uh uh uh kilo THC isolate down

2096
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:02,360
to you know $250 or whatever it is now

2097
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:06,840
but these other minor canabo you know

2098
01:27:02,359 --> 01:27:09,198
they have a role you know CBG thcv CBN

2099
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,639
CBC all these things they're like once

2100
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:14,198
we get to the real the place that we're

2101
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:17,000
all kind of trying to go I think

2102
01:27:14,198 --> 01:27:19,439
everything is relevant you know and how

2103
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,920
many lanes cannabis needs to be that's

2104
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,359
that's a hard question to ask because

2105
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:25,359
it's so chemically complex but if we

2106
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:28,158
actually really started looking at it

2107
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:31,039
medically and therapeutically then we

2108
01:27:28,158 --> 01:27:33,279
would probably find that all these other

2109
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:36,359
um cultivars and all these other chimo

2110
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:38,519
bars are way more relevant than people

2111
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:40,158
think they are you know because we're

2112
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,320
right now it's just about weed that gets

2113
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:44,759
you high or weed that tastes good it's

2114
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:47,399
not about the supplement side or the

2115
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:49,440
lifestyle Improvement or the relief from

2116
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:51,839
pain and suffering that cannabis brings

2117
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:53,238
to a lot of people I mean it's it's it's

2118
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,119
kind of a weird thing that you know

2119
01:27:53,238 --> 01:27:57,879
medical was a gate way towards adult use

2120
01:27:56,118 --> 01:28:00,198
but then medical got kind of kicked to

2121
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,840
the curb along the way you know like

2122
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:04,359
there's this assumption that people use

2123
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:06,520
their sick kids and cancer and AIDS to

2124
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:08,679
to make cannabis legal which is

2125
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:11,440
true but let's not forget that people

2126
01:28:08,679 --> 01:28:14,199
had sick kid and cancer and AIDS right

2127
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:16,638
and they still need medicine as well so

2128
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:19,319
there there's a there's a a whole bunch

2129
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:21,960
of opportunity around breeding and

2130
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:24,840
products and and Brands and all that

2131
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:27,760
stuff around just Wellness

2132
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,000
um and you know that's you know like

2133
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,920
like the pink boost goddess and that

2134
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,039
variety really speaks to that in a big

2135
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:36,199
way um you know that what do you want

2136
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:38,960
cannabis to be for you you know and the

2137
01:28:36,198 --> 01:28:43,118
fact that it's a a low potency thcv

2138
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:46,920
variety that wins Awards based off of

2139
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:48,839
its just being flower you know people

2140
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,600
aren't judging it off of anything else

2141
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:54,560
it's like this was you know um an

2142
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:57,199
award-winning variety so um it goes to

2143
01:28:54,560 --> 01:29:01,840
show that you know you can create new

2144
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:03,879
lanes for cannabis if it's done right um

2145
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,600
but it's yeah once again it's just it's

2146
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,520
so complicated it's so chemically

2147
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,079
diverse that it's just hard to figure

2148
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:12,239
out how many lanes you need you know

2149
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,880
because you could conceivably create you

2150
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:18,238
know Lanes based off of cannaboids and

2151
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,920
Aroma profiles and just have you know I

2152
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:22,959
mean I mean there's 7,000 different

2153
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:25,440
clones of Pon Noir someone told me once

2154
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:28,198
like different different mutations of

2155
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:33,238
one clone that still fall under the

2156
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:36,000
class of Pino you know so it's like I

2157
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:39,839
mean it can get pretty nutty so if we

2158
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:43,079
had like CBG or thcv varieties with the

2159
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:46,000
full spectrum of Aroma or do we have you

2160
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:48,639
know the um Aroma profiles with the full

2161
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,719
spectrum of canabo I mean it's

2162
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:52,279
just it's kind of like when you start

2163
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,039
look crunching the numbers on the data

2164
01:29:52,279 --> 01:29:57,679
in terms of how many different off

2165
01:29:54,039 --> 01:30:00,840
offerings you could have from this one

2166
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:03,440
genus it's it's insane and and back to

2167
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:04,239
the Beer thing um we're seeing that now

2168
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:07,158
in

2169
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:09,238
hops where you know beer used to taste

2170
01:30:07,158 --> 01:30:11,279
like beer and now beer has all these

2171
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:12,759
tropical notes and these gassy notes and

2172
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:14,118
these fruity notes and these cereal

2173
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,560
notes and all these things because we've

2174
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:18,158
learned how to manipulate H Aroma in

2175
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,080
such a different way that now modern

2176
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:22,319
beer doesn't taste like it used to that

2177
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:26,000
we've just taken a whole different

2178
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:27,840
approach to like well the you know what

2179
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,079
what are the limitations of what you can

2180
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:33,279
do um and that's once again just aroma

2181
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:35,439
so add Aroma and effect together and

2182
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:39,960
it's just like a you

2183
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:41,960
know just yeah it's a it's a day to

2184
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,800
nightmare yeah no look it's so

2185
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:46,359
interesting you say that about the way

2186
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:49,840
it's changed and and the fact you

2187
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:51,880
reference the the pink boost I I've been

2188
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:56,079
trying to describe this one to people

2189
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:58,359
for years cuz I when was it

2190
01:30:56,079 --> 01:31:01,079
2022 I think last time I was in the

2191
01:30:58,359 --> 01:31:05,079
states I I met up with bod and he gave

2192
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:08,000
me a jar of the pink boost um and I

2193
01:31:05,079 --> 01:31:10,519
wasn't I didn't know what to expect and

2194
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,719
easily one of the most memorable flowers

2195
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:15,320
I've I've ever Vaped and and I

2196
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:17,279
remembered like thinking to myself like

2197
01:31:15,319 --> 01:31:19,599
oh I get why they call it pink boost

2198
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:21,519
like the the pistols are pink and it

2199
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,520
boosts you like it's like this so

2200
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,320
stimulating but because I only ever

2201
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,239
tried to that one time I've like

2202
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:29,238
struggled to articulate it any better

2203
01:31:27,238 --> 01:31:31,198
than like it was awesome flower and it

2204
01:31:29,238 --> 01:31:33,678
felt very uplifting how would you

2205
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:37,039
describe it for people who haven't had a

2206
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:38,960
chance to try it um I mean I think you

2207
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:40,960
pretty much nailed it I mean to me

2208
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,480
perfectly to be perfectly honest because

2209
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,800
I've always got to be honest when we're

2210
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:47,678
talking about the

2211
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:51,800
plants um I'm not sure how

2212
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:54,399
I experience um these minor canono um

2213
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:56,360
one: ones and two to ones and stuff much

2214
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:58,719
different than low potency

2215
01:31:56,359 --> 01:32:00,719
flour meaning like the thing that

2216
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:03,719
resonates most with me with the variety

2217
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:06,639
that's 10% THC is that it's 10%

2218
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:08,439
THC you know what I mean so it's like

2219
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:14,840
pink boost goddess is a perfect example

2220
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:17,079
of it's it's like 8% THC and like 7 8 %

2221
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:19,639
thcv so you're not really just you're

2222
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:22,198
not just smoking a THC variety you're

2223
01:32:19,639 --> 01:32:24,480
smoking a low THC

2224
01:32:22,198 --> 01:32:26,960
variety which is important

2225
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:28,759
because THC is often the thing that

2226
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:32,039
gives people the negative side effects

2227
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:35,239
too much of it you know so is it in same

2228
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:37,399
with CBG so is it is it obviously the

2229
01:32:35,238 --> 01:32:40,959
the the modulating and moderating

2230
01:32:37,399 --> 01:32:45,000
effects of the miners are there but also

2231
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:46,760
the less negative side effects of the

2232
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,719
major THC is there as well because

2233
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:51,600
you've diminished it right so what I

2234
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:57,319
what I haven't tried yet is like a 20%

2235
01:32:51,600 --> 01:33:00,679
THC variety that also has 10% or 7% thcv

2236
01:32:57,319 --> 01:33:02,960
to compare it more apples to apples

2237
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:04,279
right like and I haven't done this but I

2238
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,600
haven't take like a flower that I've

2239
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:09,079
smoked a bunch and then just put like a

2240
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:10,920
dab of pure thcv on top of it but that

2241
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:12,639
but that is ultimately where people

2242
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:14,319
discovered what the Entourage effect was

2243
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:17,319
is like well what if you just take THC

2244
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:19,000
alone and then add things to it and that

2245
01:33:17,319 --> 01:33:22,559
tells you that

2246
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,439
they change the the effect so so I don't

2247
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,880
know just to be perfectly honest but I I

2248
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:27,839
do know that it smokes like really

2249
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:29,880
lovely low potency flour with a great

2250
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,480
Aroma and that is something that I

2251
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:33,239
really like smoking and I think almost

2252
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:35,479
everybody would too if they just stopped

2253
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:38,839
looking at the label and if they had the

2254
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:41,439
chance to smoke 10 12 15% THC they'd

2255
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:43,840
realize it's just so approachable and

2256
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:45,839
you can finish your joint and you know

2257
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,639
or you could come back to it later and

2258
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:51,880
you just don't get overwhelmed um and I

2259
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:54,480
think that that in a you know in a way

2260
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:56,400
maybe maybe cannabis consumers maybe

2261
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:58,678
cannabis cultivators need consumers to

2262
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:00,559
smoke lower potency flour just so they

2263
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:02,719
can grow more of it you know maybe

2264
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:05,199
that's the way to save the market you

2265
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:06,198
know like instead of selling one pound

2266
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:09,359
you're selling

2267
01:34:06,198 --> 01:34:11,719
two so you know because you know I know

2268
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:13,679
for for me myself most flour if I roll a

2269
01:34:11,719 --> 01:34:15,279
joint I can't finish it because it's

2270
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,600
just a little bit too potent I come back

2271
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:19,000
to it later but low potency flour you

2272
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,600
can kind of smoke like a cigarette and

2273
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
finish it put it out and then later come

2274
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:25,360
back and smoke another one so for the

2275
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,359
market it's great it's like beer you

2276
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:28,839
know you you don't want to you drink one

2277
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:30,599
beer because you don't want to get too

2278
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:33,279
drunk and you can choose to have another

2279
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:37,119
one or not but if all beer was the

2280
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:38,840
potency of whiskey you know so like I

2281
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:41,198
think that these low potency varieties

2282
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:42,960
really have a place for average

2283
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:44,919
consumers like the same way gummies and

2284
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:47,560
Vapes do you know it's like it's like

2285
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:50,800
easy approachable

2286
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:52,440
gentle um and I just I just love smoking

2287
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:56,480
them I find that like the outdoor

2288
01:34:52,439 --> 01:34:59,759
version of most varieties that I've um

2289
01:34:56,479 --> 01:35:01,479
bred are more approachable and friendly

2290
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,360
to consume even though they're not as

2291
01:35:01,479 --> 01:35:06,839
like knock you out or as impressive

2292
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:09,279
looking but like they just are nicer

2293
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:11,119
Kinder gentler versions and I think

2294
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:13,118
that's that has some and pink boost is

2295
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:15,519
also you know those guys are amazing

2296
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:18,079
regenerative Farmers they grow their

2297
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:21,760
salt of the earth kind of bulk and they

2298
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:24,600
grow healthy organic flour sungrown from

2299
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:26,480
seed every year you know so you don't

2300
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,600
just get the cultiv you get you get

2301
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:31,359
everything that comes with it as

2302
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:33,560
well yeah that's awesome I I haven't I

2303
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:35,359
haven't met the uh the creators but I'd

2304
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,679
heard they were they were good folk much

2305
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:39,839
like you mentioned so that's that's cool

2306
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:41,719
to hear I wanted to quickly ask you you

2307
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:44,079
know cuz I I'm not sure if you've done

2308
01:35:41,719 --> 01:35:46,560
this so I could just be completely you

2309
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:49,479
know out out there but I was wondering

2310
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:52,600
have you ever seen or spoken 21 who had

2311
01:35:49,479 --> 01:35:55,718
like self a plant just a bunch of times

2312
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:57,440
just like 10 times like like S10

2313
01:35:55,719 --> 01:36:00,560
something like that like what what

2314
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:02,039
happens does it just go weird cuz I

2315
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,679
thought maybe maybe on like the

2316
01:36:02,039 --> 01:36:06,000
commercial scale you guys might have

2317
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:10,359
come across someone doing something like

2318
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:14,000
that um I know that it happens a bit in

2319
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:16,639
terms of like um bringing out recessive

2320
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,158
traits that are like

2321
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:21,118
uh bad traits like negative tra I I

2322
01:36:19,158 --> 01:36:24,238
don't know I have actually I have not

2323
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:25,719
selfed a lot myself I have some people

2324
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:27,238
have done it with genetics that I've

2325
01:36:25,719 --> 01:36:28,679
provided them but I'm actually it's

2326
01:36:27,238 --> 01:36:30,559
funny you should I'm just about to

2327
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:34,199
embark on this journey

2328
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:38,480
myself for the first time um I I've

2329
01:36:34,198 --> 01:36:40,319
always bred to select cultivars to grow

2330
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:43,158
never for seed

2331
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:47,238
production so my goals have always been

2332
01:36:43,158 --> 01:36:49,559
make crosses run through those and

2333
01:36:47,238 --> 01:36:52,238
select cultivars to grow to cultivate

2334
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:56,239
usually for myself um so I'm kind of

2335
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:58,959
like my own breeder production thing so

2336
01:36:56,238 --> 01:37:00,559
I've never produced seed to

2337
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:04,359
sell

2338
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,920
um so I I I I'm just not really in the

2339
01:37:04,359 --> 01:37:07,599
seed production side it's always been

2340
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,399
very small batches just to make enough

2341
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,480
seed to literally go through uh you know

2342
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:15,839
a population to select

2343
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:17,919
cultivars um but I do know people have

2344
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:20,199
used selfing for I know that for

2345
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,079
instance David Watson use selfing for

2346
01:37:20,198 --> 01:37:26,559
for selecting his um single canabo

2347
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:29,118
varieties that went into gw's um

2348
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,880
portfolio so it is a very valuable tool

2349
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:33,719
it's probably the only tool to really

2350
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,000
get to that to that means you know to

2351
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:40,480
that end because um just your ability to

2352
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:43,000
know the um chemistry of your both

2353
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:46,839
parents you know males males are a

2354
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,599
variable that nobody males add time in a

2355
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:51,279
big way

2356
01:37:48,599 --> 01:37:54,599
right yeah totally and I mean while

2357
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:57,399
we're on the topic of males do you do

2358
01:37:54,599 --> 01:37:59,319
you think there's any tips to selecting

2359
01:37:57,399 --> 01:38:02,399
a good male do you think it's all sort

2360
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:05,039
of random do you put any stock in

2361
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:07,238
anything like you know like morphology

2362
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:08,479
or you compare it to the females

2363
01:38:07,238 --> 01:38:10,879
anything like that or do you think it's

2364
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:13,718
like it's kind of just trolling error

2365
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:17,199
really well I mean I mean no matter what

2366
01:38:13,719 --> 01:38:18,639
you yeah yeah I I feel it's always going

2367
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:20,198
to be trial and error just because you

2368
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:22,000
don't smoke the mail but the more

2369
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:23,559
analytics you have on the mail I mean

2370
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,880
you can get a lot of information you can

2371
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:27,639
get a tur profile from a male um

2372
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,319
traditionally for me because you know

2373
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:31,000
I'm not a seed producer and I've never

2374
01:38:29,319 --> 01:38:33,639
really done traditional breeding on that

2375
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,359
scale um it's just all the same things

2376
01:38:33,639 --> 01:38:37,279
that you look at a female flower for

2377
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:38,799
before you smoke it you know structure

2378
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:42,800
flower time

2379
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:44,960
Aroma um you know height um branching

2380
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:47,320
all that stuff you know and obviously

2381
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:49,439
with the for males that stem rub you

2382
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:50,880
know thing really is the best you can

2383
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:51,638
get in terms of like what are you going

2384
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:56,440
to

2385
01:38:51,639 --> 01:38:58,719
consume um so yeah yeah I I I I I still

2386
01:38:56,439 --> 01:39:00,919
like the idea of keeping males in the

2387
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:02,800
loop right even though all for all

2388
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:05,920
practical purposes maybe it doesn't make

2389
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:08,520
sense in a for a lot of ways but I guess

2390
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:11,880
there's still some kind of

2391
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:14,920
XY chromosome thing that wants to happen

2392
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:16,639
so it's like um you know cannabis is a

2393
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:18,359
goddess but there's also a God in there

2394
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:21,679
who contributed a little bit in order to

2395
01:39:18,359 --> 01:39:23,479
get that female there um you know at

2396
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:26,800
least now there's a pollen donor you

2397
01:39:23,479 --> 01:39:29,638
know so there's the expression of that

2398
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:32,079
but um no I I I I'd hate to think that

2399
01:39:29,639 --> 01:39:36,000
we got to a world where the male side

2400
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:37,198
was completely discarded right but um

2401
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,760
and I think there's some people who

2402
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:42,719
enjoy the hunt that way that they always

2403
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,320
are introducing that variable but man it

2404
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:47,079
seems like breeders have really pushed

2405
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:49,079
towards uh you know feminized production

2406
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:51,279
because of you know controlling the

2407
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:53,760
outcome and having you know a little bit

2408
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:56,079
more of a ground to stand on when you

2409
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:59,599
start um versus just the rolling the

2410
01:39:56,079 --> 01:40:02,599
dice when I you know back in Amsterdam I

2411
01:39:59,599 --> 01:40:04,599
would always do um my breeding would

2412
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:06,960
happen in the summer when I could put a

2413
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:10,760
bunch of plants outside and I could

2414
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:13,560
select males outdoors and it was

2415
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:15,000
Amsterdam and they didn't have you know

2416
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:16,480
the weather was bad so they never really

2417
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,279
expressed themselves the way they should

2418
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,879
so it was kind of like a survival of the

2419
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:21,960
fittest kind of strategy and I know

2420
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,400
people have a lot of different

2421
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:27,319
strategies for how they select their

2422
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:29,638
males you know but um yeah I don't know

2423
01:40:27,319 --> 01:40:31,639
to be to be honest I haven't been doing

2424
01:40:29,639 --> 01:40:34,679
a great deal of breeding over the past

2425
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:37,159
few years it's been about every year I

2426
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:39,079
make a selection or two and that's about

2427
01:40:37,158 --> 01:40:42,598
it and it's usually just kind of on a on

2428
01:40:39,079 --> 01:40:43,719
a hobby level um I've made a lot of seed

2429
01:40:42,599 --> 01:40:45,039
just you know like we were saying

2430
01:40:43,719 --> 01:40:46,158
earlier it's pretty easy to make a seed

2431
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:49,319
I've made a lot of seed in a lot of

2432
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:52,439
crosses that I really want to get to so

2433
01:40:49,319 --> 01:40:54,118
like I'm I'm doing some feminized stuff

2434
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:56,238
right now just because I've got some

2435
01:40:54,118 --> 01:40:58,479
some new things that I want to bring in

2436
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:00,479
and I've got um some stuff that I want

2437
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:02,559
to preserve um you know I want to do

2438
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,718
some s1's from some old cuts that I

2439
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,440
don't have a lot of seed from but for

2440
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:08,359
the most part I would really just love

2441
01:41:06,439 --> 01:41:11,079
to work with stuff I have from Years

2442
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:14,238
Gone by and if I could I would love to

2443
01:41:11,079 --> 01:41:16,880
do some um rescue work on really really

2444
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:19,839
old seed that I have from way way way

2445
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,719
back um and I think that's that's like

2446
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,840
what get would get me the most excited

2447
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:25,520
like if I could pop in anything right

2448
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,520
now i' pop the beans that I've got from

2449
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:30,119
the 80s that I still have that I've been

2450
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:33,159
keeping in relatively good condition

2451
01:41:30,118 --> 01:41:35,079
over the years um just because I think

2452
01:41:33,158 --> 01:41:37,118
that most of us didn't ever get a chance

2453
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:40,000
to work through large populations of

2454
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:41,198
seeds from the old school stuff you know

2455
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,399
like especially if we were indoor

2456
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:45,638
Growers we got big bags of seeds and

2457
01:41:43,399 --> 01:41:48,839
popped 10 of them and selected a female

2458
01:41:45,639 --> 01:41:51,118
and then grew that for years versus you

2459
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:52,800
know taking 500 seeds of some stuff that

2460
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:54,719
you've always wanted to look deeper into

2461
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:58,599
and just like doing a full round and

2462
01:41:54,719 --> 01:42:01,000
looking at it that would be super

2463
01:41:58,599 --> 01:42:03,199
exciting well you totally preempted my

2464
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,679
next question which was going to be I'm

2465
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:09,479
sure you got a lot of rare stock in your

2466
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:11,039
Vault what to you is

2467
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:14,598
rare

2468
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:17,439
um stuff that doesn't have the modern

2469
01:42:14,599 --> 01:42:21,239
influence that's that's the main thing

2470
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:24,678
um just that that OG Kim you know Blue

2471
01:42:21,238 --> 01:42:28,319
Dream Durban You Know Jack all those

2472
01:42:24,679 --> 01:42:31,719
things that got into everything um I

2473
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:34,079
have pixer stuff that came from Mexican

2474
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:37,239
heritage and I have biger stuff that

2475
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:39,279
came from African Heritage that goes way

2476
01:42:37,238 --> 01:42:41,799
back and

2477
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:44,439
um they've been in somewhat cold storage

2478
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:46,480
for you know the majority of the years

2479
01:42:44,439 --> 01:42:48,399
but not always so not in great condition

2480
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:50,718
and I also got land R stuff that I've

2481
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:53,319
gotten from friends over the years some

2482
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:56,000
from their things that they like breeder

2483
01:42:53,319 --> 01:42:58,840
that I know that make crosses for

2484
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,039
themselves or things that they keep for

2485
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:02,279
them you know like things that they

2486
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:04,560
don't release that they've given me like

2487
01:43:02,279 --> 01:43:07,238
this is this is the here are the seeds

2488
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:10,039
that I used to find the male that I used

2489
01:43:07,238 --> 01:43:13,638
to make this plant but they never used

2490
01:43:10,039 --> 01:43:14,800
it um because you know there's it's like

2491
01:43:13,639 --> 01:43:20,159
the old

2492
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:22,360
um like uh f1s from you know a lot of

2493
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:24,439
act like crops will not share their

2494
01:43:22,359 --> 01:43:25,920
parents but they'll share the f1s

2495
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:27,479
because their parents are too special

2496
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,679
right they'll never release the thing

2497
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:31,799
that made the

2498
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:33,800
f1s um so some of that stuff I'd love to

2499
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:35,599
explore other people's old school stuff

2500
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:39,400
and I've got just land race things that

2501
01:43:35,599 --> 01:43:41,560
people have given me um but really I

2502
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:43,238
mean if I could I right now I would

2503
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:46,760
probably just go through all the oldest

2504
01:43:43,238 --> 01:43:49,399
sage seeds that I have that made the

2505
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:50,599
stuff that ended up becoming the parents

2506
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:53,399
for th

2507
01:43:50,599 --> 01:43:56,279
seeds um because there was some Fe there

2508
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:59,198
was so much so much um such a spectrum

2509
01:43:56,279 --> 01:44:00,719
of of um fenos in there that there were

2510
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:03,879
some that I

2511
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:06,840
overlooked um and out out of necessity

2512
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:08,639
could only keep you know a few of the

2513
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,159
selections and things were like oh man I

2514
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:14,960
really should have kept that one really

2515
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:16,879
unique effects different feelings um I

2516
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,560
had this one variety it was a sage it

2517
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,679
was a pure Sage but it was one Cult of

2518
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:24,000
our that we had me and a friend selected

2519
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:27,760
and it had this really

2520
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,479
relaxing sativa feeling it wasn't like

2521
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,280
you know how you get that headband on

2522
01:44:29,479 --> 01:44:33,000
your head and it feels like the head the

2523
01:44:31,279 --> 01:44:34,880
like the rubber band is going up towards

2524
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,439
the top of your head and lifts up off

2525
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:40,480
the top and Pops off you know that

2526
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:42,319
effect that kind of crown thing where

2527
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:44,439
like you feel like the very tip of your

2528
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:46,880
head kind of tingle this one had the

2529
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:49,519
opposite where it went down and it felt

2530
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:51,800
like um it felt like water dripping down

2531
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:55,159
your head onto your shoulders like you

2532
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:58,960
just had this ah this kind of settling

2533
01:44:55,158 --> 01:45:00,920
feeling um but it was super super subtle

2534
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,399
and you had to like appreciate it you

2535
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:04,960
had to like be in the space to

2536
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:07,679
appreciate it but it was really unique

2537
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,560
and my friend and I that selected it we

2538
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:12,039
were both just like you know I

2539
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:14,840
understand this isn't like Market

2540
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:17,679
friendly flower but that has something

2541
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:20,440
unique that you don't feel in other

2542
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:23,239
varieties um and that kind of stuff you

2543
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:25,598
know in a time when you could only keep

2544
01:45:23,238 --> 01:45:28,479
what was really you know selling or what

2545
01:45:25,599 --> 01:45:31,119
you could afford to to Mom up or to keep

2546
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:34,559
in storage I wish I'd saved all those

2547
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:37,158
things um because I I I'm like as you

2548
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:40,599
can tell man I'm all about effect it's

2549
01:45:37,158 --> 01:45:43,479
like that that is it for me

2550
01:45:40,599 --> 01:45:45,279
100% I love it cuz ain't that what the

2551
01:45:43,479 --> 01:45:48,118
heads are all about right chasing that

2552
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:50,679
ultimate effect I I wanted to quickly

2553
01:45:48,118 --> 01:45:53,439
ask you before we jump onto the tail end

2554
01:45:50,679 --> 01:45:55,199
and the quickfire questions is about 6

2555
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:58,238
months ago maybe even a bit longer I

2556
01:45:55,198 --> 01:46:01,439
interviewed Shanty and he spoke very

2557
01:45:58,238 --> 01:46:03,039
fondly about uh he he was sort of saying

2558
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:06,238
you know this one time I got this

2559
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:08,760
incredible batch of skunk seed from Rob

2560
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:11,678
Clark he's like I never got skunk seed

2561
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:13,960
stock like that since anyway it got me

2562
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:16,079
thinking maybe over the years you've

2563
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:18,279
been lucky enough to have uh been

2564
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:20,800
exposed to some of this mythical stuff

2565
01:46:18,279 --> 01:46:23,198
through Rob any any sort of standouts

2566
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,800
that you've been able to try or seed

2567
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:26,079
stock of his that you're sort of eyeing

2568
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,960
off and thinking oh wouldn't mind

2569
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:29,479
cracking some of

2570
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:36,639
that

2571
01:46:29,479 --> 01:46:39,079
um well I'll say this um yes and no um I

2572
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:41,719
haven't because I've been so focused on

2573
01:46:39,079 --> 01:46:43,840
Sage for all the years that I really you

2574
01:46:41,719 --> 01:46:46,319
know and I I've grown a lot of other

2575
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:48,520
things you know in for the commercial

2576
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:53,279
Market you know especially 10 years ago

2577
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:56,560
15 years ago but I recently

2578
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:59,158
um so they they had a haze skunk that

2579
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:01,360
was just killer back in the day and and

2580
01:46:59,158 --> 01:47:02,359
you know like like you wouldn't it

2581
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:03,759
wasn't something you could buy at a

2582
01:47:02,359 --> 01:47:05,158
coffee shop it'd be something that theyd

2583
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:07,239
pull out of their pocket you know and

2584
01:47:05,158 --> 01:47:08,598
like here have a bud and smoke it which

2585
01:47:07,238 --> 01:47:09,799
was always the best weed every

2586
01:47:08,599 --> 01:47:11,199
everywhere right it was never something

2587
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:14,039
that came out of a jar it was something

2588
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:17,879
that someone gave you but um I've always

2589
01:47:14,039 --> 01:47:20,679
wondered what the original Sage was I've

2590
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:23,480
always wondered you know um because it

2591
01:47:20,679 --> 01:47:25,440
was clearly a haze something and it was

2592
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:26,718
a haze Afghan something it could have

2593
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:28,079
been a lot of people used to think it

2594
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:32,039
was nl5

2595
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:35,279
Haze um but I have so I have a

2596
01:47:32,039 --> 01:47:40,840
30-year-old clone 20 actually 29y old

2597
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:44,238
clone maybe and um it's the the um the

2598
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:45,639
sister of the or or the the um the

2599
01:47:44,238 --> 01:47:47,399
backat

2600
01:47:45,639 --> 01:47:53,000
cross um

2601
01:47:47,399 --> 01:47:55,039
F1 of the original um cross and I at the

2602
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,880
time I never thought it was as special

2603
01:47:55,039 --> 01:47:59,880
as the original female and it kind of

2604
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:02,039
got back burner but it was the one that

2605
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:05,039
survived over the years and I still have

2606
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:07,158
it to this day and at the time I didn't

2607
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:09,079
I only grew it a couple times you know

2608
01:48:07,158 --> 01:48:11,000
and I've kept it it's been passed around

2609
01:48:09,079 --> 01:48:13,719
and I've had it for a few years I got it

2610
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:17,399
back um a few years ago but anyway I

2611
01:48:13,719 --> 01:48:19,158
flowered it just um last year actually

2612
01:48:17,399 --> 01:48:20,839
no it was the summer so I do a bunch of

2613
01:48:19,158 --> 01:48:23,000
weird photo period trials and put things

2614
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:24,599
out at different times and stuff it's a

2615
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,639
fascination of my night night

2616
01:48:24,599 --> 01:48:30,520
Interruption and stuff um for photo

2617
01:48:27,639 --> 01:48:33,279
period extension anyway I Tri it and I

2618
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:34,760
put it out and after I smell walked up

2619
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:38,118
to it and smelled it and I was like wait

2620
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:41,320
a second this is so obviously skunk one

2621
01:48:38,118 --> 01:48:43,960
in here it's just so

2622
01:48:41,319 --> 01:48:45,439
obvious now like 30 years later going

2623
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:46,760
like oh okay because I don't grow a lot

2624
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:48,158
of skunk and I haven't even smelled a

2625
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:49,639
lot of like Pierce skunk one in a while

2626
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:50,960
so it was like a long time since I

2627
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:54,199
smelled it and a long time since I've

2628
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:57,000
grown that plant long time decades

2629
01:48:54,198 --> 01:49:00,399
now in hindsight I'm pretty sure that

2630
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:02,560
the original Sage was a haast

2631
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:05,000
skunk because they had some killer Hast

2632
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:07,360
skunk and when I think about like all

2633
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,158
the the seed that I saved it always came

2634
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:12,559
out of a Bud from somebody who gave me a

2635
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:15,079
bud it was unmarked it wasn't out of a

2636
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,960
jar it didn't come out of a little

2637
01:49:15,079 --> 01:49:18,319
package from a coffee shop with a name

2638
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:21,198
already written on it it was like an

2639
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:23,118
unknown random bud so when I put two and

2640
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:27,319
two together I'm like I really think

2641
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:30,079
that that first plant was probably hay

2642
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:32,439
skunk out of a seed of hay skunk that

2643
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:36,800
came from a bud that Rob gave

2644
01:49:32,439 --> 01:49:39,879
me oh wow so yes so yeah so I so I have

2645
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,199
try some of the killer so so I think

2646
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:42,920
that's in there because it's clearly not

2647
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:44,879
Northern Lights and it's clearly not

2648
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:47,039
chamba and it's clearly not Hayes and

2649
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,480
it's clearly not all these other things

2650
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:51,679
so the only thing that it really leans

2651
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:53,839
towards is skunk one so in a few weeks

2652
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:55,599
or or maybe less I'm going to uh bring

2653
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:57,400
Rob over and I'm going to stick it under

2654
01:49:55,599 --> 01:50:00,199
his nose and say just tell me or not is

2655
01:49:57,399 --> 01:50:01,920
that skunk one in there and then then

2656
01:50:00,198 --> 01:50:05,198
I'll know for sure I'm like okay that

2657
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:11,000
was what contributed that part to Sage

2658
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:12,879
was hay skunk times chamba Rock C Inda

2659
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,760
um so

2660
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:19,079
yeah wow that's really cool what what a

2661
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:21,800
great answer to that question I love it

2662
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:23,519
uh we've got just uh a few quick Patron

2663
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:25,320
ones before we do the final five first

2664
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,679
one is can you tell us anything about

2665
01:50:25,319 --> 01:50:31,279
the Big Sir

2666
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:34,279
Nigerian so that's part of the

2667
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:37,399
folklore um and there could be things in

2668
01:50:34,279 --> 01:50:39,039
Big Sir the Nigerian but the African

2669
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:41,000
cannabis that was grown in biger was

2670
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:45,560
mainly Malo based it came in with the

2671
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:48,560
Peace Corp in 1976 came into La corn

2672
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:50,560
cobs came up to Big Sir and people

2673
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:52,400
started growing African varieties in Big

2674
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:56,199
Sir the very first cannabis that I ever

2675
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:59,598
grew grew in 1983 myself from seed was

2676
01:50:56,198 --> 01:51:01,559
um was from that maloi stuff that's

2677
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:05,679
where my S memory that's part of that

2678
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:08,639
whole smell thing um

2679
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:11,480

2680

know um counterculture and stuff and

2687
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:31,039
every fourth of July babat tund olun

2688
01:51:29,118 --> 01:51:32,799
who's a Nigerian drummer was also a

2689
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:34,519
family friend he played in also played

2690
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:39,119
in the band with my dad at one

2691
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:40,840
point he would come and um stay in Big

2692
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:42,880
Sir and they do these events these

2693
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:44,440
Fourth of July drum troop events with

2694
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:46,920
another family friend of ours who led

2695
01:51:44,439 --> 01:51:50,919
the troop with him Gordy Ryan who's son

2696
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:54,719
married my niece all part of the family

2697
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:57,399
um and so they would come there and they

2698
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:58,880
were Nigerian and this is all I can say

2699
01:51:57,399 --> 01:52:01,399
is that I know for sure like I don't

2700
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:04,118
know any other story that matches what

2701
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:07,039
this is just my reality and I remember

2702
01:52:04,118 --> 01:52:09,799
sitting out on the Bluffs with them as a

2703
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:11,960
young kid smoking the weed my brother

2704
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:14,520
grew which was

2705
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:15,679
maloi and smoking it with them saying

2706
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:17,880
hey man you guys want to try some

2707
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:21,158
African weed and getting high with the

2708
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:26,400
drum troop smoking African wheat and

2709
01:52:21,158 --> 01:52:30,078
that was in the early 80s 82 83 84 85 86

2710
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:32,759
87 that range right I never remember

2711
01:52:30,078 --> 01:52:36,439
anyone from their side sharing seeds

2712
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:39,480
with us and growing it I could be

2713
01:52:36,439 --> 01:52:42,919
totally wrong but I think what happened

2714
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:46,078
is because of the Malawi chamba thing in

2715
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:47,719
Big Sir and because of Baba tund olun

2716
01:52:46,078 --> 01:52:49,399
being a Nigerian drummer who came and

2717
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:52,000
played in BX sir and stayed with my

2718
01:52:49,399 --> 01:52:54,920
family stayed at my brother's house and

2719
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,639
we smoked a with them maybe even gave

2720
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:59,480
them seeds maybe at some point they

2721
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:03,840
shared seeds but I think the lore behind

2722
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:07,078
the Big Sur and the Nigerian thing came

2723
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:09,319
from that and I've even heard there's

2724
01:53:07,078 --> 01:53:13,439
websites and there's things talking

2725
01:53:09,319 --> 01:53:15,198
about hunji and cannabis and stuff but I

2726
01:53:13,439 --> 01:53:17,078
don't know anything about that all I

2727
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:18,759
know is that he's been a family friend

2728
01:53:17,078 --> 01:53:23,479
since the early

2729
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:27,800
70s and um we shared a lot of weed with

2730
01:53:23,479 --> 01:53:30,638
them and we grew African varieties and

2731
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,840
chamba is an African variety and Malawi

2732
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:36,159
corn cobs were grown in Big Sur and they

2733
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:39,078
were part of the Holy weed Spectrum so

2734
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:41,279
that's it that's all I can really say um

2735
01:53:39,078 --> 01:53:42,840
for sure so I don't know if it's just

2736
01:53:41,279 --> 01:53:44,078
another telephone thing where someone

2737
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:45,880
heard something and then they heard

2738
01:53:44,078 --> 01:53:48,880
something and someone retold that story

2739
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:50,560
but I know now it has been accepted I

2740
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,639
mean not accepted but it is part of the

2741
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:55,639
Holy weed story is maybe that the seeds

2742
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:58,000
came from Baba tund tunji and I just

2743
01:53:55,639 --> 01:54:01,840
really really really really don't think

2744
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,560
that's true um but he wasn't he was a

2745
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,480
friend and they loved weed and maybe

2746
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:07,599
some at some point they brought seeds

2747
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:10,399
and shared them but that would have

2748
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:13,960
happened much much later that would have

2749
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:16,759
happened in the late 80s or early 90s I

2750
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:18,520
would think and by then I think the

2751
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:23,159
story that people are trying to tell is

2752
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:24,800
a story from the 70s you know so

2753
01:54:23,158 --> 01:54:28,238
yeah certainly it sounds like the

2754
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:30,360
timelines don't quite line up there yeah

2755
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:32,519
the uh the last patreon question we had

2756
01:54:30,359 --> 01:54:33,598
for you was can you please tell us the

2757
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:35,320
headband

2758
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:39,560
backstory

2759
01:54:35,319 --> 01:54:42,559
oo you save the best for last um once

2760
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:45,719
again it's controversial but um this is

2761
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:49,320
just my perspective from this is just

2762
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:51,719
the from from my life and I'm sure

2763
01:54:49,319 --> 01:54:53,799
there's other stories um so I don't want

2764
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:57,599
to step on any one's chose but this is

2765
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:59,039
the way it happened from me and with me

2766
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:01,800
um like I mentioned earlier I knew the

2767
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:04,000
sour diesel guys dating back from I

2768
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:08,599
don't know 93

2769
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,840
94 um when I came back to Amsterdam I'm

2770
01:55:08,599 --> 01:55:11,279
going to give you the long-winded

2771
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,840
version when I came back to Amsterdam

2772
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:16,599
and I was making hash um I had a

2773
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:21,560
girlfriend who lived in Big Sir and she

2774
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:22,840
was going to college in um in uh Vermont

2775
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:24,719
I think it was

2776
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:27,639
and I had given her some water hash that

2777
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:30,279
I made and she was sitting around a fire

2778
01:55:27,639 --> 01:55:32,599
Circle campfire thing with some other

2779
01:55:30,279 --> 01:55:34,800
college mates um what was I think

2780
01:55:32,599 --> 01:55:36,639
Hampshire College I think is what it was

2781
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:39,159
not sure

2782
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:41,800
um and she pulled out a piece of hash

2783
01:55:39,158 --> 01:55:44,118
and the guy looked at the hash and took

2784
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:45,800
a hit and he said whoa I haven't seen

2785
01:55:44,118 --> 01:55:49,399
hash like that since

2786
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:51,599
Amsterdam made by this guy Mo and she's

2787
01:55:49,399 --> 01:55:53,638
like whoa that's my boyfriend and he's

2788
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:55,199
like no hey we've been we you know he

2789
01:55:53,639 --> 01:55:59,359
was an old friend and we haven't been in

2790
01:55:55,198 --> 01:56:01,359
contact for years so she gave me um he

2791
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:04,439
got she got his number and he connect

2792
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:07,359
she gave me the number to my buddy um

2793
01:56:04,439 --> 01:56:09,678
his handle on Instagram is sour silicate

2794
01:56:07,359 --> 01:56:12,519
um he's a glass blower but he's the guy

2795
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:14,960
who popped the original Sour Diesel Bean

2796
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:18,360
the Kim dog it was a Kim dog of unknown

2797
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:21,439
maale um and he popped it and you know

2798
01:56:18,359 --> 01:56:23,039
I've I 100% believe their story because

2799
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:24,678
when I learned the story there was no

2800
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:26,118
utility in them lying they were just

2801
01:56:24,679 --> 01:56:28,520
guys who had a couple lights in the

2802
01:56:26,118 --> 01:56:30,799
closet kind of thing and it turned into

2803
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:33,199
something bigger over the years but they

2804
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:37,560
were just friends who had this amazing

2805
01:56:33,198 --> 01:56:40,039
clone um so now I'm in connection with

2806
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:42,039
the sour diesel guys again through my

2807
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:46,000
girlfriend which was weird the little

2808
01:56:42,039 --> 01:56:48,519
piece of hash um and then um but but it

2809
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,639
also was you know connected with Josh D

2810
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:54,560
and his crew um in La at that point and

2811
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:57,639
so when the sour diesel guys came

2812
01:56:54,560 --> 01:57:01,280
through and I showed them um OG for the

2813
01:56:57,639 --> 01:57:02,920
first time then just called Kush um they

2814
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:04,840
right away were like whoa this is this

2815
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:06,279
is the diesel like where'd you get this

2816
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:07,840
this is Diesel and I'm like what do you

2817
01:57:06,279 --> 01:57:10,238
mean Sour Diesel and they said no it's

2818
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:12,639
like the diesel the diesel before Sour

2819
01:57:10,238 --> 01:57:14,638
Diesel um because there was that gas

2820
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:16,480
note that just like was a signal to them

2821
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:18,239
they're like there's something here this

2822
01:57:16,479 --> 01:57:20,078
is similar and I I could never like get

2823
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:21,439
sure like you know like is this a clone

2824
01:57:20,078 --> 01:57:23,840
you're talking about or just like a

2825
01:57:21,439 --> 01:57:25,479
class of gas weed or whatever but they

2826
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:29,039
were just all about like whoa where did

2827
01:57:25,479 --> 01:57:32,479
you find this so I thought it would be

2828
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:36,359
nice to bridge those two worlds the sour

2829
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:39,678
and OG and I got cuts of the sour and

2830
01:57:36,359 --> 01:57:42,559
gave it to the OG guys and I got cuts of

2831
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:45,399
OG and gave it to the sour guys and at

2832
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:49,039
the same time um helped facilitate the

2833
01:57:45,399 --> 01:57:51,198
transfer of those two clones to um

2834
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:52,599
Amsterdam which was the first time that

2835
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:54,399
they both showed up there the sour

2836
01:57:52,599 --> 01:57:56,599
diesel had been there earlier but it got

2837
01:57:54,399 --> 01:58:00,879
you know it got removed from the

2838
01:57:56,599 --> 01:58:04,039
system anyway so now both groups had the

2839
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:07,239
plants um so it was kind of the gas the

2840
01:58:04,039 --> 01:58:09,880
the intersection of the gas right but at

2841
01:58:07,238 --> 01:58:11,519
the time because la which is very

2842
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:13,440
foreign to me I grew up in a kind of

2843
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:17,079
hippie you know

2844
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:20,359
outdoor grower thing wh everyone was a

2845
01:58:17,078 --> 01:58:23,960
very different world than an LA indoor

2846
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:26,078
thing which was kind of driven by money

2847
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:28,158
and driven by opportunity and there was

2848
01:58:26,078 --> 01:58:30,238
a lot of unsavory characters that were

2849
01:58:28,158 --> 01:58:32,479
often involved in the Cannabis trade at

2850
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:36,359
that time you know in the early 2000s

2851
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:39,279
and cannabis was worth $6 to 8,000 a

2852
01:58:36,359 --> 01:58:40,799
pound you know and so it it had it

2853
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:44,719
brought along some unscrupulous

2854
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:47,079
characters right so when I gave the OG

2855
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:49,319
to the guy the sour guys then living in

2856
01:58:47,078 --> 01:58:52,198
somoma um I just said maybe you

2857
01:58:49,319 --> 01:58:55,039
shouldn't call it Kush because there's

2858
01:58:52,198 --> 01:58:56,598
little bit of a of a of a click around

2859
01:58:55,039 --> 01:59:00,158
it you know there's only very few people

2860
01:58:56,599 --> 01:59:01,920
have this plant and um it has a little

2861
01:59:00,158 --> 01:59:04,759
bit of a track record and it's got a

2862
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:08,078
very you know a signature Aroma profile

2863
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:11,480
maybe call it something else and so he

2864
01:59:08,078 --> 01:59:14,319
called it headband because headband was

2865
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:17,839
something that they used as a descriptor

2866
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:20,399
to describe like you know the effect of

2867
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,400
a good snap and where you feel that you

2868
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:25,679
you know that constriction around your

2869
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:27,839
head um that tightness and so he called

2870
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:31,520
it headband and started selling it in

2871
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:34,599
the Bay Area and um but also selling

2872
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:37,079
sour maybe as headband and also selling

2873
01:59:34,599 --> 01:59:41,920
flower that might have seeds as

2874
01:59:37,078 --> 01:59:45,198
headband um so it quickly became OG was

2875
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:48,319
headband or beans that came out of OG

2876
01:59:45,198 --> 01:59:51,039
were headband or maybe even sour was

2877
01:59:48,319 --> 01:59:53,439
headband um it was just a new marketing

2878
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:57,719
tool and it was a new name

2879
01:59:53,439 --> 02:00:02,000
and I know people have used that name

2880
01:59:57,719 --> 02:00:04,239
for weed predating that time 200 2001

2881
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,279
something like that but I don't think

2882
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:09,879
that there's a surviving Cult of our

2883
02:00:06,279 --> 02:00:13,319
around today that came

2884
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:15,639
from headband so whatever they called e

2885
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:18,039
headband on the east coast in the

2886
02:00:15,639 --> 02:00:19,920
90s I don't know what that plant is and

2887
02:00:18,039 --> 02:00:23,078
I don't know where it is today and if it

2888
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:25,599
survived but what they call head B today

2889
02:00:23,078 --> 02:00:30,158
as far as I know came from the renaming

2890
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:32,599
of OG and for this crisscross over OG or

2891
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:34,479
sour being called headband or seeds that

2892
02:00:32,599 --> 02:00:36,480
came out of those plants being called

2893
02:00:34,479 --> 02:00:38,439
headband and that's why the modern

2894
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:40,279
headband today is definitely a different

2895
02:00:38,439 --> 02:00:43,238
plant because it was seed it was

2896
02:00:40,279 --> 02:00:45,000
selected and it was people made seed

2897
02:00:43,238 --> 02:00:47,559
companies and bred with it and turned it

2898
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:50,520
into a new thing but how it came back

2899
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:54,039
into the world and where those

2900
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:57,320
original um Heritage the the founders of

2901
02:00:54,039 --> 02:00:59,519
what modern headband is is OG or sour

2902
02:00:57,319 --> 02:01:03,479
and it's just a renaming it's just a

2903
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:06,159
renaming and that was the way I saw it

2904
02:01:03,479 --> 02:01:07,238
happen and I've never seen anything else

2905
02:01:06,158 --> 02:01:10,679
to say

2906
02:01:07,238 --> 02:01:12,759
otherwise um so it's a weird story and

2907
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:15,639
there's layers and layers that go deeper

2908
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:18,360
into it um because of weird prohibition

2909
02:01:15,639 --> 02:01:21,719
Dynamics um it's for a it's a whole show

2910
02:01:18,359 --> 02:01:24,279
in itself just telling that whole story

2911
02:01:21,719 --> 02:01:26,239
um because of this the all the Dynamics

2912
02:01:24,279 --> 02:01:28,759
around Sour Diesel and the guys that

2913
02:01:26,238 --> 02:01:31,198
were growing it and how it soured

2914
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:34,079
relationships and all the Dynamics

2915
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:35,559
around OG Kush and who was growing it

2916
02:01:34,078 --> 02:01:37,920
and what kind of opportunities were

2917
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:40,480
created and relationships and burnt

2918
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:43,359
Bridges and all kinds of stuff it was a

2919
02:01:40,479 --> 02:01:45,559
weird time for cannabis and that is

2920
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:48,319
where headband came from and I'd love

2921
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:50,599
for anybody out there to not only

2922
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:52,920
challenge that but show me some any

2923
02:01:50,599 --> 02:01:55,679
lineage any plants anywhere that came

2924
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:59,880
from a different headband or a

2925
02:01:55,679 --> 02:02:01,840
different origin story um so yeah that's

2926
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:05,480
that's where it came from as far as I

2927
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:08,239
know I love it I uh I've heard from two

2928
02:02:05,479 --> 02:02:10,198
different people that that is the

2929
02:02:08,238 --> 02:02:12,000
backstory on the headband cut they have

2930
02:02:10,198 --> 02:02:14,279
at least that it originates from a

2931
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:17,238
renamed OG and it's it's just like a

2932
02:02:14,279 --> 02:02:20,000
really good OG essentially so look I'm

2933
02:02:17,238 --> 02:02:21,638
I'm happy to believe you for sure and

2934
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,520
it's and it's well it's not even it's

2935
02:02:21,639 --> 02:02:26,920
just before OG was OG it was just Kush

2936
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:28,520
and there's only one Kush I mean that's

2937
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:30,760
the that's the big one is now there's

2938
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:33,280
like all these OG became a class of its

2939
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:36,119
own like OG's plural like oh what kind

2940
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:38,439
of OG do you grow but OG was actually

2941
02:02:36,118 --> 02:02:41,960
something that was OG was a descriptor

2942
02:02:38,439 --> 02:02:44,519
for Kush was kush OG was saying our OG

2943
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:48,599
that was grown by the OG guys who did it

2944
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:50,480
right and are are are growing fire so

2945
02:02:48,599 --> 02:02:53,440
then it kind of revers where OG's became

2946
02:02:50,479 --> 02:02:55,839
the genetic or became the the plant

2947
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:58,359
instead of kush being the plant OG being

2948
02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:01,119
the crew and the people and the style

2949
02:02:58,359 --> 02:03:03,399
and all that so Kush is just Kush and

2950
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:06,198
Kush might be TK and Kush might be the

2951
02:03:03,399 --> 02:03:10,039
same thing that's debatable but in terms

2952
02:03:06,198 --> 02:03:12,960
of how the world experienced OG today it

2953
02:03:10,039 --> 02:03:15,238
came from just one clone which is Kush

2954
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:17,078
that came to California and it went to

2955
02:03:15,238 --> 02:03:20,359
Silver Lake and then it went around the

2956
02:03:17,078 --> 02:03:21,920
world from there you know um so that

2957
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:23,598
that's like I think it's also important

2958
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,440
just remember like the same with diesel

2959
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:26,800
people talk about like the different s

2960
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:29,000
What Sour Diesel do you grow it's like

2961
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:32,039
there's only one Sour Diesel it's a

2962
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,039
clone only plant there's only one Kush

2963
02:03:32,039 --> 02:03:37,560
it's a clone only plant and there's not

2964
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:40,279
many of them there's just one they've

2965
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:41,560
been used a lot and they've been renamed

2966
02:03:40,279 --> 02:03:43,158
and they've been called this that and

2967
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:46,000
the other and we can all argue about

2968
02:03:43,158 --> 02:03:48,359
where they came from but in terms of the

2969
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,039
Clone there's one Sour Diesel there's

2970
02:03:48,359 --> 02:03:53,519
one Kush that's

2971
02:03:50,039 --> 02:03:56,078
it here here they you go well look that

2972
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:58,559
brings us to our quickfire questions for

2973
02:03:56,078 --> 02:04:01,238
the end so the first one I wanted to ask

2974
02:03:58,559 --> 02:04:03,320
you what is the single best or most

2975
02:04:01,238 --> 02:04:04,718
memorable experience with cannabis

2976
02:04:03,319 --> 02:04:07,118
you've ever

2977
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:09,000
had

2978
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:11,198
H well the

2979
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,639
first the first thought that came to my

2980
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:19,118
mind was the first plant that I ever

2981
02:04:13,639 --> 02:04:21,480
grew myself when I um I was 13 and I put

2982
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:23,519
a seed on my mom's balcony and one of

2983
02:04:21,479 --> 02:04:24,399
her flower pots probably without even

2984
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:27,400
asking

2985
02:04:24,399 --> 02:04:29,039
her and which also speaks to the Vigor

2986
02:04:27,399 --> 02:04:30,479
of old school seeds man you know you

2987
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:33,078
could just take a any seed and stick it

2988
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:37,078
in a pot and you get a plant out of it

2989
02:04:33,078 --> 02:04:39,078
um and it grew up a few feet and it got

2990
02:04:37,078 --> 02:04:41,719
to the point where it was popping up

2991
02:04:39,078 --> 02:04:44,439
over the balcony and my mom's like no we

2992
02:04:41,719 --> 02:04:46,039
can't do this anymore um so I went to a

2993
02:04:44,439 --> 02:04:49,000
friend of mine who's living in the

2994
02:04:46,039 --> 02:04:50,599
Palisades and I said hey can you can we

2995
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,679
finish this plant at your place and he

2996
02:04:50,599 --> 02:04:56,039
had about or 20 plants grown in his

2997
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:58,239
backyard and I brought it there this was

2998
02:04:56,039 --> 02:05:01,118
African seed that came from Malawi from

2999
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:02,638
Big Surf flower my brother had grown um

3000
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:06,039
every Christmas my brother would give us

3001
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:09,319
a little jar of flour um so here I'm a

3002
02:05:06,039 --> 02:05:10,880
13-year-old kid with my own plant and I

3003
02:05:09,319 --> 02:05:13,840
brought it to my friends and my buddy

3004
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:15,760
who was like 15 years older than me

3005
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:18,599
maybe 20 years older than me he was yeah

3006
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:22,159
probably 20 years older than me and we

3007
02:05:18,599 --> 02:05:25,239
grew it and then harvested it on

3008
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:27,920
Thanksgiving night 1983 we stayed up all

3009
02:05:25,238 --> 02:05:29,638
night trimming flour in the

3010
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:32,480
garage

3011
02:05:29,639 --> 02:05:34,800
and that one plant that I had was by far

3012
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:37,238
the best out of everything it was really

3013
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:41,000
special I named it

3014
02:05:37,238 --> 02:05:43,598
um Elanor and I picked Elanor because it

3015
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:46,399
reminded me of Dolores the Mexican

3016
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:50,279
variety that was popular in Big Sir um

3017
02:05:46,399 --> 02:05:53,439
so Eleanor was this one plant and It

3018
02:05:50,279 --> 02:05:55,920
produced amazing African

3019
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:57,158
flower and it had the best high out of

3020
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:03,078
everything in the

3021
02:05:57,158 --> 02:06:07,198
backyard and it eventually got sold and

3022
02:06:03,078 --> 02:06:09,039
um I only I kept a very small amount to

3023
02:06:07,198 --> 02:06:12,359
um to

3024
02:06:09,039 --> 02:06:14,118
smoke um and the rest got sold and I got

3025
02:06:12,359 --> 02:06:16,679
the profit from it and I went and bought

3026
02:06:14,118 --> 02:06:19,359
a video camera one of these big giant

3027
02:06:16,679 --> 02:06:20,920
bulky video cameras you know and I was a

3028
02:06:19,359 --> 02:06:23,479
13-year-old kid who went around

3029
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:26,000
documenting everything and it was all

3030
02:06:23,479 --> 02:06:28,919
because of this one seed that I just one

3031
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,559
day decided to put in my mom's pot and

3032
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:32,760
it was right that was when I really

3033
02:06:30,559 --> 02:06:34,880
first felt that like I'm not going to

3034
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:37,199
it's like not the power of cannabis but

3035
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:40,359
the significance it can play in like

3036
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:42,198
changing your life where I was like I

3037
02:06:40,359 --> 02:06:45,279
was just a kid but now I was the kid who

3038
02:06:42,198 --> 02:06:47,198
grew the best weed and I grew I grew the

3039
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:49,319
best weed and I made some money off of

3040
02:06:47,198 --> 02:06:51,598
it and now I'm like doing something with

3041
02:06:49,319 --> 02:06:54,399
my life because of it it was like really

3042
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:56,760
exciting and it was also that same

3043
02:06:54,399 --> 02:07:00,279
chemical Aroma signature thing that

3044
02:06:56,760 --> 02:07:03,119
resonates with me still today which is

3045
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:05,559
that terpinolene dominant uplifting

3046
02:07:03,118 --> 02:07:09,439
soaring energetic

3047
02:07:05,559 --> 02:07:14,400
flower that even as a 13-year-old kid I

3048
02:07:09,439 --> 02:07:17,558
still felt it then and I feel it now um

3049
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:19,399
so it's uh that's that's been that's

3050
02:07:17,559 --> 02:07:22,440
been my journey has been like just

3051
02:07:19,399 --> 02:07:25,799
keeping that torch going for like

3052
02:07:22,439 --> 02:07:28,238
different and amazing flower that um can

3053
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:29,760
stand out within within out of out of

3054
02:07:28,238 --> 02:07:32,118
the population as being something

3055
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:34,679
special and unique and people want to

3056
02:07:32,118 --> 02:07:36,839
have in their lives I love it that's

3057
02:07:34,679 --> 02:07:39,840
beautiful so full circle you know that

3058
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:42,960
that same profile Aroma just keeps

3059
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:45,078
popping its head up I love that a lot on

3060
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:47,239
the other end of the spectrum what would

3061
02:07:45,078 --> 02:07:49,679
be one of the more

3062
02:07:47,238 --> 02:07:51,519
disappointing uh strains or varials

3063
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:52,840
you've come across you know often I

3064
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:54,719
phrase it is you know one where

3065
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:56,159
everyone's really hyping it up you're

3066
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:58,118
really excited to try it and then

3067
02:07:56,158 --> 02:08:00,439
eventually you get it and you're like oh

3068
02:07:58,118 --> 02:08:00,439
is that

3069
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:05,800
[Music]

3070
02:08:03,639 --> 02:08:07,800
all

3071
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:10,279
well

3072
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:13,480
um well the weird thing for me is I

3073
02:08:10,279 --> 02:08:17,078
could almost say that about all Afghani

3074
02:08:13,479 --> 02:08:19,158
cannabis like it it's almost hard for me

3075
02:08:17,078 --> 02:08:22,679
to even feel the

3076
02:08:19,158 --> 02:08:24,279
effect like it just like I I I kind of

3077
02:08:22,679 --> 02:08:27,239
acknowledge that I have a high tolerance

3078
02:08:24,279 --> 02:08:28,840
to some things like you know like I have

3079
02:08:27,238 --> 02:08:31,598
a high tolerance to Edibles for instance

3080
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:35,000
like they I need a good you know 50 60

3081
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:37,599
milligrams to really feel it um but

3082
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,800
indicas for me are almost like hard to

3083
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:42,400
put my finger on how I feel it's almost

3084
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:46,039
like not there because it's just this

3085
02:08:42,399 --> 02:08:48,158
kind of soft muted kind of sensation so

3086
02:08:46,039 --> 02:08:50,559
I've always been like struggling to even

3087
02:08:48,158 --> 02:08:53,759
see like what is what does Northern

3088
02:08:50,559 --> 02:08:55,760
Lights feel like what does AF [ __ ] and

3089
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:58,400
Romulan and all these things that some

3090
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:01,840
people really really love and really

3091
02:08:58,399 --> 02:09:04,638
have like this you know that relaxing

3092
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:08,078
couch lock thing like I'd love to be

3093
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:09,960
able to lock into a couch it just sounds

3094
02:09:08,078 --> 02:09:11,238
like you know what a great you know

3095
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:12,920
opport like just to be able to take a

3096
02:09:11,238 --> 02:09:15,919
couple hits and just sink into a bean

3097
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:18,239
bag and feel like ah but it just doesn't

3098
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,239
have that effect with me you know it

3099
02:09:18,238 --> 02:09:23,598
just

3100
02:09:19,238 --> 02:09:25,238
doesn't doesn't ring my Dome um so

3101
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:27,920
that's always been fascinating for me

3102
02:09:25,238 --> 02:09:30,399
and often that's really beautiful chunky

3103
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:32,279
early flowering amazing weed that you'd

3104
02:09:30,399 --> 02:09:34,558
really want to resonate with you because

3105
02:09:32,279 --> 02:09:36,679
it's so you know it's good to grow it's

3106
02:09:34,559 --> 02:09:39,599
good to breed with but that's why I've

3107
02:09:36,679 --> 02:09:44,480
always been on my my path has been that

3108
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:46,599
you know for me for my you know my

3109
02:09:44,479 --> 02:09:49,479
process or my neurochemistry or whatever

3110
02:09:46,599 --> 02:09:52,239
it is that these other varieties I feel

3111
02:09:49,479 --> 02:09:54,118
them in such a profound way where some

3112
02:09:52,238 --> 02:09:56,759
stuff I just it just doesn't even it's

3113
02:09:54,118 --> 02:09:58,719
almost not there and to be honest a lot

3114
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:59,960
of the modern weed that's out there

3115
02:09:58,719 --> 02:10:02,880
today and I hate to sound like an old

3116
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:05,158
guy and say like modern weed but a lot

3117
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:07,319
of weed people give me and I don't even

3118
02:10:05,158 --> 02:10:09,399
it's like it's almost like no effect

3119
02:10:07,319 --> 02:10:11,158
it's like a little bit it's like yeah

3120
02:10:09,399 --> 02:10:12,879
and I just throw it in the Deep Freeze

3121
02:10:11,158 --> 02:10:15,519
and then maybe years later make hash out

3122
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:19,199
of it or do something or I don't know

3123
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:22,119
but so much flour I try today just

3124
02:10:19,198 --> 02:10:25,118
doesn't doesn't do it I I don't I I

3125
02:10:22,118 --> 02:10:27,279
can't explain but the flavor there you

3126
02:10:25,118 --> 02:10:28,799
know and then you know and then I smoke

3127
02:10:27,279 --> 02:10:33,359
something that I know does it and it's

3128
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:35,400
so profoundly works for me um that I'm

3129
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:38,679
just always curious that like why these

3130
02:10:35,399 --> 02:10:40,399
varieties became really popular um but

3131
02:10:38,679 --> 02:10:43,078
that's back to this thing of Aroma like

3132
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:45,198
Aroma over effect I get the aroma thing

3133
02:10:43,078 --> 02:10:47,158
in Spades it's like amazing amazing

3134
02:10:45,198 --> 02:10:49,919
amazing

3135
02:10:47,158 --> 02:10:52,479
flower yeah yeah I can certainly agree

3136
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:54,800
with that one for sure

3137
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:56,439
so I'm going to drop you off on a desert

3138
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:58,320
island I'm going to give you three

3139
02:10:56,439 --> 02:11:00,439
strains you can grow forever you've got

3140
02:10:58,319 --> 02:11:02,558
infinite resources to keep growing them

3141
02:11:00,439 --> 02:11:04,359
you can take clones or seeds if you want

3142
02:11:02,559 --> 02:11:05,760
to do a little breeding what are you

3143
02:11:04,359 --> 02:11:08,759
going to take with

3144
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:08,760
you

3145
02:11:09,319 --> 02:11:18,399
H H that's a good one

3146
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:20,639
um uh I really like well I I think I

3147
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:22,799
think I would take a big batch of sage

3148
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:25,400
seeds like if I could go back to like my

3149
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:28,440
998 like the last time I made seeds

3150
02:11:25,399 --> 02:11:31,960
myself from those original parents those

3151
02:11:28,439 --> 02:11:33,558
98 seeds I'd take a big batch of those

3152
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:34,880
um because there's so much diversity in

3153
02:11:33,559 --> 02:11:36,520
there and you could kind of like you

3154
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:40,520
know Steer the ship whatever Direction

3155
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:43,360
you wanted I kind of feel but I um I

3156
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:46,679
want to give props to my um good friend

3157
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:49,839
who recently passed away um Michael who

3158
02:11:46,679 --> 02:11:54,559
grew some amazing amazing um land Race

3159
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:58,800
drive varieties in and he had um an El

3160
02:11:54,559 --> 02:12:02,920
Dorado that was just so elegant and so

3161
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:05,960
like just made you feel like

3162
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:08,000
whole um and I used to love smoking that

3163
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:13,039
and I also used to love smoking his

3164
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:18,198
African Haze um from Ace seeds because

3165
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:19,880
it you know is truly psychedelic weed um

3166
02:12:18,198 --> 02:12:22,118
you know and I guess that's I guess what

3167
02:12:19,880 --> 02:12:24,159
I would get out of that is like I don't

3168
02:12:22,118 --> 02:12:28,000
I I want I love flower that makes you

3169
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:31,238
feel like comfortable and relaxed and

3170
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,960
and connected um but I also love flower

3171
02:12:31,238 --> 02:12:36,078
that gets you right on that Razor's Edge

3172
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:38,920
of being uncomfortably High you know

3173
02:12:36,078 --> 02:12:41,679
like like sweaty palms and just like oh

3174
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:43,158
who wow and to me some of those those

3175
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:46,639
African varieties and some of those

3176
02:12:43,158 --> 02:12:49,960
hazes are just have that in a way where

3177
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:53,199
it's like it's the uh you know it's the

3178
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:55,198
sacrament side of cannabis and I i'

3179
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:59,158
would always want that to be a part of

3180
02:12:55,198 --> 02:13:01,118
of my life you know 100% I love that I

3181
02:12:59,158 --> 02:13:04,439
love that you touched on that our next

3182
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:06,359
question is who are your three top three

3183
02:13:04,439 --> 02:13:08,799
or just three of your favorite breeders

3184
02:13:06,359 --> 02:13:08,799
from all

3185
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:14,880
time wow that's a good one um well the

3186
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:16,960
first the the first one that pops I got

3187
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:19,920
to give props to David Watson because he

3188
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:21,719
gave us the things that we used to breed

3189
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:24,319
all the things that we love

3190
02:13:21,719 --> 02:13:25,920
you know in a big way you know so

3191
02:13:24,319 --> 02:13:28,118
without you can't talk about a breeder

3192
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:30,118
without talking about David um just

3193
02:13:28,118 --> 02:13:31,679
because I'm a total Haze head and we

3194
02:13:30,118 --> 02:13:35,319
wouldn't even though he didn't develop

3195
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:36,760
Haze but he made and distrib he he

3196
02:13:35,319 --> 02:13:38,719
created the haze that we all know and

3197
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:42,920
love today or at least brought it to the

3198
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:45,118
World um I love what bod has been doing

3199
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:47,639
over the years and I love just the idea

3200
02:13:45,118 --> 02:13:49,719
of sourcing that diversity and making

3201
02:13:47,639 --> 02:13:52,639
crosses to bring it to people and let

3202
02:13:49,719 --> 02:13:56,679
people play with it and go forward that

3203
02:13:52,639 --> 02:14:01,760
way I think that that's that's just um

3204
02:13:56,679 --> 02:14:05,719
um really has a a huge role in cannabis

3205
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:09,760
and then I'd have to say

3206
02:14:05,719 --> 02:14:11,279
um because I mean I I I you know I and

3207
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:12,760
I've had discussions with people about

3208
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:14,559
this difference between a breeder or a

3209
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:17,760
seed producer and seed companies versus

3210
02:14:14,559 --> 02:14:21,320
breeders and it they are different to me

3211
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:23,320
you know because people like um you know

3212
02:14:21,319 --> 02:14:25,000
Lee and Steve habba and the work that

3213
02:14:23,319 --> 02:14:27,558
they did with Nao research they did

3214
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:29,679
really amazing breeder breeding work you

3215
02:14:27,559 --> 02:14:31,400
know and but I think what people want to

3216
02:14:29,679 --> 02:14:33,880
hear is like what about the stuff that's

3217
02:14:31,399 --> 02:14:36,078
out there today you know and that's why

3218
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:37,840
bod I think is so important because he's

3219
02:14:36,078 --> 02:14:40,118
brought he brings the fire he brings

3220
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:41,719
things that are relevant in the modern

3221
02:14:40,118 --> 02:14:43,759
world but also brings the things that

3222
02:14:41,719 --> 02:14:47,439
have that diversity from all that

3223
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:49,559
cannabis can be um and I think I already

3224
02:14:47,439 --> 02:14:51,439
mentioned well I'll just say Okay Todd

3225
02:14:49,559 --> 02:14:55,000
McCormick is also doing something

3226
02:14:51,439 --> 02:14:56,638
amazing by keeping the the um the

3227
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,559
primary colors of cannabis the

3228
02:14:56,639 --> 02:15:01,239
foundational building blocks keeping

3229
02:14:58,559 --> 02:15:03,840
them separate but still available I

3230
02:15:01,238 --> 02:15:07,799
think that's super important the inl the

3231
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:11,078
skunk onean the Durban the hay um those

3232
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:12,960
things if you look at what they created

3233
02:15:11,078 --> 02:15:16,000
we can't just Overlook that they're

3234
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:17,559
still available as tools you know and I

3235
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,198
think that that's really important to

3236
02:15:17,559 --> 02:15:21,520
not just rapidly move forward in a poly

3237
02:15:20,198 --> 02:15:23,638
hybrid world

3238
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,960
but to always keep going back and say

3239
02:15:23,639 --> 02:15:27,118
like you know that's why like if I could

3240
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:30,039
go back I'd go back to the 70s and 80s

3241
02:15:27,118 --> 02:15:33,558
and pull things from there so um I'll

3242
02:15:30,039 --> 02:15:34,880
say yeah David Todd and bod I'll give

3243
02:15:33,559 --> 02:15:38,119
those three for the work that they're

3244
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:40,719
doing for sure some super solid picks I

3245
02:15:38,118 --> 02:15:42,880
can get behind I love those ones and you

3246
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:46,279
almost preempted my final question so

3247
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:48,520
let's flesh it out as usual I got a time

3248
02:15:46,279 --> 02:15:50,679
machine you can use it to go anywhere

3249
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:52,480
any place anytime collect whatever you

3250
02:15:50,679 --> 02:15:54,719
want where are you g to go what are you

3251
02:15:52,479 --> 02:15:54,718
g to

3252
02:15:55,039 --> 02:15:59,719
collect um well the funny thing is I

3253
02:15:58,078 --> 02:16:02,118
just thought about like I thought about

3254
02:15:59,719 --> 02:16:03,679
the early early days of cannabis and I

3255
02:16:02,118 --> 02:16:07,000
was thinking about like that story about

3256
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:10,719
my mom and you know I'm a I love jazz

3257
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:13,118
jazz is really um I love I love how

3258
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:18,480
cannabis fits into

3259
02:16:13,118 --> 02:16:21,000
jazz um it's like and that's trust me

3260
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:22,759
they weren't smoking Afghan that's a

3261
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,639
perfect example of like where sativa

3262
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:26,239
fits in and Afghan doesn't if you're

3263
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:28,599
playing

3264
02:16:26,238 --> 02:16:30,598
bbop and you're doing this crazy like

3265
02:16:28,599 --> 02:16:32,359
improvisational stuff with like six

3266
02:16:30,599 --> 02:16:34,159
different people and you're like on the

3267
02:16:32,359 --> 02:16:36,000
edge of your seat just trying to move as

3268
02:16:34,159 --> 02:16:37,439
fast as you can you need a different

3269
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,318
type of cannabis you need something

3270
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:43,200
that's stimulating and like just like

3271
02:16:39,318 --> 02:16:46,359
thought-provoking and um so I I love the

3272
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:49,880
idea of these varieties that people were

3273
02:16:46,359 --> 02:16:53,679
consuming in the 40s 50s and early 60s

3274
02:16:49,879 --> 02:16:55,920
before this kind of drug trade happened

3275
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:59,200
because of beat Nicks and hippies you

3276
02:16:55,920 --> 02:17:01,679
know because that stuff was more land

3277
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:04,240
race in my opinion because there wasn't

3278
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:05,558
a bunch of guys from California going

3279
02:17:04,239 --> 02:17:07,718
down to Mexico and saying no I want you

3280
02:17:05,558 --> 02:17:09,599
to grow it like this or grow this way or

3281
02:17:07,718 --> 02:17:11,839
grow this one more than this one because

3282
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:15,040
this is the one we want to buy it was

3283
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:18,558
really you know Colombian and Brazilian

3284
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:22,000
and African and Indian and Thai and you

3285
02:17:18,558 --> 02:17:23,558
know but probably majority Mexico um but

3286
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:26,280
it was a different type of cannabis I

3287
02:17:23,558 --> 02:17:29,358
imagine and it was also the stuff that

3288
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:32,559
kind of made us fall in love with modern

3289
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:35,960
cannabis you know through um through

3290
02:17:32,558 --> 02:17:38,959
that blues and jazz culture um you know

3291
02:17:35,959 --> 02:17:41,478
it was just so prevalent and it married

3292
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:44,318
well with that type of music and that

3293
02:17:41,478 --> 02:17:47,119
type of mindset and that open-mindedness

3294
02:17:44,318 --> 02:17:48,718
and that kind of liberal freeth thinking

3295
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:51,840
um it would have been really cool to

3296
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:53,159
know you know what was Louis Armstrong

3297
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:54,880
puffing on although I heard he was

3298
02:17:53,159 --> 02:17:56,799
puffing on some pretty bad stress but I

3299
02:17:54,879 --> 02:17:58,959
heard some of the other cats like later

3300
02:17:56,799 --> 02:18:00,920
in the 50s were like man we got really

3301
02:17:58,959 --> 02:18:03,919
good stuff now Louie you know you should

3302
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:06,239
try what we got now um and I I just

3303
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:08,120
loved to to to know what that was like

3304
02:18:06,239 --> 02:18:09,718
because you know like back to my mom's

3305
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:11,160
story when she tells her story about the

3306
02:18:09,718 --> 02:18:13,558
first weed she smoked it sounded like

3307
02:18:11,159 --> 02:18:14,959
really good weed sound sounded like the

3308
02:18:13,558 --> 02:18:17,558
kind of experience that everyone would

3309
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:20,879
like to have um so I'd just be super

3310
02:18:17,558 --> 02:18:22,638
duper curious what that was like totally

3311
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:25,079
I I love that that would be brilliant to

3312
02:18:22,638 --> 02:18:27,119
know what they were puffing on for sure

3313
02:18:25,079 --> 02:18:28,920
so with that I think it just about

3314
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,439
brings us to the end of it for this one

3315
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:31,760
were there any comments or shout outs

3316
02:18:30,439 --> 02:18:35,479
you wanted to

3317
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:38,120
make no I think we touched on a lot um I

3318
02:18:35,478 --> 02:18:42,000
had a great time you you really know how

3319
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:43,960
to get the conversation going here um so

3320
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,040
yeah no I was really really stoked to to

3321
02:18:43,959 --> 02:18:48,518
have this conversation with you and and

3322
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:51,359

3324
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:55,318
excited for the work that you're doing

3325
02:18:52,679 --> 02:18:56,558
man I I think that you are these type of

3326
02:18:55,318 --> 02:18:59,239
stories and the people that you're

3327
02:18:56,558 --> 02:19:02,920
interviewing are really important and

3328
02:18:59,239 --> 02:19:05,359
you know um the genetics and the people

3329
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:07,159
and their stories are kind of like the

3330
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:09,519
last big most important thing we have to

3331
02:19:07,159 --> 02:19:11,718
offer as we come out of prohibition I do

3332
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:14,120
really feel that that you know all the

3333
02:19:11,718 --> 02:19:16,199
other stuff is going to handle itself

3334
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:18,439
you know in terms of like Agriculture

3335
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:20,479
and the supply chain and commerce and

3336
02:19:18,439 --> 02:19:21,519
dispensaries and laws and regulations

3337
02:19:20,478 --> 02:19:23,478
but

3338
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:25,719
the plants and the people that brought

3339
02:19:23,478 --> 02:19:27,358
them here that can never be changed and

3340
