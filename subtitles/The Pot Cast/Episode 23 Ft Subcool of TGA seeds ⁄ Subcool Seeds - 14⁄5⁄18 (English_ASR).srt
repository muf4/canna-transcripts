thank you very much

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,680
so first question we're going to do a

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
little change of pace here i want to

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,680
know what are you smoking on right now

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,560
um i'm smoking uh cookies and cream

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,040
live resin rosin that um a friend of

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,280
mine sent to me because i'm getting the

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,000
cubans cookies and cream cut next week

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,359
so i'm beta testing this live rosin and

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,759
it tastes like

32
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,599
caramel and coffee with creamer in it

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,478
it's delicious

34
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,399
wow

35
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,078
i certainly have never had anything that

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,840
nice before do you think that's kind of

37
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,719
the future of concentrate is going in

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,359
this super primo fashion

39
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,200
yeah i think so i am i mean i was a big

40
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,040
rosin head before the house burned down

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,680
i had a sasquatch rosin press and i

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,600
learned so much about it and

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,600
the flavors and everything you can get

44
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,478
are just amazing you take some really

45
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,158
high quality water hash and you press it

46
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,640
and press all the contaminants out of it

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,640
and what you're left with is

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
truly some of the smoothest tastiest

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,439
stuff in the world now i prefer to smoke

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,439
thc crystals which are torture made you

51
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,560
know with solvents and stuff

52
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,719
but you can't beat the flavor of live

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,080
resin breast it's like like i said it's

54
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,239
like eating caramel but smoking it

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,920
nice and so are you a fan of the

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,200
sasquatch presses i've seen a few people

57
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,759
with them

58
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,439
yeah i am i'm more a fan of the the

59
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,799
people that were really nice to me and

60
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,560
now the rosin pressers are good there's

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
so many people out there but sasquatch

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,640
themselves made me a press put my logo

63
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,919
on it shipped it to me and then when my

64
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,199
house burnt down they built me another

65
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,799
one and they have it ready to ship to my

66
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,479
new house and that's pretty nice

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
customer service

68
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,919
yeah i can't argue with that so we'll

69
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,840
jump back on to the regular first

70
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,958
question now what was your first

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
experience with cannabis

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
this is going to draw out because it

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,719
sounds like such [ __ ] but it's the

74
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,839
truth so when i was around nine years

75
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,878
old

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,759
i had the opportunity to go to a concert

77
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,799
with a guy that had a roach okay

78
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,479
seriously

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
so i think it was edgar winter or

80
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,000
something so we walked around the entire

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,680
show even though everybody was smoking

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,919
cannabis everywhere and we were too

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,439
scared to smoke it because we were kids

84
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,799
and so we went home to his house and i

85
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,959
remember we stood on the toilet and

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
turned the fan on and we each got one

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,598
hit

88
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,560
and we blew it up into the thing

89
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,158
and

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,800
i will never forget what it tasted like

91
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,719
it was to me the most incredible

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,920
interesting thing i'd ever done in my

93
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,239
life

94
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,000
so about a year and a half later i had a

95
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
best friend who had an older sister who

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
i used to look at her you know she was

97
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,799
she was cute i used to have the thing

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,400
for and

99
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,239
her boyfriend left roaches in the

100
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
ashtray really long ones he was a

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,840
cannabis seller and i mean he was my

102
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,000
hero he was sleeping with her

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,158
and he had weed you know so i used to

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,080
steal his joints roaches not steal his

105
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,840
weed but take his you know lipstick on

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
them from her and we'd take them out

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
back and smoke them and this was

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
colombian gold

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,000
so it would make our ears ring and i

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,759
have to continue the one thing so the

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
first time i got high

112
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,239
i heard in my head i mean really high

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,400
about a little 10-ish or 11. i heard

114
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
this

115
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,840
and i heard it for years when i got high

116
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,840
and i was 15 when i heard the immigrant

117
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,199
song and i heard the sound again

118
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,478
why the hell did i hear the immigrant

119
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
song when i got high even though i

120
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,478
didn't know led zeppelin was

121
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,758
huh there you go you reckon maybe

122
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,918
you you heard it when you were really

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,439
young or not just never exposed to it i

124
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,560
don't know i think led zeppelin smoked

125
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,319
some weed and heard it and that's why

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
they wrote the song

127
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,680
that's a good explanation

128
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
so

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,360
kind of from that point forward how did

130
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,799
you really get into cannabis i guess you

131
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,720
obviously just progressively started to

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
smoke more from that age at what point

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
did you kind of become did cannabis

134
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,000
become really quite involved in your

135
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,680
life

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,600
well i went to back up a little bit so i

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,160
come from this i come from the south

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,320
where um cannabis was very prohibited

139
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,080
and it was very expensive so at a fairly

140
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,879
early age i don't want to

141
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,879
i don't want to lie 16 17 i think i had

142
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,639
a car you know i started buying weed

143
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,360
from a guy and selling it and so i was

144
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,560
the weed guy you know always i bought

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,720
pounds of seeded crappy commercial weed

146
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,120
and our profit margin back then was we

147
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,680
sold six ounces to make our money

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
and then we kept six ounces of stash or

149
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
or whatever and that that's the way it

150
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,680
always worked and so

151
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,000
that continued until the drug war kept

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
in and cannabis went to 400 an ounce

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,639
down in gainesville with gainesville

154
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
green and

155
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,478
at that time i started growing i got

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,160
some seeds and i

157
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,959
from a bag and i put them out in my yard

158
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
and i

159
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,959
i grew some tall male female plants and

160
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,560
when they got about my height i cut them

161
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,519
down and smoked them

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,120
and then um i started reading um ed's

163
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,478
book um they did there weren't such

164
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,840
things as the internet so i started

165
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,519
reading books

166
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,799
and it was a book called since amelia

167
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:57,198
tips and i had pictures of pot plants on

168
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,520
concrete blocks with fans and lights and

169

i talked about females and males and i i

170
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,439

maturity and i was like wait a minute i

173

174
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,918
we actually grew really good cannabis

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,519
outside i mean we harvested at the end

176
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,799

really good

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
and we instantly became famous people in

179
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,000
our circle because we had dank seedless

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,120

187
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,839
i'm very gregarious and loud but it's to

188
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,679
hide a shyness

189
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,839

190
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840

like i belong in the world and

196
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,439
and i just ran with it i mean i started

197
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,240
growing indoors um i was growing in

198
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,120
georgia by the time i was

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,598
in my 30s um i'll tell the story quick i

200
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,199
went to amsterdam to buy some seeds and

201
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,800
the guy that i was living with decided

202
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,919
to rip all the pot plants off while i

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
was gone

204
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,598
and kind of set up a pot plant in the

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,519
front yard to get me busted so i came

206
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,199
back to a police tape

207
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,038
and that was my first bust i went down

208
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,038
for five years for

209
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,759
um they found the trailer where he moved

210
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,639
everything so they got us for 362 plants

211
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,400
um

212
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
he got the majority of the problems

213
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,679
because i was out of town but but i got

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,880
my five

215
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,439
and then i moved to florida because they

216
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,879
banned me from georgia and my son was in

217
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,279
georgia so i wanted to see him on the

218
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,800
weekends so i illegally moved close

219
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,079
where i could skip over the state line

220
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,598
and see him

221
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,038
and i started doing the one thing i know

222
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,959
best i started growing weed in

223
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,318

224
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,079

me

248
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,038
and that is when i moved to the west

249
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,680

250

251
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,199
illegal and i stopped getting in trouble

252
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,000
wow we definitely need to whine back

253
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,759
there there's hours worth of stories to

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
dig into so the first thing which caught

255
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,879
my attention was all the way back at the

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,120
start you mentioned um ed's book in

257
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,480
those early days who were some of the

258
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,480
other people who you looked up to

259
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,720
besides ed you know because i the thing

260
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
that i seem to notice was besides ed and

261
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,639
maybe neville there wasn't a lot of

262
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,958
people you really could look up to

263
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,399
there was no one mate i mean we heard

264
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,919
heard of jack but

265
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,000
you know uh me and ed are friends if you

266
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,639
guys don't know ed is really calling pop

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
he calls me son he published my book

268
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,199
he helped me get my book in the

269
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,240

of congress i mean the guy's awesome guy

271
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
but it's not like i believe everything

272
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,240
ed says the whole photos interrupt this

273
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,360
thing we used to argue but when i was

274
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,639
growing up there was one book

275
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,800
it was the marijuana encyclopedias it it

276
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,720
sat on our toilet when we went to the

277
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,559
bathroom we read it and it was ed and

278
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,560
mel and we read it forwards and

279
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
backwards and backwards and forwards

280
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,000
and that's i mean that and sense of

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,200
media tips i mentioned it earlier i

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,120
don't know if you remember since emilia

283
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,759
tips that was the first

284
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,919
cannabis magazine i ever saw because

285
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,399
at the time high times had cocaine and

286
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,799
heroin and pills and it wasn't a

287
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,639
cannabis cultivation magazine it was a

288
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,479
drug magazine so

289
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,000
yeah there was no one else there was no

290
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
internet and there were no books and

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,120
believe me in georgia you didn't even

292
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
let anybody know you had that growth

293
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,519
book

294
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,120
yeah wow different times wasn't it so

295
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,799

296
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,399
strains were you growing were there any

297
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,919

stream i grew was grape ape but it's not

302
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560

303
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,079
bag of wheat we bought from tabi island

334
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,120
for ten seeds and i grew it out and

335
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,278
i i didn't like it i was like well my

336
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,360
grape eight was better

337
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,439
so that's when i actually flew to

338
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,360
amsterdam for the first time and bought

339
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
uh i got a bunch of american growers

340
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,480
that i know

341
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,120
and we got 3 000 american dollars which

342
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,839
was 8 000 gilder

343
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,440
and i smuggled back uh about a thousand

344
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,800
seeds for all the growers i know in the

345
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,760
united states i put them in my belt

346
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,679
buckle

347
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,240
and we snuck them all out and from that

348
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,399
and this is going to sound so cocky from

349
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
that overgrowth was formed

350
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
because some of my friends got northern

351
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,440
lights and some of my guys got black

352
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
dominants some of my guys got white

353
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,839
widow and some of my guys got russian

354
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,079
and we all started working together and

355
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,160
growing and working with the canadians

356
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,759
that also have genetics and that's how

357
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,600
these things form i mean northern lights

358
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,559
5 bam right there in the channel is

359
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,759
being mixed with white widow and g13

360
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,638
and some of those trains are still

361
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,519
around today my favorite is a mighty

362
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,079
mite

363
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,159
chemo widow it would blister you like it

364
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,159
would make you not be able to speak it

365
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,719
was so strong

366
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,159
wow and obviously that's not commonly

367
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
spoken about at all i guess a lot of

368
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,439
this stuff has fallen off

369
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,278
it's fallen off and it's gotten mixed in

370
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,680
with others and you know remember those

371
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,320
stories i told so in georgia

372
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,399
when they rated me i lost 83 mothers i

373
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,480
lost dank ass [ __ ]

374
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,200
a dab it's a strain that growers would

375
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,879
know i lost i lost nebu's uh uh rush and

376
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,440
i mean i lost lost tons and tons of moms

377
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,838
and then i lost another thousand seeds

378
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,560
that can never be replaced and i would

379
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
imagine that a lot of the core genetics

380
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,159
that we have built and collected over

381
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,639
the years before the things changed it

382
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,759
got destroyed by the police

383
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,240
wow

384
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,919
and so just to look back on that trip to

385
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,200
amsterdam quickly

386
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,399
do you remember what brands you were

387
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
buying based off what you said it

388
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,440
sounded like you were buying a lot of

389
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,879
the seed bank and

390
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
as well as maybe

391
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,480
um super sativa seed club you know were

392
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,559
those the people who were around at that

393
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,000
time or was it a little after that no no

394
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,399
they were the greenhouse was there we i

395
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,399
was a big fan of serious seeds a white

396
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,958
russian ak-47 a huge fan and also

397
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,198
tony with sargamantha who comes to my

398
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,239
chat channel and hangs out i'm blown

399
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,559
away

400
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,759
so he used to sell that yum bolt

401
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,278
and we went to a place they're called

402
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,879
the grey area and the gray area is an

403
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,919
americanized coffee shop it's not dutch

404
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,480
they have

405
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,519
soda pops and rock and roll and metal

406
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
tables

407
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,879
and the keith they had there the cali ms

408
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,519
keith was some of the best i've ever

409
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,000
smoked in my life so we went to buy the

410
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,919
genetics we smoked at the coffee shop we

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,639
were naive we were like that's where the

412
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,439
good [ __ ] is that's where the good seeds

413
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,680
are

414
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,279
so that first trip we bought a lot of ak

415
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,879
and by the way that ak that i bought

416
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,039
that cherry aka

417
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,439
still used to breed with today by about

418
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,519
four breeding companies

419
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,959
well yeah so are you of the opinion that

420
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,360
the stock back then was generally of

421
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,359
higher quality than it is today

422
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,519
yeah i'm i don't want to start a war but

423
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,519
for sure it's pretty common for them to

424
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,919
lose a mother and a father

425
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,120
and just grow it out again and start an

426
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:42,799
f2 i mean i can guarantee you that ak-47

427
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,560
we bought in 87 was not the ak-47 that i

428
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,240
grew out three years ago it was

429
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,399
homogenized crap

430
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,159
and i'm not talking talking bags it was

431
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,360
tons i got three pounds off the off the

432
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,600
back

433
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,360
giant plants but it was homogenized it

434
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,040
lacked character in what we call dank

435
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,680
yeah okay

436
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,198
so if we scoot a little forward then you

437
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,039
mentioned coming back a lot of these

438
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,319
genetics giving birth to kind of

439
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,240
overgrown

440
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,278
before that was there many people

441
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,600
bringing seeds back do you think

442
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,360
um there were but we weren't organized

443
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,159
this is what overgrow gave to us

444
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,159
overgrow gave us a platform to speak so

445
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,838
i was speaking to bogg and i was

446
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,919
speaking to soul

447
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,760
and i was speaking to be kai

448
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,679
and we started sharing notes well what

449
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,439
are you growing what do you breed well i

450
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,120
make killer queen what do you make well

451
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,880
i have a g13

452
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,198
and that's when we started trading

453
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:38,078
genetics and growing together so

454
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,639
me and seoul and sly used to

455
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,439
talk a lot with the a13

456
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,320
um the cindy and then vic had the space

457
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,279
queen

458
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,680
so if you wonder how i created vortex

459
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,039
i knew those guys so they gave me their

460
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,559
genetics

461
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,958
i crossed them together

462
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,198
and i get a lot of credit for the a13

463
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,758
across the vortex because it won the

464
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:03,039
cannabis cup a guy grew out of five pack

465
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,039
renamed it god's [ __ ] and beat me

466
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,480
and but it's it's not rocket science i

467
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,679
mean i got the very best phenotype from

468
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,039
um

469
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:15,359
from seoul which was one female a13 out

470
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,278
of 500 seeds the only one that existed

471
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
and then i crossed at times space queen

472
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,559
i mean

473
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,159
i'm sorry but if you have really good

474
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,479
[ __ ] you mix it together i don't think

475
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,319
you need to be super skilled and i take

476
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
heat on that people like well subs not a

477
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,680
breeder

478
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,759
well i don't know i made jack the ripper

479
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,758
you know i had to make it somehow and it

480
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,919
started back then so

481
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,959
the exchange of knowledge through

482
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,799
overgrowth changed the world it allowed

483
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,518
me to talk to another grower how do you

484
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,278
grow a growing water what's your ph this

485
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,360
what are you growing this

486
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,958
that knowledge just

487
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,639
superspeeded

488
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,439
cannabis growing in america we learned

489
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,519
about lights we learned about co2 we

490
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,000
learned about nutrients we learned about

491
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,879
super soil through vic

492
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,519
vic had a very basic recipe online

493
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,038
called vicks super soil and i still have

494
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,838
that copy

495
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,919
i took the recipe and added about 25

496
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,318
units of things to it

497
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,000
to make it better in my opinion

498
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,959
and people still use that super soil

499
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,959
today

500
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,038
without overgrowth i would have never

501
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,798
talked to vic vick would have never gave

502
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,279
me his recipe and we would have never

503
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,078
had super soul so it was the knowledge

504
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,480
that overgrow gave us it wasn't all the

505
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,639
[ __ ] and the trolls and

506
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,640
the karma liking system it was being

507
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,640
able to pm bog

508
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,038
and say bro let me have a cut of your

509
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,120
bog bubble sure sub how about how about

510
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,599
a cut of your jack's cleaner yeah boo

511
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,439
let's make jack's cleaner blueberry

512
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,439
which bog still uses today to make

513
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,960
lifesaver

514
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,880
yeah that's interesting you just you

515
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,960
touched on so many questions i think

516
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,679
we'll rewind back try to quickly touch

517
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
on

518
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,720
you reference the god's [ __ ] that was

519
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,120
funny i had a question i was going to

520
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,960
ask later basically do you have any

521
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,798
plans to maybe try to get that cut and

522
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,640
breed with it because my friends from

523
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,400
round table basically explained this cut

524
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,600
to me and they were saying like yeah

525
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
it's you're not going to believe it it's

526
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,639
phenomenal and so immediately i was like

527
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,320
like you know what's the go with that

528
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,360
if you grow 100 seeds vortex seeds

529
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,918
you'll get 49 of those phenotypes

530
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,798
see uh one there was one percent

531
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,440
difference between my phenotype and his

532
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,759
mine tasted a little peachy his was a

533
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,160
little more lemony and that year the

534
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,079
judges that were judging like citrus

535
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,919
they were stand even and that sounds

536
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,678
cocky but it's not it's

537
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,120
last i was looking for a male vortex

538
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,759
okay about six years ago and this is

539
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,479
documented on roll it up so i started 20

540
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,599
seeds and i got 19 damn females not what

541
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,400
i wanted

542
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,839
and

543
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,360
every single one of them was exactly the

544
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,879
same i mean if you go look at the thread

545
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,879
there's 19 plants we're just taking

546
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,400
pictures of them over and over again

547
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,120
they look exactly the same

548
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,640
slight differences between peach pear

549
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,879
lemon you know that

550
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,400
that slight essence of cannabis terps

551
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,400
but it's the most stable strain i've

552
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,280
ever created i didn't do anything to it

553
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,559
but cross a male and a female plant

554
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,079
yeah okay

555
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:09,599
so another thing i just remembered that

556
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,918
you spoke about was you referenced

557
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,199
talking to sly sly's someone who really

558
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,799
had to get a lot of information about

559
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,480
him what was your relationship with him

560
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,279
like and you know kind of how was your

561
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,919
what was your impression of him

562
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,000
well you know slice um both fly and vic

563
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,840
um and me had a very unique way of

564
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
learning we argued with each other i

565
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,720
mean you if you would have seen it it

566
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,558
was like you dumbass you don't know what

567
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
you're talking about but that exchange

568
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,240
of information

569
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,320
got us somewhere but sly was the kinder

570
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,359
he was the smarter he was the scientist

571
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,960
you know

572
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,959
um

573
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
a soul was definitely more the sales guy

574
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,679
i mean i'm not knocking rick if he was

575
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,280
sitting here right beside me i'd say the

576
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
same thing he was with his fingernail

577
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,960
polish and his and his cinderella

578
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,480
slippers i mean he's a

579
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,319
good good good

580
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
um salesman and a very good

581
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,879
representative for the company but sly

582
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,360
had the brains man he knew

583
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,880
he knew about dominant dominance and and

584
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,399
traits and he knew how to work these

585
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
trains together and he knew what would

586
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,360
work

587
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,919
and as importantly he's brave enough to

588
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,918
send us all clones so if you knew vig

589
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,000
high when i was

590
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,000
20-ish if you asked vic for a clone he

591
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,440
just sent you a cut out of killer queen

592
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,038
and we didn't have clone shippers back

593
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,640
then dude it was

594
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,158
a different game but he got it done

595
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,840
that's cool so something i did wanted to

596
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,080
quickly mention was

597
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,918
i think for a lot of people like myself

598
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,839
you were the person who kind of got them

599
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,840
into organics through making the super

600
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,279
soil easy so obviously you know a big

601
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,639
thank you for that because i'm very

602
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,558
passionate about organics now but

603
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,720
something which it led me to do was to

604
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,558
dive further into the supersore recipe

605
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,400
and i believe i found a screenshot of a

606
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,440
really old overgrowth thread where vic

607
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,320
actually says that he found the recipe

608
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,960
in

609
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,558
an old book by like forest agronomist or

610
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,038
something like that and he basically

611
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,798
said that um they would make this recipe

612
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,558
they would put the dry amendments under

613
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,079
big trees when they transplanted big

614
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,599
trees into forests so that you know

615
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,599
they'd grow into the nutrient-dense

616
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,959
stuff anyway i found it was interesting

617
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,918
because what it essentially goes to show

618
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,759
is you know it's just it's just

619
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,679
continually built over time and i think

620
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,158
that that's a bit of a people make the

621
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,640
mistake of thinking that he fully made

622
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,840
it and it's never been modified and the

623
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,520
point that you brought up is really

624
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,519
relevant that you added a lot to it and

625
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,038
if you do compare his recipe to yours

626
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,359
you'll see that yours is a lot more kind

627
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,200
of holistic in in all of the amendments

628
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,119
whereas his is a lot more bare bones and

629
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,960
it's just you know like manure and blood

630
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,879
and bone and one or two other things

631
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,640
really

632
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,159
and it goes further i mean you know kids

633
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,000
take my super soil that are smarter than

634
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,760
me and they adjust it they measure it

635
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
they take it to soil shops

636
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,960
build a soil has an entire [ __ ]

637
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,200
thread

638
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,960
based on my super soil where one

639
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,640
scientist says i'm an idiot and it

640
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,120
doesn't work and another scientist

641
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
explains why it does work and you can

642
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,599
buy

643
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,439
super soil and build a soil you can buy

644
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,639
the dirt and a charge pack and you just

645
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,360
mix the [ __ ] up and put the

646
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,360
worm castings in and you have it so

647
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,678
the only thing i did with with supersoul

648
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,119
was give people the idea to mix it up in

649
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,960
your backyard and play with it i mean

650
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,000
we've made hot batches we've made coal

651
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,079
batches

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,599
gnats are part of super soil i'll go

653
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,798
ahead and tell you now the newest thing

654
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,798
we do

655
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,639
is we put two inches of neen cake on top

656
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,519
of all the barrels after we make super

657
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,120
soil

658
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,279
it prevents the fungus gnats from

659
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,719
getting down into the compost and then

660
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,240
the manure

661
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,240
and then when you go to use it you just

662
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,759
scrape the neem cake off with your hands

663
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,079
and throw it away and a little bit extra

664
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,798
that stays is good for the soil this is

665
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,199
something brand new we figured out so

666
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:36,400
super soil is not static and it's not

667
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,759
for sale it's the way a guy grows pot so

668
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,840
i mean if somebody wants to give me [ __ ]

669
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,359
about it they can kiss my ass it's how i

670
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,119
grow pot

671
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,798
and vic vic taught me to take dirt and

672
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,479
mix it up in tubs

673
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,720
and then the other thing that we do now

674
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,279
is when we first made super soil we used

675
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,279
really shitty ingredients like i buy the

676
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,639
most expensive ingredients now organic

677
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,798
down to earth

678
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,360
expensive soils

679
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,519
nice crab meals stuff that's made

680
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,839
properly and not not cheap and that's

681
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,440
another reason super soil works well and

682
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,199
just so you know i mean we have people

683
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,200
here in arizona that grow commercially

684
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,558
in super soil buildings full of the

685
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
stuff

686
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,359
and i think

687
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,279
maybe i'm wrong

688
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,199
but i think the no-till revolution kind

689
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,720
of spurned from this what do you do with

690
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
all the super soul well we don't want to

691
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,519
throw it away so guys started figuring

692
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,798
out how to do no-till and treat with

693
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,558
teas and

694
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,960
hell geek mike up in oregon takes a

695
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,119
super soil and runs it through like a

696
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,960
a machine and shakes everything out of

697
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,599
it and rebuilds it like he's got a

698
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,200
factory to redo super soil so they don't

699
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,599
throw it away so

700
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,360
vic taught us so much he taught us that

701
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,319
you could grow dank

702
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,000
without hydroponics and then a lot of us

703
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,319
played with the soil until we got it

704
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,679
where it is today

705
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,119
yeah i think there's definitely some

706
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
truth in that statement you made in

707
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,439
regards to super soil and the no-till

708
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,158
which has come after it something i have

709
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
seen raised a bit though is people do

710
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,240
seem to feel as though super soil is

711
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,599
quite wasteful would you ever you know

712
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,919
in that you do inevitably have to

713
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,439
exchange the soil out after a run or two

714
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,200
would you ever consider doing more of a

715
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,640
no-till option

716
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,038
i'm doing it right now i don't close

717
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,960
super soil out at all i haven't done

718
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,798
super soil out in years

719
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,480
oh that thing yeah we have 100 gallon

720
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,759
pots in our pool we don't reuse it i

721
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,599
mean we don't throw it away we didn't

722
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,000
throw 100 pounds of soil away

723
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,839
you amend it you put teas in it

724
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
one problem indoors is a problem so

725
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,519
outdoors you can amend the pots in the

726
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,599
middle of the season

727
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,599
cover them with straw and you get a nice

728
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,719
you know you get a nice natural

729
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,158
re-amendment

730
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,480
indoors we don't have the same issue i

731
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,520
mean when we finish our giant plants

732
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,200
indoors

733
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,599
we take a five-gallon bucket that's got

734
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,519
the bottom cut off of it like a razor

735
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,959
and cut it down into the pot we cut the

736
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,759
root ball out

737
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,640
but it is the same process you reamend

738
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,440
um

739
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,120
you use teas and you build a giant cover

740
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,159
crop in between while your plants are

741
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,000
vegging

742
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,720
cover it with straw it's the same

743
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,200
process you just have to do it faster

744
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,278
do we have small problems yeah

745
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,600
indoors is not as easy as outdoors but

746
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,200
they're definitely growers now that grow

747
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,000
in super soil that have not changed

748
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,840
their soil out in many years

749
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,159
yeah

750
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,519
totally and so if we just kind of

751
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,600
jump back to what we were talking about

752
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,079
earlier you got back and you had the

753
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,839
seeds and overgrown's just started out

754
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,918
is this when you would consider yourself

755
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,439
to have truly kind of begun the breeders

756
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,120
journey or do you feel like you started

757
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,080
a little before that

758
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,519
no that's where so i made jack's cleaner

759
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,199
um

760
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,278
blueberry

761
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,120
and i made excuse me excuse me excuse me

762
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:43,038
jax cleaner bx and i'm a danny boy and

763
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,678
there was a site a sister site to

764
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,599
overgrow called cannabis world

765
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,240
and on cannabis swirl was the auctions

766
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,319
and so we went to uh sea bay and you

767
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,759
could put your seeds up and i remember

768
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,558
the first pack of seeds i put up with

769
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,558
danny boy was five dollars stayed up for

770
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,158
three days no bids

771
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,759
put it back up

772
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,240
stayed up for two days and someone

773
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,919
bought it for five dollars

774
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,599
within a year

775
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,919
people were bidding on the seeds upwards

776
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,519
of forty to fifty dollars bog joined

777
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,120
soul was in

778
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,319
and i gotta tell you this crazy story

779
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,079
about human nature so in the seed

780
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,119
place you could buy a pack of seeds for

781
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,639
a price it was called instant purchase

782
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,399
but then as a breeder you could lift a

783
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,000
pack of seeds up there for less and let

784
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,960
people bid on it

785
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,200
there's some bizarre human nature

786
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,120
people would bid past the instant

787
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,120
purchase price so there'd be a pack of

788
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,119
danny boy sitting there for 40

789
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,199
and three guys would be bidding up the

790
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,119
other pack to 90 dollars

791
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,159
and as a businessman i just [ __ ]

792
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,359
laughed

793
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,720
i was like if you want to pay me 40 more

794
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,879
dollars for it so you guys can argue

795
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,960
with each other great so an enormous

796
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
amount of money was made on the on the c

797
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,720
bay with people bidding against each

798
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,640
other and that's a form of trolls and

799
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,640
haters already already starting on the

800
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,120
internet people arguing with each other

801
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,799
over a pack of seeds and as a seed

802
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,959
seller not a breeder

803
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,720
i laughed my ass off i was like all over

804
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,159
paying for the seeds

805
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,079
it's just part of the history of seeds

806
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,080
interesting and it seems as though so

807
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,319
many kind of notable breeders did get

808
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,119
their their starting foot

809
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,720
in these in these forums do you feel

810
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,199
like there's any reason as to why we

811
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,798
don't see the same popularity for forums

812
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,880
nowadays it seems to be quite contained

813
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,200
to like instagram

814
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,399
um i think i think trolls are a big part

815
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,679
of it i mean there's there's this we're

816
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,278
going to talk about this as well because

817
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,559
i mean i will bring it up i mean when

818
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,079
you said i was going to go on the show

819
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,158
today at 150 comments that was the

820
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,759
biggest piece of [ __ ] on the planet

821
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,278
so that's in the internet you got to

822
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,679
roll it up right now and it's like hey i

823
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,798

824
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,399
sucks you suck dicks it's just it's

825
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,158
exhausting

826
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,918
on instagram the same thing occurs but

827
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,000
you can block people

828
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,038

829
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,119
comments

830
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,798
on roll it up if somebody's up your ass

831
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:58,239
there's nothing you can do i mean if

832
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,918
every time you post a picture the guy

833
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,839
calls you a dumbass

834
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,640
so that's part of it that's part of it

835
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,639
the other thing is you just said it i

836
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,159
carry instagram in my phone bro i ain't

837
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,840
got to sit at my house and upload

838
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,679
pictures i don't have to

839
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,678
you know remember the old uploading a

840
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,360
picture to overgrow would take like five

841
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,960
minutes remember that [ __ ]

842
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,240
dial-ups and stuff i mean nowadays

843
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,079
somebody sends me a picture i hit a

844
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,599
button and i'm making an advertisement

845
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,759
that's part of it

846
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,079
the other part of it is

847
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,319
i think there are too many

848
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,398
forums i think it got fragmented when

849
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,798
roll it i mean excuse me when overgrow

850
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:36,319
got started that was it bro

851
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:38,319
we were all at one place all of us

852
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,398
now there's roll it up which is run by a

853
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,879
bunch of kids there's no moderator

854
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,278
there's ebay there's icy mag which i've

855
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,960
been banned for life because gypsy

856
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,960
doesn't like me i mean i never even

857
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,399
could go there i was funny one of his

858
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,919
guys called me one day to advertise

859
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,158
there i was like dude

860
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,520

861
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,200
gonna buy an ad

862
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,440
and then there's thousands more there's

863
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,919
cannabis and this and this and this

864
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,519
it's fragmented so instead of

865
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,320
a hundred thousand growers all in one

866
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,000
spot talking every day it's spread apart

867
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,918
i could compare it to dating sites i'm

868
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,599
not you know if there's one dating site

869
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,038
then you meet everybody but if there's a

870
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,158
thousand how the hell do you find

871
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,000
everybody

872
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,440
everybody's on instagram if you're in

873
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,359
the pot business

874
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,200
you're on instagram

875
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,278
yeah that's the truth isn't it

876
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,798
so something we haven't been able to get

877
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,880

878
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,639

883
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,639

903
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,440
decent gentleman when he didn't drink

904
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,880
but in the afternoon he would send me

905
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,558

906

910
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,159
and get him a couple bottles of wine and

911
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,678

internet mate what the [ __ ] you sought

914

915
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,079
attack people online if you haven't i

916
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,519
mean come on and that's what you get the

917
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,439
gypsy in the morning was a fairly decent

918
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,278
guy watch your breakfast take you around

919
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,960

920
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,480
drank he was rude and

921
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,919
i will address that as well there are

922
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,200
people one of the things that somebody

923
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,320
said to me

924
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,798
is that in public i was rude to them

925
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,599
between the time i was diagnosed with a

926
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,200
[ __ ] progressive fatal illness

927
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,199
and today

928
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,960
i went through some [ __ ]

929
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,960
and there was about a year i will tell

930
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,360
you right off i was checked out of life

931
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,278
i was drinking i was taking drugs

932
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,599
i was trying to escape a diagnosis of

933
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,119
choking to death on my own it's not

934
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,439
i got my [ __ ] together and i don't do

935
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,079
drugs anymore i haven't had a drink or a

936
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,600
pharmaceutical drug in over 450 days and

937
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,398
i won't don't think i'll ever do them

938
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,319
again

939
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,239
so the reason i bring that up is alcohol

940
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,398
is a [ __ ] up thing and then

941
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,558
what i found in gypsy

942
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,079
was alcohol not gypsy and i didn't know

943
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,038
that until i

944
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,960
had my own bout with it so about three

945
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,038
years ago if you came in contact with me

946
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,319
and i was rude as [ __ ] to you i was

947
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,679
trying to kill myself because some

948
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,359
doctor told me i was gonna choke to

949
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,000
death in a hospital

950
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,398
i have dealt with it emotionally and i

951
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,159
plan to live my life every day the best

952
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,719
i can until that time comes instead of

953
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,880
sitting around and worrying about it

954
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,240
yeah i think that's a it's a really good

955
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,640
kind of message and i think a lot of

956
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,480
people will be happy to hear that

957
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,600
just to kind of how did you wrap up the

958
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,759
amsterdam i think you said that you

959
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,798
ended up going to canada after that what

960
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,200
was what oh no let's no mate back up so

961
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,839

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,240

1002
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,480
love in his life is such a sad story so

1003
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,720
he'd come to amsterdam and spend his

1004
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,798
yearly income getting laid

1005
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,000
and the second night he came back and

1006
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:35,918
started hard for me to tell but the

1007
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,159
second night he came back

1008
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,200

1009
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,640
course

1010
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,319
and he came in and he sat down and he

1011
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,440

1012

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,038
do you want to go to the hospital he

1017
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,399
goes well do you know where hospital is

1018
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:55,919

1019
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,719
the morning amsterdam my stone as you

1020
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,159

1021
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
so he's like i'm just gonna go down bro

1022
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,440
so he went lay down and the next morning

1023
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,879
at breakfast he wasn't there and i guess

1024
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,720
it was like 7 30 i was like well where

1025
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,399
the hell is he at so i went upstairs and

1026
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,480
he was dead he was laying in gypsy's

1027
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,398
fourth floor and he had died of a heart

1028
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,240
attack in his sleep

1029
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,918
so we had to carry his body down the

1030
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,598
steps first time i'd ever seen a dead

1031
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,960
person and especially my [ __ ] best

1032
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,119
friend oh yeah by the way i performed

1033
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,878
cpr on him for about 30 minutes and

1034
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,599
because i thought death rattle was life

1035
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:23,679
and

1036
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,679
nah perform cpr on a dead guy that's

1037
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,760
always good for your brain

1038
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,440
so we get we get blown out i get blunt

1039
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,720

1040
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,838

1041
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,559

1047
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:50,559
i had about 200 gilder and i called rc

1048
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:53,439

1052
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,480
so i landed god this story is so weird i

1053
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,960
landed and i took a cab to this high

1054
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,280

1055
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,199
it's all these fancy models and jackie

1056
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,440
stewart likes i did not belong there

1057
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,279
dude i was an american on the run with

1058
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,200
my ass kicked

1059
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,640
but there was rc and he picked me up and

1060
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,279
he took me to a little hotel called the

1061
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,358
samurai a little teeny little place and

1062
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,519
he gave me some weed which rc did not

1063
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,279
carry weed because he owned overgrowth

1064
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,199
and he gave me some money

1065
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,040
300 to 400

1066
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,639
and from there i went into the middle of

1067
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,759
the country in amsterdam to i mean

1068
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,719
excuse me

1069
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,320
to winnipeg to a weed nerd's house not

1070
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,118
at the time was not a weed nerd just a

1071
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,400
friend

1072
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,519
and i started him on a girl i was like

1073
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,519
basically can i come to your house and

1074
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,280
grow shitload of weed and he said yeah

1075
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,599
so that's how i got from

1076
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,040
amsterdam to canada was danny dying and

1077
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,720
that's why i named that stream danny

1078
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,880
boyd

1079
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,039
and so how do you think that's affected

1080
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,640
you in the long term having to kind of

1081
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,559
been there for danny's death and the

1082
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,559
subsequent you know there was a it's

1083
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,078
obviously like a dramatic kind of exit

1084
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,440
in its own right

1085
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,560
and what pissed me off because i

1086
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,240
couldn't come back to the united states

1087
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,480
to watch him get buried because i was a

1088
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,559
fugitive from from the law for growing

1089
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,960
[ __ ] plant

1090
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,559
so i had to deal with not going there i

1091
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,320
had to deal with people hating on me

1092
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,799
because i didn't love danny you didn't

1093
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,320
even go up to the [ __ ] funeral

1094
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,079
could imagine how torturous that was i

1095
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,680
was stuck in amsterdam on my best friend

1096
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,119
you know i mean excuse me stuck in a

1097
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,639
knock i was in canada i could not come

1098
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,440
back in the country

1099
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,679
and um i mean i later actually went and

1100
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,039
saw danny's gravestone and danny's

1101
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,279
mother and father were both friends of

1102
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,800
mine danny's father has since died

1103
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,880
and i have to tell you one of the things

1104
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,119
i'll get all [ __ ] sad but one of the

1105
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,200
things i lost in the fire was a

1106
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,960
i had a hand-drawn picture of danny and

1107
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:46,879
it burned up no [ __ ] can't get that

1108
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,400
back so i don't have a picture of danny

1109
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,760
that's tough to hear

1110
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,440
something i thought was always really

1111
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,280
inspiring though is that you did create

1112
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,880
that strain in his honor

1113
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,960
um is that something you ever plan to

1114
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,320
maybe try to work with further maybe

1115
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,679
bring it back i think i've heard you

1116
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,359
speak about it on the weed nerds episode

1117
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,000
but i think you also said that this the

1118
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:06,239
stock's kind of gone as well

1119
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,320
yeah the taco mom um was lost and then

1120
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,959
not only that you know danny boy was

1121
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,640
very special to me danny and so is danny

1122
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,119
boyce so the 500 and something seeds

1123
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:18,159
that i created if you don't have a cut

1124
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,160
you don't get to see it either

1125
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,440
so if we just go back to the canadian

1126
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,838
part of the story you were at your

1127
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,440
friend's house growing the weed there

1128
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,119
how did you sleep

1129
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,358
sweetly okay so what strains were you

1130
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,519
growing in canada at the time

1131
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,078
um a lot of the same stuff a.b high had

1132
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,480
given us ab and hob and the dab the

1133
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,640
blueberry cheese

1134
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,719
g13 um ak-47 all those and and i can

1135
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,000
shorten the canadian story simple

1136
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,838
because we don't need to tell a lot of

1137
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,599
time i lived in a winnipeg it was 45

1138
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,799
below freezing and [ __ ] we moved into

1139
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,119
the house and we grew 10 pounds of dank

1140
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,359
in two months and we dropped it onto the

1141
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,280
street and the cops were like where the

1142
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:04,319
[ __ ] did this come from

1143
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,760
i met a kid named miles weed was 2 200 a

1144
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,640

1145
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,480
my wheat for 2 200. we're going to 3 200

1146
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,239
he said you'll never do it

1147
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,719
i harvested showed it to them they said

1150

cops knew they knew that there was weed

1151
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,359
in the city and they just chased it back

1152
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920
to us and

1153
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,159

1155
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,719
machine gun to my head put the knee in

1156
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,880

1159
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,920
just treated me like [ __ ] in canada they

1160
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,839
rang the doorbell

1161
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,680

1162
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:42,639

1163
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,319
down

1164
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,239
and while they were busting us they

1165
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,200
found the warrant so you're gonna love

1166
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,039
this one i love to tell the story

1167
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,559
stayed in canada for a long time in a

1168
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,279
place called the headingley hilton built

1169
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,199
in 1929 i was a chef i cooked it wasn't

1170
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,400
the worst gig you ever had for 12 months

1171
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,358
in jail i got high in jail i had food in

1172
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,800
jail

1173
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,639
you could have a blanket so you could

1174
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,560
beat off in jail a lot of things you

1175
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,078
can't do in america

1176
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,759
so it was like not the worst experience

1177
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,760
of my life so then they deported me to

1178
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,880
america and

1179
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,520
at the border of dakota and winnipeg

1180
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,358
they let me out cavalier north dakota

1181
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,358
i stayed in this little box and the

1182
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,880
guard cooked macaroni and cheese and

1183
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,519
hamburger helper and peas that was

1184
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,280
supper that's how small this place was

1185
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,880
and they held me and they asked

1186
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,160
florida to come get me in florida didn't

1187
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,680
want me

1188
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,118
so they killed me for 30 days and i had

1189
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,480
a law there that says florida doesn't

1190
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,240
come get you in 30 days they'll let you

1191
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,280
go so let me go

1192
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:41,039
so i moved in down in um

1193
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,640
to the city and went to work with a

1194
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,239
friend of mine named squid

1195
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,239
i worked as a heating and air sales

1196
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,358
person i made a lot of money i went to

1197
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,799
your house and gave you an estimate i

1198
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,480
was good at my job

1199
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,200
and one night i went through a damn

1200
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,240
speed zone and the guy picked me up

1201
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,838
came to the car he goes you know you got

1202
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,679
a warrant and i said yep and i said i

1203
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,239
got a warrant florida they're not going

1204
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,759
to come get me well this place was a

1205
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,318
little different

1206
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,560
they held you for nine months and they

1207
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:10,239
call florida every day

1208
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:12,400
so in the 11th hour the very 11th hour

1209
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,559
um they came and got me i started

1210
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,639
talking to jill at the time um she was

1211
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,078
writing me every day and we had started

1212
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,118
a relationship

1213
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,560
they got me at the last hour 11 59 and

1214
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,640
there's something that this is part of

1215
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,400
the story there's something in america

1216
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,960
called trans core

1217
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,480
go look it up on the internet transcore

1218
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,800
prisoner services

1219
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,920
that's so beautiful we transport your

1220
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,760
prisoners in luxury [ __ ] you they

1221
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,400
strapped us together in a school bus and

1222
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,800
drove us 10 000 miles in fetus

1223
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,720
mcdonald's and when you pass by the jail

1224
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,640
you're supposed to go to you ride right

1225
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,959
by it because they can keep you on the

1226
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,960
bus for 30 days and they make a thousand

1227
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,358
dollars a day per prisoner and they keep

1228
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,039
it full and they drive it out around and

1229
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,358
there's hundreds of them in america

1230
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,279
right now it is the most egregious [ __ ]

1231
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,519
i've ever heard of my life it's called

1232
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,400
transcore and i was shackled to another

1233
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:06,639
man for 17 days and i [ __ ] in a steel

1234
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,720
box and i was fed mcdonald's three times

1235
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,000
a day and i swore to god that's a true

1236
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,199
story

1237
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,920
i'm not sure i've ever heard of that

1238
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,358
that's that's really kind of scary

1239
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,480
that's how they transport a prisoner

1240
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:17,838
from one place to the other and the

1241
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,679
reason they treat you so shitty is

1242
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,838
because you're convicted you're not you

1243
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,159
know you're not like going to court

1244
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,119
you're on the run or you're moving and

1245
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,199
it's

1246
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,680
it's rough i was i was strapped to a guy

1247
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,639
that blew his dad away with a shotgun

1248
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,838
so

1249
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,879
it's pretty

1250
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,639
pretty crazy to take a guy who grows pot

1251
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,280
and has a loud mouth i mean if i have a

1252
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,960
flaw i have a loud mouth that's it and

1253
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,079
and put him through the system and i

1254
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,240
learned

1255
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,920
so much [ __ ] i learned about guns and

1256
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,519
murder and

1257
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,800
i mean i learned every criminal element

1258
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,280
you could ever learn in your life in

1259
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,280
jail um and then anyway so that was

1260
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,720
florida they dragged me down to florida

1261
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,240
and i get to florida

1262
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,000
they just let me go

1263
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,838
they're like well we don't want you

1264
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,119
anymore it's like why the hell did you

1265
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:04,960
come get me because they kept calling us

1266
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,039
so they gave me three years drug

1267
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,639
probation which is you basically piss

1268
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,719
once a week you have to go every

1269
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,039
wednesday and piss in a cup for three

1270
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,838
years and i did it i quit smoking weed

1271
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,519
and i passed that test and i got off

1272
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,119
probation that's incredible i couldn't

1273
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,920
imagine even to having to do it like a

1274
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,519
year at three years

1275
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,760
so were you growing during that time as

1276
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:27,199
well and just abstaining you bet no you

1277
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,800
bet i was growing

1278
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,838
[ __ ] i couldn't do that remember the

1279
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,519
story remember the story when the guy

1280
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,559
called me and he said how are you doing

1281
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,759
how's it going and i said man

1282
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,119
everything's going [ __ ] great i was

1283
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,240
standing in the grow room but i didn't

1284
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,240
smoke

1285
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,838
you fail a piss test on on this kind of

1286
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,159
thing you go back to jail so it's not

1287
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,000
like you don't get a wrist slap if you

1288
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,199
have two years and four months left and

1289
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,039
you test dirty you go back to jail

1290
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,439
it was pretty incentive you know

1291
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,599
yeah jail or not get high

1292
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,000
so i guess from a different angle those

1293
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,240
were kind of financially profitable

1294
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,679
years seeing as you were just just a

1295
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,439
marketer

1296
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,879
yeah florida's you know florida's was

1297
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,240
around seven thousand dollars a pound

1298
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,960
and i lived in gainesville and we were

1299
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,279
just

1300
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,800
pumping it out um to the college there

1301
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,720
and ounces were 400 to 450 maybe 500 on

1302
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,400
the weekend and

1303
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,838

1304
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,440

00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,719
give me a raise

1309
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,720
yeah there's a lot of parallels in

1310
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,879
australia right now i think you know the

1311
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,959
prices are arguably even a little higher

1312
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,800
than what you're quoting what they used

1313
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,318
to be but yeah very much the same thing

1314
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,880
you know it's supply and demand to the

1315
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,159
largest extent

1316
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,079
absolutely

1317
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,000
so what type of strains were you growing

1318
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,000
in florida and were you aware of any

1319
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,519
other kind of notable people in the

1320
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,880

1372
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,679
and then i go

1373
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:33,679
for forever and then

1374
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,199
so it's we used to play it it was a real

1375
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,599
bong hit that went on for a really long

1376
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,838
time and they used to play it so as i'm

1377
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,519
and all you got to do to play it is type

1378
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:48,318
wave sub slash in the text and it plays

1379
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,920
so i'm cuffed i'm sitting on the couch

1380
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:51,679
my friends don't know i'm on the couch

1381
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,318
cuffed and so they keep playing the

1382
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:55,118
[ __ ] wave while the cops run out

1383
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,119
so

1384
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,880
so the cop reached over and snatched the

1385
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,000
cord out of the wall and when you snatch

1386
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,400
a computer out on merc it does something

1387
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,119

1412
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,920
he let me go out there and then me i had

1413
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,599
three days to get the job

1414
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,079

and one guy's wife said either this guy

1418
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,720
is full of [ __ ] or he really knows a lot

1419

about heating and air and i really do

1420
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,559
so they gave me a job and um that was

1421
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:16,318
you know that was

1422
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,799
out there with jill and

1423
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,119
i worked every day up in lines georgia i

1424
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,480
started literally framing in houses

1425
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,480
because he wasn't impressed when i had

1426
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,318
to have him call my probation officer by

1427
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,960
the way after i got the job

1428
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:30,079
hey buddy i need you to make a call for

1429
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,760
me

1430
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,519
so he put me to work roughing up houses

1431
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,960
putting in ducks and [ __ ] but it wasn't

1432
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:36,239
long he could tell i worked my house off

1433
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,760
when i was a good guy so i became head

1434
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,519
of sales and

1435
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,000
i started growing cannabis in oregon

1436
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,440
under the medical program um in a home

1437
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,440
that me and jill had

1438
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,599
we moved to the country to a bigger

1439
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,559

1441
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,079
weed i made seeds

1442
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,920
part of the success of uh sub cool um is

1443
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,280
the wheat i grew i mean we sold some

1444
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,280

1445
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,359
while jill was raising kids and

1446
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,640
homeschooling and gym and things that

1447
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,000

1449
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
as much as i possibly could

1450
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,400
because i wanted to put the kids to

1451
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,880
school i wanted a nice house i wanted to

1452

to have a retirement i pay taxes like

1454
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,880

1455
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,358
[ __ ] tell you one thing right now

1456
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,920

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,920
and i always have

1459
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,920
i think that's important

1460
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,559
so that's how basically we got started

1461
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,760
we worked there we formed a company um

1462
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,440
and we

1463
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,240
sold stuff on the internet it wasn't

1464
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,318
long i built the website i will tell you

1465
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,479
that i hand typed every [ __ ] word

1466
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:48,239
took every picture when people want to

1467
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,400
talk about claiming things you know in

1468
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,000
my organization there's only one guy

1469
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,639
that wrote built that website there's

1470
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
only one guy that did the pollination

1471
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:58,078
same thing with all the breeders when i

1472
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,079
went out and i found jinx and odie and

1473
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,440
all those guys they're great people and

1474
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,200
they're great growers and everything but

1475
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,720
i had to teach them how to breed they

1476
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:06,558
weren't breeders

1477
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,959
here you take a male you stick it in

1478
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,200
here you take this much time you want to

1479
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,280
stagger this male 7 days you want to

1480
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,358
stagger this male 9 days

1481
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,519
and taking nothing away from these guys

1482
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,960
nothing some of the most talented people

1483
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,400
in the world i have worked with with

1484
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,559
giant egos

1485
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,079
but i took their seeds and i sent them

1486
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,920
overseas

1487
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,160
and i put them on catalogs and i put

1488
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,559
them on posters and i put them on high

1489
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,039
times magazines and we developed these

1490
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,519
strains so when people talk about oh sub

1491
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:37,920
didn't make it well [ __ ] i shipped

1492
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,318
it to [ __ ] amsterdam and i set up a

1493
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,838
store and i sold it and if you're one of

1494
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:43,199
my breeders that are out there talking

1495
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,279
[ __ ] about me that don't work for me

1496
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,279
more there's a reason your shit's in

1497
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,240
canada there's a reason your shit's in

1498
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,960
israel that's because i sent it there

1499
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:55,838
and i wanted to make very clear

1500
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:59,039
so just to maybe clarify

1501
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,318
why do you think od and jinx for example

1502
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,558
because i think you mentioned those two

1503
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,318
specifically why do you think they've

1504
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,680
just moved on to you know doing their

1505
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:07,358
own thing or is there a reason why

1506
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,039
they've moved on

1507
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,838
i'm hard to work with

1508
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,119
i'm very type a it's money so i'll give

1509
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:14,480
you the money so i used to pay these

1510
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,480
guys two dollars for seeds and sell them

1511
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,960
for four when they got famous enough

1512
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,159
they just sold them for four

1513
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,679
sounds simple

1514
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,838
don't need sub cool no more everybody

1515
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,358
knows who we are but it's the egos the

1516
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,119
problem and i'll tell you right now

1517
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:28,960
jason's a great guy a great breeder and

1518
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,800
i hated every god like this

1519
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,280
the fact remains if you work for pepsi

1520
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,039
cola and you develop a product and pepsi

1521
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,559
cola spends fifty thousand dollars

1522
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,440
developing your product

1523
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,359
it's pepsi's product it's simple patent

1524
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,079
and trademark law

1525
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,920
the only difference between now and then

1526
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,000
is if you do business with me now you

1527
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,559
sign a contract and we agree on

1528
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,880
everything including the divorce

1529
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,240
what happens if you don't pay the bills

1530
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,280
what happens if you don't provide the

1531
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:56,719
seeds

1532
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,960
what happens if your seeds herm

1533
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:01,039
aphrodite well we have a contract and

1534
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,639
the only difference i'm so sick of this

1535
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,960
the only difference was

1536
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,719
two guys broke as [ __ ] shook hands on a

1537
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,559
deal and then later down the road

1538
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,480
there's a shitload of money involved and

1539
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,000
the handshake didn't meet anymore and if

1540
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,199
people don't understand that i really

1541
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,519
don't care

1542
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,279
that's the real truth of the matter i

1543
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,199
busted my ass traveling around this

1544
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,160
country i've wrote books and put

1545
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:24,318
magazines in it thousands of posts did

1546
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:27,279
not create these strains

1547
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:30,239
not saying i did i marketed them

1548
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,200
that's it it's it's law if you create

1549
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,838
something

1550
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,879
as a company it becomes your proprietary

1551
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:38,159
property and i've never done anything

1552
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,400
different i don't breed with those

1553
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:42,318
strains anything i simply want somebody

1554
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,838
to give me some simple credit

1555
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:44,639
and i'm gonna get i'm gonna go hard on

1556
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:46,880
this

1557
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,719
when jinx walked on stage in one [ __ ]

1558
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,800
cannabis cup with high nine pound hammer

1559
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,719
and he won it all i wanted to say was

1560
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,800
thanks sub

1561
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:56,639
the [ __ ] what was wrong with that but

1562
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,720
instead of that we created a war and i

1563
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,879
lost a friend and now we all are this

1564
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,239
division of people we don't even dislike

1565
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,640
each other

1566
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:06,078
awesome family great people

1567
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,400
but that's what happened that's the

1568
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,480
story it was money

1569
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,720
two dollars wasn't enough so let's sell

1570
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,719
it on the open market for four dollars

1571
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,558
and i don't flaw anybody i think

1572
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,318
everybody should get in business

1573
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,920
but if you do business with me now you

1574
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:21,759
sign a contract

1575
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,200
contracts are how we do business the

1576
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,720
reason we didn't sign contracts in the

1577
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:26,719
old days is because it was against the

1578
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,358
law

1579
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,519
that's that's the best i can say it

1580
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:33,440
um i don't harm anybody but when you

1581
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,440
take and make a menu and you put nine

1582
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,800
strings on it and you create artwork and

1583
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,599
you ship

1584
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,760
thousands of packs of seeds

1585
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,280
and then you don't get credit for it

1586
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,960
you're gonna get mad and that's why a

1587
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,319
lot of people think i'm a dick

1588
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,880
all i want is credit for the work i did

1589
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,880
does that sound like an [ __ ]

1590
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,400
with with that being said we see a lot

1591
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,800
of the strains that were formally

1592
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,440
released under tga now under their

1593
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,440
respective breeders individual line is

1594
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,920
that because you guys have kind of come

1595
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,000
to an anatomical conclusion in regards

1596
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,599
to that or is that because the contracts

1597
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,880
ended like no

1598
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,318
i just don't do it i'm not going to make

1599
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,240
those strings i don't i don't want to

1600
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,159
make any of them i don't there's nothing

1601
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,000
wrong with i make my own strings and i'm

1602
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,159
not making or recreating anything made

1603
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,440
by anybody that's ever made with me

1604
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:20,239
it's not like that

1605
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,960
now

1606
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:25,039
in my new business we process cannabis

1607
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
under my like anything that i've ever

1608
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,279
processed under my label i'll process

1609
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,358
into hash or flowers i'm not talking

1610
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,359
about breeding cannabis i mean you can

1611
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,039
go out and buy 50 pounds of jelly bean

1612
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,279
and make cash out of it and sell jelly

1613
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,358
bean hash can't you you can that's all

1614
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,800
i'm doing i prefer to work with strains

1615
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:43,598
that i worked with

1616
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,680
if my name was on a pack then i prefer

1617
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,359
to sell that strainer dispensary it's

1618
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,879
just kind of common sense

1619
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:51,039
and i don't think anybody would deny

1620
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,680
that i helped develop this stuff but as

1621
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,440
far as recreating it breeding it i don't

1622
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:58,000
i don't that's not what i want i'm not

1623
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,440
trying to make money off of anybody

1624
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,880
all i want is one thing

1625
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,240
yeah man the guy worked his ass off for

1626
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,760
us thanks

1627
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,679
that's it

1639
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,119
i you know i went to the school of dank

1640
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,559
and raised 40 000 for jinx's

1641
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,559
organization then i went back and did it

1642
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,240
again i spent my money on the hotel

1643
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,839
bills i spent my money on the weed the

1644
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,439
seeds and everything so

1645
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,279
if i'm an [ __ ] i'm an [ __ ] you

1646
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,119
know but i'm pretty sure

1647
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,119
i was involved and i'm gonna take it

1648
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,880
even further farmer john is one of my

1649
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,318
hashmakers here in arizona and he was

1650
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,880
talking to somebody the other day some

1651
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:49,039
somebody was online saying oh and he

1652
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,920
said you know what i was there

1653
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:54,318
i [ __ ] watch sub teach these people i

1654
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,960
watched him take the [ __ ] plant and

1655
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,279
put it in place a by plant b

1656
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,199
and show teach he said he said it to me

1657
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,960
he said so if i was there

1658
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:04,960
it made me feel good you know he wasn't

1659
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,119
trying to start arguing he's like sup

1660
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,838
you did help these people

1661
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,519
and i was like thank you john

1662
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,078
yeah i can understand that

1663
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,920
so i think maybe a nice way to end up

1664
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,760
this general thread would be just to say

1665
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,838
that many of the breeders who were

1666
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,359
formally under the label have gone on to

1667
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:23,039
obviously achieve success in their own

1668
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,639
right and that's going to make you proud

1669
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,798
seeing as you're involved in it but

1670
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:29,440
another thing is that a lot of the work

1671
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,039
does have remnants of tga lines you

1672
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,798
created and so surely it must be

1673
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,159
rewarding twofold because you know

1674
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:35,838
you've helped them to achieve their own

1675
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:38,639
success and there's some of your own

1676
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:39,838
work embedded within theirs

1677
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,440
i'll tell you something right now

1678
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,279
quantum kush by homegrown natural

1679
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,679
wonders is the singest most single most

1680
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,839
potent plant i've ever grown in my life

1681
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,838
and you should buy it from an od it is

1682
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:51,039
[ __ ] knock your dick in the goddamn

1683
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:52,558
dirt potent

1684
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,558
over 30

1685
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,839
um my time wreck mail was used to breed

1686
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,359
it and there was some controversy on

1687
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:58,880
that um

1688
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:01,519
dioxide

1689
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,599
grew out a 10 pack of plants and that is

1690
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:06,400
where the time wreck plant came from

1691
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,318
i showed joel how to pick the last male

1692
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,838
plant that shows sex

1693
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:13,519
i showed him the difference between a

1694
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:16,639
cordage male plant and a sex plant a a

1695
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:18,480
excuse me a drug recessive plant

1696
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,000
and that plant went around and it's

1697
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,440
still used today and that's it that's it

1698
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,358
i don't want anything

1699
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,920
go buy a quantum kush it'll knock your

1700
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:28,239
[ __ ] dick in the dirt go by doctor

1701
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,599
who it's awesome

1702
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,798
they both were created with a time

1703
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,400
wrecked mail that's it

1704
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:35,920
so this is going to sound like a weird

1705
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,519
question but i heard this and i i don't

1706
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,798
think there's any particular good spot

1707
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,239
to slow it in so i'm just going to slow

1708
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:43,440
it in right now

1709
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:45,519
i heard that um some bikeys came up to a

1710
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,400
tga booth at one of the cups and said

1711
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:50,480
stop using the hell's angel's name and

1712
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,519
is that true is there any truth to that

1713
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,440
not true

1714
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,358
have you heard that story

1715
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,559
i have heard that story it's not

1716
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,440
do you have any idea where it maybe

1717
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,040
comes from yeah troll rumors it's that's

1718
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,559
not that hell's og cut doesn't belong to

1719
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:03,838
hell's angels like they live right next

1720
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,079
door to me they don't give a [ __ ] about

1721
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,199
a cut you break

1722
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,960
yeah it's just the name hell's it's

1723
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,039
named at harborside i mean it's not it's

1724
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,039
not nearly as deep as you think and i'll

1725
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,558
tell you something blow your mind

1726
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:16,719
we lost the hell's og cut last year at

1727
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,040
one of our breeding facilities

1728
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:21,759
so the 8 000 jesus og seeds that exist

1729
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:24,239
today that's it

1730
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,599
that's it okay and so would you ever

1731
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,279
look to recreate it or are you of the

1732
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,599
opinion if something kind of leaves like

1733
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,000
that you just want to move on

1734
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,920
well here's my smart ass answer

1735
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,079
i think as it dies off we'll find a new

1736
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,680
og male and we'll kill jesus and then

1737
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,880
when we make a new one we'll resurrect

1738
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,480
him

1739
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,440
but

1740
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,599
we'll see we'll see

1741
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,838
okay my new business is growing cannabis

1742
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,480
i don't need to make seeds um we are now

1743
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:52,880
germinating 1 000 jesus og seeds and

1744
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,639
finding the best two phenotypes

1745
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,160
those phenotypes will be logged into

1746
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,849
philos

1747
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:59,519
uh candor um

1748
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:01,358
[Music]

1749
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:04,719
testing labs

1750
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:06,639
be listed um trademarked as our clone

1751
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,798
and protected and then that clone will

1752
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:11,199
be grown and sold in in dispensaries and

1753
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:12,798
my company name will go on them it'll be

1754
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,919
grown under something called the dank

1755
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,798
standard

1756
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,200
which sets minimum for terpenes

1757
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,559
um cannabinoids and and

1758
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:22,719
sets the standards for not having

1759
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,839
pesticides and we test everything three

1760
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,318
times

1761
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:28,000
and so before long we hope that you'll

1762
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:29,920
be able to go to a dispensary and buy a

1763
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,239
of cannabis product it's in a

1764
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,480
nitrogen-filled box that's prepared by a

1765
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:38,479
professional that is the exact same

1766
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,480
cannabis that you will buy in colorado

1767
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:43,359
oregon washington and california and the

1768
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,199
way we can do this is we are setting up

1769
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:46,558
these facilities in each state so i'm in

1770
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:50,318
arizona now

1771
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:53,119
i'm a d.a i can sell to all 131

1772
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:54,798
dispensaries and i can buy from 131

1773
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,880
dispensaries

1774
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,559
i'm setting the same thing up in nevada

1775
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,760
right now and also in northern

1776
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,480
california

1777
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,319
so we grow the cannabis in the facility

1778
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,240
there the seeds are put out there the

1779
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:08,318
clones are put out there and we're not

1780
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:10,078
crossing state lines we don't even

1781
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:11,838
change banks

1782
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,000
the money from colorado stays in a

1783
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:14,960
colorado bank and stays in a colorado

1784
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,599
company

1785
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,079
this was all formed by my partner tj

1786
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,318
will and three lawyers who came up with

1787
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,280
what they say is a landmark way of doing

1788
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:24,880
business

1789
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,480
instead of growing cannabis in one area

1790
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,318
and shipping it to another

1791
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,079
we're going to set a set of standards to

1792
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:31,759
produce it

1793
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:35,280
and i don't know if you're watching me

1794
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:38,240
but we hit 96 thca today

1795
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,040
with cbd a i don't know what the hell it

1796
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:41,519
is

1797
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:43,679
so we are knocking the charts off with

1798
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:46,159
quality this stuff was tested three

1799
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:49,279
times we spent three thousand dollars

1800
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:51,039
testing the cannabis flowers

1801
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,319
and then we're testing the extracts

1802
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:53,838
twice

1803
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,558
the reason i'm doing this is because

1804
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:58,960
arizona specifically has no testing no

1805
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,319
state testing and people are smoking poo

1806
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,480
stew and avid and all kind of [ __ ] when

1807
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:06,639
we go out and buy cannabis we test it we

1808
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,599
make sure that it doesn't have mold

1809
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:11,679
and trash and that's the cannabis we use

1810
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,838
the time of of selling cannabis with

1811
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,318
crap on it or grown and poorly it's

1812
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,679
gotta go this medicine it's not medicine

1813
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:19,599
for everybody

1814
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:20,798
some people like to get really [ __ ]

1815
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,400
stoned

1816
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:24,159
but if you have an autoimmune system you

1817
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,318
need to make sure there's not [ __ ] on

1818
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:29,118
your weed and you make sure there's not

1819
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:30,558
avid or sm-90 and it's a set of

1820
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,599
standards that we are very proud to

1821
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,160
uphold

1822
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,240
and it is we think is the new future

1823
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:38,159
i do not see the seed business staying

1824
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,159
where it was in the past

1825
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:41,838
the home of the five dollar grams here

1826
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:43,519
so many people in the world used to grow

1827
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,358
cannabis because that's the only way to

1828
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,318
get it it ain't gonna be very long at

1829
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,159
all you're gonna be able to go to

1830
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:49,440
walmart and buy weed

1831
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:51,118
you're gonna be able to go into a liquor

1832
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,880
store and buy weed and americans

1833
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,318
generally like to smoke shitty pre-rolls

1834
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,000
not good cannabis

1835
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,679
so the people who are going to grow

1836
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
cannabis are the people like

1837
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:00,798
us that have a very serious passion for

1838
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,599
it

1839
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:05,679
i think a huge market of people used to

1840
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,920
grow recreational get weed well just buy

1841
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:10,239
it i mean growing wheat is is the hard

1842
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,720
work it's a lot of dedication and if

1843
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:13,919
they can go buy weed i think the seed

1844
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:15,279
business will fall off and there's

1845
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,960
another thing

1846
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,519
clone business is taking off when i

1847
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,920
started doing this you had to buy a seed

1848
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:24,719
you can go buy a

1849
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,519
clone right now of all 40 of my strains

1850
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:30,558
in sacramento you can drive to alpine

1851
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,559
alternative and buy the damn clone you

1852
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,960
can buy the clone that i selected you

1853
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,760
can go get my time wreck that i grow

1854
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,920
here

1855
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,079
so why you need to buy a pack of seeds

1856
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,440
so i see a shift that's why i'm growing

1857
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,720
flowers now

1858
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,880
still a breeder

1859
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,239
still i made 12 new strains since my

1860
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,318
house burned down

1861
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,919
but in the old days we were basically

1862
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:51,679
the only seed company other than some

1863
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,000
europeans and there was cali connection

1864
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,838
then there was dna there's 12 new seed

1865
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,079
companies every day

1866
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,480
the market's thin

1867
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,720
without a doubt do you feel though that

1868
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,639
part of the drive people have to buy

1869
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,399
seeds is that there's almost a

1870
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:07,920
similarity between like gambling you

1871
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,160
know it's like it's a very small risk

1872
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,880
but maybe it'll be a really big payoff

1873
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,399
and

1874
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,680
i think that plays into it because i

1875
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,039
think the majority of people know that

1876
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:16,719
their chances of getting something

1877
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,720
phenomenal from a pack of seeds you know

1878
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:21,358
like obviously it improves with breeder

1879
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:23,038
selection but for the most part you know

1880
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:24,400
like you can get clone onlys that'll

1881
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,359
probably be better than what you get out

1882
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,798
of most packets

1883
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:30,159
i think that's part of it but there's an

1884
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:31,838
unknown and you guys are gonna laugh do

1885
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:33,038
you know where like i i'm just gonna

1886
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:35,119
throw a number out there and y'all can

1887
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,640
beat me up but it's probably 30 40

1888
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,559
percent of the seeds aren't ever grown

1889
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:41,759
out people collect seeds like baseball

1890
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,760
cards bro wow

1891
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,839
i got some 2003 black russian

1892
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:48,639
well grow it [ __ ] they're probably bad

1893
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:50,078
by now you know yeah that's my favorite

1894
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,358
that's huge i have guys that showed me

1895
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,280
their collection on instagram and i'm

1896
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:56,078
like jesus dude you own ten thousand

1897
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,079
dollars worth of seeds

1898
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,400
yeah

1899
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,440
just gonna hurt they pop so with all

1900
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,440
with all the things you were just

1901
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,400
mentioning it sounds very much like it's

1902
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,318
kind of

1903
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,079
the the general industry is moving that

1904
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:09,759
way something i wanted to mention though

1905
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,920
is that yourself and a few other

1906
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,799
companies do outsource some of their

1907
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,960
strain reproduction to other breeders

1908
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:18,239
this seems to be a growing trend do you

1909
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,679
think that do you agree with that do you

1910
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:21,279
feel it's a growing trend and do you

1911
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:22,639
feel there are any downsides of this

1912
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,319
practice

1913
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:26,239
there are downsides a man that's a great

1914
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:28,079
question so that's one thing that's one

1915
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,199
of the wonderful things that that might

1916
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,680
attract he don't even make his own sage

1917
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:35,519
well we have 48 strength and there's not

1918
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:36,639
possible to make 48 strains in one

1919
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:37,599
location

1920
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:38,798
a

1921
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,920
b

1922
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,000
we operate in several different

1923
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,960
locations california

1924
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,480
arizona bada so there's that

1925
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,318
and you take the simple fact that we

1926
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,358
like to keep one male

1927
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:54,000
in one location so that we'll mix it up

1928
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,239
and the last factor is talent

1929
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,440
so my breeder's name is badger he's

1930
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,598
probably one of the best growers i ever

1931
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,000
met you know i got that way a [ __ ]

1932
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,240
hand trained him for three years

1933
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,639
taught him every single thing i know

1934
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:10,000
so now he lives in another place in a

1935
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:12,960
nice building and he does exactly what i

1936
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
taught him to do with the exact same

1937
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,838
clones

1938
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,519
so when he makes jack the ripper he

1939
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:18,880
makes it just like he did when he was in

1940
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,159
my basement

1941
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,240
nothing changed

1942
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,960
why would i change that you with me why

1943
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,479
would i take that incredible talent away

1944
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,000
he just created a string called queen

1945
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,400
anne's revenge that has more resonant

1946
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,318
than i've ever seen in my entire life he

1947
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,960
created it with passion

1948
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:37,199
it's not a job for this guy he's [ __ ]

1949
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,798
sub cool's breeder and he happens to be

1950
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,439
my best friend and he named his [ __ ]

1951
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,960
son montgomery which is my name

1952
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,559
so this isn't some

1953
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,358
shack in the middle of a [ __ ] field

1954
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,119
somewhere this is my [ __ ] brother

1955
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:49,838
so that makes a little bit different

1956
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,318
than

1957
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,599
outsourcing your genetics who else makes

1958
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:55,440
my genetics

1959
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:58,000
a friend of mine named norstar i've

1960
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,760
known him for 25 years

1961
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,920
his house was the house i took a shower

1962
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,880
in after my house burned down

1963
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,079
his kids are my step or my god children

1964
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,720
again

1965
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:11,760
outsource yeah i talk to these people

1966
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:14,239
every single day and he has 75 mother

1967
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,640
plants that no one else has

1968
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,798
that's why we work with him

1969
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,558
yeah anyone who's seen uh northstar's

1970
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:23,119
library or his instagram feed in general

1971
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,640
is it's quite impressive

1972
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,000
to be able to work with happy are you

1973
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:27,598
kidding me to be able to call this guy

1974
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,280
up and say hey man why don't you cross a

1975
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,720
times b and you go sure

1976
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,119
you gotta bro

1977
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:35,439
if we just go back to the the storyline

1978
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,960
for a moment let's go back to

1979
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,400
i think you correct me if i'm wrong i

1980
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,480
think it was shortly after you moved to

1981
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,798
oregon is this when you popped the

1982
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,679
packet of space queen

1983
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:46,798
yeah so great that's great so and by the

1984
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:48,239
way everybody thinks we should stop

1985
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:50,639
calling it space bomb because nobody

1986
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:52,639
knows what it is it's simple vic sent me

1987
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:54,078
a pack of space queen when i left the

1988
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,440
united states i left all my seeds at

1989
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,200
danny's house because i didn't know

1990
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,280
where the hell i was going the pack of

1991
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,759
space queen was taped underneath the

1992
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,599
keyboard this gets creepy at dinner at

1993
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,799
danny's wake i had one of my friends go

1994
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,240
into his office and get all the seeds

1995
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,400
and send it back to me

1996
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:09,598
danny would not have wanted to be thrown

1997
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,200
away

1998
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,079
i cracked those seeds and from that we

1999
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:16,879
found tiny bomb which is a female space

2000
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,400
queen plant we found sea which we call

2001
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,400
cherry which we have since got rid of

2002
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,880
and we found the dude

2003
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,358
which is our space queen male we call

2004
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,440
him the dude and he's made over sixty

2005
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:29,920
percent of all our crosses i've taken

2006
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,480
heat all he does is cross this yeah

2007
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,559
this is one plant out of a billion for

2008
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,000
real you could cross it with a turnip

2009
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,559
and it would get you high

2010
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,400
so that's that's why we're using he also

2011
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:44,079
influes excuse me

2012
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,160
and infuses a cherry flavor so if you

2013
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,920
have a grape strain and you cross out

2014
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,000
cross sometimes this train it becomes a

2015
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,079
great cherry stream

2016
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,480
that's how we made cuvee we took a

2017
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,720
strain that tasted like chocolate

2018
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,199
and we crossed it with space queen and

2019
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:01,199
it tastes like cherries and chocolate

2020
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,038
cuvee is means to combine two things

2021
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:04,879
together that are good to make one

2022
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,799
better and i would say that chocolate

2023
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,119
and cherries are better than each one

2024
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:09,119
alone

2025
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:13,199
so just to try to set the record

2026
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,838
straight it's been alleged that the

2027
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:17,679
space queen was in fact a c99 back cross

2028
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:19,920
is that the case

2029
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:22,318
i all i can tell you is vic sent me a

2030
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,318
pack of scent of steeds that said space

2031
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,199
clean with an ink pen on them that's the

2032
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:26,960
story

2033
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:29,598
okay you'd have to ask vic

2034
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,599
and so maybe a different way to approach

2035
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,720
this question and to kind of satisfy

2036
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,880
some people

2037
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:37,358
if you were to find out that it was say

2038
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,838
a cindy 99 back cross would you want to

2039
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,679
say try to rectify the information

2040
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:43,599
sources out there

2041
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,719
no i don't i don't care and i that i'd

2042
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:46,400
you know what's funny i've never even

2043
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,318
heard that you know vic sent me a pack

2044
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,240
of seeds in the mail and he said they

2045
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:52,400
were space queens so

2046
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,159
pretty sure that's what they were so

2047
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,880
i'm not aware of this actually not aware

2048
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,000
of the c99 rumor that's that's a new one

2049
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,760
okay

2050
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,920
so i guess while we're on that general

2051
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,079
topic how do you feel about fire loss

2052
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,159
and about the general kind of testing of

2053
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,920
plants finding out their origins is is

2054
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:09,199
it a concept you're in favor of or

2055
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,760
because i know that some people aren't

2056
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,519
in favor where do you sit on that one

2057
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,200
we um we are mapping all of our mother

2058
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,600
plants absolutely and you're you're

2059
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,358
indicating a problem that my ex actually

2060
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,359
talked about um

2061
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,759
during all of the testing that we sent

2062
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:26,798
in to phylus one time we actually made a

2063
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:29,198
mistake we did and we sent the stem of

2064
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,238
the same [ __ ] plant in each envelope

2065
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,000
i don't know if you've ever done a five

2066
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,519
loads test kit but you have to take a

2067
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,238
stem and you cut a piece of it off and

2068
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,759
you wash it with alcohol three times

2069
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,959
and that's how you get it there

2070
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,960
the guy that did it for me made a

2071
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,399
mistake simply had six bags and he just

2072
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,880
put one in there and they turned this

2073
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,639
into this huge thing and by the way

2074
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,400
tried to destroy the reputation of my

2075
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,319
company which kind of cool being is the

2076
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:52,559
other person owns half of the company

2077
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,400
but it didn't work because we have two

2078
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,000
strains that are pretty important and i

2079
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,198
love telling a story so one is called

2080
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,600
cuvee

2081
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,318
so that's pinot noir

2082
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:05,520
space queen which has a cherry flavor

2083
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,279
and there's tinto de verano which is

2084
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,440
taste of summer

2085
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,199
and it's pinot thomas jack the ripper

2086
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:13,599
and it has a lemon taste and those

2087
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:15,278
strains are easy to detect

2088
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,480
and if you grow them out they're there i

2089
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,560
got a friend named eagle right now

2090
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,318
that's grown out 45 of my strains i was

2091
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,759
talking to him last night i said well

2092
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,319
what do you think of this [ __ ] he

2093
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:25,838
goes well i got cuvee and it tastes like

2094
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,080
chocolate and cherries and i've worn the

2095
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,119
cup here and i've got your tinto and

2096
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:31,198
this lemon

2097
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,880
but even funnier is

2098
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:35,759
everything burnt up in the damn fire

2099
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,640
anyway so now we're dead we're vlogging

2100
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,880
our new mails other than dude so it is

2101
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,600
what it is i checked it again and it was

2102
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,440
right i've taken so much heat on this

2103
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,120
i've never actually told them so we made

2104
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:49,919
a mistake on the clipping that was sent

2105
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:52,079
in but not the resulting clone because

2106
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,920
the clone gets tested all the time and

2107
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:56,079
when we test our strains that are made

2108
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,600
with the clones they test right go and

2109
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,679
file this and look go look at jack the

2110
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,560
ripper go look at jelly bean go look at

2111
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,079
all the strains they're right but people

2112
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,760
in the business wanted to turn this into

2113
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:07,198
this huge thing

2114
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,560
because hey if you can make sub luck

2115
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:10,079
like a dumbass

2116
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,080
you can slow his business down and take

2117
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:13,519
his business

2118
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:15,119
it is what it is

2119
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,960
my friends and my fans that grow my

2120
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:19,359
genetics love them the shops here that

2121
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,800
grow jesus and time wreck they they

2122
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:22,158
laugh at this [ __ ] they think it's the

2123
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,000
biggest

2124
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:25,759
internet joke in the world but it is

2125
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,520
something i had to address and that's

2126
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,039
that's the very bottom truth of it the

2127
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,199
space bomb we have

2128
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,238
jill's got a copy of it i've got a copy

2129
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,479
of it

2130
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:36,079
mendo dope just killed a quirkle mail

2131
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:38,559
because our corporal mail burn up it's

2132
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:40,960
headed to philos right now to get tested

2133
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,840
jack the ripper was pulled by 25

2134
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,560
from badger so we got three males headed

2135
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,239
to philos right now we're going to test

2136
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,520
three and catalog three males and chase

2137
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:52,238
them to the system

2138
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,400
and we're rebuilding from the fire so

2139
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,000
you know i think philos is a very

2140
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:57,119
important mechanism

2141
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,119
but i think the other problem with

2142
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,198
philo's if you actually go right now to

2143
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:03,359
the philos galaxy as a layman and try to

2144
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:05,519
read it you can't understand it because

2145
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,039
i can't understand it so i have to ask

2146
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,880
nishan the owner

2147
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:10,560
and me and nishan are friends and he's

2148
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,279
been on the show

2149
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,840
and me and um phylos and subcool seeds

2150
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:16,719
are pretty tight so that's pretty much

2151
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,039
it

2152
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,960
we'll have all 30 of our moms and dads

2153
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,800
catalog by the end of the year and

2154
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,000
they'll get a hologram certification for

2155
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,840
our program

2156
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,279
and when we take a clone into a shop or

2157
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,319
something like that we'll know exactly

2158
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:29,679
what it is because it'll carry

2159
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:31,198
certification

2160
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,880
so the stuff from the old days it won't

2161
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:33,839
be like that anymore because we have

2162
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,600
open

2163
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,840
source breeding like we've never had

2164
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,079
because we can look at it you guys can

2165
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,279
go look at it so i think everybody needs

2166
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,238
to get involved

2167
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,519
and and log their mails i got to go back

2168
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,279
god's [ __ ] is logged into the

2169
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:50,320
philosophy galaxy by the way and i can't

2170
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:53,198
change it because i didn't enter it

2171
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:54,639
there you go so go look it up i i may

2172
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:56,479
have misheard you but i think you said

2173
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,239
that you weren't going to get space dude

2174
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:59,759
tested

2175
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:01,759
no yeah and it's in there it's basically

2176
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,920
oh okay yes i was just going to say if

2177
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,520
so why was that i was thinking maybe

2178
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,840
i was going to say is it possible to

2179
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,360
maybe try to like propagate a clone from

2180
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,039
just a cutting because if so i could

2181
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,039
understand why you'd not want to send

2182
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,039
your prize mail in

2183
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:16,560
yeah no no they can do that and here's

2184
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,238
another thing it's kind of cool we know

2185
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,000
now that we can actually take a plant

2186
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:22,319
and bring it down to a cell

2187
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,760
cryo cloning you know and you can ship

2188
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:25,439
the cell

2189
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,520
i mean it's we could talk about this for

2190
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:29,198
hours but if you can take a plant down

2191
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,199
to a single cell

2192
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,919
and put it in a cryo ship it you can

2193
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:35,519
ship a cell it ain't a plant so we can

2194
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,719
move genetics nowadays i mean you'd have

2195
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,040
to get a lawyer involved to talk about

2196
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,640
the rest of it but as far as the ability

2197
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:41,519
and a [ __ ] heartbeat you can ship a

2198
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,119
cell

2199
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,560
and a cell can be propagation so that's

2200
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:46,158
going to be the new

2201
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,280
a new thing of cannabis is coming pretty

2202
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,279
soon

2203
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,039
and that's cellular cloning the clone is

2204
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:52,880
going to be able to be moved around the

2205
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,399
world and we see this coming in the next

2206
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,840
five years

2207
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:57,759
yeah okay

2208
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,199
so i did have another one or two

2209
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,280
questions on space queen i wanted to

2210
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:03,519
bash out before we move on one of the

2211
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:05,439
common sentiments i've heard is that

2212
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,600
some people feel the repetitiveness of

2213
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:10,158
space queen across multiple different

2214
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,920
strains can kind of just ultimately lead

2215
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,079
to if you were to say grow out a few

2216
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,520
packets of tga you might find those more

2217
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:16,960
space queen phenos popping up

2218
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,120
repetitively which is obviously to be

2219
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,039
expected do you feel like that is a

2220
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:22,559
little bit of a detriment like in the if

2221
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:24,479
i were to say grow three or four packs

2222
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,199
of tgas i could end up with say half of

2223
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:29,119
them being essentially really similar

2224
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:30,479
no not even close you can go in any

2225
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:32,719
dispenser in america and look at all 40

2226
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:35,599
of my strings i'm not saying it's in a

2227
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:38,480
vortex is apollo 13 space queen it

2228
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,880
tastes like baby puke and peaches

2229
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:42,639
it's got a very pronounced sick sickly

2230
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,640
smell but in a good way

2231
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,760
jack the ripper smells like lemons it's

2232
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,119
pure

2233
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,960
lemons

2234
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:51,198
cuvee also these are all space queen

2235
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,319
crosses it smells like chocolate with

2236
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:53,919
cherries

2237
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:55,198
every single one of them has a distinct

2238
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,039
profile and that's because the mother

2239
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,879
plants are so strong

2240
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:01,359
i can differentiate i can take five jars

2241
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:05,920
and differentiate from them now

2242
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:07,039
do all of my strains have a fruity

2243
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,239
pungent

2244
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:12,319
pukey smell yeah i like that [ __ ] i

2245
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:14,559
don't like fuel

2246
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:16,319
i don't like goobers rag i mean we have

2247
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,039
a kim d time jack gripper which is

2248
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:21,519
brutal i don't like it i don't like

2249
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,679
grease that's a personal thing when i

2250
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,640
started breeding this is what i wanted

2251
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,399
crepe

2252
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,360
lemon banana

2253
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:30,238
lime

2254
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:33,439
orange cherry and melon i wanted a

2255
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:35,519
rainbow and i [ __ ] did it

2256
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:37,279
yeah undeniably some very tasty weed

2257
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,679
which kind of brings us to another

2258
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:41,840
question i think this this one

2259
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,520
definitely depends on kind of the lens

2260
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,440
in which you view the question but

2261
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,320
another kind of sentiment you commonly

2262
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:50,879
hear from people is that tga strains

2263
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:53,119
extremely tasty but generally not the

2264
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,600
most potent have you heard this sentence

2265
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:57,519
and how would you respond to that

2266
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,239
i would respond to the jesus i ran today

2267
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,159
for extract tested at 26 and dumped a

2268
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:03,839
[ __ ] pile of crystalline like you've

2269
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:05,198
never seen in your life so i call

2270
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,640
[ __ ]

2271
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:07,599
so what i was gonna what i was thinking

2272
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,440
was

2273
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,400
in a way though i guess the other way to

2274
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,559
view it is

2275
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:13,839
even if even if you did kind of think oh

2276
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,280
well even if that's the case there's a

2277
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,199
certain niche because the follow-up

2278
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:19,679
statement that people will say is a lot

2279
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:21,198
of people i know really like the tga

2280
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,640
strains because they're not just gonna

2281
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:24,559
like make you totally [ __ ] and

2282
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,960
they've got a lot of flavor and you know

2283
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,400
it's a good often a good like this this

2284
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,039
might lay me a bit of heat but it's like

2285
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,799
it's good weed to like get people into

2286
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:34,960
maybe the more obnoxious stuff like the

2287
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,440
gassy stuff and all of that

2288
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,439
do you feel like there is a market there

2289
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:41,759
to fill like someone who's looking for

2290
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:43,919
the most tasty weed and you know that's

2291
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,520
their main criteria

2292
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,279
i do that's great you were you were

2293
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,199
really good at this just so you know

2294
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:50,960
yeah i mean there is a reason we have 48

2295
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:52,719
strings on our menu and you know not

2296
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,319
everybody wants to smoke vortex and be

2297
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,760
scared shitless and puke on the ground

2298
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:57,039
like matt ryze did when he smoked a

2299
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,880
joint with me

2300
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:00,960
you can smoke a joint of jelly bean and

2301
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,400
lay around and want to [ __ ]

2302
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,840
you can smoke some coracle and kind of

2303
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:06,000
lay around on the couch and just be

2304
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,920
mellow they're all different there's i

2305
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,920
mean they're not just all cannabis we

2306
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,000
call it cannabis but there's reasons

2307
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:14,399
cheese quake is one of my favorites

2308
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,198
cheese quake is in the

2309
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:19,119
18 to 21 range according to how you grow

2310
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:20,879
it so it doesn't blister your forehead

2311
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:22,479
or make you scared

2312
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,119
but it's got a nice

2313
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:28,238
danish taste it rolls around your tongue

2314
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:30,640
and the mercium and the from the quirkle

2315
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:32,879
brings an overall calming to you so so

2316
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,640
when you smoke it you're relaxed

2317
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,199
but you're not scared shitless and you

2318
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,920
can focus like like my jack's cleaner

2319
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:40,238
too

2320
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,039
you couldn't type on jax cleaner too if

2321
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,639
you had to your vision blurs

2322
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,600
you can't see very well and you can't

2323
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,199
focus

2324
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,679
but you take another strain of mine like

2325
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:50,479
third dimension which is done in like 49

2326
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,359
days

2327
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:56,158
it has a very coconut pineapple kind of

2328
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:57,759
flavor i can smoke that [ __ ] all day i

2329
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:59,920
wouldn't call it weak

2330
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,640
it's just a different way of a profile

2331
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,079
so

2332
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,920
what you say definitely has a lot of

2333
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,600
truth and you know i don't think

2334
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,399
cannabis is all about just getting

2335
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,560
blasted i mean i get up in the morning

2336
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,479
love to smoke some of the the more

2337
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,480
sativa mixed hybrids

2338
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:17,039
chili bean in the morning makes me laugh

2339
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:18,718
and giggle and [ __ ] but like if you

2340
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:20,399
smoke vortex in the morning you wouldn't

2341
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,239
want to get in your damn car you'd be

2342
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:23,039
going why are they following me and [ __ ]

2343
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:25,839
so

2344
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:28,560
to me cannabis is not just a medicine

2345
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,640
and a recreation it's a sacrament so

2346
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,159
if i want to trip then i'm going to take

2347
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,039
something that's like that but if i want

2348
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:34,479
to

2349
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:36,158
listen to

2350
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,519
you know peter frampton and lay around

2351
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:39,279
and make out then i'm going to pick

2352
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,600
another kind of weed so

2353
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:43,599
to me cannabis is just all over the

2354
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,199
place and you know that's what we talk

2355
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,360
about we talk about the cannabis that

2356
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:49,439
actually you know makes you smarter

2357
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:52,639
apollo i'll never forget when i was

2358
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:54,319
making apollo 13 bx i'd be online typing

2359
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,640
and i'd be staring at a cursor if you

2360
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:58,238
write you know that blinking cursor

2361
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,840
and i would say i'm going to smoke a

2362
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:01,839
bowl and the next thing you would hear

2363
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,319
is

2364
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,480
typing it was literally i was like wow i

2365
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:08,399
can just make one bowl of this apollo 13

2366
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:12,639
and start typing so i don't think you

2367
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:15,198
can categorize any cannabis is one thing

2368
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,520
yeah i think that's a really good answer

2369
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:19,919
so something i did want to ask you is

2370
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,239
what do you think outside of say space

2371
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,239
dude and space queen would be a strain

2372
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:27,198
that you think really nicely embodies

2373
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:28,799
tga seeds

2374
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:30,639
coracle was a project i mean uh

2375
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,159
coracle's you know somebody called fakes

2376
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,520
that fake ass circle the other day well

2377
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:35,039
i mean we know it's not we know it's

2378
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,280
article because it's just tested it's

2379
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:39,439
the same one that three of us use

2380
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:41,679
um joel didn't even get his from me they

2381
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,279
just happened to be the same plant but

2382
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:46,158
what i wanted when i made coracle was a

2383
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:48,960
breeding plant i wanted a way to

2384
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:51,439
a paintbrush of purple and grape

2385
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,039
urkel's a female plant and i don't

2386
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:55,198
believe in feminizing

2387
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:56,399
so i was like well what can i do i was

2388
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:58,399
like well what about

2389
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,279
outcrosser time space queen

2390
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:01,679
cool

2391
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,039
and then since space queen is cherry and

2392
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,960
not colored

2393
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:07,359
and urkel is

2394
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:10,079
grape and colored as we look at the

2395
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:12,639
progeny we can see the variance if it's

2396
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:14,079
really [ __ ] purple and short it's

2397
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,840
urkel dominant

2398
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:16,800
if it's really limey green and cherry

2399
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,880
and tall

2400
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,000
it's space queen dominant and you can

2401
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,679
see it

2402
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,039
you can also see the males and i'm not

2403
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:25,279
going to get a discussion on male

2404
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,039
selection because that's another game

2405
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:28,719
but you can see

2406
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:31,359
the coracle dominant males and you can

2407
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:33,279
see the space queen dominant males so if

2408
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,960
you want to breed something and you want

2409
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:37,679
to make it grape

2410
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,079
like we make we just took and we made

2411
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:42,158
great goo so we took an half gooey and

2412
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,079
we crossed the toms of purple

2413
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:47,359
porkal male the thing actually gets

2414
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:49,359
purple leaves it has a very grape scent

2415
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:52,079
it's very indica dominant and has a ton

2416
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:53,359
of mercium in it so with that male we

2417
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,119
can control

2418
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:56,479
the flow of the strain do we want to

2419
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,439
take grape

2420
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:01,599
conversely we also have a coracle male

2421
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:02,879
that is a cherry flavor and produces

2422
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,840
more resin

2423
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:08,319
it tends to make a strain less

2424
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:11,119
short it tends to leg out a little bit

2425
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,960
it has larger trichome heads

2426
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:15,920
and the trichomes themselves have a

2427
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:18,319
larger amount of liquid in them

2428
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:20,719
so as a grower breeder these are traits

2429
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:23,039
i can literally see

2430
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:25,679
so in order to make something i had to

2431
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:27,920
create quirkle so i had to make a seed

2432
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,158
that would grow a plant that was a male

2433
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,399
plant and that male plant would either

2434
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:33,279
give the attributes of purple

2435
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,719
grape

2436
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:35,840
or cherry

2437
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,840
and that's how you control a breeding

2438
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,079
program i had to make quirkle in order

2439
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,800
to make anything i couldn't make cheese

2440
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:45,439
quake without making quirkle and cheese

2441
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,400
quake's grown by everybody it's big and

2442
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,158
chunky

2443
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:49,759
it's a fun strain to grow mendo dope

2444
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:50,960
loves growing it they got 12 pounds on

2445
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:54,480
their outdoor

2446
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:56,480
and all i did was create a male plant

2447
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:58,319
and then cross the top cheese and so

2448
01:20:56,479 --> 01:20:59,198
using that formula i can do it times

2449
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:00,799
everything

2450
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:03,119
anything you have that you want me to

2451
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,320
turn purple and give it a great flavor i

2452
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:06,158
can do so

2453
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:08,639
so i can take something that's lemon i

2454
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,479
can make grape lemons i can take

2455
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,440
something that's cherry i can make grape

2456
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:13,678
cherry

2457
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:15,599
or if i want to make it more cherry i'd

2458
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,840
use the cherry mail

2459
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,199
did i lose you no no no no i'm just

2460
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,360
trying to take it all in

2461
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,839
yeah so that's it's it's to me a male

2462
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:25,679
plant is a paint brush

2463
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,800
okay perfect so

2464
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,079
one of the earliest kind of tips i don't

2465
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,320
know if you call it a tip on breeding

2466
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:34,000
but i just i i vividly remember it from

2467
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:35,519
the weirdness episode and i think you

2468
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,800
said it in a few you said something to

2469
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,120
the effect of

2470
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,440
you think that the male brings generally

2471
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:43,359
potency and the female brings more of a

2472
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:45,439
structure i might be

2473
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:47,119
you know getting that vaguely wrong

2474
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:48,399
opposite yeah sorry i might get

2475
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:51,039
something wrong with that

2476
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:52,960
do you think that holds generally true

2477
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,960
yeah the male has

2478
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:57,359
the male in my opinion provides cordage

2479
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,279
and structure um it also provides pest

2480
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:01,279
resistance but nobody ever talks about

2481
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:02,960
the male plants there i mean cannabis is

2482
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:04,800
duplicious and and the male plant and

2483
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,480
the female plant are there for a reason

2484
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,400
and in my opinion when we feminize a

2485
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:11,119
plant and i got lots of friends that do

2486
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:13,359
it we're we're presenting a slightly

2487
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,119
less quality version i think that nature

2488
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:16,559
would always make a better version and i

2489
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:17,920
that hybrid vigor is what i've always

2490
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,800
liked you don't get it when you feminize

2491
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,520
seeds

2492
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,480
so i've just always believed that you

2493
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,560
have to work with the real male plant

2494
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:28,399
that's the 10 chrome so the mixed with

2495
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,080
the other 10 on the female

2496
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,319
that picks up the spacious trains those

2497
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:34,639
genes mix together and you get the

2498
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:36,799
hardiness from the male plant with the

2499
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,800
potency of the female plant with the

2500
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,960
pest resistance of the male plant with

2501
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,119
the resin production of the female plant

2502
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,600
it's a [ __ ] puzzle and it's why it's

2503
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:47,359
called breeding it ain't pollen chunking

2504
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,960
you got to know what you're doing and

2505
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:51,439
how you know what you're doing is you

2506
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,840
make 97 strains and that's how many i've

2507
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:53,839
made

2508
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:58,000
and so i think something which might

2509
01:22:56,158 --> 01:22:59,759
jump to mind for people who are paying

2510
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,198
attention is that

2511
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,960
the the number you just quoted is

2512
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:05,119
obviously a lot more than what's been at

2513
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,719
market so obviously you've culled some

2514
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:09,279
that didn't make it

2515
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:11,520
what for you is the process of deciding

2516
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:12,719
whether a pack makes it to market for

2517
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,800
example

2518
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:17,359
a really a sentiment that i really like

2519
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,880
was bodhi said that he pops a 10 pack

2520
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:20,158
just a single 10 pack to kind of get a

2521
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,679
feel for what the customer would

2522
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:23,519
experience and if he's not happy with

2523
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:25,600
that then he feels it's probably not

2524
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,960
good for market where do you sit on this

2525
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,920
one

2526
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,600
well about 12 years ago we saw a problem

2527
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,000
with people buying 10 packs of the shows

2528
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,520
for 120 so we created the five pack and

2529
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,238
the way we created the five pack is we

2530
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,520
grow out tons of our shrines five seats

2531
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:41,839
we want to make sure we got a keeper out

2532
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,600
of five seats and we do

2533
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,039
if the five-pack theory didn't work my

2534
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,840
ass wouldn't be living in this house i

2535
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:48,960
paid for because i'm a profitable

2536
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,319
businessman that's a five pack sucked we

2537
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,399
wouldn't sell them

2538
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:53,840
and so yes body's right you have to have

2539
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,638
a customer get what he wants out of that

2540
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,000
pack

2541
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,279
if he doesn't get a representation out

2542
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,600
of it then he's not going to be a happy

2543
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,880
customer and five's tough

2544
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,280
they don't get it i'll usually replace

2545
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,600
them but it works all over the place i

2546
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:07,359
mean it works so testing is huge so if

2547
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,520
you don't know this

2548
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:12,000
we grow a lot of our frames ourselves

2549
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,199
and then we send 1 000 seeds into the

2550
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,800
ethernet

2551
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:17,119
and we watch

2552
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,119
we watch instagram and we watch

2553
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:21,599
facebook and we watch

2554
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,198
roll it up and they tell us it's

2555
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,199
instantaneously

2556
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:29,198
you start hearing it it's like a rumble

2557
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:31,279
it's really good it's like grapes stable

2558
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,879
and if you hear the opposite yeah it

2559
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,639
wasn't very good

2560
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,239
didn't look very good which has rarely

2561
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,520
happened dennis

2562
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:39,439
you know to go the other way but you've

2563
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,560
mentioned something else culling

2564
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,119
culling happens a lot when you get

2565
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,360
busted you've been busted four times

2566
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:46,639
it happens we lost danny boy in a bus we

2567
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:49,439
lose things

2568
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:51,440
which leads to um most of breeders

2569
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:54,638
nowadays hold our clones so

2570
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:56,079
duke diamond with uh um

2571
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:58,639
dominion seed company i'm sorry just

2572
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:59,519
left soul he has my jax cleaner

2573
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:02,239
um

2574
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,239
the trichome jungle seeds in europe

2575
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:05,919
he has my giants cleaner but [ __ ] you

2576
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:07,279
talking about getting a clone somewhere

2577
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,199
that took a while

2578
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:10,559
so these clones are alive and they'll be

2579
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:12,158
there for a while

2580
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,400
next year i'd like to take these clones

2581
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:17,359
and get them into fino seed bank

2582
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:18,799
into their cryo cellular thing so that

2583
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:20,559
when i pass on

2584
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,920
these clones or these these genetics are

2585
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,480
available for life

2586
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,399
and me and will are setting up a trust

2587
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:29,678
that lasts 500 years

2588
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:31,599
just so that this stuff will live on

2589
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:33,440
wow so i mean you just referenced

2590
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,600
trichome jungle a good friend of mine

2591
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:37,279
and more so a man near and dear to my

2592
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,280
heart duke diamond

2593
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:41,840
he actually told me that um

2594
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:43,920
you were the one who put him in contact

2595
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,319
with seoul and that kind of led to the

2596
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:49,600
the resurrection of brothers grim a few

2597
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:51,439
years ago well how did that all go about

2598
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,440
let's just say the phone call from sub

2599
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:55,359
cool carries a lot of [ __ ] weight

2600
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:56,799
that's it

2601
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,238
that's old this guy's a friend of mine

2602
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,600
he needs a job he got a job i still do

2603
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:03,198
it today i can i mean love or hate me if

2604
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,639
i call you on the phone and ask you a

2605
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,000
favor you're probably going to answer

2606
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,199
the phone

2607
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,119
and i'm probably going to have a good

2608
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:10,559
reason for calling you you're probably

2609
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:13,198
going to listen to me

2610
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:16,080
and that was gay so this guy's awesome

2611
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:18,319
duke diamond great let's go together

2612
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,479
tommy thanks me all the time

2613
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:22,079
yeah it certainly got them both launched

2614
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:23,759
again in on their own respective

2615
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:25,519
platforms which i think is a good

2616
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,320
outcome nonetheless

2617
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,920
so

2618
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:29,198
something i just wanted to loop back on

2619
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,279
quickly

2620
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:34,079
just as a bit of a pot question when

2621
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,679
space queen was first released

2622
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:37,198
did it stand out to you was it something

2623
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,960
which caught your eye was it only really

2624
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:41,119
until you popped your pack that you

2625
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,439
really kind of started to

2626
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:45,920
gain traction for you

2627
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:47,519
to this day the space bomb mail we

2628
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,079
pulled out of there is still jill's

2629
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,760
favorite strain on the planet

2630
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:54,079
that says a lot

2631
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,960
i mean thousands of seeds we crack that

2632
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:58,800
one female plant is still our favorite

2633
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,679
yeah it stood out it still stands out i

2634
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,840
mean

2635
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,679
a quarter pound of tiny bomb grown

2636
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,360
properly it's

2637
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:07,119
it's hard to believe it looks like pot i

2638
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:09,119
mean it's got so much resin on it and

2639
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:11,439
smells so

2640
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:14,000
crazy i mean it's like wow this smells

2641
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:15,839
like cherry candy and it's got sugar all

2642
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,520
over it and it's not even hard to grow i

2643
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,119
mean you still get super soil and you

2644
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,000
harvest it at eight weeks

2645
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:21,039
duh

2646
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,198
it's like

2647
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:25,760
you top it you harvest it you get two

2648
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:28,559
pounds of light every time

2649
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:30,159
yeah and so i guess maybe what i'm kind

2650
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,719
of getting at is

2651
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:35,920
do you think it had much of a following

2652
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:37,840
before you popularized it

2653
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,679
i don't think so because vic was kind of

2654
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:41,679
a cult kind of thing i mean vic you had

2655
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:43,520
to know vic and vic was an [ __ ] and

2656
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,440
you know vic died last week did you know

2657
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,800
that i i saw that on instagram that's

2658
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:49,039
really sad to hear

2659
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,239
his um there was this kid i'm sorry i

2660
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:51,600
want a dirt first a little bit there's a

2661
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:53,519
kid that's hanging a kid there's a guy

2662
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,039
that hangs around in one of my chats

2663
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,400
and he's pretty intelligent he's you

2664
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:57,679
know i got to know him very well and he

2665
01:27:56,399 --> 01:27:59,599
you know he said vic's my uncle and i

2666
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:00,480
said you [ __ ] he told me enough

2667
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,639
stuff

2668
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,000
that convinced me that vic was his uncle

2669
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,760
and he was going to see him i love this

2670
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,039
story so he told me that he told vic

2671
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,639
this stuff cool said hi and he said he

2672
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:12,238
just started kicking and that you know

2673
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,239
just all agitated

2674
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:16,719
but no i don't think a lot of people

2675
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,159
know spaceman and i'll tell you this i

2676
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:21,439
don't think

2677
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:22,960
that that pack of seeds and that male is

2678
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:25,759
some magical

2679
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,520
ethos or something i think i worked hard

2680
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,239
i think i took the strain and i made a

2681
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:32,400
shitload of genetics and i ground my ass

2682
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:34,238
out for seven days a week for years and

2683
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:36,319
years to where you actually heard about

2684
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:38,158
me and invited me on the show and i

2685
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:39,599
think any business just like that it

2686
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:42,719
takes a person

2687
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:44,239
that works his ass off and that's why

2688
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:46,319
you know about space queen i don't think

2689
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:48,158
anybody else agrees with it but i mean

2690
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,920
there's there's 50 threads right now on

2691
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:52,559
the internet you can go sub cool growth

2692
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,880
space queen tiny bomb

2693
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:57,360
i used to sit and grow and write sit and

2694
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,239
grow and write

2695
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:00,079
so

2696
01:28:58,238 --> 01:29:02,638
just as a personal question because i

2697
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:04,000
would very much say to people that if i

2698
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:05,840
had to kind of attribute what my

2699
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,238
influences are for this show i would say

2700
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,480
adam done show in the weed nerd so i've

2701
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:12,238
got to ask what kind of inspired you to

2702
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:13,919
start the show obviously you had the

2703
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,759
passion for it but what made you decide

2704
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,520
to go i'm going to actually turn this

2705
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,360
into a media format rather than just a

2706
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,880
written format

2707
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:22,238
well we've got to back up a little bit

2708
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,600
remember that that thing that i talked

2709
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:25,279
about still embarrassing that i don't

2710
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,520
feel uh

2711
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:29,198
feel like i belong well when talking to

2712
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,199
the camera made me feel like i belong

2713
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,559
and so i did the weed nerd camera i was

2714
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:34,799
we lived in oregon i had a little office

2715
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,080
i grew weed i didn't leave very often um

2716
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,360
you know chill did her thing with the

2717
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,479
kids and i stayed out there locked in

2718
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:40,559
the garage

2719
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:42,158
and i didn't have anything to do

2720
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,840
so i listened to music and i started the

2721
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:46,158
you know the recorded weed nerd and i

2722
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,159
had a lot of fun with it but the current

2723
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:50,000
weed nerd which is the live show was

2724
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:51,439
inspired by the grow tube round table

2725
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,960
crazy [ __ ]

2726
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:54,079
after my house burned down i was at his

2727
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,520
house he's letting me stay at his house

2728
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:56,800
for a couple of weeks and friday night

2729
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,800
he has a show

2730
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,279
and i was like you do it live

2731
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,840
he's like yes you don't record it yeah

2732
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:05,119
now as a problem the old show i use

2733
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,840
music

2734
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:09,279
and a lot of the weed nerds can stick up

2735
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,039
there's certain bands like don't ever

2736
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:13,198
play foo fighters but you can play chili

2737
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:14,158
peppers you can play k you just learn

2738
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:15,759
this

2739
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,279
you can play them off of youtube and

2740
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,280
they won't copyright it but if you play

2741
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:20,399
foo fighters off of youtube on a youtube

2742
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:22,479
video

2743
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:23,519
they will ban your account which is what

2744
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:25,839
happened to me

2745
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,400
i was live streaming playing the new foo

2746
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,480
fighters video on youtube

2747
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:31,839
off of youtube and they crushed the

2748
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:33,279
stream and they killed my live stream

2749
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,760
for 90 days

2750
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:37,119
but having said that it they go daigo

2751
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,239
taught me about the live stream and

2752
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:40,319
bubble man

2753
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,559
bubble man's format

2754
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:44,639
is something that

2755
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,480
i love watched and i

2756
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,800
i think it's stiffer than mine i mean i

2757
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:50,959
yell [ __ ] at my fans i toss people out

2758
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:53,279
i'm the howard stern of my show he's

2759
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,198
much more structured and classy but i

2760
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:56,880
will tell you for all the people that

2761
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:59,599
say i'm an [ __ ]

2762
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,199
my fans love it they pick on me and try

2763
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,360
to get me to throw them out they they

2764
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:04,879
try to get me to rant on them they they

2765
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:07,119
ask me stupid questions so i'll yell and

2766
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:09,359
holler at them they go oh just [ __ ]

2767
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:10,559
so it's a it's a show it's not reality

2768
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:12,158
i'm not

2769
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,320
i don't scream and you don't [ __ ] and

2770
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:15,679
relax all the time you know it's that's

2771
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:19,119
a show

2772
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:21,760
i've taken bubble man and crazy [ __ ] and

2773
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:23,519
vader and for goalie and mouse and other

2774
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,480
people like that and formed my own

2775
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,000
character

2776
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,839
and i'm gonna say it one more time i do

2777
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,039
it because i'm lonely i need human

2778
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,199
interaction

2779
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:32,800
it's a self-fulfilling thing

2780
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:34,000
when i have 200 people watching me and

2781
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,840
we're listening to music and we're

2782
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,920
talking i would rather do that than

2783
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,239
watch tv or read

2784
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:43,039
or just about anything and because of my

2785
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:44,718
position it's kind of a job too i teach

2786
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:46,800
people how to grow cannabis

2787
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:49,279
i give free seeds to any sick person

2788
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,279
that needs them no questions asked

2789
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:53,519
i raise money for people who are sick

2790
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:56,399
and that platform which is the weed nerd

2791
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,400
allows me to do it

2792
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,760
so i think some some of the critics and

2793
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:03,039
a point you know brought up in the

2794
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,119
thread is

2795
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:06,880
that it seems to be unclear how much of

2796
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,479
the work was done by you and how much of

2797
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,159
the work was done by miss jill a lot of

2798
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:12,238
people seem to think she doesn't get

2799
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:14,319
enough share of the credit do you think

2800
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:16,559
that's truthful and you know is there

2801
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:18,559
any do you want to kind of give her

2802
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,560
credit for some things and like make it

2803
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,880
clear that that's what she did or it was

2804
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,800
it all by you where do you sit on that

2805
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,719
i will not speak about jill

2806
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,880
i'm in the middle of a brutal divorce uh

2807
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,399
revolving around millions of dollars i

2808
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,679
won't speak about it

2809
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:33,839
alrighty

2810
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,840
so

2811
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:39,760
something i noticed myself was that

2812
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,920
jilly bean

2813
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,000
bean has kind of got a bit of a cult

2814
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:46,239
following around it i think it's because

2815
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,479
both the orange and the mango of both

2816
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:50,238
the parents meld together well but at

2817
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:52,079
the same time i think it's also because

2818
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:54,799
there's a little bit of you know a

2819
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:56,000
shroud of mystery around orange velvet

2820
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,840
are you willing to comment on orange

2821
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,760
velvet at all like do you do you think

2822
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,319
it it is skunk and why do you think

2823
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,159
julie being such successful strain

2824
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:06,719
i will not comment on jill or jelly bean

2825
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:09,279
in this interview sorry

2826
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:10,960
no worries

2827
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:13,359
one of the rumors that has been going

2828
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:16,560
around was that at some point i believe

2829
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:18,719
jack's cleaner male was supposedly lost

2830
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,760
in a space queen took its

2831
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:21,198
place

2832
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:23,039
do you know that's the

2833
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:25,839
yeah that's the philos sample i told you

2834
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:25,840
about uh

2835
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,279
so

2836
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,199
the current tga setup appears to have

2837
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:34,800
jill in oregon you in arizona is the

2838
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:37,678
plan to go forward with both of you

2839
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:40,719
contributing under the same tga banner

2840
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:42,158
um i can't answer that question buddy

2841
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,079
i can i can make a statement if you want

2842
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:46,238

2843
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:47,439

2847
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,319
um

2848
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:57,359
me and jill share ownership of tga and i

2849
01:33:56,319 --> 01:33:59,679
can't

2850
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,479
i don't know what will happen um what i

2851
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,960
hope

2852
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:05,279
is that jill will be incredibly

2853
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:08,000
successful and make jelly bean and make

2854
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:09,920
agent orange and make tons of strains

2855
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,359
and help tons of people

2856
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,840
and be happy

2857
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:15,759
and find happiness in life

2858
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,199
that's what i want

2859
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,840
that's a good answer

2860
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:21,359
so just before you express that you

2861
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,279
weren't particularly into the idea of

2862
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:25,119
feminized seeds i've got to imagine

2863
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,399
there's a pretty decent demand for some

2864
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:27,920
families from you would you ever

2865
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:29,279
consider it or you're just not looking

2866
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,279
to do it

2867
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:32,639
no it's it would it's number one i don't

2868
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:33,840
believe in it um so i don't know if you

2869
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:35,359
know there are companies that make 50

2870
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,760
million dollars a year selling seeds to

2871
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:39,198
morocco feminized seeds to make ash

2872
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,480
there's certainly on the table for me

2873
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:43,118
i've been offered it

2874
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:45,039
i don't believe in it

2875
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:47,198
and i certainly don't believe in making

2876
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:48,560
a billion seeds to send over to morocco

2877
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:49,839
to make ash out of them because they

2878
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,719
don't care that they are mephrodite or

2879
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,400
not it's just not my game

2880
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,760
two things happened in my breeding

2881
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:58,319
career and they would not have happened

2882
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:00,239
without joel of north star genetics i

2883
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:01,840
have to make sure i give him credit and

2884
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:04,879
we created dead lights so with dead

2885
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:06,079
lights hits 26 27 28 cbd

2886
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,079
i don't give a [ __ ] what anybody says

2887
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:09,840
about me at 56 years old i offer a

2888
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:12,238
strain that is

2889
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:15,360
above 27 cbd

2890
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:18,479
i'm good yeah that's i didn't think i've

2891
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:19,759
ever heard of cbd that high really

2892
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,519
it took a couple of years we had to make

2893
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,360
pennywise we had to get the ac dc we had

2894
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:25,040
to back cross we had a test we had to

2895
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:27,279
lose a pennywise mail we had to refire

2896
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:29,439
it my house burned down i had to i mean

2897
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:30,800
it's work it's like i told you before

2898
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:32,479
work is work

2899
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,639
right now i have

2900
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:37,519
dead lights and dead lights test over

2901
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:39,440
and over above 20 and you can literally

2902
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,679
go google the [ __ ] or instagram or

2903
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:44,319
whatever you surf it and you'll find

2904
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:45,679
right now lab reports above 27 i got one

2905
01:35:44,319 --> 01:35:48,000
on my phone

2906
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:50,158
i would say that is success

2907
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,520
i would say that prison terms and trolls

2908
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:53,198
and hates and divorce and everything

2909
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,840
that's gone on i created a strain that

2910
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:58,079
helps people

2911
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,520

2925
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:26,559
poor people

2926
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,639
i mean we're turning the pool room into

2927
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:31,119
rso if you didn't know

2928
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:34,000
my giant pool full of weed we're gonna

2929
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:36,719
turn it into rso and give it the [ __ ]

2930
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,479
away here in arizona

2931
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:40,000
that's what we're doing

2932
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,279
that's that's really nice sentiment and

2933
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,439
i'm sure a lot of people will benefit

2934
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:45,519
from that i've got to ask though what's

2935
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:47,118
with the pool like you know beyond the

2936
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,320
obvious like is it just to prove a point

2937
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:50,639
at this point

2938
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:53,118
yeah i'm having a blast dude i got a

2939
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,359
pool in my house with like 30 pounds of

2940
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:58,079
weed in it do you

2941
01:36:55,359 --> 01:37:00,479
it's awesome sadly no it's got a stereo

2942
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:02,639
we go hang out we we get our beach

2943
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:04,559
chairs and we smoke bowls and we look at

2944
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:06,719
the weed and we teach people how to grow

2945
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,400
weed and i got a dab bar you can come

2946
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:10,239
over and get hi at my dab bar and we can

2947
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:13,198
talk about the ba

2948
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:15,118
i mean seriously but the story is true

2949
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:16,879
when i moved in here i have alpha 1

2950
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:19,039
which is a progressive fatal lung

2951
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:21,520
disease i have the lungs of 105 year old

2952
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:23,439
man i don't breathe at all i can't walk

2953
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,280
upstairs i can't carry bags of concrete

2954
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:26,319
i don't do a lot but talk and yell at

2955
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:28,719
people and

2956
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:30,559
and point my finger at things nowadays

2957
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:33,439
and so that's just something i have to

2958
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,280
deal with you know of having alpha so

2959
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:36,399
that has formed almost everything i do

2960
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:38,559
in life

2961
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:40,079
um the the the not being able to get

2962
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,239
around and everything so that's kind of

2963
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:43,600
how i ended up where i'm at now

2964
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:44,718
so

2965
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:46,400
it's just something you deal with on a

2966
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,639
daily basis

2967
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:50,158
i've you i mean anyone who follows your

2968
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:52,079
stream would see you know you post

2969
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:54,158
regularly of the uh the infusions you

2970
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:55,840
have to have to keep on top of that do

2971
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:57,359
you find that that's helping you because

2972
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,199
i remember and maybe you can clarify

2973
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:01,679
this for me it's probably two or three

2974
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:03,759
years ago now maybe a little less even i

2975
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:05,600
remember that you were saying that just

2976
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,360
even generally smoking it was really

2977
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,880
quite irritating for the lungs and stuff

2978
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:10,880
whereas you know forgive me if i'm

2979
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,639
mistaken i think i see you puffing every

2980
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,760
now and again do you think things are a

2981
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,118
little better than what they were a

2982
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,880
while ago like any is that due to the

2983
01:38:15,118 --> 01:38:18,639
medication or

2984
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,319
no i it's a great it's a great story and

2985
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:22,239
leads me into i wanted to tell a story

2986
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:23,679
here so when i was diagnosed they told

2987
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:25,519
me i should never smoke again because i

2988
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:27,359
had lung disease and i quit smoking

2989
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:29,920
and uh within a couple weeks i'm very

2990
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:32,719
nervous person so i got some wine and i

2991
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,600
drank it and i like wine i tried i had

2992
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,319
me a

2993
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,760
glass and a corkscrew and i bought wine

2994
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:39,279
i bought cheap wine i bought expensive i

2995
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:40,560
[ __ ] hated it

2996
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:42,399
so i bought some beer one day and i

2997
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,039
liked beer and i drank beer and then i

2998
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:47,519
drank alcohol so rock specifically a

2999
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:49,039
couple fifths a day and i turned my life

3000
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,360
into a toilet

3001
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,118
and then one day i decided i said well

3002
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:55,439
[ __ ] man i'm killing myself i should

3003
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:56,880
smoke weed again and so i started

3004
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:58,719
smoking weed

3005
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:01,600
even though the doctors told me not to

3006
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:03,118
now i smoke only hash generally teeny

3007
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,560
teeny hits in a little bitty pipe i

3008
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:06,238
don't dab

3009
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,000
overheat i have a specific way of

3010
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:09,359
smoking it's almost a vaporizing method

3011
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,039
to do with my pipe

3012
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:12,479
but within a couple weeks of doing that

3013
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:14,960
i was able to quit drinking and quit

3014
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:18,799
doing drugs and i became my old self

3015
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,639
i felt normal again so i smoke hash in

3016
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:22,719
spite of the fact that i'm not supposed

3017
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,480
to nobody with a lung disease should

3018
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:26,399
smoke anything

3019
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:27,359
but i am a miserable

3020
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:29,118
[ __ ]

3021
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:31,679
when i don't smoke cannabis

3022
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:32,799
i'm a hateful mean

3023
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,039
[ __ ]

3024
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:37,039
so i smoke cannabis and that's it that

3025
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:38,079
was it's been a year in my life off of

3026
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:42,079
cannabis

3027
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:43,760
and my with sick and it sucked now

3028
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,279
the reason i can do better now as i

3029
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,039
moved out of northern california the

3030
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:48,479
weather in northern california was

3031
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:51,118
crushing me

3032
01:39:48,479 --> 01:39:52,879
on the humidity all that it's dry here

3033
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:53,679
and and i got lost because i'm a little

3034
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,920
high

3035
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:58,399
the pool so

3036
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:00,079
i drained the pool because alpha one

3037
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:02,079
sucks and the moisture was making it

3038
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:03,519
hard for me to breathe so during the

3039
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:06,639
pool they're standing around the pool

3040
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,560
one day and somebody on instagram said

3041
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:10,319
remember chi chin chong well of course i

3042
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,800
remember teaching challenge iguana gun i

3043
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:14,399
can recite the movie

3044
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,320
so somebody said you should go weed in

3045
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:17,679
the pool so i said yeah we should so we

3046
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:19,319
built a floor and we started and

3047
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:21,760
somebody said

3048
01:40:19,319 --> 01:40:24,158
300 people

3049
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:27,039
commented either i was a genius or i was

3050
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:29,198
the dumbest redneck in history so i took

3051
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:31,198
that as a challenge can't grow pool and

3052
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:32,719
weed in the pool so

3053
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:35,279
we're growing weed in a pool and we're

3054
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:37,840

01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:28,158
so kind of on that topic what's it like

3078
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:30,319
to have the tga brand extending into the

3079
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:32,079
european market do you find the demands

3080
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:33,679
are different or the same because the

3081
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:35,198
thing that i've seem to notice from my

3082
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,279
very limited interactions with the

3083
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:39,279
european market is they tend to be more

3084
01:41:37,279 --> 01:41:41,439
focused on the terps and so with that

3085
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:42,960
being said i would imagine tga does

3086
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:45,118
fairly well

3087
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,880
yeah and i will say that and god i got

3088
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:48,079
out of habit it's sub cool seeds i

3089
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,000
actually changed the name of the company

3090
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:52,238
and i own some cool seeds so that's just

3091
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,920
the thing so the sub cool strains are

3092
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:55,519
yeah there's there's a reason your buddy

3093
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,679
with trico and jungle seeds grows some

3094
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:59,520
of my gear there's a reason because he

3095
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,520
likes the terps there's a reason that

3096
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:03,520
some of the hashmakers use my stuff

3097
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,280
because they like the weird

3098
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:08,000
comical cherrygasm do you know about

3099
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:09,759
cherrygasm i've heard of it i've heard

3100
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,238
of it are you kidding me

3101
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:14,800
[ __ ] it makes white

3102
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:16,638
rosin that crystallizes it comes out and

3103
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,320
it'll turn in those little thca crystals

3104
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:21,440
if you press it right

3105
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:23,359
it tastes like cherry sap it

3106
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:24,879
it's this side of having an orgasm to

3107
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:27,118
take a hit of it that's why we call it

3108
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,239
cherrygasm i i'm not kidding have

3109
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:29,759
friends that come in my house and

3110
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:30,718
they're just like as a matter of fact

3111
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,480
when i moved here there was a guy that

3112
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:36,079
was making sugar wax

3113
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:38,079
i bought all he had at full retail

3114
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:40,479
it wasn't tested i was like can i taste

3115
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:42,479
that he's like i said jesus christ man

3116
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:43,678
that tastes like smoking candy can i

3117
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:45,519
have more

3118
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:47,840
so it's just one strain cherry gasoline

3119
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,880
by the way we lost cherry gas in the

3120
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,600
fire

3121
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:54,800
scotty 016 was nice enough to bring the

3122
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:57,199
cherry pie og back to joel

3123
01:42:54,800 --> 01:43:00,000
he has the space dude mail we just

3124
01:42:57,198 --> 01:43:03,519
released cherrygasm again [ __ ] you fire

3125
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,520
ain't no fire gonna take me out

3126
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:08,960
so one of the claims i've seen raised by

3127
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,039
critics is that i mean well let me put

3128
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,399
it this way you've made it clear that

3129
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,399
certain strains were discontinued

3130
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:15,839
because the mothers were gone is that

3131
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:17,439
the case that pretty much all the

3132
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,880
discontinued strains fall under that

3133
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:20,238
umbrella or were some of them pulled

3134
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,239
from the market because there were

3135
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:23,439
issues that weren't realized until after

3136
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:24,879
release

3137
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:26,479
nah i've never had an issue with the

3138
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,159
strain i've i've had strings that were

3139
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,000
better so like pandora's box we took

3140
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:32,000
pandora's box off the menu because it's

3141
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,520
a back cross of jtr

3142
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,439
it's very similar to jtr i think

3143
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,960
[ __ ] if you go to jtr and your

3144
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:38,479
pandora's box you'd be like man these

3145
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,158
things are very similar

3146
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:42,319
that pandora's box right there is a lot

3147
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:44,000
like that jack ripper female and all it

3148
01:43:42,319 --> 01:43:46,079
is is a more stabilized version so we

3149
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,198
took it off the menu guess what we just

3150
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:48,960
brought it back on the menu you want to

3151
01:43:47,198 --> 01:43:52,079
know why because 10 times a week

3152
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,840
somebody goes bring back bring that

3153
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:56,880
here's some ones jack's cleaner

3154
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:59,679
blueberry i tried for five years

3155
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:01,600
to make a blueberry flavored string

3156
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:03,118
every time i glue grow blueberry in

3157
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,119
super soil it pushes it in

3158
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:07,118
hermephrodites i used to think that

3159
01:44:05,118 --> 01:44:09,198
blueberry was a hermetic strain i've

3160
01:44:07,118 --> 01:44:11,359
taken heat on it it's not

3161
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:14,079
it's a low feeding strain if you put it

3162
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:16,000
in super soil you push it all the time

3163
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:17,279
i didn't know that back then well we

3164
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,800
know that now

3165
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:20,158
so i kept working with it i kept trying

3166
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,000
to create something and i thought i was

3167
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:23,359
creating herms because [ __ ] males

3168
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,439
kept messing up and the females kept

3169
01:44:23,359 --> 01:44:27,359
messing up it was too strong so i spent

3170
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:28,479
five years trying to do one thing and it

3171
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:30,079
didn't work

3172
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:31,678
i took the space queen mail across the

3173
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:33,760
thomas jack's cleaner and we made jack

3174
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:35,039
the ripper and you can say what you want

3175
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,880
i mean jack the ripper test is six

3176
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:38,880
percent for thcv and you can't go in the

3177
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:41,359
shop here and not buy it i would say

3178
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,199
it's a successful cross

3179
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:43,920
without a doubt

3180
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:45,599
so

3181
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:48,239
something i'm always interested in is

3182
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:50,800
deeply embedded within that cross is the

3183
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:52,319
pluton genetics which i remember you

3184
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,159
told the story and i think you said that

3185
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:56,000
your friend sent you some of the working

3186
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:58,559
parts so i don't think you actually work

3187
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,079
specifically with the pluton but do you

3188
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:02,239
think that that comes through it all in

3189
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:03,519
the cross or do you think it's more of a

3190
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:04,718
structural like you know like it's

3191
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,239
embedded in there but you don't see it

3192
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,679
particularly

3193
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:09,519
i think jack's cleaner is heavy on

3194
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:11,118
northern lights so that the story is my

3195
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,639
friend scooch who passed away two years

3196
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:14,079
ago by the way all my friends are dying

3197
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:17,199
because we're all old

3198
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:20,800
but excuse excuse me sku sent me a 100

3199
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:22,158
skosh skosh skosh seeds and

3200
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,159
that's what it is it's northern lights

3201
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:25,439
times plutonius that it's that thing you

3202
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:27,439
see me type

3203
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:28,799
northern lifestyle pluton tom hayes time

3204
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:31,039
that's that's what he sent me that's

3205
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:32,480
what he told me it was

3206
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:34,880
and so i grew them out and i got this

3207
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:37,118
amazing female plant call cleaner i mean

3208
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,639
it was the best female out of a hundred

3209
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:40,319
seeds some of the females out of that

3210
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,319
pack were shite i mean they just were

3211
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:44,639
they weren't any good the one was

3212
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:47,039
exceptional and at the time i had a

3213
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:48,560
major fascination for jack hair and i

3214
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:51,359
had grown out a pack of jack here from

3215
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:53,520
scentsy seeds i picked the last female

3216
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:56,639
to excuse me the last male to show sucks

3217
01:45:53,520 --> 01:46:00,480
and i pollinated i made jacks cleaner at

3218
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:02,639
the time i was heavy into drugs steroids

3219
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:06,238
fast cars women

3220
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:07,840
cocaine and i lost the seeds i have no

3221
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:10,479
idea where they were

3222
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,920
but that jax cleaner female was giving

3223
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:13,839
us a couple of friends of mine and when

3224
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:16,000
i got my [ __ ] back together it stayed

3225
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:18,880
around i passed it out to everybody i

3226
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,719
could get it just like seoul passes out

3227
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,719
his a13 so people don't lose it

3228
01:46:25,118 --> 01:46:28,960
so who do you think are some of the

3229
01:46:27,279 --> 01:46:31,118
breeders who

3230
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:34,639
still around now but maybe just largely

3231
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:34,639
go unnoticed by the masses

3232
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,440
i don't think there is such a thing

3233
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:42,719
we're all players now kyle cushman has a

3234
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:44,399
giant contract duke has a giant contract

3235
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,158
seoul has a giant contract with

3236
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:48,000
cinderella he grows cannabis and sells

3237

there's a bunch of pot growers

3242
01:46:56,319 --> 01:46:59,439
and that's what you're gonna see you're

3243
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,760
gonna see people aligning themselves

3244
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:04,000
with someone i have four felonies and

3245

3247
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:10,960

3327
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:53,199
so many people and i'm not trying to

3328
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:55,599
take extra credit

3329
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:57,919
if you catch me right now tonight after

3330
01:49:55,599 --> 01:50:00,960
the show in my stream and you ask me a

3331
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:03,359
question about growing i'll answer it

3332
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,198
that's what i do

3333
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:07,198
and so i noticed in the past you had

3334
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:09,118
done some kind of seminar things you

3335
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:11,118
even referenced it in regards to the

3336
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:13,039
jinx charity do you plan to do any more

3337
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:15,359
of this going forward

3338
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:17,198
no um my health really i really

3339
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:19,279
shouldn't go around a ton of people um i

3340
01:50:17,198 --> 01:50:20,799
shouldn't travel if i get a cold like if

3341
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:22,479
i get a cold or flu because i got on a

3342
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,800
plane or travel i have to go to the

3343
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:26,399
hospital so alpha is not a joke if

3344
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:28,320
anybody wants to google alpha one it's a

3345
01:50:26,399 --> 01:50:31,118
progressive fatal lung disease and it's

3346
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:33,118
brutal so yeah getting a cold is not

3347
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:34,238
good for me most people that have what i

3348
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:35,519
have die

3349
01:50:34,238 --> 01:50:37,039
because they get a

3350
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:39,440
virus or a flu

3351
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:41,039
so i don't fly all over the place and i

3352
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:42,799
don't generally

3353

3360
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:59,759

3362
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:05,119
detrimental to my health there's no way

3363

3364
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:08,799
breathing smoke and so at the last

3365
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:11,359

out seeds and have people shake my hand

3370
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:21,439
and pat me on the back but i made the

3371
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:23,759
choice not to high times in san

3372
01:51:21,439 --> 01:51:25,519
bernardino it's kind of the same thing

3373

3374
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,800
and i've been invited to be a judge at

3375
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:31,118
chalice and i'm invited to speak at both

3376
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,800
places and we may do chalice but

3377
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:34,479

3378
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:37,279
opening we're dropping sauce and 12

3379
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:39,759
dispensaries here in arizona so

3380
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:42,479
i don't really have time to go talk and

3381
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:44,560
you can watch me talk 40 hours a week

3382
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:46,718
you just have to watch turn the phone on

3383
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,440
i'm talking

3384
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:49,118
so

3385
01:51:47,439 --> 01:51:51,039
just if we loop back on that point you

3386
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:52,559
made about how you guys market and stuff

3387
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:54,079
you would be a good person ask this

3388
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:55,840
question to

3389
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:57,920
this is a hypothetical i'm not referring

3390
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:00,880
to anyone specific but do you think it's

3391
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:02,880
possible for a breeder in today's age to

3392
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:04,719
produce quality work but not be

3393
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:06,239
particularly present on social media do

3394
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:08,399
you think it's going to work or it just

3395
01:52:06,238 --> 01:52:10,319
won't be viable in this current you know

3396
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:11,920
scene

3397
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:13,279
you know that's a really interesting

3398
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:15,679
question because there are certainly

3399
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:17,840
breeders around that don't

3400
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:20,000
you know rip up social media but you

3401
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,360
know like my favorite one of my favorite

3402
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,079
breeders right now is bodhi have you

3403
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:27,279
seen his camera work on instagram yeah

3404
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:29,118
all the tobacco and stuff

3405
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:30,960
the resin heads and stuff he does he's

3406
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:32,719
just out of control and

3407
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,399
so he's about i don't know how do you

3408
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:36,399
how do you sell your strains if you

3409
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:37,839
don't tell people about them how how do

3410
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:40,079
you sell the donuts if you don't tell

3411
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:42,000
people you got good donuts i mean

3412
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:43,760
i think there are people working well

3413
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,198
here's one badger

3414
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:46,560
badger is probably one of the best

3415
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:48,399
breeders in america today do you even

3416
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:50,000
know who he is yeah i definitely know

3417
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:51,679
who he is

3418
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,000
that's so he's coming up

3419
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:55,520
is he on social media yeah

3420
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,238
you kind of have to almost if that makes

3421
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:00,480
any sense so i i don't think you can i

3422
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:02,479
really don't yeah well i mean just most

3423
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:04,079
notably having had a chat with gooey

3424
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:06,079
breeder i kind of think of him in that

3425
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:08,719
regard i think he maybe limits himself a

3426
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:10,000
bit by being so absent you know

3427
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:12,239
yeah he doesn't make any money i mean

3428
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,238
i'm not dogging he's he's got money he's

3429
01:53:12,238 --> 01:53:16,479
a very successful

3430
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:18,479
wealthy person that's not that sounded

3431
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:20,479
wrong the way i said it but does he have

3432
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:22,399
45 strains on the market selling them in

3433
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:25,039
every dispensary in every shop does he

3434
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:26,559
have a strains and attitude and no

3435
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:27,760
it's because nobody knows about him we

3436
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,599
know about me and you know about him

3437
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,520
because you know joel and we know his

3438
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,719
stuff is the bomb

3439
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:35,119
oh yeah

3440
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:37,198
you know he's he's an eclectic kind of

3441
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:39,598
guy i've only met him twice and hell i

3442
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:41,039
live down the street from him

3443
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:42,800
there you go closer than you would have

3444
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:44,880
thought

3445
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:47,360
so good good reference by the way gooey

3446
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:48,800
is a hell of a breeder that doesn't

3447
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:51,039
that people don't know that's a great

3448
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,760
reference by the way

3449
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:53,039
so

3450
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:54,400
something i wanted to quickly bring up

3451
01:53:53,039 --> 01:53:55,359
this this one you may or may not have

3452
01:53:54,399 --> 01:53:57,198
heard of

3453
01:53:55,359 --> 01:53:59,519
when i remember you first talking about

3454
01:53:57,198 --> 01:54:01,279
super soil i'm pretty sure the cook time

3455
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:02,080
has always been about three months you

3456
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:03,759
know

3457
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:05,760
i swear it's like a competition now and

3458
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:07,760
i hear people saying you know like six

3459
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:09,360
weeks eight weeks and i just feel like

3460
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,280
it's going to be somewhat detrimental to

3461
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:13,279
the plant

3462
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:15,679
do you find that uh reducing that cook

3463
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:17,840
time is detrimental to the plant

3464
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:20,079
okay so eight weeks is really good six

3465
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,279
to eight weeks um yes if it doesn't if

3466
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:22,800
you don't break down especially if

3467
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:24,319
they're using uh

3468
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,000
if they're not if they're using glacial

3469
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:27,599
rock dust which some of the recipes

3470
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,118
people still use that that does not

3471
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:30,719
break down um

3472
01:54:29,118 --> 01:54:32,479
if they're using leonardites a little

3473
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,158
slower there's a couple of things in the

3474
01:54:32,479 --> 01:54:34,879
mix it takes a little longer

3475
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:36,158
we

3476
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,279
have something we do it's completely

3477
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:42,000
different here we keep six cans made

3478
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:43,759
so if we drop three cans we keep six i

3479
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,960
can tell you that i happen to know that

3480
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:47,679
that um

3481
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:49,279
jill runs nine so we keep them full all

3482
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:51,039
the time and i would say most of our

3483
01:54:49,279 --> 01:54:52,319
supersoul is approaching two months of

3484
01:54:51,039 --> 01:54:54,319
age

3485
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:56,639
people think it goes bad

3486
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:58,799
soil it's not gonna go bad

3487
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:00,800
but remember the nat thing

3488
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,719
if you leave it outside for too long and

3489
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:05,440
it gets moist you can

3490
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:07,198
make a breeding sanctuary for gnats

3491
01:55:05,439 --> 01:55:09,279
two inches of neen creek across the top

3492
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:11,519
will prevent that

3493
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:12,800
good advice good advice

3494
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,119
so one of the things i saw in that

3495
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,560
thread today someone wanted to know how

3496
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:18,079
come you were banned from breed bay i

3497
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:20,000
don't actually know any of the context

3498
01:55:18,079 --> 01:55:21,599
to this so it's just going to be totally

3499
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,679
all new to me

3500
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:25,760

01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:28,960
beef with my ex i never really got along

3503

and

3504
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:33,840

01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,840
turns into some big drama and nobody

3539

logic

3548
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:56,638

3549
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:58,239
why

3550
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:01,520
some of the people that we work with

3551
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:04,079
like ed borg of delta 9 a 22-year

3558
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:20,719
one of the other criticisms i've heard

3559
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:22,319
from people is that

3560
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:24,000
i think it's probably true that at one

3561
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,479
point you were definitely one of the

3562
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,840
main breeders on attitude it seems like

3563
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:29,039
you've done very well on that

3564
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:31,360
historically

3565
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:33,279
what i heard was that you had a lot of

3566
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:34,880
influence over attitude and who got to

3567
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:36,000
vend on that site is there any truth to

3568
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,039
that or do you want to comment on that

3569
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,960
at all

3570
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:40,319
no it's not true at all

3571
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,760
i was there when there was only a few

3572
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:43,439
breeders and so i made a ton of [ __ ]

3573
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,039
money i was the guy going to the

3574
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:46,638
cannabis cup there wasn't anybody else

3575
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:47,840
really i liked a couple of people and

3576
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:49,279
then they started picking people up you

3577
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,319
got to realize i was there before big

3578
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:52,399
buddha

3579
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:54,639
my first high times cup i stood ass

3580
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,799
cheek to ass cheat with big buddha at a

3581
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:59,039
three by three table him behind me he's

3582
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:01,520
selling his cheese i was selling jack

3583
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:03,840
the ripper i mean we all kind of started

3584
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:04,840
from the same roots you know

3585
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,039
so

3586
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:08,800
yeah what's it like to deal with these

3587
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:10,079
international banks now do you still

3588
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,000
have these issues like what you

3589
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:14,479
mentioned with logic or is it a bit more

3590
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,319
business-like nowadays no we we we

3591
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:18,718

3622
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:17,360

3623
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:19,599
people out there

3624
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:20,880
he read this one guys thing he goes no i

3625
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:22,319
said why ain't signing because his

3626
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:24,239
contract says if we have a dispute we

3627
01:59:22,319 --> 01:59:26,639
have to go to [ __ ] new jersey

3628
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:28,238
oh yeah we're not signing that [ __ ]

3629
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:29,599

3630
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:31,839

3632
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:37,119
and they're like okay so he signed ours

3633
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,118
so we have a better nda

3634
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:41,279
so

3635
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,119
i gotta give a little bit of credit to

3636
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:44,639
uh my friend who i have actually

3637
01:59:43,118 --> 01:59:45,759
forgotten his name but he helped me with

3638
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:46,880
this one

3639
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,599
basically

3640
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:51,279
in one of the old weed episode weed nerd

3641
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,279
episodes apologies

3642
01:59:51,279 --> 01:59:54,960
you asked the fan for suggestions of a

3643
01:59:53,279 --> 01:59:57,039
strain name and eventually the

3644
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,118
suggestion of electric watermelon hash

3645
01:59:57,039 --> 02:00:01,039
plant came up but then kind of the next

3646
01:59:59,118 --> 02:00:02,799
episode you said oh we can't use that

3647
02:00:01,039 --> 02:00:04,639
because that one's already in use

3648
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:06,480
however a lot of people will point out

3649
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:08,719
that there's a few strains from the tga

3650
02:00:06,479 --> 02:00:10,638
stables which have taken names of

3651
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:12,800
already existing strains like deep

3652
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:14,159
purple from jordan of the islands as

3653
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,920
well as strawberry daiquiri from

3654
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:18,000
surefire seeds

3655
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:19,840
do you think that you know like you do

3656
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,439
try to avoid this overlapping of the

3657
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,960
names being taken was it something

3658
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:25,118
you're aware of

3659
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,399
yeah so in the old days it was easy in

3660
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:27,679
the old days you made up a name and it

3661
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:28,719
wasn't taken

3662
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:30,079
simple

3663
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:31,840
when i started doing this there was no

3664
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:33,679
such thing as the name of cannabis it

3665
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:36,000
just wasn't though you can name anything

3666
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:38,800
we want to we could name it dump truck

3667
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,920
[ __ ] that was cool but now the

3668
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:43,920
other day this is a great example so

3669
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:45,599
joel just released a strain to me called

3670
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,440
great goo

3671
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:50,480
so i typed the [ __ ] thing into google

3672
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:53,118
and it comes up all over the place

3673
02:00:50,479 --> 02:00:55,678
so i changed the name of this tester to

3674
02:00:53,118 --> 02:00:57,598
af groovy

3675
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:59,599
and joel calls me goes hey

3676
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:02,239
this is [ __ ] it's great goo when i

3677
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:03,920
said well no great goo is he goes no

3678
02:01:02,238 --> 02:01:06,000
great goo is just names and [ __ ] there's

3679
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:07,440
no verified genetic heritage and we're

3680
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,039
keeping the name

3681
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:11,598
[ __ ] changes

3682
02:01:09,039 --> 02:01:13,439
so yes i would rather not the other part

3683
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:16,159
of it's kind of i'm pretty sure my deep

3684
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:18,479
purple was before jordan's i was aware

3685
02:01:16,158 --> 02:01:20,399
of the strawberry daiquiri okay so i

3686
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:22,638
grew the strawberry dacrop

3687
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:25,359
uh the plant out and it has to be

3688
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:28,079
strawberry daiquiri it's it has to be

3689
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:30,639
it's kyle cushman's strawberry cough

3690
02:01:28,079 --> 02:01:32,399
times the thc jack the ripper male and

3691
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:34,719
it tastes like a [ __ ] strawberry

3692
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:36,158
daiquiri onion wasn't aware of it until

3693
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:37,679
i had already tested it under those

3694
02:01:36,158 --> 02:01:38,799
names when i looked it up i said well

3695
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:40,399
you know what

3696
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,279
there are only so many names to go

3697
02:01:40,399 --> 02:01:42,719
around

3698
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:44,719
so that one's going to be somebody

3699
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:46,399
else's strawberry daiquiri and this

3700
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:48,319
one's going to be sub cool strawberry

3701
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:51,920
daiquiri it was a decision because

3702
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:53,840
they're just only so many names left

3703
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:57,440
every stoner on the planet has sat

3704
02:01:53,840 --> 02:02:00,400

3705
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:02,479

3709
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:11,439
uh there's 12 strains with the

3710
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:14,239

at first really tried now i don't give a

3712

3721
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:34,238

3725
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:40,238

3727
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:45,359

3728
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:47,039
the only copy of it was at my house two

3729
02:02:45,359 --> 02:02:49,359
nights before the fire frenchie was at

3730
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:50,960
my house the night making hash

3731
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:53,598

3733
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:58,320
i said okay leo there was next day hey

3734
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:00,159

3736
02:03:00,158 --> 02:03:02,799

3737
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:05,598
and he didn't and it burned up in the

3738
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:07,119
[ __ ] fire so leo says he has a line

3739
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:08,480
on it but right now we do not have a

3740
02:03:07,118 --> 02:03:10,238
line on it which means we can't make

3741
02:03:08,479 --> 02:03:12,158
cuvee and we can't make tinto and

3742
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:14,559
they're my two favorite strains i'm

3743
02:03:12,158 --> 02:03:16,559
trying to call leo as much as i can

3744
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:19,119
you also understand when i call leo he's

3745
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:20,000
busy as [ __ ] he's got 300 acres and he's

3746
02:03:19,118 --> 02:03:21,759
growing

3747
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,079
so while he loves me and cares about me

3748
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:25,760
and wants to help me he's busy so i

3749
02:03:24,079 --> 02:03:27,599
hadn't heard from him in four weeks

3750
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:28,719
three days ago he sent me a text that

3751
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:30,480
said sub

3752
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:32,480
i have a line on the clone and i'll be

3753
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:33,919
contacting you i texted him back and he

3754
02:03:32,479 --> 02:03:35,759
never even responded

3755
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:37,840
busy is busy you know

3756
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:40,000
yeah it's interesting we speak about

3757
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:42,800
aficionado because in the uh the

3758
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,880
infamous thread we reference one of the

3759
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:46,960
very obscure points brought up was that

3760
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:48,239
someone felt that tga genetics were

3761
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:49,760
overpriced

3762
02:03:48,238 --> 02:03:51,759
forget that for just one moment i want

3763
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,199
you to consider that in contrast to

3764
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:54,719
aficionado you know do you think that

3765
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:56,879
that statement holds any weight when

3766
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:59,118
you've got people admittedly you mean a

3767
02:03:56,880 --> 02:04:00,719
300 wooden box no i don't think my

3768
02:03:59,118 --> 02:04:02,960
proceeds are overpriced i'm sorry and i

3769
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:04,800
love leo to death but i sell seeds for

3770
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:07,039
forty dollars and that's a very

3771
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:08,880
reasonable price we pay two dollars to

3772
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:10,800
manufacture them and we

3773
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:13,520
what happens is attitude turns around

3774
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:16,000
and sells them for 160 dollars that's

3775
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,719
not me

3776
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,520
would you ever consider trying to impose

3777
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:22,880
some type of ceiling on your

3778
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:24,159
prices where you say look i just don't

3779
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:25,520
ever want it going above this level i

3780
02:04:24,158 --> 02:04:26,799
just feel it's a bit excessive at that

3781
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:28,400
point

3782
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:30,400
no the industry did that crockett was

3783
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:32,799
standing at cush talk this weekend

3784
02:04:30,399 --> 02:04:34,319
himself selling 13 c's for 50 you're

3785
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,760
about to see the price of siege take a

3786
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:37,519
[ __ ]

3787
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:38,960
yeah okay

3788
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:40,239
so

3789
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:42,800
do you think that's just going to drive

3790
02:04:40,238 --> 02:04:44,799
out the small time producers

3791
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:47,039
well yeah i mean you got to keep up it's

3792
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:47,039
uh

3793
02:04:47,118 --> 02:04:50,319
well i mean that shocked me he actually

3794
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:52,560
came over to my boot to our booth and

3795
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:55,039
talked to our people and i love croc

3796
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:56,880
it's not i mean all i'm saying

3797
02:04:55,039 --> 02:04:58,800
was it's tough out there this man was

3798
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,599
standing there selling seeds that's it

3799
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:02,320
it's

3800
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:05,039
13 seeds for 50 that's

3801
02:05:02,319 --> 02:05:06,479
that's a really good deal yeah for

3802
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:07,679
crockett seeds

3803
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:09,279
that cheap

3804
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:10,639
so in the old days we'd go to an event

3805
02:05:09,279 --> 02:05:11,920
we'd make two hundred thousand dollars

3806
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:14,400
that cush stock would make twenty two

3807
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:16,399
hundred dollars you think i'm going back

3808
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:17,759
wow yeah

3809
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:19,279
plus you can buy a pack of seeds on

3810
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,199
instagram like

3811
02:05:19,279 --> 02:05:22,800

3812
02:05:21,198 --> 02:05:25,359
bringing a pack of seeds nowadays i mean

3813
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,279
it is become silly you can uber [ __ ]

3814
02:05:25,359 --> 02:05:30,000
weed to your house so

3815
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:31,599
you don't really have to

3816
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,039
do the other things we used to do i mean

3817
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:36,159
you can have somebody bring a pizza and

3818
02:05:33,039 --> 02:05:37,359
a bag of pot to your house here so

3819
02:05:36,158 --> 02:05:38,559
yeah

3820
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:41,359
so you could probably swing by and get

3821
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:41,360
your pack of seeds

3822
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:46,639
i had heard rumors that uh

3823
02:05:44,238 --> 02:05:48,399
agent orange was possibly used in the

3824
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:50,319
creation of tangie have you heard

3825
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:52,078
anything along those lines

3826
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:55,599
no i mean i'll comment on that for sure

3827
02:05:52,078 --> 02:05:57,519
so eric 77 brought us california orange

3828
02:05:55,599 --> 02:05:59,840
california orange is used by me to

3829
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:02,000
create things in the old days it's used

3830
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:04,960
by dna to create things and orange

3831
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,719
velvet is california orange it's all the

3832
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:09,118
same cut

3833
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:11,039
our cut came from some people and it was

3834
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:12,960
called melvin and we thought melvin was

3835
02:06:11,039 --> 02:06:14,479
a [ __ ] stupid name

3836
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:17,118
and it smelled like oranges so it's

3837
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:18,238
orange velvet but they're all california

3838
02:06:17,118 --> 02:06:21,198
orange

3839
02:06:18,238 --> 02:06:24,638
and they came from eric 77 in

3840
02:06:21,198 --> 02:06:26,799
gainesville in 1979.

3841
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:28,560
yeah i've i've heard that a lot of it is

3842
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:31,119
very much just callio dominant

3843
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:33,199
expressions isn't it do you think that

3844
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:34,559
we'll see the orange trend come back or

3845
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:36,078
do you think it's kind of peaked and

3846
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,280
we'll you know we won't see it again for

3847
02:06:36,078 --> 02:06:39,920
a while

3848
02:06:37,279 --> 02:06:42,559
i'm so over orange i will never smoke it

3849
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:44,480
again so you won't see me making it

3850
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:46,320
that's a good answer so what type of

3851
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:47,598
flavor profiles are you looking to move

3852
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:50,319
on to

3853
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:52,000
chocolate cherry banana and watermelon

3854
02:06:50,319 --> 02:06:53,439
those are some pretty unique ones you're

3855
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,198
talking kind of individually or more

3856
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:57,519
blending them all together

3857
02:06:55,198 --> 02:06:58,399
just those remember that rainbow story

3858
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,840

3859
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:01,839

02:07:43,118 --> 02:07:46,719
is a nepali queen and nepali has this

3881
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:49,679
really

3882
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:51,198
hashy grapey old school

3883
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:52,239
like old dope

3884
02:07:51,198 --> 02:07:55,359
you know when you went and bought a bag

3885
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:56,959
of dank when you were kid that old funky

3886
02:07:55,359 --> 02:07:58,799
incense smell

3887
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:00,800
so that's the nepali and that's one of

3888
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:01,760
joel's man it's old clone that we

3889
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:03,920
brought out

3890
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,639
a new and lemon stilton are you kidding

3891
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:07,359
me

3892
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:09,800
he took jtr and he crossed it with the

3893
02:08:07,359 --> 02:08:12,880
cheese so you get the

3894
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:15,119
thcv pain killing effect

3895
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:16,800
with the pain killing effect of cheese i

3896
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:18,880
don't know if you know this

3897
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:22,400
but people who have rheumatoid arthritis

3898
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:24,480
swear by cheese and i can't tell you why

3899
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:26,078
scientifically i don't know

3900
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:28,638
i know i know much old vets that are

3901
02:08:26,078 --> 02:08:30,559
beat [ __ ] and back and they love cheese

3902
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:33,118
and so when you mix it with that jtr you

3903
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:36,719
get an additional pain killing effect

3904
02:08:33,118 --> 02:08:38,238
thcv acts on the cb2 receptor the cb2

3905
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:39,920
receptor is responsible for your

3906
02:08:38,238 --> 02:08:42,238
autoimmune system so if you can

3907
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:45,199
stimulate the autoimmune system you can

3908
02:08:42,238 --> 02:08:48,799
help heal yourself and that's why thc is

3909
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:51,198
so uh important and it's very rare and

3910
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:53,520
since we discovered it and five percent

3911
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:55,039
in the jack the ripper you see a lot of

3912
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:57,599
people running jack the ripper looking

3913
02:08:55,039 --> 02:09:01,039
for a male in the hundreds of seeds

3914
02:08:57,599 --> 02:09:02,960
trying to find that that rare jtr male

3915
02:09:01,039 --> 02:09:04,800
yeah i can definitely agree on the

3916
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:06,800
stimulating the immune system idea i'm a

3917
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:07,679
big believer of that as well

3918
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:09,360
so

3919
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:10,719
i am interested to know do you have any

3920
02:09:09,359 --> 02:09:13,279
theories i think you may have said you

3921
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:15,840
do on where those watermelon terps lie

3922
02:09:13,279 --> 02:09:17,920
because they seem to be the most kind of

3923
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:19,440
the you know they're just being exposed

3924
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:20,960
and i'm sure they're amazing i haven't

3925
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:23,279
yet been able to try them where do you

3926
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:24,880
think they come from genetically

3927
02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:27,679
i don't know but there's a strand called

3928
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:29,199
goji and it tastes like watermelons and

3929
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:32,158
i don't even know where it's at i just

3930
02:09:29,198 --> 02:09:35,359
this is uh internet research okay yep

3931
02:09:32,158 --> 02:09:37,279
and i gotta go try to find golgi i don't

3932
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:38,799
i don't even know what it is or anything

3933
02:09:37,279 --> 02:09:40,559
about it but i understand it has a

3934
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:42,159
watermelon tarp in it

3935
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:43,520
but i will have to say something else

3936
02:09:42,158 --> 02:09:45,359
that's gonna stagger you i'm not

3937
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:47,280
currently breeding

3938
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:48,880
i moved here we have a very unique

3939
02:09:47,279 --> 02:09:50,880
program here

3940
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:53,599
we have a numbers game so

3941
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:56,078
right now i'm at 24 tuesday we get a

3942
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:58,078
piece of card i get 36.

3943
02:09:56,078 --> 02:10:01,039
on thursday i go to 48 and eventually

3944
02:09:58,078 --> 02:10:02,719
we'll have 60 here but when we moved in

3945
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:04,238
i can only have 12 plants which is why i

3946
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:06,000
have [ __ ] eight giant plants in my

3947
02:10:04,238 --> 02:10:07,519
pool it's really simple

3948
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,198
i couldn't grow

3949
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:12,159
the number of plants that i would grow

3950
02:10:09,198 --> 02:10:14,638
in the pool so we grew big [ __ ]

3951
02:10:12,158 --> 02:10:16,399
plants i would imagine

3952
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:18,800
unless the pool project is the most

3953
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:20,078
successful experiment in life

3954
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:22,159
those things will get torn down and

3955
02:10:20,078 --> 02:10:25,039
we'll go back to the standard four 10

3956
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:26,719
gallon pots under a 1000 where we get

3957
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:29,198
almost three pounds

3958
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:31,198
but if you've seen the pool

3959
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:33,198
we've employed these special cages

3960
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:36,238
called grow efficient cages

3961
02:10:33,198 --> 02:10:38,078
steel frames five by five and this

3962
02:10:36,238 --> 02:10:39,919
gentleman says strain specific we can

3963
02:10:38,078 --> 02:10:42,799
get five pounds a piece

3964
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:44,880
and that would be 40 units i'm skeptical

3965
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,320
but if we get that we may just continue

3966
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:49,118
growing the big trees indoors because

3967
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:49,118
it's [ __ ] fun

3968
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:54,000
so a lot of our viewers love to get the

3969
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:55,679
kind of growers tips from our guests

3970
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,880
a lot of our viewers also organic which

3971
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:59,359
is going to work perfectly because you

3972
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,639
know you're speaking to the the choir

3973
02:10:59,359 --> 02:11:02,399
what type of things do you like to

3974
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:04,159
supplement your super soil plants with

3975
02:11:02,399 --> 02:11:05,598
you know you mentioned teas earlier what

3976
02:11:04,158 --> 02:11:06,638
are some general tips you might have for

3977
02:11:05,599 --> 02:11:08,800
us

3978
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:11,039
so last year we started making our own

3979
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:12,800
teas which we got great results from

3980
02:11:11,039 --> 02:11:14,880
that's kind of what we call a low till

3981
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:17,840
so you have a super soil with a lasagna

3982
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,679
tech lasagna texas crabmeal and alfalfa

3983
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:20,800
and different things in between with a

3984
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:22,880
cover crop

3985
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:25,360
but we have teamed up with the dragonfly

3986
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,880
earth nutrient company and um i have to

3987
02:11:25,359 --> 02:11:28,479
tell the whole story so in the old days

3988
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,239
they sent me some and i didn't

3989
02:11:28,479 --> 02:11:32,078
i didn't take it serious i i joked

3990
02:11:30,238 --> 02:11:33,519
around oh hippy crap and i didn't take

3991
02:11:32,078 --> 02:11:35,039
it seriously i actually burned my plans

3992
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,719
because i didn't pay attention

3993
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:38,560
so when we we had them on the show and

3994
02:11:36,719 --> 02:11:40,158
they were such nice people i'm like well

3995
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:41,599
these people are really nice people i

3996
02:11:40,158 --> 02:11:43,598
need to pay attention and stop being an

3997
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:45,599
asshat so i paid attention and i got to

3998
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:47,679
know their company and they sent us

3999
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:49,599
uh a large amount of products and so

4000
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:51,199
we're feeding the super soil now we've

4001
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:54,560
been in veg

4002
02:11:51,198 --> 02:11:56,238
for god

4003
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:58,159
14 weeks now

4004
02:11:56,238 --> 02:12:00,158
so yeah and this is not your standard

4005
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:01,118
system so we've been using the luscious

4006
02:12:00,158 --> 02:12:04,158
green

4007
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:06,479
and the flowers we also used the we did

4008
02:12:04,158 --> 02:12:08,799
fuller last night

4009
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:10,000
which leads me to a crazy thing and i

4010
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:12,159
won't get back to the tips but check

4011
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,679
this out did you know that if you use

4012
02:12:12,158 --> 02:12:16,319
fuller spray

4013
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:19,039
that your micros testing in a lab are

4014
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:21,840
going to test above 10 000 and based on

4015
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:25,279
new regulations in washington

4016
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:27,679
oregon and colorado that would fail the

4017
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:29,599
test for natural by the way cannabis

4018
02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:32,880
cannot be organic because organic is a

4019
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:35,199
word of the fda it's a federal

4020
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:36,800
term so there is no such thing as

4021
02:12:35,198 --> 02:12:38,799
organic cannabis

4022
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:42,159
there's natural cannabis

4023
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:43,760
and that's a real definition in there so

4024
02:12:42,158 --> 02:12:46,158
we really like the idea of using

4025
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:49,440
beneficials but if you spray stuff on

4026
02:12:46,158 --> 02:12:51,439
your plants in certain areas you may not

4027
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:53,359
pass the lab test because they can't

4028
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:55,039
differentiate between bad microbes which

4029
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:56,799
would be [ __ ]

4030
02:12:55,039 --> 02:12:58,319
and good microbes which would be like

4031
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:00,079
basilius

4032
02:12:58,319 --> 02:13:01,519
that that's a really important point a

4033
02:13:00,078 --> 02:13:03,679
lot of people in those areas may not be

4034
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,599
aware i guess maybe a question which

4035
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:07,118
immediately jumps to mind is do you know

4036
02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:09,199
if there would be a rough cut off time

4037
02:13:07,118 --> 02:13:11,198
if you used it in veg it'd be okay just

4038
02:13:09,198 --> 02:13:12,879
don't use it in flour or buy a certain

4039
02:13:11,198 --> 02:13:15,598
week of flour stop using or do you think

4040
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:18,159
it's just a bit unknown at this point

4041
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:20,239
i wish i knew we we just learned this

4042
02:13:18,158 --> 02:13:21,519
i'm sounding awful smart because a lab

4043
02:13:20,238 --> 02:13:23,198
scientist stood there and talked to me

4044
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:25,119
about 40 minutes just three days ago or

4045
02:13:23,198 --> 02:13:26,479
i wouldn't sound nearly as smart but

4046
02:13:25,118 --> 02:13:28,238
what we found out is some really good

4047
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:29,519
cannabis that we looked at was testing a

4048
02:13:28,238 --> 02:13:31,279
90 000

4049
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,079
jewels or jazz or whatever the hell it

4050
02:13:31,279 --> 02:13:34,559
was

4051
02:13:32,078 --> 02:13:35,840
and see if you thank you cfuz i thought

4052
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:37,599
you smartered me

4053
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:39,599
and um but it was good there's nothing

4054
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:41,360
wrong with it but at 90 000 under these

4055
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:42,719
new regulations it would immediately be

4056
02:13:41,359 --> 02:13:44,479
destroyed

4057
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:46,960
so they don't understand the difference

4058
02:13:44,479 --> 02:13:48,158
between good beneficials and bad and i

4059
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:49,439
think it's one of the things that the

4060
02:13:48,158 --> 02:13:50,719
weed nerd is you know i've been doing

4061
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:52,638
shows on it i've been teaching the

4062
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:54,319
growers and one of the things i can use

4063
02:13:52,639 --> 02:13:55,760
my platform is to send information out

4064
02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:57,439
so i've already been teaching the world

4065
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:59,920
that they're trying to ban organic

4066
02:13:57,439 --> 02:14:01,839
growing because the simple solution to

4067
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:03,840
not testing above 10 000 is to grow with

4068
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:06,400
salts and cocoa and that's not the kind

4069
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:09,840
of cannabis i smoke i prefer not to

4070
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:12,399
smoke salts just all there is to it

4071
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:14,639
so i'm i'm you know hugely passionate

4072
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:16,238
about organics but a debate i'm

4073
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:18,560
interested in is

4074
02:14:16,238 --> 02:14:20,158
if you got the absolute highest quality

4075
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:22,000
produced salt grown and the highest

4076
02:14:20,158 --> 02:14:23,439
quality organic do you think do you

4077
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,960
think they're on par or do you think

4078
02:14:23,439 --> 02:14:26,960
there's still a better because i

4079
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,639
struggle with this personally i i've

4080
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:31,198
from my personal experience i think the

4081
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:33,520
absolute best salt grown it can be close

4082
02:14:31,198 --> 02:14:35,118
if not on par you know and that but but

4083
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:36,960
it's i never see it you know i see it

4084
02:14:35,118 --> 02:14:39,439
like once once a year at the emerald cup

4085
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,719
from one person soul growing is not easy

4086
02:14:39,439 --> 02:14:43,198
and not everybody does it right i can

4087
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:45,039
tell you that long ago me and um

4088
02:14:43,198 --> 02:14:46,799
me and jill did a side by side she did

4089
02:14:45,039 --> 02:14:48,800
hydro and soil and she crushed me on

4090
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:50,880
yield and we both agreed that the soil

4091
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:52,639
grown pot tasted better both i mean it

4092
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:54,639
was not it was like she got like eight

4093
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:56,239
ounces and i got like three ounces

4094
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:58,319
because they're playing oversized mine

4095
02:14:56,238 --> 02:15:00,879
it was just really fun cool experiment a

4096
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:02,319
wonderful memory but in the end i mean

4097
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:04,159
her body even looked better and had more

4098
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:05,679
resin on it but in the end when you

4099
02:15:04,158 --> 02:15:07,359
smoked a bong hit

4100
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:09,039
the [ __ ] in the dirt smoke better turn

4101
02:15:07,359 --> 02:15:10,479
white and disappeared

4102
02:15:09,039 --> 02:15:12,238
that's that's why a lot of people grow

4103
02:15:10,479 --> 02:15:14,479
soil and i haven't said that

4104
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:15,839
scientifically there's no difference

4105
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:17,519
but we both know there's something

4106
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:19,920
symbiotic going on down there in the

4107
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:22,480
soil and the roots and there's some kind

4108
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:24,399
of harmony and some kind of hippie [ __ ]

4109
02:15:22,479 --> 02:15:26,399
going on there and that's why so many

4110
02:15:24,399 --> 02:15:29,279
people grow in soil

4111
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:30,879
yeah i i totally agree and i um i don't

4112
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:32,639
get into a lot of hippie [ __ ] but i get

4113
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,560
into a lot of hippy [ __ ] around soil and

4114
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:36,000
the benefits of like just even

4115
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:38,000
interacting with it and stuff i think

4116
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,599
it's real

4117
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:42,639
one of the last things i wanted to ask

4118
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:44,480
you about was the chernobyl line this

4119
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:46,000
and especially the slimer clone has

4120
02:15:44,479 --> 02:15:48,479
gained a lot of popularity would you

4121
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,399
consider ever working with it more

4122
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:52,000
it's yeah i mean i actually have slimer

4123
02:15:50,399 --> 02:15:53,359
here and not only do i have slimer here

4124
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,198
but we talked about earlier i have the

4125
02:15:53,359 --> 02:15:57,118
genetic rights to sell it it was

4126
02:15:55,198 --> 02:15:59,598
marketed under my own strength but the

4127
02:15:57,118 --> 02:16:01,519
story of slimers clarisse a guy named

4128
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:03,119
coma found the clone and started yelling

4129
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:05,199
slimer slimer slimer i never even had

4130
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:06,479
the damn thing and it started showing up

4131
02:16:05,198 --> 02:16:07,678
in clubs and everything and then

4132
02:16:06,479 --> 02:16:10,559
somebody gave it to me and then there's

4133
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:13,279
the golden ticket man these are just

4134
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:15,840
phenotypes i i cannot buy into this

4135
02:16:13,279 --> 02:16:17,519
[ __ ] i mean there's one fino that

4136
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:19,119
runs around called slimer i guarantee if

4137
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:21,280
you caught a 10-pack you'd find another

4138
02:16:19,118 --> 02:16:23,920
one another 10-pack you'd find another

4139
02:16:21,279 --> 02:16:26,880
one it's just a genetic expression

4140
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:28,960
yes it happens to make a lot of resin

4141
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:30,400
but all chernobyl strains make a lot of

4142
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:32,000
resin i mean

4143
02:16:30,399 --> 02:16:34,159
it's a strain called blood wreck and it

4144
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,000
just it piles it out and i'm happy to

4145
02:16:34,159 --> 02:16:37,519
report that badger has the blood wreck

4146
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,280
cut and the jack the ripper and he's

4147
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:44,159
making chernobyl right now so

4148
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:46,159
something that we really enjoy making um

4149
02:16:44,159 --> 02:16:48,638
is still around and what i would suggest

4150
02:16:46,159 --> 02:16:50,959
is if you are a grower to grow out a

4151
02:16:48,638 --> 02:16:52,959
10-pack and find your own slimer versus

4152
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:55,839
something that somebody else selected

4153
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:58,159
because we all have our own taste

4154
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:01,359
and what someone likes you may not so

4155
02:16:58,159 --> 02:17:03,519
i've always been the growit and selected

4156
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:04,880
guy to the point where even around here

4157
02:17:03,519 --> 02:17:06,960
the shops that the people around here

4158
02:17:04,879 --> 02:17:09,358
will not crack a pack of seeds they'll

4159
02:17:06,959 --> 02:17:11,919
come to sub's house and take some cuts

4160
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:13,840
hey sub will you take a cut for us can

4161
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:15,599
we have one of your cuts i was like

4162
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:17,679
crack a pack of seeds and i can crack up

4163
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:18,639
a 10 pack and find the best female in 50

4164
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:20,558
days

4165
02:17:18,638 --> 02:17:23,358
it's just laziness that people don't do

4166
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:24,799
it having said that i'll keep cracking

4167
02:17:23,359 --> 02:17:26,479
seeds and finding those winters and

4168
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:28,318
putting them out on the street which is

4169
02:17:26,478 --> 02:17:30,558
what coma did and that's why you hear

4170
02:17:28,318 --> 02:17:32,318
about these things there's other ones

4171
02:17:30,558 --> 02:17:33,679
there's the watermelon fino of nine

4172
02:17:32,318 --> 02:17:35,679
pound hammer

4173
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:37,120
there's the there's the marmalade fino

4174
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:39,519
of jelly bean

4175
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:42,319
there's the rubber tire pheno of agent

4176
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:45,200
orange there's the god's [ __ ] pheno of

4177
02:17:42,318 --> 02:17:48,159
vortex there's the purple quirkle they

4178
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:50,639
just the internet tends to put labels on

4179
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:53,280
things and then people latch on to them

4180
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:54,318
it's great stories

4181
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:56,639
yeah okay

4182
02:17:54,318 --> 02:17:57,840
i certainly can uh echo that sentiment

4183
02:17:56,638 --> 02:17:59,438
of you know popping more seeds and

4184
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:01,280
finding your own one because i i can

4185
02:17:59,439 --> 02:18:03,280
attest you know i found my own slime and

4186
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:04,960
it's amazing

4187
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:06,000
this basically brings us to the last

4188
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:08,079
part of the interview where we do the

4189
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,318
quick fire questions so first of all

4190
02:18:08,079 --> 02:18:13,679
what's your favorite strain right now

4191
02:18:10,318 --> 02:18:13,679
god that's hard

4192
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:18,239
it's got it's got to be the jesus man i

4193
02:18:16,239 --> 02:18:20,959
mean

4194
02:18:18,239 --> 02:18:22,799
it's just it dumps so many crystals and

4195
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:24,879
it does it so well it's got a great

4196
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:25,920
inspiring high but that's an unfair

4197
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:26,638
question

4198
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:28,879
yeah

4199
02:18:26,638 --> 02:18:30,638
my favorite strength today is pineapple

of the spectrum what do you think is the

4208
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:51,319

4259
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:40,079

02:20:40,318 --> 02:20:44,000
i did it i mean i had there's nothing i

4261
02:20:42,559 --> 02:20:45,279
haven't worked with i know it's a cheeky

4262
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,040
answer there's nothing that i haven't

4263
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:50,000
asked for gotten or worked with in my

4264
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:53,840
life nothing the g13

4265
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:57,120
calimus a13 c99 the killer queen

4266
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:58,799
aka i know i'm happy i mean i'm i would

4267
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:01,120
like to have the pinot noir back really

4268
02:20:58,799 --> 02:21:01,920
[ __ ] bad so if anybody has a line on

4269
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:03,680
it i

4270
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:04,960
would really really really like to have

4271
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:06,639
it but

4272
02:21:04,959 --> 02:21:08,318
i pretty much have access to anything i

4273
02:21:06,639 --> 02:21:10,239
want and i

4274
02:21:08,318 --> 02:21:11,840
maybe the original northern lights you

4275
02:21:10,239 --> 02:21:13,359
know before it was adulterated so i

4276
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:15,280
could actually maybe see what it was

4277
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:16,800
like before it became five or whatever

4278
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:18,479
but

4279
02:21:16,799 --> 02:21:21,039
even that one but i mean i smoked it and

4280
02:21:18,478 --> 02:21:24,000
worked with it you know so i guess i'm

4281
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:25,760
saying i'm really happy with my life

4282
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,200
it was a really good answer so i think

4283
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:28,398
that probably just about brings us to

4284
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,760
