00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:22,618
hello and welcome to the next episode of

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:28,500
the podcast a cannabis podcast for

4
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:30,539
budding enthusiasts in this episode

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:37,170
we're joined by Jeremy from build a soil

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:38,640
to chat all things organic growing so

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,780
buckle in for some awesome organic

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,189
knowledge from the man himself so first

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,750
of all this is the only time I ever do

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,789
this I wanted to say this episode is

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,950
actually dedicated to someone it's

12
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,020
dedicated to all of the growers out

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,329
there who are thinking about maybe

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,489
switching over but maybe you use bottled

15
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,410
nutrients at the moment and maybe it's a

16
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,390
part of your income or you just scared

17
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,759
things will fall apart trust me and I

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,210
listen to us and the world won't come

19
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,859
grinding to a halt I promise so before

20
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:09,559
we get started

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,269
Jeremy what's your favorite straiten

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,189
well I don't know I've been one of those

23
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,280
types of growers that's been a seed

24
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,199
hoarder and always looking to collect

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,239
something I get easily excited about

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,430
crosses that I wasn't able to get become

27
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,798
available or a buddy that I respect

28
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,090
their work made across and so my garden

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,829
has really been I guess complemented by

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,359
organics because I can run many

31
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:36,449
different cultivars never having grown

32
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,340
them before and a lot of times they're

33
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,259
all able to run on the same regimen and

34
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,820
that was attractive to me so it's hard

35
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,849
for me to pick a favorite I grow a

36
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,709
different flavor almost every time but

37
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:47,789
one of those clone only elites there's

38
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,859
several of them that are running around

39
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,100
out there and it seems like the glue has

40
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,118
been one of those very consistent even

41
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,769
if somebody doesn't do a great job

42
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,750
growing it comes out smelling very

43
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,218
similar and looking good it has a ton of

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,530
oil on it when you're going to press it

45
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:03,718
or if you're gonna make a concentrate

46
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,310
from it and so that's one that I keep

47
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,140
going back to right now in my garden

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,300
there's one that it's very unique came

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,340
from Canada and it was a freebie and it

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
was a gene jinguk

51
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,300
crossed with a

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,130
Marrakesh and the jean-guy was a really

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,210
sought after clone only white widows

54
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:19,409
something you know I don't know the

55
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,290
background on it but this one in

56
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:25,139
particular really purple hair and the

57
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:27,780
odor is just unmistakably candy-like and

58
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,219
it's really really stinky so I'm hoping

59
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,169
that it translates to taste it I guess

60
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:35,819
we'll find out awesome

61
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:37,649
so I think the first big question is why

62
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:41,699
should people be growing organically

63
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,550
over say bottled nutrients it's a good

64
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,289
question for me it was about congruence

65
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,290
in the beginning before I knew a lot and

66
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:52,229
so I was already eating organic I was

67
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:55,139
already trying to remove processed foods

68
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,969
and I was being at least starting to be

69
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,729
conscious about the carbon footprint

70
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,050
involved in my lifestyle and I'm a

71
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:04,319
hypocrite in a lot of those areas

72
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,390
because I'm not perfect but I choose to

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,359
make decisions in areas where I can

74
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:11,489
easily make an impact so started growing

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,810
and had some success but when I went to

76
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,560
the grow shop there was no organic

77
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,330
options

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,800
I mentioned being congruent I was

79
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,410
already living a lifestyle that was more

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,390
that that method and so when I started

81
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:25,590
growing and really got a little more

82
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:27,899
serious about in 2009 there was a number

83
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,069
of options available that were organic

84
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,810
for the first time like different

85
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,870
bottled nutrients and then there was the

86
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,849
super soil which was by TGA and there

87
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,140
was I'm not sure if that had come out

88
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,560
yet it was about to come out but the

89
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,789
revs true living organics and so I was

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,699
like wow look at all these different

91
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:46,049
options and so when I started

92
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,780
researching more I found out that there

93
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,400
was actual whole world where people were

94
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,610
concerned about our soil and how it's

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,739
gonna affect our society in the future

96
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,030
how it affects the nutrient density of

97
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,920
the food that we eat and the disease

98
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,599
that we can get and so it started

99
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,369
becoming you know more of just a

100
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,530
translation of that healthy lifestyle

101
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,230
and then I found out how easy it was to

102
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,870
grow organic how it suited me my ability

103
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:11,310
to take weekends off and do things where

104
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,200
I wasn't you know completely revolved

105
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,370
around my grow and then I also found out

106
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,099
that yields could be good and then

107
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,829
significantly different to my experience

108
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,330
with hydroponics was that I could get

109
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,589
the taste and the smell out of those

110
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,629
genetics the first time I grew up

111
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:25,339
instead of really trying to figure them

112
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:27,350
out if that meant

113
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:29,239
since and so for me it was just natural

114
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,189
to wanna grow organic and it seems like

115
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,560
most of our customers also want to grow

116
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:35,149
organic and then we can get into all the

117
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,740
benefits behind that but there's there's

118
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,929
too many to talk about depending on the

119
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,000
angle do you have any more specific

120
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,530
questions I guess about that well I mean

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,168
the first thing that comes to mind is

122
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:47,418
starting build a soil was that just kind

123
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:49,849
of a natural extension of that passion

124
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:52,519
or was it more of like you saw there was

125
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,189
a niche that needed filling it was a

126
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,620
little bit of both I'd been reading and

127
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:59,449
dabbling a little bit and internet

128
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,800
businesses I'd run a couple of

129
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:02,449
businesses on my own in the past that

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,910
were more brick-and-mortar and I was

131
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,490
disenchanted with the nine-to-five job

132
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,860
routine and where I was at in life I had

133
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,120
a breakup of a relationship I had some

134
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,400
things happen in my life where I was

135
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,199
kind of refocused on growing and then my

136
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,939
father passed away and so when that

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,399
happened I took a look at my life and I

138
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:20,990
was like well geez I'm gonna wake up in

139
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,489
30 years at the same job I might as well

140
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,509
you know pursue some of these dreams

141
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,509
what am I waiting for

142
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:28,610
and so build the soil happened because I

143
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:30,589
was having to source these ingredients

144
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,169
that I was reading about on IIC mag and

145
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:34,250
other organic grow forms and I was

146
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:35,449
having a source them from all over the

147
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,769
country and all over the world and it

148
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,750
was really hard to get him sometimes I

149
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:41,000
went without or waited awhile or I'd get

150
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,800
a low-grade product and so all the money

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,750
I spent finding out all this information

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,129
started to make an impact on some of my

153
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,288
local friends and they'd buy some of the

154
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:50,959
products and so that was kind of a way

155
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:52,728
for me to buy more for myself and then I

156
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,680
thought well I'm gonna try this I built

157
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:57,319
build a soil and I posted a couple

158
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,478
craigslist ads and I had some initial

159
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,439
interest and then from there we did do

160
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:02,288
any advertising we just did

161
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,759
word-of-mouth and it went like crazy so

162
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:07,219
I'd say it was a passion for organics

163
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,478
but more than that it was because like I

164
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,160
mentioned before I went to the hydro

165
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,668
store and there was no options that were

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,590
really organic it was just these kind of

167
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:17,299
predatory wannabe organic companies with

168
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,038
really high profit margins that were

169
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,900
selling you products that were very

170
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,478
similar to the current paradigm and it

171
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:25,579
fit their model of keeping you back in

172
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:27,109
the store all the time and so when I

173
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:29,538
started build a soil it was just a way

174
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,919
to share what everybody knew in the

175
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:33,158
organic forms but it took them years to

176
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,569
find out hoping to speed that process up

177
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:36,889
and also hoping to make some money which

178
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,800
is it's working out and I'm really happy

179
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,788
about that

180
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,470
yeah nice so I guess moving on to the

181
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:45,899
big question which I'm always trying to

182
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,280
answer to people why is bottled

183
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,948
nutrients or for this interview I'm

184
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,318
gonna call it synthetic why is synthetic

185
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,509
cannabis different to organic like what

186
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,098
are the fundamental factors which cuz

187
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,509
people always say organics better than

188
00:06:56,098 --> 00:07:01,878
synthetic well let's explain to people

189
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:04,800
what is it that makes the organic better

190
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,060
that's a good question it it crosses

191
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,189
over a lot of different lines worth or

192
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,139
whether we're talking about setting up

193
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:12,180
the grow and making it easy to do versus

194
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,740
check in pH and all that stuff it can

195
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,240
definitely have his advantages but I

196
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,579
think most of us that get really

197
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,930
passionate about this there's some a

198
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,478
certain genesis of gwah about the

199
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,569
finished product that has more romance

200
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:27,800
to it it has a depth of flavor and taste

201
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:33,090
and it's it's hard to explain because

202
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:35,879
for instance I kind of I kind of like to

203
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:38,218
think of it calling it early so if we

204
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,379
were going to compare it to food or to

205
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:42,209
cooking most of what people are

206
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,240
experiencing grown synthetically is akin

207
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:47,638
to buying a Campbell's soup well or

208
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,139
maybe like a wolfgang puck or something

209
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,579
a little higher end but it's still a

210
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:55,379
processed synthetic it can chelated

211
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,329
versions so to speak and so it's it's

212
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,459
ready to use it provides value to the

213
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:02,068
market it certainly works the same every

214
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,959
time but if you would ask a chef who

215
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,460
spent his life visiting farms tasting

216
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,649
ingredients from regions traveling the

217
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,269
world growing in seasons and putting

218
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:12,538
that in their flavor it's like it's not

219
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:14,639
enough and so ultimately in organics if

220
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,589
we can now grow some of our own inputs

221
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,778
make our own compost build our own soil

222
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:20,848
or have somebody that we trust to do

223
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:22,949
that for us we start to connect all of

224
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:25,639
the dots and then you get those flavors

225
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:27,689
and you get those nutrient profiles and

226
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,848
one of the things that's neat is just

227
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:32,370
like wine you find that there's a term

228
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:34,379
called terroir and it relates to the

229
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,929
region in which the wine was grown the

230
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,399
temperature the soil and even with

231
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,319
tobacco you know if you're gonna buy a

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,578
cigar the soil is absolutely the most

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,240
important part of that and that's why

234
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:46,919
people seek out Cuban cigars so taking

235
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,750
all that in perspective looking at soil

236
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,079
as a bigger picture it's like well geez

237
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,458
how is synthetics gonna add

238
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,649
because it's all it's trying to do is

239
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:56,239
duplicate soil and then from there it's

240
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,009
trying to take out any of the potential

241
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,129
problems when you're mono cropping on

242
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:03,259
scale indoors which could be bacterial

243
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:05,269
pathogens yada yada so it's kind of like

244
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:07,399
using hand sanitizer as opposed to just

245
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,980
getting in the dirt and being healthy so

246
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,839
all in all you organics just fits all of

247
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,480
those different similarities in my life

248
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,440
and makes a lot more sense to me so so

249
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,889
people often try to say essentially that

250
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,540
organics is harder than synthetics what

251
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,949
is your general thought on this idea do

252
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:26,838
you think there's any truth to that or

253
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:32,269
maybe people have got it a bit confused

254
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:34,160
I think it's a lot easier but it is that

255
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,570
is missed on a lot of people because if

256
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,828
you go to research organics you're gonna

257
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,589
get a variety of different information

258
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:40,939
that can seem confusing what's great is

259
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,110
a lot of these people that you find with

260
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,149
million different methods they're all

261
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,339
having success in organics and so I

262
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,480
think the difference is in perception if

263
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,890
I go to the gross store they're gonna

264
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,480
give me a neat little print out with a

265
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,360
couple lines on it to say add these

266
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,649
ingredients on this day at this time and

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,269
for a beginner that's really nice to

268
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,740
have a recipe it's just like opening up

269
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:59,689
a cookbook and measuring every single

270
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,370
item to put it in the bowl but once you

271
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,720
get a little better at this you don't

272
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,700
need the cookbook it's significantly

273
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,519
easier you know ratios you throw things

274
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,410
together and they work that can be very

275
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,208
scary for someone who's new to this who

276
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:13,458
has no mentor who has nobody to hold

277
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,469
their hand and so I think that it's just

278
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,699
kind of a misconception organics is so

279
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,240
much easier that it's hard to give a

280
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,259
precise recipe where that's very easy

281
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,899
and synthetic so you just tell people

282
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:25,309
exactly what to do the thing is is when

283
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:26,389
people get down the line in synthetics

284
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:27,799
and they're grown a lot of plants they

285
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:29,419
realize that it's not that simple most

286
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,370
of the manufacturers miss label you have

287
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:33,439
to cut the dosages in half you have to

288
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,120
make certain changes to make things work

289
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,230
and so I don't think organics any

290
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,959
different it's just to where you're

291
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,639
gonna invest your time and kind of like

292
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,229
switching from scheme to snowboarding or

293
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,970
surfing to bodyboarding it's just

294
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,620
different skills and so if you're an

295
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,209
advanced expert in one area it's gonna

296
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,490
make you feel kind of like a beginner to

297
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,989
try organics but I feel like the

298
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,230
learning curve is a lot easier and

299
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,120
certainly the ability to lose a crop in

300
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,769
hydro can happen overnight where in

301
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,519
organics I think even a beginner isn't

302
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:03,049
going to get to harvest so yeah so I

303
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,409
mean kind of touched on something he

304
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:07,318
said earlier

305
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:08,789
in relation to organic food its there's

306
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:10,259
a little debate you know everyone would

307
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:13,049
prefer organic food if they had the

308
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:15,300
choice so why is it that people go to

309
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,828
hydro over organic as say their first

310
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,628
choice you know like it would seem to me

311
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:20,068
like it would be the thing people would

312
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:22,350
first want to do but a lot of people

313
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:24,539
don't you know it often you hear people

314
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,689
saying oh I did hydro first and now I'm

315
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:28,828
organic yeah I don't know why that is I

316
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,419
think that it's a system of the

317
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:32,278
marketing machine that existed you know

318
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,528
you have a lot of the magazines that

319
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,958
target a core demographic of teenagers

320
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,490
to early 20s you go to the store that's

321
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,500
fueled by repetitive sales with high

322
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,149
margins that are on the same products

323
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,980
and so when you're not allowed to ask

324
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:45,870
for help ask anybody things are illegal

325
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,819
all you can listen to is the people that

326
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,860
are selling you the products not only

327
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:51,059
that but it's coupled by a few different

328
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,310
things when you look at the history of

329
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,078
cannabis you can read a few different

330
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,869
posts but DJ's short has a great one and

331
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,609
it's talking about how in the 90s there

332
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,198
is this perfect storm of hydroponic

333
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,360
nutrients and lights that were available

334
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:04,799
at stores and coupled by the fact that

335
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,629
people figured out how to grow hybrid

336
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,028
plants that grew shorter and had higher

337
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:10,259
yield and worked indoors and that was

338
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,509
all a consequence of the war on drugs

339
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:16,379
going indoors and forcing people to do

340
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:18,509
that at a larger scale so when you have

341
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:20,909
that happening you just have a lot of

342
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:24,839
things that are changed in that process

343
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:26,068
and are forced to have happen so I think

344
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,000
that's kind of a key difference there if

345
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:32,938
that makes sense yeah so here's kind of

346
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,149
a bit of a nuts and bolts question can

347
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:37,769
organic ever yield more or equal to

348
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:40,589
synthetic you know this is the major

349
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:42,419
argument presented by everybody in the

350
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,860
hydroponic industry do you think there's

351
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,568
any proof behind this or do you think

352
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,519
we've moved past those days where it's

353
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:51,299
just commonly accepted that hydro will

354
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,990
always out yield organic and sorry sorry

355
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:57,179
sorry as I follow-up if hydro does yield

356
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:00,180
organic do you think the cost reduction

357
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,679
because often hydroponic we don't go for

358
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,870
as much as organic do you think the cost

359
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,808
reduction in selling price is worth the

360
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:10,198
cost savings or any potential savings in

361
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:12,600
say you increase yes so it's so strange

362
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,308
cuz there's there's not enough data on a

363
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,740
real large scale we're talking five year

364
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:17,980
data by real companies there is when

365
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,360
we're talking farming so

366
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,649
we're looking at agriculture there's a

367
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,889
lot of data when we're looking at

368
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,240
horticulture specifically cannabis there

369
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:26,470
isn't as much data and I know a lot of

370
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,210
my friends can claim some pretty

371
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,000
significant yields using the hydroponic

372
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,610
techniques the thing is is we also want

373
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,289
to look at yields 24/7 365 including

374
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,539
problem gardens crops that are failures

375
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:38,889
we also want to look at energy usage we

376
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:41,110
want to look at the profit margin not

377
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:42,639
just the yield that's produced and so I

378
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,919
think that when we start to consider

379
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,000
that I'm finding my greenhouse customers

380
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,949
that are using the sunlight and

381
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,240
supplemental lighting are drastically

382
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,860
increasing their profit margin by

383
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,899
keeping the same soil around and

384
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,330
learning to soil test top dress and

385
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:57,129
amend and what we're all learning right

386
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,480
now even you know me I'm learning every

387
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:03,429
day about how to improve these soil

388
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,960
mixes so the it's crazy because some

389
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:06,549
people will get hydro that will actually

390
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,080
go for a higher dollar amount based on

391
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:10,809
the bag appeal just like how you can go

392
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,930
to a shop store and get a tomato that

393
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:15,219
looks perfect but tastes like nothing

394
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:17,649
hydroponics can make a beautiful product

395
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,420
no doubt about that it's it's the punch

396
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,850
behind that the power the lasting

397
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,349
effects the taste the flavor all those

398
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,000
secondary effects that organics

399
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,950
typically has from the nutrient density

400
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,269
now some of these hydroponic guys are

401
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,980
getting a little better by incorporating

402
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,720
organics into their synthetics and

403
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,080
starting to bring some of that back and

404
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,490
so when we're looking at indoor

405
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,920
duplicating a grow and having someone

406
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,580
who's never grown before hydroponics

407
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:43,719
hag's has a few legs up on systematizing

408
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,250
but once you get growers that are really

409
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,040
good at their craft and good at organics

410
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,389
we're finding a higher sellable profit

411
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:51,579
product like you're finding because it

412
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,230
smells better and looks better and then

413
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,759
we're finding that the profit margins

414
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,310
there and so one of the reports that I'd

415
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:02,049
encourage people to look at is going to

416
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:04,599
the 30 to 35 year I believe now Rodale

417
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,099
organic farms trial study and what

418
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,740
you'll find is that when they compare

419
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:12,060
synthetic verses or conventional versus

420
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,409
organic when they compare also no-till

421
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,729
conventional versus no-till organic

422
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:18,490
versus some of these other hybrid

423
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,399
methods organic just wins across the

424
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,629
board every single time you know when it

425
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,159
comes to bumper crop years where the

426
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,840
weather is great they both are

427
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,819
neck-and-neck when it comes to drought

428
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,759
years organic just crushes it when it

429
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,600
comes to bushels per acre organics is

430
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,480
winning when it comes

431
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,100
to the price per actual profit margin

432
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,839
there's less cost and inputs in the

433
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:43,149
organics and then actually already not

434
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:45,459
do like you said demand a higher price

435
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:47,500
at the market so they're widening the

436
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:49,958
profit margin both of the front and the

437
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,549
back and that's really appealing because

438
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,078
that's a 30-plus year study on an

439
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,419
agricultural level which is where we

440
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,620
should be heading as the laws change I

441
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:58,708
don't think we're gonna be forced to be

442
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,789
indoors at least we'll be in greenhouses

443
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,439
as things loosen up a little bit more

444
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:04,990
and we can get those profit margins

445
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,529
there and get more medicine produced if

446
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,600
that makes sense yeah so I mean maybe

447
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:12,370
this is a bit of a no-brainer but um in

448
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,230
the ideal world would everyone be

449
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,870
growing organic in your you know in your

450
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:21,579
ideal world yeah of course in my ideal

451
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,899
world but I think that I think that

452
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:24,669
there's always like for instance how do

453
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,929
you know how good it feels to be healthy

454
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:28,870
unless you've been sick there's always

455
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:32,289
this yin and yang and so if I just saw

456
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,120
that the mainstream majority understood

457
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:35,409
that organic wasn't witchcraft and there

458
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,328
wasn't you know something that will

459
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:38,588
never work I think I'd be really happy

460
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,388
with that and people can make their own

461
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:42,399
intelligent decisions but you know

462
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,318
certainly having 5000 percent markup on

463
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,698
little bottles with liquid in them I

464
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:47,469
think that that's gonna end pretty

465
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:49,719
quickly as consumers get more educated

466
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,180
so that will be phased out next is gonna

467
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,889
be you know looking at actual scale like

468
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,778
for instance the hip farms that we visit

469
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,610
out here it's different you know we're

470
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:59,470
not gonna recommend a 30% compost they

471
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,199
can't spend you know 400 truckloads

472
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:03,339
across an acre to do that and so we've

473
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:04,869
got to start to consider different

474
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:06,338
methods that are going to create new

475
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:08,558
opportunities for business and new

476
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:10,629
challenges for growers because right now

477
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,939
on scale that's the really big challenge

478
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,799
is how do we do organics on a farm that

479
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,509
has been synthetic for a long time and

480
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,338
do that conversion and successfully

481
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:19,959
train people to convert learn the new

482
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:22,000
skills spend the money that it takes to

483
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,798
ramp up and that's essentially what it's

484
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,240
like for most every single grow because

485
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:26,769
every grow grower that I work with

486
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,650
unless it's a brand new facility is

487
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:30,668
switching from hydro to organic when

488
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,110
they're brand new and they have our an

489
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,788
organic grower I see a higher success

490
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:35,408
rate it's a lot harder to change over

491
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:38,919
for you know keeping the same grow or

492
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:41,350
the same same mindset yeah so let's talk

493
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,800
about that process of rejuvenating soil

494
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:47,289
so if you have had soil that's been you

495
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,779
used for synthetic nutrients for an

496
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,579
extended period of time it's obviously

497
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:54,369
gonna have a large amount of salt

498
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:57,069
buildup and virtually no microbes in it

499
00:17:54,369 --> 00:18:00,039
what would be your you know kind of

500
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:01,779
first guess as to how to rejuvenate it

501
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,119
would you be looking at using you know

502
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:05,859
adding houmous through some means and

503
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,359
then trying to get some microbes back in

504
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:09,250
there or is it a much more complex

505
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,409
process because this kind of crosses

506
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,630
over into you know like how would people

507
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,519
you know reuse some of that cocoa to

508
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,690
make their new soil mix if they're going

509
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,920
organic yeah yeah there's a few

510
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,779
different ways and it really depends on

511
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,029
your time frame so in farming they call

512
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,410
it leaching instead of flushing and you

513
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:27,879
could certainly do a flushing if it's

514
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,290
just a small amount of cocoa medium and

515
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,640
get the salts out they sell products

516
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,279
that are gonna doing that and they sell

517
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,170
enzyme products that eat the salts on

518
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,119
the agricultural scale people have been

519
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,450
using the product by tear organics the

520
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:42,009
em1 it's a probiotic it's kind of one of

521
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,430
the originals that has purple non sulfur

522
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:47,500
bacteria lactobacillus and yeast and you

523
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,390
can make something that's a part of that

524
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,789
at home on your own and some of these

525
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,060
have been proven to remediate toxic

526
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:57,009
soils and help with salts so I would do

527
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,399
specific research based on my area what

528
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:02,529
type of salts I'm dealing with but but

529
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,810
definitely there what ways to do it

530
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:06,879
I really recommend when people are

531
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,409
considering doing that if they've got

532
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,270
just a small investment in some

533
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,160
synthetic medium may be using that out

534
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:15,009
outside in the garden or something and

535
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,470
starting from the from scratch to start

536
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,309
their organic process and it's not that

537
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,750
I think that it's a hundred percent

538
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:21,639
necessary but when you're trying to

539
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,900
troubleshoot later on I hate that

540
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,430
there's a variable there I'm wondering

541
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,660
is it really some leftover salts or

542
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,250
something that I messed up from trying

543
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,440
to recycle this soil that I probably

544
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,329
shouldn't have and so to make it just

545
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,710
really clear-cut keep your variables to

546
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:35,470
a minimum I think starting from the base

547
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,569
recipes is advisable otherwise flush it

548
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,460
with just water you could add some

549
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:42,339
sulfur it's how they do it on the

550
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,890
agricultural level and that leeches some

551
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:46,959
of the potential excess cations and we

552
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,610
can talk about that you could also use

553
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,930
some gypsum and that would replace any

554
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:54,750
of the ones that it's flushing out with

555
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:56,740
calcium so I guess it's a case-by-case

556
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,329
yeah okay

557
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,579
so kind of full

558
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:03,369
in that same vein what is the best way

559
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:05,470
to increase the general human content of

560
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,928
your soil because a lot of the times

561
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,759
when I see people and they tell me you

562
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,640
know this this soil is depleted there's

563
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,528
nothing you know often what rings in my

564
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,630
head is like no you've just got no human

565
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:19,390
content in that soil so do you think

566
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,580
that I guess this question it kind of

567
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,890
the underlying of is like no-till versus

568
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:25,538
general recycling should you be looking

569
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,149
to continually just topdressing your

570
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:29,589
soil with things like compost and you

571
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:31,418
know eventually the human content will

572
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:33,278
kind of leech back in or should you be

573
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,200
looking to full-on pull your soil our

574
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:37,089
composter with some rich human

575
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,240
ingredients for a few months and then

576
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:41,470
bring it back in so to speak you know I

577
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,569
don't think that we should ever be

578
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,399
recycling and dumping and reinventing

579
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:47,528
and all that at least from an idealist

580
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:49,839
perspective if we were to scale it up

581
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:51,609
it's got to be scalable and dumping

582
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,129
reinventing is certainly a lot of labour

583
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:56,648
when you start looking at acreage and

584
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,049
greenhouses and anything bigger than it

585
00:20:56,648 --> 00:21:01,859
you know your own closet now at home if

586
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:04,148
you I guess the reason why people do it

587
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:05,469
as far as starting from scratch each

588
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:07,778
time and throwing all of their stuff

589
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,519
away would be because it's a reset and I

590
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:11,648
can guarantee the starting point and so

591
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,259
then from there we started recycling and

592
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:16,888
it worked from there we can also do soil

593
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:19,419
testing recycling and that works but

594
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:20,859
when we started to learn or when I

595
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,288
started to learn more about how planets

596
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:25,148
and nature work the biomimicry portion

597
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:27,129
you start to look at all of the compost

598
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:29,168
that comes from the leaves and from all

599
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,850
the stuff on top it's never mixed in

600
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:34,120
unless it's brought down by animals and

601
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:36,308
so the no-till crowd uses worms and over

602
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:37,839
time you continually can lessen your

603
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:40,480
inputs because there's a nutrient

604
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,339
cycling that starts to happen but at the

605
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,919
beginning I would prefer to top dress it

606
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:46,990
and so I've got a story out back in my

607
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,120
at my property I have some really bad

608
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,940
soil it's very clay out here really high

609
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,959
and cal stress and alkaline and so it's

610
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,509
very simple you want to add a lot of

611
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,730
organic matter to start to get it to

612
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:59,200
work properly and so I was considering

613
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,538
tailing down and doing a ton of work and

614
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,649
I decided to get a very affordable

615
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:05,109
truckload of compost that wasn't even

616
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:06,399
finished yet more like woodchips brought

617
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:08,259
it in and dumped it down and I

618
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,120
raise the soil up about six inches using

619
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:11,650
that and then in the areas I wanted to

620
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,689
plant plants I just put a little potting

621
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,759
soil and dug out a couple gallon hole

622
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,350
and put the plant and that first year

623
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,849
everything was successful but the second

624
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:20,829
year it almost completely turned into

625
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:23,199
soil and built the soil up instead of

626
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:24,639
digging it down so I think I saved a lot

627
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,620
of money and saved a lot of effort doing

628
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,430
it that way living indoors when you're

629
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:31,389
growing or when you're growing in beds

630
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,009
adding the worms in the container can

631
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,900
certainly help so you don't have to add

632
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:37,509
so much that it adds to the volume of

633
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,360
your bed but all the biomass that we are

634
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:41,890
taking out should be added back in and

635
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,599
there should be a little extra and so

636
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,370
whether that's adding a cup of this a

637
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,879
cup of that as far as dry bed mints or

638
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:50,619
adding compost back I think those are

639
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,120
them I think those are the easiest way

640
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:55,209
to go meaning when you add it to the top

641
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:57,399
there's a lot less risk of it being out

642
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,079
of balance and in hurting the plant but

643
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,060
when you start to mix it in you better

644
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,859
be balanced and so that's why we make a

645
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,349
potting soil that tries to follow the

646
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:08,019
major cations in balance and we're now

647
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:09,909
working on all of the micronutrients but

648
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,829
from there after a cycle or two without

649
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,140
doing a soil test it seems to be a lot

650
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:16,329
easier just to top dress and keep it

651
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,930
just so it has a bigger savings account

652
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:22,899
than it needs and things go really well

653
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:25,630
yep so would your general philosophy on

654
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,759
how to get the most out of your soil be

655
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,250
that essentially you try to maximize the

656
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,490
cation exchange capacity or not

657
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:35,049
specifically yes you want to have a good

658
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,740
balance between cation exchange capacity

659
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,909
and the organic matter content and if

660
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,069
they go kind of in opposite directions

661
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,340
the more clay you get the the more

662
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:48,029
cation exchange you can have the more

663
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:50,949
actual you know exchange sites there are

664
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:52,450
and then when you go the opposite

665
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,039
direction and add a lot more organic

666
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,539
matter sometimes you lower that a little

667
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:57,730
bit and you complex a lot of the

668
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:00,159
nutrients it's a little bit harder to

669
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,809
read so to get the most out of the soil

670
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,940
we want a generous amount of organic

671
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:06,039
matter it's gonna hold moisture and it's

672
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,019
gonna have all of those complex organic

673
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,670
nutrients in it but we also want to have

674
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:11,109
the cation exchange and a decent level

675
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,440
and what I found recently is that our

676
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:15,849
lining agents can actually artificially

677
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,559
increase the cation exchange and what

678
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:19,480
that means is there's calcium that's

679
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,480
free floating around it has

680
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,210
been adsorbed into the cation exchange

681
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,769
sites yet and the soil tests falsely

682
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,640
read that as a higher cation exchange

683
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:32,710
and we just did a soil test recently in

684
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,990
fact I got it here in front of me and we

685
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,150
did a man look three soil tests through

686
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,460
Logan labs and it came in at thirty two

687
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,610
point five two cation exchange capacity

688
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,210
or the total exchange capacity and

689
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,709
that's pretty good

690
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,900
we'd like to see something you know the

691
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,980
20s or 30s that's really high certainly

692
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,290
we don't want to be able below ten

693
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:54,130
that's more like a field soil when we

694
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:56,649
did the ammonium acetate point two

695
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,210
alkaline type test on it dissolved out a

696
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,400
lot of that excess calcium and showed us

697
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,860
where our exchange capacity was actually

698
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,300
an eighteen point seven one that makes

699
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:06,129
sense because our organic matter is at

700
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:08,440
forty three percent on this recipe which

701
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,360
is really high and so to get that

702
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,830
exchange capacity higher you could have

703
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:14,679
a little less organic matter maybe add

704
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:16,839
some more clays and things like that but

705
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,860
in any case here's what happens if you

706
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:19,299
have a really low exchange capacity

707
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:21,039
you're gonna have to supplement your

708
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:23,769
full season plant with a lot of input

709
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,970
nutrients and so if your soil is not

710
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:26,589
quite as balanced that might actually

711
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,970
benefit you because you'll exhaust

712
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,819
through things faster and you can

713
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,289
control it by using teas I don't like to

714
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,970
use a ton of teas and so I want to have

715
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:35,529
a lot higher exchange capacity and

716
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,880
really properly balance these nutrients

717
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:39,670
that way you have to basically just add

718
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,620
water and so to get the most out of your

719
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,269
soil the higher CEC will hold more

720
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:45,279
nutrients but I think that at that point

721
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:48,129
the balance of those nutrients is gonna

722
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,139
be a little more important yeah so that

723
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,050
question for me it kind of relates to

724
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,300
like super soil versus coots mix you

725
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:56,859
know like on the one hand when I look at

726
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:59,440
the super sore yeah it's like that that

727
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:01,359
organic heavy and the the exchange

728
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,460
capacity is not as good whereas kootz is

729
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,529
the opposite you know I using what is

730
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,420
there more efficiently do you think that

731
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,609
that shall be our general approach to

732
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,250
all organic so let's use less amendments

733
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,750
and get more out of them yeah I think so

734
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,039
especially when it comes to economies of

735
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,990
scale we're gonna have to learn how to

736
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,789
work with the microorganisms that are

737
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:20,500
able to break these down for instance

738
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:22,720
phosphorus is very immobilize been a

739
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,769
problems for farmer and consequently

740
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,350
always been a problem for groundwater

741
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:28,180
too and it's gonna bind and lock up and

742
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:30,799
it's not going to be available where in

743
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,779
organics nature finds a way even

744
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,279
you know ph's that should be available

745
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,930
they're able to exchange differently

746
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:41,480
pick up nutrients in different fashions

747
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:43,940
and so when I look at a super soil a lot

748
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,250
of times there's the margin for error

749
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,259
was where you'd hit a hot pocket not be

750
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,329
able to undo it so my opinion is that

751
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:52,879
starting with a really good balance you

752
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:54,829
can always add more to it in the areas

753
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,840
in which your environment or genetics or

754
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:58,490
whatever might require that but if you

755
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:00,589
start off just tripling and doubling all

756
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,930
the nutrients to try and power it and

757
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:04,309
just really push them hard you could end

758
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,320
up finding cultivars that don't like

759
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,419
that or imbalance within the input

760
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,519
recipes that made that batch each time

761
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,670
and then from there it's very hard to

762
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:16,220
recycle a really hot soil like that even

763
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,390
if you did nail at the first round very

764
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,390
hard to get it right the second round

765
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,400
without throwing a win starting over so

766
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,470
having a balanced soil with a known

767
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,740
recipe that people can duplicate allows

768
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,480
us to create this and then if we have to

769
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,799
like I said add to it by topdressing

770
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,450
and to me that just seems like there's

771
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,309
more power and man there's more control

772
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,750
in that and if we're trying to get more

773
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:39,079
people to grow organically they're gonna

774
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:42,079
have more success doing it that way yeah

775
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:44,299
so if people were growing with super

776
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,980
soil and they're of the opinion that

777
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:47,419
they've now depleted it do you think

778
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,829
it's the case that there probably is

779
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,570
still a fair amount of nutrients in

780
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:52,669
there and you say they amended it with

781
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:55,700
maybe some peat or some cocoa that might

782
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:58,160
kind of change the exchange capacity a

783
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,420
bit to uh you know you know to make some

784
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,220
of those nutrients more available or do

785
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,320
you think no yes you probably just start

786
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,450
over okay totally work I've seen people

787
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,710
take it and one of the benefits is a lot

788
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,600
of these guys are flushing really hard

789
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,190
and it does strip out a lot of their

790
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:12,109
nutrients and so it's not as bad as you

791
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,240
think in fact we're worried about sodium

792
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:17,029
excess but when I test soils that are

793
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,130
you know super soils and have been

794
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,559
flushed at the end because that's their

795
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,400
protocol I'm not seeing sodium build-up

796
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:24,740
because they're not using liquid

797
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,269
nutrients and so that's fine what I

798
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,009
typically see is that their phosphorous

799
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:29,660
and potassium is still just in excess

800
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,160
more so than they think

801
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,690
and then the calcium and magnesium is

802
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,360
not quite supporting which should be you

803
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,039
know the more major cations and so it's

804
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,389
hard to tell exactly what's going on

805
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,740
when they plant back into it and then

806
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,710
they're adding more of the wrong things

807
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,089
so I wouldn't know if we took super soil

808
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,450
did a soil test we can look at it

809
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,639
balanced

810
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,170
pretty easily if I was just gonna shoot

811
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,900
from the hip I would say cut it in half

812
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,160
with some peat and some compost and

813
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,960
aeration to make sure that the textures

814
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,009
right plant into it then you could top

815
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,440
dress from there and have that you'd

816
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:59,000
work perfectly it'll have it'll have

817
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,740
excess P&amp;K and probably a little low

818
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,099
calcium and nitrogen and so when you cut

819
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,660
it in half it'll cut that PK where it

820
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:08,419
needs to be and then the top dressing is

821
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,800
where you'll fix the rest so if you're a

822
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,230
good grower you could certainly cut it

823
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,119
and then judge on the plant if this is

824
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,009
your first time you had a good luck with

825
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,959
super soil and you're hoping to use it

826
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:19,279
you might want to send off for a soil

827
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,950
sample and see where you're at if that's

828
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,500
easy where I live it's 25 bucks and you

829
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,569
get a really good report there's also I

830
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,190
can go down to the local college

831
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:30,619
Extension Office and actually get a free

832
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:32,690
soil test so if you have those resources

833
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:34,449
I totally use them where you're at

834
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,009
another great person to talk to would be

835
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:40,220
Steve Solomon not sure if he's available

836
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:44,569
for consulting but I know that his book

837
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,190
the ideal soil I'm sorry that's funny I

838
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:48,439
mix the two up I'm also thinking of

839
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,880
Michael a sterile I deal soil and then

840
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,710
Steve Solomon is the intelligent

841
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,470
gardener those two really talk about

842
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,850
soil mineral balancing and so that would

843
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,210
be worth looking into maybe grabbing a

844
00:29:55,849 --> 00:30:00,949
copy of those yeah for sure so I'm just

845
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,900
gonna say I have to admit I actually use

846
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,759
blood and bone in my soil mixtures and

847
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,290
it's only been recently that I've been

848
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,390
reading more and more about how the the

849
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:10,849
salt levels can start to really build up

850
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,790
how detrimental do you think it is to

851
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:15,740
use blood and bone and the salt that's

852
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:17,480
in a verse say another amendment that

853
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,309
would say replace blood and bone do you

854
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,950
think it's because I see that more and

855
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:23,809
more people were kind of urging us to

856
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,610
move away from it and I'm all fine with

857
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:27,319
that but I was just wondering is it

858
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:29,839
actually that detrimental or is it more

859
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:31,539
of like people don't agree with the

860
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,789
methods in which button Boehner's

861
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:36,289
presumable sorting methods I think it's

862
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,909
I don't think it's that bad as far as

863
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:39,440
the actual salt you could certainly get

864
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,269
some back to they're a little saltier

865
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,920
but I mean we're talking fish bone meal

866
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:45,049
and kelp we get sodium with those as

867
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,490
well and if we make a proper soil a lot

868
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:48,589
of times we could use a little sodium

869
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,569
and I don't think that's really going to

870
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:54,319
be detrimental I have seen soils where

871
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:55,609
that's hot where I focus on this is like

872
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,659
in the kitchen if I'm going to use an

873
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:57,529
ingredient I'd like it to be a

874
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,940
multitasker

875
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:01,009
like I don't need to get a watermelon

876
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,570
cutting knife I've got a great knife

877
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:04,160
that'll cut anything and so if I'm gonna

878
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,649
buy a soil amendment I'd like it to be

879
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,269
just like in nature very well balanced

880
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:12,980
so seed meals and kelp has every mineral

881
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:14,990
you know things that have a good NPK

882
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,259
where you look at but then a blood meal

883
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,579
it's just basically in and then use take

884
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:22,339
a step further from that and you realize

885
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:23,869
that it's basically corn or feeding the

886
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,389
cattle corn in which we shouldn't be

887
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:28,519
they're features of eating grass

888
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,990
Monsanto GMO roundup sprayed crops going

889
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,210
through the process it's one of the

890
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,950
worst industries there is I know there's

891
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,059
only a few meat packers out there and so

892
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,039
we're getting all the blood from those

893
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,589
sources and minutes stamped organic

894
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,240
which most people I think if you asked

895
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:43,159
them and they bought organic blood meal

896
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,039
they would expect that to come from an

897
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,860
organic cow and that's just not the case

898
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:51,470
and so in an effort to not support that

899
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:54,589
I've not sold any of those products and

900
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,240
will will continue to not offer them and

901
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:58,789
then from the perspective of let's say

902
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,980
they were actually good it was your cow

903
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:02,899
I had a great diet and you got the blood

904
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,339
from it I'd be all for using it and I

905
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,740
don't really see a downside so I think

906
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:09,740
it's more about the methods and then

907
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,470
from there it is a little one-sided it's

908
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,819
just the end or it is just the P and so

909
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,289
that is good sometimes when you're

910
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:17,029
reading a soil test and you only need

911
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:18,200
one ingredient sometimes the challenge

912
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:19,579
with organics there's a lot of your

913
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,039
ingredients comes with multiple

914
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:23,750
variables and so when you read a soil

915
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:25,399
test you have to see how each variable

916
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,559
has changed like for instance if I need

917
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,000
calcium but my sulphur is too high I

918
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,369
can't use gypsum because that brings a

919
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,509
lot of sulfur so there is a place for

920
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:37,250
these unit asking ingredients but once

921
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:40,629
you get there it becomes about the

922
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:43,819
source and who is supporting etc etc so

923
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:45,860
yeah so when we deal with this I call it

924
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:47,629
the minefield of organics because you've

925
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:50,179
got all these products which may be a

926
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,220
labeled organic but under the hood maybe

927
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,410
aren't so I think the best example is a

928
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,940
lot of the bottled nutrients which are

929
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:59,240
stamped with organic yet I have to

930
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,890
explain they're not how do you you know

931
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,839
how do you straddle this kind of

932
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:05,420
dichotomy of where the chemistry

933
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:06,949
nomenclature already exists saying that

934
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,500
anything with a carbon backbone is

935
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,970
organic and therefore some people will

936
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,509
claim that certain synthetics are

937
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,640
organic

938
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:15,559
on that viewpoint well in the gardening

939
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,420
we'll you know the time organic Ole Miss

940
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:22,069
has a completely different meaning you

941
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:23,600
know I had how do you deal with this you

942
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:25,730
have to deal with it by getting educated

943
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,949
and setting some core values for

944
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:30,349
yourself and keeping that as your focus

945
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,819
point and what I mean by that is even in

946
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:33,500
the organic world some people would say

947
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:37,819
that gypsum is not organic because it's

948
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,529
not a carbonate it is calcium and sulfur

949
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:41,149
it's a mined mineral but that to me if

950
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:42,859
it's dug out of the ground that's great

951
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,019
I like it it's natural is that it's out

952
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:47,539
there it helps grow plants and so

953
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:49,849
there's always this duality that exists

954
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:53,299
on both sides of the fence where a very

955
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:54,139
intelligent hydroponic growers can

956
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:56,299
explain that

957
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,210
organic nutrients are broken down to

958
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:01,190
these chemistry nutrients at the end of

959
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,500
the process anyway so why not just cut

960
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:05,390
the chase and so to me it always ends up

961
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,740
coming around where I think that if you

962
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,079
don't use it you lose it and we're

963
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,610
certainly losing our soil and we haven't

964
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,190
been using it it's like if you were to

965
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,389
take a person put them in an IV diet

966
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,398
that was supposedly the perfect

967
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,079
nutrition I guarantee you they'd lose

968
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,730
their teeth their stomach all the stuff

969
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,090
that was not processing the nutrients

970
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:25,128
and it would be very strange but equally

971
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,750
hard to get that perfect diet when

972
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:28,069
you're just feeding them food but I

973
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,690
think we'd all agree growing your own

974
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,980
food and eating holistically would

975
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,190
probably be the best way to live a long

976
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:37,369
life so it's just it's strange these

977
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,648
organic minefield like you say you have

978
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:41,359
to get educated start asking questions

979
00:34:39,648 --> 00:34:42,619
just like when you go to the store and

980
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,210
you start instead of looking for

981
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:47,269
calories and fat you start to look as

982
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,740
this real food or is it fake food and so

983
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:50,570
in the organic industry you just got to

984
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:52,219
do the same thing and I think when you

985
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,419
apply that logic it becomes easy you

986
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:55,069
know you're like huh where's blood meal

987
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:57,739
come from I wonder if it's organic cows

988
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,269
you google it you find out it's not with

989
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,949
guano it's a little more interesting you

990
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:04,730
have a lot of organic grower still using

991
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:06,980
guano and I can't really hold them

992
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:09,320
accountable to some you know perfect

993
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,090
ideal because my reasons are different I

994
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,230
don't want my crew to breathe it in and

995
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,300
I think it's expensive for what it

996
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,219
brings to the table and historically

997
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,990
organically when Kawano was the only

998
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:20,719
nutrient we over mined it and it did

999
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:23,179
cause a lot of problems so there's gonna

1000
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,259
be a different reason for a lot of these

1001
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:27,739
organic

1002
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,210
and I don't want people to kind of lose

1003
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,879
sleep over it you just have to kind of

1004
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,980
pick your area of comfort and go for

1005
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,519
that meaning I know a lot of people that

1006
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,108
compost non-organic produce and some

1007
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,389
people would just think that's insane

1008
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:43,579
but I trust composting and I know how

1009
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:45,980
it's able to rip molecules down to their

1010
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:47,239
basicness you know building blocks so

1011
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,639
each person is gonna have a different

1012
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:51,529
answer for this yeah of course

1013
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,868
and finally enough you kind of hit one

1014
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:56,510
of my lighter questions on the head I am

1015
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:59,390
I use a lot of gypsum in my soil mix and

1016
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:01,460
cut out a chunk of oyster shell flour

1017
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:03,019
and I get it some people give me a bit

1018
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,150
of flack for that and I try to explain

1019
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:07,130
to them that like even though the gypsum

1020
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:09,349
isn't organic as you mentioned they

1021
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,180
bring up it's not organic and you know

1022
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,099
yeah yada yada I guess in the end what

1023
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:14,690
I'm saying is do you think that it's

1024
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:17,059
really do you think it's really

1025
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,980
worthwhile for people to go and look

1026
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:20,570
into those elements a bit higher so that

1027
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,369
they can as you said you know make that

1028
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,109
distinction between well you sure do

1029
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:26,180
person's not organic but I can use it

1030
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:28,099
and you know sure epsom salts are not

1031
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:29,868
organic but foliar feeding with it isn't

1032
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:32,868
gonna you know I kill my plants

1033
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:34,130
overnight I think it's important for us

1034
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:37,820
to all go through these things on our

1035
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,559
own and a lot of times in organic

1036
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,019
gardening it's important to learn these

1037
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,400
lessons one by one and going through

1038
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:45,250
that in our garden and answering them

1039
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,269
for ourselves because that's

1040
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,440
unfortunately one of the only ways to do

1041
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,880
this but what's great is if you have a

1042
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,769
vegetable garden in a cannabis garden

1043
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,070
you can try a lot of different different

1044
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:56,239
experience experiments but like you said

1045
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,750
with gypsum I just don't have any

1046
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,309
problem with that

1047
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,760
some people will and there's no way you

1048
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:02,929
can convince them otherwise but to me I

1049
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,280
mean there's a town in from Colorado

1050
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,589
called gypsum it's laying out there in

1051
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,840
the ground and so okay that's just okay

1052
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,130
to me but here's the thing let's say we

1053
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,380
scale up big-time

1054
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,119
how much gypsum is there so one of the

1055
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,039
things people think about or they

1056
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,240
purchase is perlite what a lot of people

1057
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:18,769
don't know is that perlite is an

1058
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,149
obsidian rock and there's not an endless

1059
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,670
supply of it and it takes a ton of

1060
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,800
energy to transform it from this black

1061
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,510
rock into a like a puffed up piece of

1062
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,609
popcorn that turns white and is really

1063
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:31,420
fluffy and is it is great material for

1064
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:34,429
gardening that's why we don't use it but

1065
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,320
when you start to look into organics and

1066
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:37,338
you get to deeper levels it not only

1067
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,920
becomes is it or

1068
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:43,099
will it work but how sustainable is that

1069
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,318
like cocoa core the argument is is more

1070
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:48,559
sustainable than peat moss but the

1071
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:50,088
pima's society would argue that we've

1072
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,069
only used a very small percentage and

1073
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:54,380
they're replanting in yada yada yada

1074
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:55,728
whereas people against coconut will say

1075
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,200
well they're planting plantations of

1076
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:58,879
coconut trees they're using synthetic

1077
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,858
nutrients so now you have to find out is

1078
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,210
it organic or is it synthetic is it near

1079
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:03,920
the ocean where it's salty are they

1080
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,079
shipping it over on an oil tanker

1081
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,028
it just becomes insane and so the only

1082
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,219
answer if you're a purist is to get back

1083
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:11,748
to permaculture close of the loop and

1084
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:13,460
have it all coming from your property

1085
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:17,238
but to ramp up you still have to bring

1086
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:19,670
in outside sources cover crop organic

1087
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:21,259
material animals and then from there you

1088
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,059
can start to close that loop so you have

1089
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:24,710
to ask yourself do I want to make all my

1090
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:27,440
own inputs close my loop have my own

1091
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,028
animals make my own compost or am i okay

1092
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,829
digging in the ground on someone else's

1093
00:38:29,028 --> 00:38:33,228
property to get a few of my resources

1094
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:34,999
and I think that if it came down to

1095
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:37,159
actually producing food for us to eat or

1096
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:38,268
you'd all be okay using some gypsum when

1097
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,858
it comes down to three plants in a

1098
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:43,209
closet we can afford to have some really

1099
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:45,548
high ideals and I'm ok with that but

1100
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,659
applying those to everybody isn't I

1101
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:49,159
found in the beginning when you're first

1102
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,629
learning you want to hold everybody you

1103
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:52,728
know kind of there's this organic

1104
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,160
elitist thought and people kind of get

1105
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:56,868
in this trap where they I have to

1106
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,338
justify their process by kind of being

1107
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:59,690
condescending and I think once you start

1108
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,940
to learn a lot more about it there's

1109
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:03,619
that goes away and you just kind of

1110
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,318
focus on your own garden and teaching

1111
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:08,869
those that are willing to learn yeah so

1112
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:12,949
I mean just touching on that point about

1113
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:14,630
the cocoa in Australia for example cocoa

1114
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:16,818
is readily abundant because you know

1115
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,950
we're close to lots of small islands

1116
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:21,528
that produce a lot of coconuts however

1117
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:23,989
however peat moss is very very expensive

1118
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:26,420
it's it's you know five six times the

1119
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,190
price it's no sense to use peat moss

1120
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,568
where that right yeah that was going to

1121
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,670
be the question whose are they are they

1122
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:36,768
pretty interchangeable they're not

1123
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:39,650
really I want to say yes but I think

1124
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:42,139
that they're not 100% interchangeable in

1125
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,088
the idea that if both of those were

1126
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:46,308
available to you at the same price and

1127
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:48,768
they had no environmental impact and

1128
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:50,840
they were just perfect to use we'd still

1129
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:52,659
be able to divide that line up

1130
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,100
a little bit and some peat moss

1131
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:57,079
typically when we get it fresh from the

1132
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,489
bog is gonna have fulvic and humic acids

1133
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,170
it's going to have some indigenous

1134
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:03,199
bacteria it's not gonna have to be

1135
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:07,039
washed and rinsed and sat out for a

1136
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:09,259
couple of years and it's going to be a

1137
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,889
higher cation exchange capacity it'll

1138
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,690
hold more nutrients I mean there's a

1139
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:17,900
reason why Pete Moss is so widely used

1140
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:20,269
and why garden like greenhouses that

1141
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,800
have you know millions on the line still

1142
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:23,719
use it even in the presence of coconut

1143
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,750
coir being viable and rice hulls being

1144
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,219
viable and all these other options so I

1145
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:30,769
think that peat moss has a little bit of

1146
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:31,879
a leg up but if I was forced to I

1147
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:34,190
certainly think I could grow with

1148
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,990
coconut coir in our soil recipe and if I

1149
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:38,929
was forced to going out both I think I

1150
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:40,729
could by making a compost that was not

1151
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:43,009
quite as nutrient dense and cutting that

1152
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,170
with maybe 50% aeration and then from

1153
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:47,030
there adding my starting materials you

1154
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:48,740
could use aged manure that was fairly

1155
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,050
devoid of nutrients that's been rinsed

1156
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:53,539
out rained on and that would be kind of

1157
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,430
like peat moss so ultimately if I didn't

1158
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:56,869
have a mic I could do it and for you

1159
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:59,359
being out there I probably would avoid

1160
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:01,159
even starting to learn about peat moss

1161
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,660
as my soil recipe because it sounds like

1162
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,699
it's cost prohibitive and it's

1163
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:07,549
definitely gonna have a big

1164
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,419
environmental impact so yeah that was

1165
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,700
actually the other thing I was gonna

1166
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,230
bring up is that um yeah we don't

1167
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:13,549
produce a lot of thing here so that was

1168
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:16,340
one of the reasons I had heard while I

1169
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:18,200
was so expensive there I'd be doing it

1170
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,210
in a side-by-side just to satisfy my

1171
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:22,879
curiosity and I'd import some peat moss

1172
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,829
and I would attempt to get my local

1173
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,320
recipe to match and miR that and then

1174
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:29,750
exceed that because my natural curiosity

1175
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,370
even if I made the best recipe ever I

1176
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:33,619
would probably say dang but I wonder

1177
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:35,329
what if and so if you could get over

1178
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:37,069
that I think that you'll be fine but if

1179
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:38,750
you really have to try it do it other

1180
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,880
than that I would say locally just you

1181
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,230
know try and work with it now if you

1182
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,849
start reading a coconut core you'll find

1183
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,010
a little bit of difference one of the

1184
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:47,989
things I found we sent a recipe off that

1185
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,660
was half peat moss half coconut coir as

1186
00:41:47,989 --> 00:41:53,389
the portion of the base we used that for

1187
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:55,460
and the soil test came back very similar

1188
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:56,989
a little lower CEC a little bit

1189
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,840
different a couple numbers but it was

1190
00:41:56,989 --> 00:42:02,029
almost a interchangeable so I would say

1191
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,200
with confidence that as long as you can

1192
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,940
balance the calcium and

1193
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:07,289
potassium and all that stuff and have a

1194
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,789
little bit of thought to the salt that

1195
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:10,380
might be in that coconut core and really

1196
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:12,779
wash it I don't think you'll have any

1197
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,298
issues fantastic

1198
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,040
so to someone who's currently running

1199
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:20,548
synthetics and wants to switch over to a

1200
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:22,259
Yank what would you suggest is the best

1201
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:24,568
way to convert so maybe not necessarily

1202
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,369
talking about like soil mix is quite yet

1203
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:28,409
but if they wanted to convert would you

1204
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:30,240
say look you know just just go all out

1205
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:31,588
just you know switch all hydro all

1206
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,598
organic all you say no let's just do

1207
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:35,429
like maybe a few buckets organic and get

1208
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,109
the hang of it and then slowly switch

1209
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:39,019
over or how would you recommend they

1210
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:42,449
they switch from one to the other

1211
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:44,608
there's a tough question from it a

1212
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:46,409
large-scale agricultural perspective and

1213
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:48,869
from business perspective it's always

1214
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:52,318
advisable to just do a small test and

1215
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:53,338
then go from there but I'm always at the

1216
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:54,900
thought that when used to stand on the

1217
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:56,219
fence and you're in the middle you get

1218
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,349
shot from both sides and it's really

1219
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:00,568
advisable sometimes to burn your brayer

1220
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:02,010
put all your efforts double down and

1221
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:04,170
know that's what you're going to do no

1222
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,400
matter what a lot of people that are

1223
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,200
going to organics that's their mentality

1224
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,818
they're not going to retreat they're not

1225
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,199
gonna do hydro that's not their mindset

1226
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:13,048
that's all they want to do but for

1227
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:14,279
people who really don't have a emotional

1228
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,449
investment in this you just say hey

1229
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,170
whatever better I don't care if it's

1230
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:18,838
hydro

1231
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:20,639
it's synthetic and as chemicals or if

1232
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:23,429
it's organic I just want to grow what

1233
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,608
fits my lifestyle and works for me I

1234
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:29,730
think that the easiest setup for someone

1235
00:43:26,608 --> 00:43:31,199
like that is going to be looking at what

1236
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,608
they're comparing it to and I know a lot

1237
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,838
of the hydro guys can get just crazy

1238
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:35,730
with the number of nutrients they get

1239
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,949
into so then their personality's gonna

1240
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,059
come into play some guys find organics

1241
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,598
so easy a dredge and crazy they're

1242
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:44,040
always looking for extra things to do

1243
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,000
yeah I guess circling back around to

1244
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:47,579
your question about what's the easiest

1245
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,900
way to start we have two methods that we

1246
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:52,140
share it build a soil and one of them

1247
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,760
for a beginner if they have an earth box

1248
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:56,219
which is basically a sub irrigated

1249
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,809
planter it's a plastic growing container

1250
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:59,818
that has the water that's held

1251
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:02,490
underneath the soil and it's held up by

1252
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:03,869
a tray and above that's just soil the

1253
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:05,189
plant grows in it like normal but once

1254
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:06,900
it hits the bottom instead of just

1255
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,420
hitting the fabric pot it digs into a

1256
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,150
reservoir of waat of water and this

1257
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,730
eliminates the watering factor which a

1258
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,320
lot of times somebody moving over to

1259
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,610
organics is going to underwater

1260
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,130
over water and that's gonna be their

1261
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:23,250
steepest learning curve and so that's a

1262
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,539
great way to mitigate that now prior to

1263
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,309
me using earth boxes I would have said

1264
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:30,179
earth boxes are stupid and I never use

1265
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:32,880
it I only used the fabric grow pots or

1266
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:35,159
plastic grill pots and the fabric or my

1267
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,430
favorite and as long as you use a little

1268
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:39,509
bit of mulch on top and you start to

1269
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:40,919
sometimes people like in a 15-gallon

1270
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,630
will put a tray underneath and you can

1271
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,099
water from the top and also pour a

1272
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,650
little water in the tray to help it wick

1273
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:48,929
up and water from the bottom there's a

1274
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,940
few ways you can take that with a pretty

1275
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:52,259
easy learning curve we have a moisture

1276
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,599
meter that'll allow you to probe into

1277
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,400
the soil and find out if it's dry or wet

1278
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,949
and that'll help a first-time grower to

1279
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,150
determine if they're over under watering

1280
00:44:57,949 --> 00:45:01,859
but certainly what we hear about all the

1281
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,960
time when they're going to a big bed of

1282
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,090
soil to make it easier to get a large

1283
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,470
yield we find the first thing to have a

1284
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,710
problem with is how much water to add

1285
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:13,529
and the rule of thumb on large scale has

1286
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,480
always been what I've always heard from

1287
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,370
people is said hey if you have a hundred

1288
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,929
gallon pot you're gonna add 10 gallons

1289
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:20,549
it's a 10 percent rule if you have a 10

1290
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:22,109
gallon pot you'll water a gallon every

1291
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:23,700
time but that doesn't always translate

1292
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:26,940
in organics because it's gonna be

1293
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:30,509
dependent upon your humidity you know

1294
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:33,000
and a lot of other factors so I guess

1295
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,890
the easiest way is either a fabric grow

1296
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,050
container or that earth box and then my

1297
00:45:34,889 --> 00:45:38,940
favorite is a large large grow bed but

1298
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,410
most people that are willing to just try

1299
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,940
out organics don't want to put a couple

1300
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:43,859
hundred gallons of soil in their bedroom

1301
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,639
and not have the ability to move it

1302
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:49,440
around on a whim so yeah so funnily

1303
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:51,359
enough I got a friend who was in a

1304
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,780
similar situation so he's just switched

1305
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:57,000
over to organics and now he's in I

1306
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:59,519
suspect he's over watered a bit and he's

1307
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,869
now got a lot of bugs as a result what

1308
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,250
would be your recommendations for

1309
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:03,239
someone who's just switched over I've

1310
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,219
actually got a few friends in this

1311
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:07,439
position and they've just which do

1312
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:09,899
organic and because they've been using

1313
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,820
some of those hydroponic principles you

1314
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,070
know like obviously Coco absorbs a lot

1315
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,950
more water than soil so people naturally

1316
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:19,800
overwater I find what would be your

1317
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:21,029
advice to them in terms of getting rid

1318
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,740
of the bugs because I've got a lot of

1319
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,360
friends who are kind of acquits and

1320
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:26,250
trying to deal with these bugs and they

1321
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:29,108
that's kind of the biggest downside they

1322
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,519
find coming from synthetics

1323
00:46:29,108 --> 00:46:34,068
interesting to me because when you get

1324
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,869
bugs in synthetics it's game over in

1325
00:46:34,068 --> 00:46:37,279
organics you know there's a lot that can

1326
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:39,050
happen before it really takes your crop

1327
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,269
down and so it's depending on how you

1328
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:44,089
look at it of course somebody that's

1329
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:45,769
used to visioning a white lab coat in a

1330
00:46:44,088 --> 00:46:48,078
sterile room is gonna have a hard time

1331
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:49,940
looking at soil that has bugs moving

1332
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,589
around minute but most of the bugs we

1333
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,869
find in the soil are beneficial and if

1334
00:46:51,588 --> 00:46:56,289
they're a fast-moving mite usually it's

1335
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:59,450
a soil mite and they're assisting in

1336
00:46:56,289 --> 00:47:01,130
that whole ecosystem and so a lot of

1337
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:02,689
times it's just a false thought hey is

1338
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,190
the plant growing great yes it is don't

1339
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:07,730
worry about it of course if you got

1340
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:09,858
fungus gnats if you've got actual spider

1341
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,599
mites or Russert mites or you know all

1342
00:47:09,858 --> 00:47:13,159
these problems we hear about those are

1343
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,220
specific problems that you're gonna need

1344
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:19,399
to address fungus gnat seems to come up

1345
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:20,659
as the really common pest that doesn't

1346
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,280
seem to do a lot of damage but it's

1347
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:24,429
really annoying what would be your

1348
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,920
recommendation for getting rid of it

1349
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:30,289
it's really coming up as a problem with

1350
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,510
a lot of our customers as well it can

1351
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:34,309
become a problem in hydroponics and it

1352
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:36,170
can really be detrimental because they

1353
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,328
eat the organic matter so if you're

1354
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,309
growing in rock wool on slabs and you

1355
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:42,530
get fungus gnats they can decimate your

1356
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:44,420
grill in organics it's more of an

1357
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,160
annoyance and it can be very very

1358
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,750
annoying and of course it can get into

1359
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,489
your flowers and stick there and it

1360
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,960
could you know hit you in the face when

1361
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:54,588
you open the tent or go to look in your

1362
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,119
grow and so a few things we can do one

1363
00:47:54,588 --> 00:47:57,409
of the least expensive portions of our

1364
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:58,880
grows the mulch layer and a lot of guys

1365
00:47:57,409 --> 00:48:00,559
are having a really thick mulch layer

1366
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,500
with a lot of decaying organic matter

1367
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:07,039
that fungus gnats love and so until this

1368
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,750
soil in a no-till system ramps up to a

1369
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,550
full ecosystem where there are Rove

1370
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,780
beetles and there are predator mites and

1371
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,150
there's all these things happening that

1372
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:17,420
balance that you'll notice things come

1373
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,769
in in booms and so a huge fungus in that

1374
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,079
population you could just leave it on

1375
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:22,789
its own and probably in the next six

1376
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,079
months to a year maybe a few months it's

1377
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:25,550
gonna go away something else is gonna

1378
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,079
come in and eat it and of all balance

1379
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,660
out but we can't just sit around and

1380
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:31,818
wait it ruins crops it has problems so

1381
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:33,409
we can remove our complete mulch layer

1382
00:48:31,818 --> 00:48:34,818
throw out the trash remove it from the

1383
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:37,368
room that will remove a lot of the

1384
00:48:34,818 --> 00:48:38,869
larvae and then from there you can

1385
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:40,160
sprinkle some neem cake down if you

1386
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:41,380
don't have access to neem you can use

1387
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:42,819
some insect

1388
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,900
if you don't have access to that you

1389
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,610
don't have to use any of these

1390
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,860
ingredients you can create a barrier

1391
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,930
with the next step and that's to put I

1392
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,900
like to use a premium compost or

1393
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:55,449
vermicompost and put about an inch layer

1394
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,530
up to two inches as a barrier covering

1395
00:48:55,449 --> 00:48:58,719
all of the soil that would have

1396
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:01,000
previously been infested and something

1397
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:03,279
about the beneficial the probiotics the

1398
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,289
organisms that are in that compost or in

1399
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,910
that worm castings the vermicompost it's

1400
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:11,230
Smothers amount and it really wipes out

1401
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:13,000
a big majority of them so you're back

1402
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,579
down into maintenance mode instead of

1403
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,739
you know a huge eradication effort and

1404
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:20,019
then from there don't water immediately

1405
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:21,609
keep it dry so that the adults can't

1406
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:23,289
immediately lay eggs on the top and you

1407
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:26,769
can put some sticky traps start to kill

1408
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:29,230
then while you're smothering the you

1409
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:31,389
know larvae below and that works really

1410
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:34,119
really well what I'd like to do is do

1411
00:49:31,389 --> 00:49:35,859
all of that but the exact same time once

1412
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,780
I remove the multi layer to get the soil

1413
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,470
really wet so that I can avoid watering

1414
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:42,910
the top for a day or two I like to get

1415
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:44,349
nematodes predator nematodes I'm not

1416
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:45,909
sure if they're available in Australia

1417
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:48,460
but we have a number of insector ease

1418
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:50,799
out here and I use our becau organics

1419
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,389
and we have a couple others but I order

1420
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,220
one that's specifically for fungus gnats

1421
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,929
and you water it into the soil and they

1422
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:58,000
eat all the larvae and they really not

1423
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:59,858
come down within the first week and then

1424
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,530
you can also get hypo abscess miles

1425
00:49:59,858 --> 00:50:04,329
predator mites and those would be you

1426
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,650
know coming already in your worm

1427
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:08,019
castings if you're getting them fresh

1428
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,670
but you can certainly buy them and add

1429
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:10,869
them to your soil and they should do the

1430
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:13,300
one-two punch when you have the

1431
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:15,430
nematodes and the mites and you've

1432
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,380
removed a lot of the larvae the multi

1433
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,879
layer and you got the sticky traps it

1434
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,358
should be pretty much eradicated at that

1435
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,950
point I haven't had a ton of luck with

1436
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:26,369
diatomaceous earth in organics because

1437
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:28,809
we keep the multi layer so moist and

1438
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:31,329
diatomaceous earth is not helpful when

1439
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:33,608
it's wet and that's also why the fungus

1440
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:35,559
not like it because it's wet up there in

1441
00:50:33,608 --> 00:50:37,329
that mulch layer so you may want to do

1442
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:41,289
some bottom watering and get the top a

1443
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:43,239
little bit drier but there's also if you

1444
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:45,250
do some research there's a product

1445
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,139
called BT I bacillus thuringiensis ray

1446
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,269
leus and they're in a product called

1447
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:51,339
mosquito dunks and it's a common

1448
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:54,250
bacteria that they use and it definitely

1449
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:57,130
helps destroy the larvae and stuff

1450
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:59,889
that process so using one or all of

1451
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:01,420
these techniques can really help I also

1452
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:03,699
hear about people doing some soil

1453
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:06,099
drenches so I would ask around and talk

1454
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:08,079
to other organic farmers and maybe look

1455
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:10,389
at other products that exist in your

1456
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,710
market but those are all the steps that

1457
00:51:10,389 --> 00:51:14,650
we take that seem to have the biggest

1458
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:16,090
effect you have fantastic and for anyone

1459
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,190
listening in Australia every one of

1460
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:21,250
those things is available and I've used

1461
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:23,170
most of them they work pretty well so

1462
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,820
just creating a barrier is a good way so

1463
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,220
you'll even notice that Nick's as a

1464
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,840
product it's like a recycled glass it

1465
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:30,639
looks like perlite you just put it on

1466
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,309
top of your soil I think you could

1467
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,809
probably just use perlite but no well I

1468
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:36,759
would prefer like I said it's compost

1469
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:39,400
and all that and so cool great

1470
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,890
recommendation so I'm in a previous

1471
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,720
episode we had a guest recommend that we

1472
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:45,759
all check out insect frass as you

1473
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:47,529
mentioned earlier now insect frass I

1474
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,820
believe it's available in Australia

1475
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,740
should be available in most everywhere

1476
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:52,750
but it's pretty new to a lot of people

1477
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:56,859
give us a bit of a rundown on the

1478
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:58,150
benefits of insect frass well when you

1479
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,220
look at the manufacturers and what

1480
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:05,280
they're advertising a lot of them will

1481
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:08,349
key back to a chitin and chitin is a

1482
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:12,220
material that is in crustacean in the

1483
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:14,679
shells that's in the insects and their

1484
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:18,279
exoskeleton it's also in the cell walls

1485
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:21,789
of fungus and so what what we've learned

1486
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:24,280
is that the enzyme that digests chitin

1487
00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:27,130
is really helpful and it stimulates the

1488
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,630
plant's SAR or systemic required

1489
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,510
resistance and kind of like a booster

1490
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:35,289
shot gets them on the defense and

1491
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:37,090
besides that the kite maize can help if

1492
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:39,009
it's perpetuated and there's a lot of

1493
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:44,410
chitin is it can help be a deterrent to

1494
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:46,120
certain pests and so when we use insect

1495
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:48,489
frass it comes from insects and not only

1496
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:50,319
does it have a kind of like a worm

1497
00:52:48,489 --> 00:52:52,569
casting like effect as far as

1498
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,330
fertilization it's an it's the poop of

1499
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:56,860
insects the benefit here is the insects

1500
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:59,130
are all eating plant material and so

1501
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:01,539
it's a really organic process and

1502
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,340
usually it's pretty I guess I wouldn't

1503
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:05,320
say really affordable but as things

1504
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,329
start to scale up where we're getting it

1505
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,088
is from

1506
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:11,459
mealworm farms and bug farms that are

1507
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:13,949
usually meant for feeding reptiles and

1508
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:16,288
things like that and so just like worm

1509
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:17,670
farming had this by-product called worm

1510
00:53:16,289 --> 00:53:19,469
castings that become popular in

1511
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,999
gardening the bug farms are having a

1512
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:23,309
byproduct and it's called insect frass

1513
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:25,108
and that is turning out to have you know

1514
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:26,999
multiple different benefits and I think

1515
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:28,798
what we're seeing is in any ecosystem

1516
00:53:26,998 --> 00:53:29,879
bugs are gonna be there they're gonna be

1517
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:31,588
eating they're gonna be pooping we're

1518
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,179
gonna have worms underneath we're gonna

1519
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:35,429
have compost from all the leaves we're

1520
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:37,829
now finally mimicking that putting all

1521
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:40,139
of it into our organic soil and it's

1522
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:43,140
like wow the whole thing is right here

1523
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:45,958
now and so I think that's where that

1524
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:47,248
real extra effect is coming from but

1525
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,448
I've heard a lot about frost recently

1526
00:53:47,248 --> 00:53:49,428
too a lot of people are starting to use

1527
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:51,599
it

1528
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:55,528
awesome yeah I've heard it too it's a

1529
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:57,509
good sustainable amendment sustainable

1530
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:58,949
so just kind of going back to a point

1531
00:53:57,509 --> 00:54:01,469
you made a little while ago about the

1532
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:04,559
kind of um the elite ivities that exists

1533
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:05,880
around organics how do you think we get

1534
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,059
around this because like for me

1535
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,519
personally like I try to be as non

1536
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:13,319
elitist about it as I can at times but

1537
00:54:11,518 --> 00:54:14,518
sometimes it's even just like it's hard

1538
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:16,108
to get around it like I've got some

1539
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:17,518
friends who grow synthetically and like

1540
00:54:16,108 --> 00:54:19,228
I just don't want to smoke synthetic

1541
00:54:17,518 --> 00:54:20,909
weed like that it's nothing against them

1542
00:54:19,228 --> 00:54:22,649
it's that's just my kind of personal

1543
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:23,938
stance how do you you know how do you

1544
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,079
say to someone hey man I don't want to

1545
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:27,058
smoke your weed because it's synthetic

1546
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:28,469
without coming across as super elitist

1547
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:31,229
or just in general you know what I mean

1548
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:32,579
I don't think there's a great way to do

1549
00:54:31,228 --> 00:54:34,468
that I mean if you go to a buddy's house

1550
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:36,509
and he's gonna you know microwave some

1551
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:40,229
some canned soup and cook you up a

1552
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:41,789
frozen burger patty and look at you as

1553
00:54:40,228 --> 00:54:44,159
if it's the best thing that they've ever

1554
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:45,420
made before you're not gonna want to

1555
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,728
look at it and say [ __ ] I'm sorry man I

1556
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:50,548
want to eat this it's [ __ ] but at the

1557
00:54:47,728 --> 00:54:52,348
same time if you're somebody who has a

1558
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:53,969
very specific diet it cares about what

1559
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:55,439
you eat you know all the chemicals that

1560
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:56,729
are in that you know what went into the

1561
00:54:55,438 --> 00:54:58,588
process you know it doesn't taste as

1562
00:54:56,728 --> 00:55:00,448
good and you're thinking the [ __ ] can't

1563
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:02,429
you see what I'm saying the McDonald's

1564
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:03,989
burger might sell a lot of burgers but

1565
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:05,579
it's not the best burger I can make a

1566
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:08,818
better one especially if I had my own

1567
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:11,339
cap knew what a ate processed it myself

1568
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:13,708
built the fire and cooked it myself and

1569
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:15,659
so I think the difference just becomes

1570
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:17,428
really when they don't care at all down

1571
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:18,029
to personality and it's just better not

1572
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:19,740
to try and

1573
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:21,450
Venson better not to have that friction

1574
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:23,429
in your relationship and just appreciate

1575
00:55:21,449 --> 00:55:24,839
them for who they are and if they start

1576
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:27,119
to open up at some point maybe you can

1577
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,620
share it I find the number one way to

1578
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,000
open them up is to share some of your

1579
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:32,029
herb with them and they're gonna go what

1580
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,519
like how does that happen

1581
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:37,970
and that might be enough but beyond that

1582
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:43,170
I feel like it's just a losing argument

1583
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:45,659
yeah okay cool so a lot of people like

1584
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:47,550
to talk a lot of trash about woodchips

1585
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:49,589
in soil mixes like whenever I see a

1586
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:51,510
photo and I can visibly see woodchips I

1587
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:53,340
just know there's gonna be some comment

1588
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:54,180
somewhere about like oh you go woodchips

1589
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,740
in your soil

1590
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:57,149
what's your thoughts on woodchips are

1591
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:58,589
they really the worst thing ever the

1592
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:00,240
only thing I really read about them is

1593
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:03,780
that they can kind of dive the pH a

1594
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:06,419
little know I know what chips are

1595
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,040
fantastic and from Leica if I was to

1596
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:10,079
improve a property putting a multi layer

1597
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,000
down on truckloads of wood chips that

1598
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,829
were from potentially you know downed

1599
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,500
trees that had to be fallen for certain

1600
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:18,150
reasons like beetle infestation or they

1601
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,349
had to they were old and rotting and

1602
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,389
removed from other people's property

1603
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:24,119
chipped up instead of making compost

1604
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:26,940
they went to my property phenomenal

1605
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:28,920
results I mean so highly fungal really

1606
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,590
helps build soil fast and that high

1607
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,200
lignin turns into good humic and fulvic

1608
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:35,519
as a compost so I don't think it's a bad

1609
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:38,279
thing here's where the fear comes from

1610
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,050
there's a I'm gonna say it wrong but

1611
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,810
there's a process called allelopathy

1612
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:44,880
where trees will not want to have other

1613
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:46,920
trees competing in their inner territory

1614
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,579
and so they exude and excrete these

1615
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,960
chemicals that will not it will make it

1616
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:53,279
harder for things to grow there and so

1617
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,050
the fear has always been that if you use

1618
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,170
these particular woodchips especially

1619
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:59,610
from a green waste yard that has all the

1620
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:01,170
different types of trees blended up

1621
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:02,519
you're going to get some early low

1622
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:05,070
Pathak wood and it's going to ruin your

1623
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:07,230
soil I've only found that to be an issue

1624
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:09,600
when it's mixed into the soil in a high

1625
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:12,150
ratio as opposed to compost at first or

1626
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,039
just top dressed when it's top dressed I

1627
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:18,030
don't see any issue it's a perfectly

1628
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:20,039
fine mulch and when it's composted it's

1629
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:21,500
a great material addition to compost

1630
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:25,050
that helps provide a low-cost

1631
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:27,780
sustainable source of compost of course

1632
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:29,070
not deforesting but using trees that may

1633
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,920
have been pulled for various reasons

1634
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:33,230
other than that

1635
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,970
I I guess I haven't heard as much about

1636
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,559
the wood in your soil or anything I know

1637
00:57:34,969 --> 00:57:39,980
that certain places have talked about

1638
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,929
bad about municipal compost facilities

1639
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,849
that are shredding pallets and then

1640
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:45,649
composting that I'm calling your compost

1641
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:47,449
then I could see kind of the concern

1642
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:49,250
there for the chemicals in the wood and

1643
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:51,829
you know all the nails and stuff like

1644
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:53,239
that but all in all if I had to chop a

1645
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:55,699
tree down my property I think I'd be

1646
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:57,229
really excited to use that in fact users

1647
00:57:55,699 --> 00:57:59,809
should list the listeners should look up

1648
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:01,880
a process called Hugo culture it's a

1649
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:04,369
permaculture principle and it's based on

1650
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:07,760
burying rotting wood trunks and stalks

1651
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:10,039
underground to eliminate watering and to

1652
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,000
build an ecosystem and it really really

1653
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:17,059
has some power yeah fantastic

1654
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,400
so um it seems like there within the

1655
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:21,349
organic movement there there's a little

1656
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,639
bit of an appeal to nature fallacy and

1657
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:24,769
this this question is going to be a bit

1658
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:27,319
extended but essentially the whole

1659
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:29,300
movement around indigenous microbes now

1660
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,430
in Australia for example we've got a

1661
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,320
very specific environment where we have

1662
00:58:31,429 --> 00:58:35,359
extremely low phosphorus in the soil and

1663
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:38,210
the microbes have adapted over time and

1664
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:39,950
as a result the native plants really

1665
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:42,110
don't actually like to have a lot of

1666
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:44,480
phosphorous in the soil and so

1667
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:47,090
essentially whenever I see people going

1668
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,369
and trying to you know populate these

1669
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:51,110
indigenous microbes I just think to

1670
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:53,000
myself well you're gonna be adding them

1671
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,890
to a medium which is high phosphorus and

1672
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,630
I know that those microbes can't handle

1673
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:58,279
high phosphorus so they're just gonna

1674
00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:01,309
get wiped out by the treaty almost

1675
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,230
instantly and if I thought about it do

1676
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:05,329
you do you think that this you know

1677
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,920
indigenous microbes thing is a bit of an

1678
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:08,599
appeal to nature fallacy or there is

1679
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,980
maybe some truth to it and just it works

1680
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:12,589
out in Australia's case that it's not

1681
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:14,059
going to work too well for you I don't

1682
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,890
know I think the time will tell you know

1683
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:17,239
we don't know enough at all to tell that

1684
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:20,000
and I think that a lot of people are

1685
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:22,399
wanting to use purchased microbes or

1686
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,590
indigenous microbes and the research is

1687
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,510
showing that those aren't around months

1688
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:29,240
later but what they are doing is kind of

1689
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:31,610
like a team of soldiers going in and

1690
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:33,049
training the locals how to do their job

1691
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,460
and so you get some of them to have

1692
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:37,610
immediately some of them stay and

1693
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,590
persist and nature always has this

1694
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:41,240
ability to have all that diversity and

1695
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,949
that's where its benefit is where we

1696
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:44,868
come and slaughter that

1697
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:46,579
by using synthetics is where we start to

1698
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:49,160
have to add back and guess but like you

1699
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:52,689
said indoors with a soil recipe two

1700
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:55,278
totally different high phosphorus I

1701
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:57,588
don't I don't really know the answer if

1702
00:59:55,278 --> 00:59:59,748
you're indoors the indigenous microbes

1703
00:59:57,588 --> 01:00:01,248
may not be of any benefit other than the

1704
00:59:59,748 --> 01:00:01,728
fact that you could cultivate them for

1705
01:00:01,248 --> 01:00:03,649
free

1706
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:05,629
and if they were really good at actually

1707
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:07,249
saw you buy zhing phosphorus because of

1708
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,259
what they did for the local plants you

1709
01:00:07,248 --> 01:00:11,748
might find benefit in lowering your

1710
01:00:09,259 --> 01:00:13,338
phosphorus in put your soil recipe it's

1711
01:00:11,748 --> 01:00:14,868
so knowing that would be beneficial and

1712
01:00:13,338 --> 01:00:16,639
might have some effect we're just

1713
01:00:14,869 --> 01:00:18,380
throwing into a high phosphorus recipe

1714
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:20,629
like you said that might actually hurt

1715
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:23,179
it may just be a waste of your time and

1716
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,890
so more education more testing is gonna

1717
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:26,809
need to be done to say definitively but

1718
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:28,188
I've heard from a number of growers that

1719
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:30,559
are using these phosphorus all you buy

1720
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:32,420
zhing products on a super soil with high

1721
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,400
phosphorus they're having a ton of

1722
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,259
issues where growers that are using a

1723
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,880
balanced you know low phosphorus all

1724
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:43,248
recipe are experiencing really great

1725
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:44,588
effects from it so that's all anecdotal

1726
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:47,419
is just stuff I'm hearing from people

1727
01:00:44,588 --> 01:00:48,708
but it just shows how much more research

1728
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:52,009
means to be honest every one of these

1729
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:53,989
questions is great questions and I know

1730
01:00:52,009 --> 01:00:55,728
that nature finds a way so when I use

1731
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:57,139
the micro eyes I when I try just create

1732
01:00:55,728 --> 01:01:00,078
a balanced phosphorus instead of an

1733
01:00:57,139 --> 01:01:01,608
excess I have great results I know like

1734
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,339
Michael astera recommends a lot more

1735
01:01:01,608 --> 01:01:06,318
phosphorus in our soil and certain

1736
01:01:04,338 --> 01:01:07,880
growers will want that but I haven't

1737
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:09,170
necessarily found the need and I find

1738
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,528
that it shuffles that I've balanced

1739
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:13,789
around to other areas so ask me again in

1740
01:01:12,528 --> 01:01:16,099
a year and I might have a very different

1741
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:19,009
answer we'll see yeah no worries

1742
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:21,469
so another one which kind of seems like

1743
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,938
maybe it's I don't know I'm not going to

1744
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,588
say a fad but it kind of seems like

1745
01:01:22,938 --> 01:01:27,048
splitting hairs to me when we look at

1746
01:01:24,588 --> 01:01:28,639
the Korean natural farming or the

1747
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:30,409
no-till movements in certain regards

1748
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:32,889
like it seems like there's all these

1749
01:01:30,409 --> 01:01:35,118
names and all these kind of ways to

1750
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:36,498
individualize your specific style of

1751
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,630
farming we're in the end I think we

1752
01:01:36,498 --> 01:01:40,728
could just use like this broad term of

1753
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:42,499
natural organic or something like that

1754
01:01:40,728 --> 01:01:44,989
do you agree with that that we should

1755
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:46,728
stop trying to you know split organic

1756
01:01:44,989 --> 01:01:48,019
into these subdivisions or you think oh

1757
01:01:46,728 --> 01:01:48,348
it's just semantics it doesn't really

1758
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:51,108
matter

1759
01:01:48,349 --> 01:01:52,519
I don't know I think that from just

1760
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:54,498
learning about it at all and teaching it

1761
01:01:52,518 --> 01:01:55,459
we should you know not really categorize

1762
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:57,439
it that

1763
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:59,000
you know which one's better but learning

1764
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,480
about these nuances has been helpful for

1765
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,420
me

1766
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,280
you know I think that where it becomes a

1767
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,960
problem was whether ego gets inserted so

1768
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,820
if it's kind of like oh I knew about you

1769
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,400
know Fukuoka before you did

1770
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:11,809
I knew about Cho before you did and ha I

1771
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:16,700
make my own nutrients and you don't

1772
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:18,880
therefore I'm better that can go but the

1773
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:21,019
different segments to me are like

1774
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,789
specialization with an educational field

1775
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:24,769
and so when you go to school you can

1776
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:26,869
specialize deeper and Neri or narrower

1777
01:02:24,769 --> 01:02:29,090
within a niche and I feel like as long

1778
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:31,039
as they're all working we can maybe mine

1779
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:32,840
some valuable information from that and

1780
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,550
what I mean by that is for instance the

1781
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,320
Korean natural farming's latest

1782
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:39,140
extension is you Dom natural farming

1783
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,280
chose Sun I believe and so we start to

1784
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:43,159
look at that and the difference between

1785
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,810
show Cho is Cho uses a lot of molasses

1786
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:47,539
which is imported not grown there and is

1787
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:49,880
expensive whereas udam uses leaf bolt

1788
01:02:47,539 --> 01:02:52,159
harvested within digital microorganisms

1789
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,570
and is going to be fermented on the site

1790
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:56,029
where the plants are grown at that

1791
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:57,110
temperature and so to them it's like why

1792
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:59,090
would we do this different you're gonna

1793
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:01,220
import a lot of stuff but from the

1794
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:02,660
outside in their favorite thing to make

1795
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:04,279
that's very important to a lot of these

1796
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:06,859
recipes and foliar is called a digital

1797
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,780
wetting agent which involves bringing in

1798
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,430
potassium hydroxide from without in the

1799
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:12,980
farm and making your own soap at a low

1800
01:03:10,429 --> 01:03:14,750
cost and so for me I'm like well yucca

1801
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,670
is easier for me to get a great wetting

1802
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,739
agent is not zapping it is a great

1803
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:20,119
fungicide I'm gonna use that because

1804
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:22,099
it's just as cheap and I don't want to

1805
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:26,809
wait and make my own wedding agent so if

1806
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:28,909
we can't and instead of learn about I

1807
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:31,159
guess embrace our differences and learn

1808
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:33,170
why they're there and then each person

1809
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:34,399
individually figure out whether that

1810
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:36,260
should be applied to them or not it's

1811
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,639
probably the best way but because we

1812
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,590
don't all have done limited time to

1813
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:40,909
research all the methods we end up just

1814
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:43,070
kind of asking and that's where I think

1815
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:44,299
a lot of us get it shut down is you know

1816
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:45,800
you'll Alaska is this way better of

1817
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,090
course it is I've been doing this for 10

1818
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,870
years it's all I think about this is the

1819
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:54,470
only way but most people that are honest

1820
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:55,940
will say that they all work no matter of

1821
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:57,739
where you live what region where in the

1822
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,849
world what you're trying to do and we're

1823
01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:03,789
gonna have a different answer for a lot

1824
01:03:58,849 --> 01:04:07,039
of these situations yeah so um I guess

1825
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:08,599
kind of another one that might be a

1826
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:08,909
little bit of semantics but how do you

1827
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:11,039
feel

1828
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:13,799
about exotic ingredients you know

1829
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:17,820
recently we've seen the rise of herb I

1830
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:19,080
say right the shilajit now how do you

1831
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,490
feel about these types of ingredients

1832
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:22,529
you think on the most part there's

1833
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:24,809
probably something that you can do its

1834
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,850
job reasonably cheaper or do you think

1835
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:33,299
some of these kind of exotic ingredients

1836
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:34,949
do have a spot in the garden yes because

1837
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,269
a lot of us are one an experiment at the

1838
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:37,949
highest level with all these things

1839
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:39,239
we're gonna be reading about all these

1840
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:40,529
things that work for human health

1841
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:42,659
like shilajit and you're gonna be

1842
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:44,970
reading about Ormus and different things

1843
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:46,259
that you can make but without a doubt

1844
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:47,819
I've never found anything that just

1845
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:50,070
doubles my yield or just makes

1846
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:52,680
everything so incredibly different a few

1847
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:56,580
of them like you know good compost some

1848
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:58,799
kelp meal compost tea certainly was one

1849
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:59,880
of those wow that really worked and so

1850
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:05,340
there's a few things that just make a

1851
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:08,519
huge difference but some of these things

1852
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:11,250
I'm just not sure are worth the cost

1853
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:15,239
and so just purely looking at them are

1854
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:17,309
they do they do something but versus

1855
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:20,219
their return on investment a lot of

1856
01:05:17,309 --> 01:05:21,840
times don't pan out you know you don't

1857
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:23,099
see essential oils used on big farms

1858
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,079
because it's just you'd have to grow

1859
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:26,460
billion acres of plants just to make the

1860
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:28,469
essential oils to turn around and put it

1861
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,849
on all our crops but for an indoor

1862
01:05:28,469 --> 01:05:33,299
gardener essential oils can work really

1863
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:35,610
good so I guess I guess there's value

1864
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,930
but everybody's gonna have to ask you

1865
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:38,250
know that on their own and the most

1866
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:39,929
value comes when you're really

1867
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:42,329
researching this I find if somebody just

1868
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:43,679
gives me something and I try it for some

1869
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:45,449
reason it's not the same as me reading

1870
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,889
romance and learning about every effect

1871
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:50,460
it's going to have and then seeing if I

1872
01:05:46,889 --> 01:05:51,750
see that so you do something about that

1873
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:54,179
law of attraction the power of thought

1874
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:58,079
you know there's some products that'll

1875
01:05:54,179 --> 01:06:01,169
definitely have that fake effect that

1876
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,730
placebo effect and so weeding that out I

1877
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:04,019
think is important and a number of

1878
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:05,519
products will come back on the market

1879
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:08,369
there's just a cycle that happens and

1880
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:10,050
you know full vyx a lot of times get

1881
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:12,569
popular and then they go out because so

1882
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,800
many fake foot companies come on the

1883
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,150
market people realize it doesn't work

1884
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,250
and then they go by the wayside and then

1885
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,450
the real companies stick around and

1886
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:21,389
people start using it again it gets

1887
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:22,379
popular then it goes away and so it's

1888
01:06:21,389 --> 01:06:23,849
always going to depend on the

1889
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:27,000
all of these inputs as well a lot of

1890
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:28,920
snake oil salesman wolf they keen on the

1891
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,150
latest keyword and sell you stuff so

1892
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,789
just just do your research if you want

1893
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:34,410
to try one of these newer products yeah

1894
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:36,840
so just touching on how you said that um

1895
01:06:34,409 --> 01:06:38,639
one ingredient you had noticed a big

1896
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:42,120
improvement from was like quality

1897
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:44,699
compost a you of the opinion that really

1898
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:47,250
high quality worm castings in a fermi

1899
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:48,569
compost is the best compost or do you

1900
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,289
feel that there's another compost which

1901
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:51,289
maybe is a bit better

1902
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:55,019
they're good for different purposes worm

1903
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,880
castings will have the most nutrient

1904
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:58,380
density typically and then here's that

1905
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,210
here's the difference a thermophilic

1906
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:02,130
compost will go to temperature to make

1907
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,420
it so that it's viable for use and if

1908
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:04,950
it's done over a really long period of

1909
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,289
time it'll have really good balance of

1910
01:07:04,949 --> 01:07:08,460
nutrients and pH and all that compost

1911
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,650
isn't gonna have a lot of minerals it's

1912
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,909
all organic matter and so mineralizing

1913
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:14,460
that compost is always going to be

1914
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:16,739
important and if you mineralize compost

1915
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:18,119
feed it to worms add extras like kelp

1916
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:20,279
meal and things like that

1917
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:22,049
it's not gonna go to temperature again

1918
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:25,380
the worms will work it through bacterial

1919
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:27,390
action and fungal action and it's gonna

1920
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:29,039
keep a lot of secondary benefits that

1921
01:07:27,389 --> 01:07:30,719
might be available in these plants so

1922
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,090
for people that are looking for the

1923
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:35,609
hormones the metabolize the second berry

1924
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:37,200
you know properties of compost worm

1925
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:39,269
castings is where it's at and so that's

1926
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:41,250
why everybody uses both but what we're

1927
01:07:39,269 --> 01:07:43,079
learning from a scalability perspective

1928
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,730
is that following these recipes is not

1929
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:46,559
affordable and then it would make more

1930
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:48,960
sense to make your own castings and use

1931
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,029
those for side dressing top dressing and

1932
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,720
teas and then focus on your main soil to

1933
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:55,950
be built on other materials like compost

1934
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:57,329
okay interesting yet because I was

1935
01:07:55,949 --> 01:08:00,089
actually gonna ask what would you

1936
01:07:57,329 --> 01:08:01,769
recommend yeah doing the opposite of

1937
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:04,110
what you said well I may be using a

1938
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:06,300
slightly reduced quality compost in the

1939
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:07,710
bucket but top dressing with a high

1940
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,260
quality compost is something I'd always

1941
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:12,659
heard was that a huge benefit of top

1942
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:14,310
dressing with say vermi compost was you

1943
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:16,470
know the the leaching of the microbes

1944
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:18,960
down into the root ball and so that

1945
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:20,430
could kind of improve the compost down

1946
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,480
there if it wasn't quite as good and you

1947
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:24,600
say you didn't have the money to buy a

1948
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:26,489
lot of worm castings yep and worms

1949
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,020
always do it right people don't and so

1950
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:30,329
if you go to a local spot they may not

1951
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:32,790
have the carbon to nitrogen ratio proper

1952
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:34,500
which means that the off gassing of

1953
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:35,469
methane and nitrogen gases will be high

1954
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,899
it's not gonna happen

1955
01:08:35,469 --> 01:08:39,909
nutrients where when I test castings

1956
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:41,588
it's like really high in nitrogen really

1957
01:08:39,909 --> 01:08:42,969
high in potassium really high in

1958
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:44,559
phosphorus and that's why we're seeing

1959
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:46,298
those effects even if the microbes

1960
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,750
aren't fully intact and it's a little

1961
01:08:46,298 --> 01:08:51,488
older so worm castings are significantly

1962
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:54,149
more potent and that's why their money

1963
01:08:51,488 --> 01:08:55,899
is is that's why it's more expensive but

1964
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:57,399
contrary to that they can also be a

1965
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:59,798
little too potent and so if you base it

1966
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,738
on a lot of our recipes at 30% compost

1967
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:04,060
and you get a really potent vermicompost

1968
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:05,829
you might have some problems of excess

1969
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:08,020
nitrogen excess potassium excess

1970
01:09:05,829 --> 01:09:09,880
phosphorus and we ran into that the

1971
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:11,799
reason why is about 90 percent of the

1972
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,719
comp of the worm castings on the market

1973
01:09:11,798 --> 01:09:15,130
the United States just thrown a number

1974
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:16,930
out there it's got to be upwards of that

1975
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:19,420
percentage are made by unco and they're

1976
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:21,130
a processor that basically makes a

1977
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,140
product that's devoid of nutrient and so

1978
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:25,480
you can grow in a hundred percent unco

1979
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:27,369
worm castings you can't do that with

1980
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:29,198
homemade and I think that's a big

1981
01:09:27,369 --> 01:09:31,659
difference so one of the reasons why is

1982
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:33,579
if you start feeding a said Reed peat in

1983
01:09:31,659 --> 01:09:36,338
a bucket with a little bit of grain to a

1984
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:37,930
worm that process the weight of input

1985
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:40,000
material is the weight of castings they

1986
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:42,279
get out with our castings when we have a

1987
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,170
regular farm doing it they put about 8

1988
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:45,940
pounds of feed in to get 2 pounds of

1989
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:48,640
castings out those other six pounds are

1990
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:50,318
for the worms and it's just a big

1991
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,609
difference in nutrient density and so

1992
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,500
you have to use a lot of times around

1993
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:58,960
that 10 to 15% mark to hit that sweet

1994
01:09:53,500 --> 01:10:02,198
spot yeah and so um I guess the question

1995
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:04,329
would then be is if you are gonna make

1996
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,009
your own worm castings what would you

1997
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:08,680
recommend is the best way to do it I've

1998
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:10,510
read some stuff which says you know you

1999
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,460
should use if you want to go for those

2000
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:15,219
really nutrient-dense costumes as you

2001
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:16,989
spoke about maybe use a lot of manure as

2002
01:10:15,219 --> 01:10:19,448
your base instead of cocoa you know what

2003
01:10:16,988 --> 01:10:21,218
are your recommendations yeah so if you

2004
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:26,079
wanted to make a material that would

2005
01:10:21,219 --> 01:10:28,840
that when composted was very low cec

2006
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:31,000
very you know not nutrient rich that

2007
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:33,489
actually might serve a purpose as a base

2008
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,439
kind of like peat moss and it would

2009
01:10:33,488 --> 01:10:36,609
certainly be high in bacterial and it

2010
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,559
would be a good material to work with

2011
01:10:36,609 --> 01:10:41,229
but when you start thinking about making

2012
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,750
a really nutrient dense top dressing and

2013
01:10:41,229 --> 01:10:45,339
T quality vermicompost we're gonna you

2014
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:48,698
know relate that to the quality of our

2015
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:49,300
inputs and so the best would be to start

2016
01:10:48,698 --> 01:10:50,979
with a thermal

2017
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,630
what compost is the starting point it

2018
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:54,519
would remove all those seeds and all the

2019
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:55,960
problems that happen from just just

2020
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,610
recycling waste like throwing your

2021
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,050
Tomatoes right in there you might have

2022
01:10:57,609 --> 01:11:01,539
some tomato seeds pop up because it's

2023
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:03,880
not gonna be you know fully composted so

2024
01:11:01,539 --> 01:11:05,349
you make a thermophilic compost and you

2025
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,550
get the carbons and nitrogens and greens

2026
01:11:05,349 --> 01:11:08,440
and then from there to make it even

2027
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:11,110
better a lot of people will focus on

2028
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:13,439
using really nutrient-rich plants to

2029
01:11:11,109 --> 01:11:16,509
make their compost like metal and

2030
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:18,219
comfrey and all of the plants that are

2031
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:20,020
already revered at gardening because

2032
01:11:18,219 --> 01:11:22,539
they are able to draw nutrients from

2033
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:25,059
deep within the soil and you use those

2034
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:27,069
along with uh some straw or whatever

2035
01:11:25,059 --> 01:11:29,230
Browns you find that are good and you

2036
01:11:27,069 --> 01:11:31,210
make a compost that by itself would be

2037
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:33,819
phenomenal and then you feed that to

2038
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:35,859
worms with a few extra benefits like

2039
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:38,039
kelp and things after the compost has

2040
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:40,269
gone to temperature and cooled back down

2041
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:43,929
that to me makes the most nutrient dense

2042
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:46,150
compost or vermicompost and the compost

2043
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:47,739
the word the worm castings we're

2044
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:50,229
currently using are from a facility that

2045
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:51,968
does use manure and they are incredibly

2046
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:54,009
nutrient dense so I would agree with you

2047
01:11:51,969 --> 01:11:56,408
on that okay awesome

2048
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,820
and so just touching on some cover crops

2049
01:11:56,408 --> 01:12:00,069
like you just mentioned there with the

2050
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:01,960
nettle in the comfrey do you think that

2051
01:12:00,069 --> 01:12:03,819
having a cover crop like those or

2052
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,130
something like clove or each - any of

2053
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:08,109
these nitrogen depositing companion

2054
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:10,630
plants do you think that they outweigh

2055
01:12:08,109 --> 01:12:13,839
the benefits of say having a nice big

2056
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:15,099
top dressing layer of compost and you

2057
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,179
know like if you had to pick one or the

2058
01:12:15,099 --> 01:12:20,139
other which one would you choose

2059
01:12:16,179 --> 01:12:22,480
essentially well from indoor perspective

2060
01:12:20,139 --> 01:12:23,980
probably just top dressing but there's a

2061
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:25,359
number of benefits we have a facility

2062
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:27,308
that's multiple tens of thousands of

2063
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:29,469
square feet indoors and instead of doing

2064
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:31,119
big beds they ended up doing I think 20

2065
01:12:29,469 --> 01:12:34,000
or 30 gallon containers on rolling

2066
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:35,198
tables and so for them a little bit of

2067
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,599
clover that they're growing in their

2068
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:39,669
acts as a binder to the soil and keeps

2069
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:41,319
the entire soil mass intact so when

2070
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:43,929
they're hand watering it doesn't shift

2071
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:45,308
the soil and so for them that was really

2072
01:12:43,929 --> 01:12:46,840
imperative that they had that process

2073
01:12:45,309 --> 01:12:48,159
and they feel like it also is feeding

2074
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:50,170
those eggs Yoon's to the soil and

2075
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:51,219
keeping the soil alive and a lot of

2076
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,960
people will tell you that that's just

2077
01:12:51,219 --> 01:12:54,730
totally imperative and I agree but

2078
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,109
picking one or the other I think that

2079
01:12:54,729 --> 01:12:58,529
you had a little more nutrient power

2080
01:12:56,109 --> 01:13:00,949
command on the spot by just top dressing

2081
01:12:58,529 --> 01:13:02,329
personally all rather the top

2082
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:03,920
mulching and I'll just top dress right

2083
01:13:02,329 --> 01:13:06,590
over the top and smother it so you get a

2084
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,270
little bit of both yeah and then in the

2085
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:10,159
field when we have time is our benefit

2086
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:12,980
we can harvest we can sow cover crop

2087
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,359
after harvest let that grow up and then

2088
01:13:12,979 --> 01:13:15,979
we can smother that through winter and

2089
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:17,989
then we can tell it back under or top

2090
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:19,399
dress over it get all of the benefits

2091
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:21,710
from the free nitrogen that's taken out

2092
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:22,939
of the air as well as the top dress

2093
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:25,550
where the way most people are using

2094
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:27,919
cover crop indoors it's not really

2095
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:30,230
fixing nitrogen and nodules and and

2096
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:32,899
putting it deep into the soil it's more

2097
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:34,869
once that cover crop dies and returns to

2098
01:13:32,899 --> 01:13:38,149
the soil that is adding its benefit so

2099
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:40,970
so if people could grow one plant may be

2100
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:43,309
outside or around that's gonna help out

2101
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:44,930
with the growth of cannabis what would

2102
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:46,850
be the one plant you recommend they grow

2103
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:48,770
alongside it so to speak like so for me

2104
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:51,500
it's a leviair because i it's got a lot

2105
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:52,520
of good purposes in my opinion yep LM

2106
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,949
very probably the one I recommend

2107
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,360
because most the plants that grow have

2108
01:13:54,949 --> 01:13:58,099
to have some benefit whether it's

2109
01:13:56,359 --> 01:13:59,779
beautiful or whether it produces food or

2110
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,520
you know an aloe vera just has a ton of

2111
01:13:59,779 --> 01:14:03,170
them if you look it up it has all the

2112
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,350
amino acids it has the you know

2113
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:07,819
salicylic acid for rooting it has

2114
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:09,710
benefits as far as happening and wetting

2115
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:11,840
agent you can use it for burns and it's

2116
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:14,119
a great plant to grow it's very easy to

2117
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,470
grow is the other key point you you know

2118
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:17,329
you almost can't mess it up if you get

2119
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:18,800
the right type of aloe and if it's got a

2120
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:20,300
lot of Sun you can water in lots of

2121
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,130
nutrients in the winter you can just

2122
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:23,480
almost not water it it'll stay alive if

2123
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:25,819
you practically kill it you can bring it

2124
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:27,049
back to life beside that comfrey is

2125
01:14:25,819 --> 01:14:28,579
another really popular one

2126
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,770
the problem is comfrey can be invasive

2127
01:14:28,579 --> 01:14:34,159
and take over so you've you know they

2128
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:36,040
found that the Bocking for Bocking 14 or

2129
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:39,590
a very popular cutting of comfrey that

2130
01:14:36,039 --> 01:14:41,300
doesn't develop seeds it's sterile and

2131
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:43,279
that one in particular has a good carbon

2132
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:45,079
to nitrogen ratio so when you cut the

2133
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:47,119
leaves off and top dress with them or

2134
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:48,859
make compost they turn to compost very

2135
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:50,269
very quickly and they have some

2136
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:52,609
secondary benefits that are good to have

2137
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:54,410
on the farm too like that they can come

2138
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:57,439
in the nickname for it is knit bone it

2139
01:14:54,409 --> 01:15:00,500
helps heal broken bones and you can make

2140
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:03,619
a poultice with it and in the soil it

2141
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:05,840
has a lot of potassium and it'll have

2142
01:15:03,619 --> 01:15:07,640
you know a good rounding of other

2143
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,170
nutrients so those two the aloe or the

2144
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,579
comforter would be great to grow and

2145
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:14,719
very easy to grow so yeah fantastic

2146
01:15:12,579 --> 01:15:17,359
so

2147
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,670
for me when I found Koontz Mix and

2148
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:22,189
admittedly it was through your site it

2149
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:23,690
was a pretty big game-changer for me in

2150
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:24,589
terms of the results I was getting it

2151
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:26,899
was phenomenal

2152
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:29,090
however as you've kind of alluded to a

2153
01:15:26,899 --> 01:15:31,488
few times when I went to upscale this

2154
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:34,029
the worm castings became a bit cost

2155
01:15:31,488 --> 01:15:36,379
prohibitive do you find that there is

2156
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:38,359
fairly similar results from using

2157
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:40,998
because I find that you can get pretty

2158
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:42,710
high quality general compost and and

2159
01:15:40,998 --> 01:15:44,779
it's pretty good do you think that from

2160
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:46,189
using say a good quality compost as

2161
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:49,309
opposed to the Carson's you can get a

2162
01:15:46,189 --> 01:15:51,018
fairly comparable result yep I think so

2163
01:15:49,309 --> 01:15:53,449
as long as it's good compost and we've

2164
01:15:51,019 --> 01:15:55,130
actually switched our recipes to exclude

2165
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:58,009
the vermicompost it was really keeping

2166
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:59,989
us to the point where we had no profit

2167
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:01,909
margin we couldn't you know get it to a

2168
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:03,859
sort of resell it because they couldn't

2169
01:16:01,908 --> 01:16:06,920
afford to ship it and all that and the

2170
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:08,420
castings was the problem I mean 15 to 20

2171
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,069
grand just for a truckload of castings

2172
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:11,449
and we start burning through them it can

2173
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:14,359
cause a really big problem for cash flow

2174
01:16:11,448 --> 01:16:16,308
and then inconsistencies that would come

2175
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:17,948
from having to source that much when you

2176
01:16:16,309 --> 01:16:20,659
know people just don't make that much

2177
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:22,788
where compost they can and there's a

2178
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:25,098
really good reason for composting and

2179
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:26,868
people are already doing it at scale and

2180
01:16:25,099 --> 01:16:28,369
they understand it better so when you

2181
01:16:26,868 --> 01:16:30,768
find compost facilities that have really

2182
01:16:28,368 --> 01:16:33,319
good compost tests and you can learn to

2183
01:16:30,769 --> 01:16:35,630
interpret those find the pH look at the

2184
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:37,969
carbon to nitrogen ratio look at the

2185
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:40,099
salt levels you can pretty easily make a

2186
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:42,590
great soil and then from there make your

2187
01:16:40,099 --> 01:16:44,510
own dang castings for free put worms

2188
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:46,729
right in your soil they will turn that

2189
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:48,619
compost into castings for you while

2190
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:50,659
you're planting rose it's like it's

2191
01:16:48,618 --> 01:16:52,158
brilliant and then on top of that you

2192
01:16:50,658 --> 01:16:53,629
can take that worm castings out of your

2193
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:55,969
bin and top dress you get all the

2194
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:57,739
benefits without all the expense or if

2195
01:16:55,969 --> 01:16:59,840
you really are just starting you can buy

2196
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:02,419
a small amount of local castings and use

2197
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:05,360
those for teas and really stretch it so

2198
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:07,429
all in all I'm starting to get off the

2199
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:09,439
high horse of castings or bust and start

2200
01:17:07,429 --> 01:17:11,658
to say that a good compost is probably a

2201
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:13,129
lot more important and making your own

2202
01:17:11,658 --> 01:17:16,908
castings will be the big price

2203
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:19,599
difference so yeah so if you were gonna

2204
01:17:16,908 --> 01:17:22,518
recommend to like say a good friend a

2205
01:17:19,599 --> 01:17:24,769
sow mix and they're just starting out

2206
01:17:22,519 --> 01:17:26,599
would you give them coop thanks or would

2207
01:17:24,769 --> 01:17:27,929
you give them maybe something else like

2208
01:17:26,599 --> 01:17:29,788
what would your recommendation

2209
01:17:27,929 --> 01:17:32,788
someone who's just looking to get into

2210
01:17:29,788 --> 01:17:34,050
organics yup just coots mix or for

2211
01:17:32,788 --> 01:17:35,368
instance if those ingredients might be

2212
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:37,590
hard to find and it would keep them from

2213
01:17:35,368 --> 01:17:40,649
taking action I would say just mix up a

2214
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:42,449
recipe of three parts one part you know

2215
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:44,670
peat moss or coconut coir or whatever

2216
01:17:42,448 --> 01:17:46,738
that type of medium that you have

2217
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:49,739
available make sure it's good and rinsed

2218
01:17:46,738 --> 01:17:50,788
and it's a good quality peat moss over

2219
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:53,098
you know we're not gonna rinse it with

2220
01:17:50,788 --> 01:17:54,748
cocoa that's why I say that the next

2221
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:57,239
part would be your aeration perlite

2222
01:17:54,748 --> 01:18:00,059
pumice lava rock something to have some

2223
01:17:57,238 --> 01:18:02,218
air holding capacity in there and then

2224
01:18:00,059 --> 01:18:04,139
the third component would be the compost

2225
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:06,208
and from there you pretty much have a

2226
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:08,368
good soil but when you're using peat

2227
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:09,658
moss it's a little acidic and the

2228
01:18:08,368 --> 01:18:11,429
numbers aren't quite right so we add a

2229
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:13,170
little bit more calcium to it via waste

2230
01:18:11,429 --> 01:18:16,319
your shell flour gypsum so I would still

2231
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:17,998
recommend those normal numbers and then

2232
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,038
from there if you didn't have like the

2233
01:18:17,998 --> 01:18:21,958
crustacean me on the neem and the kelp

2234
01:18:20,038 --> 01:18:23,759
that as part of the coots mix I would

2235
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:26,099
say go grab a tomato fertilizer that's

2236
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,239
organic you like follow the recipe put

2237
01:18:26,099 --> 01:18:29,458
it in your soil and use that as your

2238
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:31,018
first grill I think you'll crush it from

2239
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:31,828
there you'll experience some benefits by

2240
01:18:31,019 --> 01:18:33,689
getting some really high-quality

2241
01:18:31,828 --> 01:18:35,880
amendments and starting to learn about

2242
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:38,249
each of them individually but tomatoes

2243
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,618
are similar fast-growing annual or

2244
01:18:38,248 --> 01:18:43,978
biennial plant kind of treated as an

2245
01:18:40,618 --> 01:18:45,268
annual so similar nutrient requirements

2246
01:18:43,979 --> 01:18:47,579
and I think most people are aware of

2247
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:49,949
that so out here there's a number of

2248
01:18:47,578 --> 01:18:51,779
tomato fertilizers you can buy problem

2249
01:18:49,948 --> 01:18:53,578
for me was I pick up that box and I'd

2250
01:18:51,779 --> 01:18:56,130
read cottonseed meal and realize oh

2251
01:18:53,578 --> 01:18:58,618
that's GMO number one pesticide sprayed

2252
01:18:56,130 --> 01:19:01,349
the the next one is there's feather meal

2253
01:18:58,618 --> 01:19:04,649
big chicken farms all GMO corn fed and

2254
01:19:01,349 --> 01:19:06,958
you know hormones and so it you find

2255
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:08,879
right away that all of the fertilizers

2256
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:10,828
are usually just someone's waste sold at

2257
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,420
a huge profit margin and that's why we

2258
01:19:10,828 --> 01:19:14,279
ended up going to these specific recipes

2259
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:16,050
but certainly if you're already doing

2260
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:18,179
synthetic going down the street by the

2261
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:19,619
tomato fertilizer mixing the three parts

2262
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:22,889
together I think you'll have good

2263
01:19:19,618 --> 01:19:24,988
success great and just specifically I

2264
01:19:22,889 --> 01:19:26,909
found it almost impossible to find

2265
01:19:24,988 --> 01:19:28,408
crustacean meal in Australia just for

2266
01:19:26,908 --> 01:19:32,448
that one amendment what would you

2267
01:19:28,408 --> 01:19:34,859
recommend is like a good interchangeable

2268
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:36,719
we're mainly after the calcium carbonate

2269
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:38,518
there and so it's just a natural source

2270
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,288
of calcium if you have a waster shell

2271
01:19:38,519 --> 01:19:41,150
flour great you're done you don't need

2272
01:19:40,288 --> 01:19:43,009
the crustacean

2273
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:44,599
the one thing that it does bring to the

2274
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,800
table though is a little bit of meat

2275
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,289
that might have been in there so a

2276
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:50,869
little nitrogen and I might also bring

2277
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:52,130
to the table the chitin which you know

2278
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:55,489
we talked about previously that's

2279
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:57,170
available in insect frass and so even

2280
01:19:55,489 --> 01:19:59,149
then if you didn't have it I don't think

2281
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:01,369
it's totally imperative and so you could

2282
01:19:59,149 --> 01:20:03,409
just get away by using a lime which is

2283
01:20:01,369 --> 01:20:06,050
calcium carbonate and if you have an

2284
01:20:03,409 --> 01:20:07,670
agricultural lime it's gonna be mostly

2285
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:09,800
calcium and about four percent magnesium

2286
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:11,359
if you have a dolomite it's gonna be

2287
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,070
higher magnesium but here's the kicker

2288
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:15,199
and then museums not the water soluble

2289
01:20:13,069 --> 01:20:17,539
part the calcium is and so you're mostly

2290
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:20,569
giving a calcium from that anyways until

2291
01:20:17,539 --> 01:20:22,399
a few years down the road so I wouldn't

2292
01:20:20,569 --> 01:20:23,449
worry terribly about the crustacean you

2293
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:25,789
know that's one of those that's a little

2294
01:20:23,449 --> 01:20:28,309
more easily replaceable I would use

2295
01:20:25,789 --> 01:20:32,479
insect frass as a direct replacement if

2296
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:36,320
that's available so yeah and so for

2297
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:39,229
people like the Rev he often advocates

2298
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:42,079
that um you know dolomite limes quite

2299
01:20:39,229 --> 01:20:44,149
good in your soil mixes and I remember

2300
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:46,729
the first post I ever read on Builder

2301
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:48,889
soil was essentially a link and it was

2302
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:50,419
dissecting through the super soil recipe

2303
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:51,619
and I was really impressed with it and

2304
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:53,300
the biggest thing I always remember

2305
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:55,099
about that article was that you were

2306
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:57,380
fairly adamant that you don't really

2307
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,180
need dolomite in your soil mix and it

2308
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,890
just forms like these little anaerobic

2309
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,300
pockets and it's not even really doing

2310
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:03,980
what a lot of people think it's doing

2311
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:05,510
would you mind maybe explaining this a

2312
01:21:03,979 --> 01:21:07,279
little better and do you still stand by

2313
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:10,909
that philosophy of don't really need

2314
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:12,229
dolomite so I don't think it's as

2315
01:21:10,909 --> 01:21:13,849
detrimental as I maybe previously

2316
01:21:12,229 --> 01:21:15,379
thought when I was getting educated in

2317
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:17,180
the subject I know people that use it

2318
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:18,710
it's not ruining their soil by any means

2319
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:20,150
but you know most those people aren't

2320
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:21,560
keeping it around for years at a time

2321
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:23,389
and it may not be hardening up but the

2322
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,160
wicking and the moisture holding

2323
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:27,050
capacity may not be as good and it's

2324
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:29,510
certainly been proven on an agricultural

2325
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:31,310
scale so what I started to do is instead

2326
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:34,010
of making up my own opinion and just

2327
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:35,600
going by what I saw 100% I started

2328
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:37,239
researching and you know across the

2329
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,370
board at the forefront of soil

2330
01:21:37,239 --> 01:21:42,619
remineralisation and soil testing

2331
01:21:39,369 --> 01:21:44,390
application they're not using double

2332
01:21:42,619 --> 01:21:46,239
mine anymore and it is very cheap you

2333
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:48,770
can buy all over the place but the

2334
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:50,630
calcium to magnesium ratio that we're

2335
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:52,310
looking for is not present in dolomite

2336
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:54,300
it's a little bit off and so over time

2337
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:55,860
it will affect itself now

2338
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,020
you're just lining peat-moss it's very

2339
01:21:55,859 --> 01:21:59,849
cheap it's available and it works we're

2340
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:01,920
keeping our soil and so in an effort to

2341
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:04,010
avoid that I still hold true that you

2342
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,539
don't need dolomite I would rather see

2343
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:07,800
magnesium added separately calcium added

2344
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:09,869
separately and have more control over

2345
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,489
that I would rather see waster shell

2346
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:13,140
flour which is more natural there's a

2347
01:22:11,489 --> 01:22:16,710
reason why it's fed to every chicken it

2348
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:18,240
has a premium source of calcium and then

2349
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:19,739
on top of that it also rather see maybe

2350
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:22,829
gypsum that brings the sulphur with it

2351
01:22:19,739 --> 01:22:24,750
that's so much more beneficial so if

2352
01:22:22,829 --> 01:22:26,399
that's all you have you know looking

2353
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,779
back on my previous posts I don't think

2354
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:31,139
that I would maybe beat it up as much

2355
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:32,429
but certainly at the if you're gonna be

2356
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,860
the one teaching everybody about

2357
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:36,990
building soil right now that's not the

2358
01:22:34,859 --> 01:22:39,719
go-to and I still believe that using an

2359
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:41,130
agate and AG lime using that oyster

2360
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,800
shell using chips something a lot of the

2361
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:46,970
others it's gonna be better yeah so

2362
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:48,900
we've got some people like the Rev who

2363
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:51,990
advocating some of these really

2364
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:53,849
long-term amendments like green sand and

2365
01:22:51,989 --> 01:22:56,039
as you mentioned just that dolomite the

2366
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:57,690
magnesium can take years to become

2367
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:01,109
available do you think they're

2368
01:22:57,689 --> 01:23:03,389
advocating the use of such long-lasting

2369
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:05,339
or slow release pavements is a good

2370
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:07,680
thing just because from my experience as

2371
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:10,050
much as we all try to reuse our soil

2372
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:11,730
things often happen and I can't really

2373
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:13,890
guarantee that everyone would have the

2374
01:23:11,729 --> 01:23:16,139
same soil in three years from now such

2375
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:17,730
they're really getting all the uses out

2376
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:20,340
of those long-term amendments do you

2377
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:22,729
feel the same way or do you think that's

2378
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:24,600
the you should just hang onto your soil

2379
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:25,919
well I think you should I go to your

2380
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,570
soil and if you're one that can planted

2381
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,829
that far ahead that's great but I don't

2382
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:31,079
think any of us really can that

2383
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:32,550
accurately I've had a number of people

2384
01:23:31,079 --> 01:23:33,899
that grew up in Jersey tell me man I

2385
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:37,230
wouldn't buy anything from there it's

2386
01:23:33,899 --> 01:23:39,839
probably dirty but that being said it's

2387
01:23:37,229 --> 01:23:41,789
mined other places and so you know there

2388
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,140
there was a big kick and it was a fad

2389
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:45,060
and there was a huge market that was

2390
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,770
talking about potassium it's important

2391
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:49,470
and green sanehat it and it you should

2392
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:50,550
use it and I'm a big believer that some

2393
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:52,590
of these things that might be a long

2394
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:54,420
term breakdown in a very very active

2395
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:56,039
microbial living soil might actually

2396
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:57,149
break down faster so who knows maybe

2397
01:23:56,039 --> 01:23:59,420
we're gonna learn more about that in the

2398
01:23:57,149 --> 01:24:01,529
future and double back on that but I

2399
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:03,600
don't like to get a rock dust that's

2400
01:24:01,529 --> 01:24:06,569
just potassium or just one direction and

2401
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,710
like you said is proven to take a number

2402
01:24:06,569 --> 01:24:10,380
of years to break down

2403
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:11,310
you like that the bad use of the space

2404
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,600
in that container

2405
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:14,640
I would rather add an ingredient that's

2406
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,930
gonna have more power and so that's just

2407
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,690
kind of how I looked at it I would

2408
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:20,400
rather use basalt it's got the

2409
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:23,189
paramagnetic energy it's got all of the

2410
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:24,750
micronutrients and there's a number of

2411
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:26,849
other ways to get potassium for instance

2412
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:29,149
from compost and I don't think that we

2413
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:31,260
need such a slow release form so I

2414
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:33,000
definitely don't believe in green sand

2415
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:34,800
but there's never a number of other

2416
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,210
ingredients that I'm surprised like

2417
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,590
there's a local buddy of mine that got

2418
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:39,989
basalt and instead of getting in rock

2419
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:42,000
dust he got gravel of basalt a larger

2420
01:24:39,988 --> 01:24:45,419
chunk of it he said after two years it

2421
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,310
was dawn anything a lot of microbes in

2422
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:48,569
his soil and so I'm just I'm thinking

2423
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,820
you know maybe it's not about just the

2424
01:24:48,569 --> 01:24:53,099
minerals but maybe the coenzyme factor

2425
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:54,509
the energy effect of just having those

2426
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,850
minerals there and the ability for the

2427
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:58,530
microbes to play off that energy I know

2428
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:59,940
if there's a Discovery Channel show you

2429
01:24:58,529 --> 01:25:01,529
can watch that's about the formulation

2430
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:04,229
of the earth and it talks about basalt

2431
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:06,149
and how the first organic substances

2432
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:08,488
were created at really high temperatures

2433
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:09,929
and it was something to do with the

2434
01:25:08,488 --> 01:25:12,059
energy of the rock and all the minerals

2435
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:14,489
there and there was this amino black

2436
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:16,380
substance organic life like created for

2437
01:25:14,488 --> 01:25:19,439
the first time and you know I don't

2438
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:20,760
obviously that's not something they're

2439
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:22,649
teaching in school and it's not like

2440
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:24,750
exactly this they're just talking

2441
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:27,179
generally but it still exists it's

2442
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:28,738
exciting enough to consider that you so

2443
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:30,719
maybe there's a possibility Green's hand

2444
01:25:28,738 --> 01:25:32,579
has some of that benefit but I feel like

2445
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,380
more more of it was a marketing ploy

2446
01:25:32,579 --> 01:25:36,479
based on the fact that at that time

2447
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:38,520
people do potassium was important and

2448
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:39,839
they had a mindful of it and so we've

2449
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:43,020
moved away from that and I don't see it

2450
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:45,690
as popular anymore yeah so just staying

2451
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:47,130
on that topic of basalt it's actually

2452
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:49,199
one that's a little more tricky to find

2453
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:52,199
in Australia as well as like things like

2454
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:54,269
glacial rock dust what would be your

2455
01:25:52,199 --> 01:25:56,189
recommendation for alternatives to these

2456
01:25:54,270 --> 01:26:00,960
ones is regular rock dust a good

2457
01:25:56,189 --> 01:26:03,899
replacement to glacial rock dust yeah

2458
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,699
well we've got rock dust I've found

2459
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:07,409
basalt is a little harder to find and

2460
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:11,269
I've never seen glacial rock dust

2461
01:26:07,409 --> 01:26:13,319
I just think rock dust would be fine

2462
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:14,340
it's weird you know you look at rock

2463
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:16,170
dust and all of a sudden you start to

2464
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,819
see like aluminum and you think oh my

2465
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:19,560
god I got to stay away from it but a lot

2466
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:21,238
of these alumina silicon a little bit of

2467
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,769
iron silicates they're just locked

2468
01:26:21,238 --> 01:26:25,109
this complex where most of the

2469
01:26:22,769 --> 01:26:26,760
micronutrients are the coenzymes that's

2470
01:26:25,109 --> 01:26:28,920
actually having effect and if you read a

2471
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,510
book that's free it's available on the

2472
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,130
internet called bread from stones they

2473
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:33,420
started with granite and have really

2474
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:34,800
good effect and I feel like in the

2475
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:36,359
United States if you're towards the East

2476
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,610
Coast probably go granite if you're in

2477
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:41,609
the West Coast probably a volcanic or

2478
01:26:38,609 --> 01:26:43,828
glacial and so here in Colorado we're

2479
01:26:41,609 --> 01:26:45,029
blessed with the where I live down the

2480
01:26:43,828 --> 01:26:45,779
street there's a Mesa it's called the

2481
01:26:45,029 --> 01:26:47,309
Grand Mesa

2482
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:48,748
we're the largest flat top mountains in

2483
01:26:47,309 --> 01:26:50,670
the United States maybe even the world

2484
01:26:48,748 --> 01:26:53,010
a few hundred lakes are on top of it and

2485
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:55,078
it's completely encapsulated by a basalt

2486
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:56,610
so for me it's just a no-brainer we just

2487
01:26:55,078 --> 01:26:57,960
go right there we get basalt it's got

2488
01:26:56,609 --> 01:27:00,719
all the benefits it's being talked about

2489
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:02,010
right now it's got all the energy that

2490
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:03,359
being said if I didn't have it and

2491
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:05,610
granite was right there I'd probably use

2492
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:08,399
it so I would look at what's locally

2493
01:27:05,609 --> 01:27:09,988
available a lot of times you can go down

2494
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:11,609
to a gravel production area and just get

2495
01:27:09,988 --> 01:27:16,259
some rock dust for free as their waste

2496
01:27:11,609 --> 01:27:17,908
product it's the 400 mesh it's like the

2497
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:19,739
powder they just can't do anything with

2498
01:27:17,908 --> 01:27:21,268
and you can use that as a rock dust if

2499
01:27:19,738 --> 01:27:22,678
you really wanted to you can send it off

2500
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:26,940
to a lab and get it test it and see if

2501
01:27:22,679 --> 01:27:28,920
there's anything toxic in it but for the

2502
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:30,029
most part if you go to remineralize org

2503
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,590
they really just talked about using

2504
01:27:30,029 --> 01:27:33,748
whatever rock dust is locally available

2505
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:36,510
in it having a remineralization effect

2506
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:38,639
on the soil and so I'm still trying to

2507
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:41,280
learn about that but for a while we used

2508
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:42,599
the glacial rock dust and now I'm really

2509
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:44,939
sticking with basalt and it makes a

2510
01:27:42,599 --> 01:27:48,869
great texture in our soil so that's

2511
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:50,908
that's where I'm at right now yep and so

2512
01:27:48,868 --> 01:27:52,498
when you're looking at just a general

2513
01:27:50,908 --> 01:27:56,279
soil or maybe more specifically a

2514
01:27:52,498 --> 01:27:58,408
compost do you think that like black is

2515
01:27:56,279 --> 01:28:00,090
better like that's the aim for a really

2516
01:27:58,408 --> 01:28:01,828
nice humic rich soil you should be

2517
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:04,469
looking to get it nice and dark or not

2518
01:28:01,828 --> 01:28:07,889
necessarily I don't know it always

2519
01:28:04,469 --> 01:28:09,149
depends you know rock dust a lot of

2520
01:28:07,889 --> 01:28:10,769
times we go there as we look at the

2521
01:28:09,149 --> 01:28:12,388
Earth's ability to remineralize itself

2522
01:28:10,769 --> 01:28:14,630
and in volcanic regions where that's

2523
01:28:12,389 --> 01:28:16,739
happened through lava we see a really

2524
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:19,650
increase in the nutrient density of

2525
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:21,598
crops and so if we look at that and from

2526
01:28:19,649 --> 01:28:23,219
the lava flow to a high canopy

2527
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:24,420
rainforest we find that there's a lot of

2528
01:28:23,219 --> 01:28:28,260
microbes involved in the beginning

2529
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:29,969
processes and so when we look at compost

2530
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,590
now we're not looking at minerals we're

2531
01:28:29,969 --> 01:28:33,569
looking at an organic matter and so to

2532
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:35,100
get the humic sinful vyx a lot of

2533
01:28:33,569 --> 01:28:36,750
premium compost like are all amount

2534
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:38,400
fish compost is broken down with

2535
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:41,039
hardwood and stuff that takes years to

2536
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:42,449
make and it does turn dark black that

2537
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:44,460
being said if you took a manure compost

2538
01:28:42,449 --> 01:28:46,590
that it was dark black I'd think that it

2539
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:48,329
was made in a few months I'm guessing it

2540
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:49,350
got way too hot and it was full of way

2541
01:28:48,329 --> 01:28:51,750
too many thermophiles

2542
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:53,010
and it just turned black and if you were

2543
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:54,300
to take a hundred percent grass

2544
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:56,010
clippings from your front yard and

2545
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:58,560
cotton from your front yard it'll turn

2546
01:28:56,010 --> 01:29:00,630
death black and smell nasty and that

2547
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,910
black is not a premium compost but it

2548
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:04,199
certainly turned black so it depends I

2549
01:29:02,909 --> 01:29:05,269
would always be asking you how it was

2550
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:09,779
made

2551
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:12,960
yep okay so how do you feel about using

2552
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:15,149
Bokashi as a soil amendment because I've

2553
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,189
seen it come up a lot lately but to me

2554
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:18,809
it kind of was initially ringing some

2555
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:20,519
alarm bells like the idea of like

2556
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:22,380
because Bo Kashi obviously wants an

2557
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:25,380
anaerobic environment but in your soil

2558
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:26,640
you want an aerobic environment so how

2559
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:28,470
does that kind of work are they not

2560
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,240
working against each other in a way oh

2561
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:31,770
no I used to think that they were

2562
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,880
working against each other I was scared

2563
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:34,290
of it then I saw people growing

2564
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,060
completely in aerobic Li with great

2565
01:29:34,289 --> 01:29:37,800
success and I thought [ __ ] this nature

2566
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:40,500
has more than one way to do things it's

2567
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,150
pretty crazy I mean you look at jus daun

2568
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,250
farming American tenant is that if it

2569
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:45,420
smells it doesn't matter you know we

2570
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,100
need to get over that we used to throat

2571
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:49,369
[ __ ] and blood and sticky stuff all over

2572
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:54,450
our farms and it worked great you know

2573
01:29:49,369 --> 01:29:55,739
when you look at other cultures too like

2574
01:29:54,449 --> 01:29:57,449
some of the Asian cultures farming for

2575
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:58,769
10,000 plus years without having any

2576
01:29:57,449 --> 01:30:00,599
issues and all of a sudden they adopt

2577
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:06,000
Western philosophies and they got major

2578
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:09,150
problems so yeah well I mean have you

2579
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,640
ever heard anyone who had looked into a

2580
01:30:09,149 --> 01:30:12,769
toyed with the idea of creating cannabis

2581
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:15,000
from humanure

2582
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:16,470
yeah I haven't people have done it I've

2583
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,930
even talked to a couple people that are

2584
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:20,520
in the outback there and they live and

2585
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:21,480
they've had composting toilets and

2586
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,190
they're more comfortable with the

2587
01:30:21,479 --> 01:30:24,500
process and their diet is good and

2588
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:26,699
they've been growing their own in it

2589
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,470
having that as a day-to-day conversation

2590
01:30:26,699 --> 01:30:30,119
with customers and talking about peeing

2591
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:32,280
for fertilizer and diluting with water

2592
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:34,470
and most of our diets aren't there I'm

2593
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:36,359
not totally comfortable with it from a

2594
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:37,829
permaculture perspective it makes sense

2595
01:30:36,359 --> 01:30:39,779
to close the loop and I think you could

2596
01:30:37,829 --> 01:30:41,130
successfully do it I think that the only

2597
01:30:39,779 --> 01:30:44,279
way I would do that was making a product

2598
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:46,230
that was been used and turned into

2599
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:48,000
compost and maybe grew another crop and

2600
01:30:46,229 --> 01:30:49,619
the back crop was used to make the

2601
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,840
post that I actually used I would have a

2602
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:52,979
couple layers between being that yeah

2603
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,329
but when you're looking at Bokashi

2604
01:30:52,979 --> 01:30:55,469
there's a couple different methods so

2605
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:57,449
for instance we talked about boss

2606
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:59,070
gassing that happens when composting if

2607
01:30:57,449 --> 01:31:00,689
it's done properly there really

2608
01:30:59,069 --> 01:31:03,449
shouldn't be a lot but it does take time

2609
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:05,779
so we're finding in tests that people

2610
01:31:03,449 --> 01:31:08,429
can Bokashi compost significantly faster

2611
01:31:05,779 --> 01:31:10,289
so for me I try not to say one's better

2612
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:12,270
than the other if I'd Bokashi composting

2613
01:31:10,289 --> 01:31:13,739
it could be a tool where in my kitchen

2614
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:15,270
when I used to do it more often it was

2615
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:16,829
because it was winter it's snowing out I

2616
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:18,240
don't have a thermo compost pile going

2617
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:20,789
and I have some food scraps I want to

2618
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:23,010
recycle so I open the bucket I put the

2619
01:31:20,789 --> 01:31:24,869
Bokashi and I'll use it but most people

2620
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:28,110
aren't using the Bokashi compost or the

2621
01:31:24,869 --> 01:31:29,849
Bokashi product as the actual fertilizer

2622
01:31:28,109 --> 01:31:31,769
I mean that could go get buried in your

2623
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:33,990
yard or processed through the worms or

2624
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:35,820
fed to the compost we're talking about

2625
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:38,399
using the actual Bokashi as a fertilizer

2626
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:40,710
and it does have a pretty good NPK so it

2627
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:42,359
can acts as a fertilizer the digitus

2628
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:43,980
microbes that are the microbes that are

2629
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:45,719
on it like the lactobacillus and things

2630
01:31:43,979 --> 01:31:47,069
they're actually Faculty of anaerobes so

2631
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:50,280
they don't have to have anaerobic

2632
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:52,710
environment to work and you know the

2633
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:58,019
lactic acid is certainly being a good

2634
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:59,310
decomposer so adding that in depending

2635
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:01,050
on who you're talking to if they might

2636
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:04,020
be making a soil from scratch and you

2637
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:05,789
want to out-compete a lot of times

2638
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:08,520
mixing it into a soil could be a good

2639
01:32:05,789 --> 01:32:10,409
idea and I've not seen a a problem from

2640
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,160
doing it when it's in the proper

2641
01:32:10,409 --> 01:32:13,260
proportion

2642
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:15,180
I personally don't mix it into my soil

2643
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:16,739
though I would use it only as a top

2644
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:19,020
dressing or I would use it for my

2645
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:20,760
Bokashi compost other people are using

2646
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:22,860
it for teas and so if anything what's

2647
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,780
exciting is that people are finding

2648
01:32:22,859 --> 01:32:26,009
benefit to it and it's working even in

2649
01:32:24,779 --> 01:32:27,599
the face of the fact that a few years

2650
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:29,100
ago I would have said anaerobic is gonna

2651
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,200
kill it all you just can't do that

2652
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,730
that's so I'm just a neighbor that it's

2653
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,829
like the complete opposite of what we

2654
01:32:32,729 --> 01:32:36,029
said actually still works and so I'm

2655
01:32:34,829 --> 01:32:38,399
just trying to learn from that right now

2656
01:32:36,029 --> 01:32:39,840
and what I found is that fermenting some

2657
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:44,129
of your own and fertilizers works pretty

2658
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:46,949
well and look how she has a place but

2659
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:49,109
it's not like a make-or-break must-have

2660
01:32:46,949 --> 01:32:50,909
item in my book I think that the

2661
01:32:49,109 --> 01:32:53,250
relationships that I've created with

2662
01:32:50,909 --> 01:32:55,920
people that like Bokashi keep me talking

2663
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:57,510
about it a lot but other than that if I

2664
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,699
absolutely had to have a few things it

2665
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:01,510
would just be some soil you know it's

2666
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:04,420
some compost I don't think the cost you

2667
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:05,920
number one item on there yeah so if

2668
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:08,020
someone was looking to get their own

2669
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:11,230
compost pile started whether it be

2670
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:14,740
through Bokashi or other means would you

2671
01:33:11,229 --> 01:33:16,299
recommend that will not recommend but do

2672
01:33:14,739 --> 01:33:18,819
you think that you could use both Kashi

2673
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:20,800
to kind of kickstart a compost pile like

2674
01:33:18,819 --> 01:33:23,049
my friends got this big compost pile and

2675
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:25,840
it's not that thermophilic but it is

2676
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:27,550
quite anaerobic and I tell him like you

2677
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,989
should consider throwing some Bokashi in

2678
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:30,699
the middle of that and it might really

2679
01:33:28,989 --> 01:33:32,859
kickstart things you think that's the

2680
01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:34,239
case or probably not I think you

2681
01:33:32,859 --> 01:33:35,859
probably would but you know I don't know

2682
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:37,210
if it's just gonna be from if you were

2683
01:33:35,859 --> 01:33:38,920
to just throw some grain in the pile it

2684
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:40,449
might be enough you know extra kick and

2685
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:42,310
nitrogen or whatever is required from

2686
01:33:40,449 --> 01:33:43,569
the scenes to kick-start that you know

2687
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:45,070
if you look if you go buy a product at

2688
01:33:43,569 --> 01:33:46,509
the store called compost starter you'll

2689
01:33:45,069 --> 01:33:48,489
flip up on the back and realize it's

2690
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:50,650
alfalfa meal crustacean meal it's just

2691
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:52,539
some you know some nitrogen having

2692
01:33:50,649 --> 01:33:53,710
materials in it that helps kick start

2693
01:33:52,539 --> 01:33:56,590
the process sometimes they'll have a

2694
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:57,699
little bacteria in it and what's neat is

2695
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:58,779
that there is the bacteria in it and

2696
01:33:57,699 --> 01:34:00,550
that's a lot of times what's considered

2697
01:33:58,779 --> 01:34:01,989
a starter so I think it'd be a great

2698
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:03,369
place to start and here's the great

2699
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:04,840
thing if it doesn't work it's not gonna

2700
01:34:03,369 --> 01:34:06,909
hurt anything

2701
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,289
that being said most of the people that

2702
01:34:06,909 --> 01:34:09,609
are doing thermophilic compost they're

2703
01:34:08,289 --> 01:34:11,800
not including Bokashi now they're

2704
01:34:09,609 --> 01:34:13,539
keeping them separate on my property

2705
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,460
I'll dump the Bokashi right on my thermo

2706
01:34:13,539 --> 01:34:17,829
compost but I still considered a thermo

2707
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:20,289
compost I'm not Bokashi in the process

2708
01:34:17,829 --> 01:34:23,529
they're separate from each other yeah

2709
01:34:20,289 --> 01:34:25,479
and so if someone did want to say start

2710
01:34:23,529 --> 01:34:27,609
their own compost pile whether it be you

2711
01:34:25,479 --> 01:34:30,009
know quite cooking their soil and just

2712
01:34:27,609 --> 01:34:31,149
for anyone who's not aware I appreciate

2713
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:33,159
Ronnie's but you know whenever like

2714
01:34:31,149 --> 01:34:36,399
someone like sub cool says cooking soil

2715
01:34:33,159 --> 01:34:37,479
like they really just mean composting so

2716
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:39,009
if someone was to start their own

2717
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:40,719
compost pile and make either the Cootes

2718
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:43,780
mix or the supersoul how long would you

2719
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:46,900
recommend composting at four and would

2720
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:48,609
you recommend turning it regularly I mix

2721
01:34:46,899 --> 01:34:49,750
it and plant directly into it I mean

2722
01:34:48,609 --> 01:34:52,089
we're putting very small amounts of

2723
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:53,800
inputs premium compost where most of our

2724
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:55,300
initial nutrients are coming from peat

2725
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:57,220
moss and aeration there's no reason to

2726
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:58,720
cook it when you make a super soil and

2727
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:59,949
you add tons of nutrients out of

2728
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,260
proportion that need to be kind of

2729
01:34:59,949 --> 01:35:04,239
homogenized he's the word I like to use

2730
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:06,789
into the mix it makes a ton of sense to

2731
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:08,679
moisten it and to let it sit to turn it

2732
01:35:06,789 --> 01:35:10,060
and the reason why is the inside of the

2733
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:11,530
pile is gonna get hot and the outside is

2734
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:12,940
going to stay cool so when you turn it

2735
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:14,000
it puts the cool part back into the

2736
01:35:12,939 --> 01:35:16,309
inside and make sure that it

2737
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,539
all homogenized evenly and once it cools

2738
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:19,310
back down you know that it's not going

2739
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:21,470
to go thermal and burn your plants and

2740
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:23,000
if there wasn't excess and some

2741
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:24,590
nutrients that needed to be released by

2742
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,800
the bacteria that process has now

2743
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:30,829
happened when we get above 200 gallons

2744
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:32,090
per container even in a kootz mix I want

2745
01:35:30,829 --> 01:35:32,989
to let it sit at least a week or two and

2746
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:35,210
see what the temperatures look like

2747
01:35:32,989 --> 01:35:37,010
because even a basic recipe can go

2748
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:38,899
thermal if it's in enough volume that's

2749
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:41,030
why making your own compost at home is

2750
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:43,849
typically a minimum three by three by

2751
01:35:41,029 --> 01:35:45,529
three pile another reason why Bokashi is

2752
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:47,120
popular is because most people don't

2753
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:49,099
have enough waste to make a three by

2754
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:50,869
three by three pile and so they end up

2755
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:52,610
doing cold composting that takes years

2756
01:35:50,869 --> 01:35:54,199
or a tumbler and it's not as good as

2757
01:35:52,609 --> 01:35:56,179
thermal compost and so then they have

2758
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:59,809
them seed sprouting and have flies in it

2759
01:35:56,180 --> 01:36:01,280
and larva and bugs and so everybody's

2760
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:02,570
gonna determine what's most important

2761
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:03,739
from him you're just growing vegetables

2762
01:36:02,569 --> 01:36:05,420
on the field if you're throwing it on

2763
01:36:03,739 --> 01:36:07,519
the lawn it could be called compost it

2764
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:09,319
could be Prakash e2b anything if it's

2765
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,760
going in your prized plant that's actual

2766
01:36:09,319 --> 01:36:12,829
medicine for a disease you're trying to

2767
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,930
fight in your one indoor grow that

2768
01:36:12,829 --> 01:36:16,399
you're paying electricity for you might

2769
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:20,000
get a lot more specific about what's

2770
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:22,189
going in there so so on a question

2771
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,439
that's maybe a little left of field have

2772
01:36:22,189 --> 01:36:27,589
you ever heard from maybe a customer or

2773
01:36:24,439 --> 01:36:31,039
just friends that using certain

2774
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:32,390
amendments is able to really alter the

2775
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:33,829
properties of the cannabis and I mean

2776
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:35,390
more so than just say like if it was

2777
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:36,800
deficient then then you give it a

2778
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:38,510
suitable environment obviously it's

2779
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,579
gonna come out different but like the

2780
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:42,890
specific example I've been told of is I

2781
01:36:40,579 --> 01:36:44,960
know someone and they grow these really

2782
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:47,720
skunky strains and they said that when

2783
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:49,970
they use more sulfur amendments in their

2784
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:51,230
soil it can really make those skunky

2785
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:53,210
smells come out because they're

2786
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:54,919
typically characterized by those thiols

2787
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:56,420
sulfur groups do you think there's any

2788
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:59,000
truth in this or maybe it's just a bit

2789
01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:00,289
anecdotal no I think it's totally true

2790
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,520
and what we need to look at is the

2791
01:37:00,289 --> 01:37:03,199
building blocks and when we're talking

2792
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,060
terpenes terpenoids that have our

2793
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:07,010
flavors we're talking carbon and

2794
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:08,450
hydrogen or carbon hydrogen and oxygen

2795
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:09,739
and you look at what goes into the

2796
01:37:08,449 --> 01:37:11,059
building blocks of that and you start to

2797
01:37:09,739 --> 01:37:13,369
find that sulfur is actually a big part

2798
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:14,780
of that creation process and so you

2799
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:16,489
don't know well that makes sense okay

2800
01:37:14,779 --> 01:37:18,710
it's not just that sulfur is aromatic

2801
01:37:16,489 --> 01:37:20,920
but it actually might be a key part in

2802
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:22,730
the process of these secondary

2803
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,199
components that actually provide that

2804
01:37:22,729 --> 01:37:26,679
smell and what I've noticed is that

2805
01:37:24,199 --> 01:37:28,989
that's that taste

2806
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:31,119
smell translation - and there's two

2807
01:37:28,989 --> 01:37:32,920
components complex organics Burnette and

2808
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:35,260
the sulfur brings that and having both I

2809
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:36,789
think gives them both so for a while in

2810
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:38,710
hydro if you had a little guano that's

2811
01:37:36,789 --> 01:37:40,390
where that smell came from but either

2812
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:41,949
the best just the organic part when you

2813
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:43,510
add the sulfur the organics and all of

2814
01:37:41,949 --> 01:37:46,630
it you get that taste to smell

2815
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:48,070
translation and I'm a big believer in

2816
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:49,810
sulfur as a part of that in fact our

2817
01:37:48,069 --> 01:37:52,149
soil has about twice the recommended

2818
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:54,250
sulfur amount for two reasons one it

2819
01:37:52,149 --> 01:37:56,139
keeps the nutrients inflow and the other

2820
01:37:54,250 --> 01:38:00,760
one is is really because of that flavor

2821
01:37:56,140 --> 01:38:02,350
aspect fantastic so another one which is

2822
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:03,940
kind of like soulful where like maybe

2823
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:06,370
some people use it some people don't

2824
01:38:03,939 --> 01:38:08,739
how do you feel about biochar you know

2825
01:38:06,369 --> 01:38:10,180
I've got a friend who swears by it but

2826
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:12,010
I've got a lot of other friends we don't

2827
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:14,380
even know what it is what do you think

2828
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:15,909
about it it's an all our soil at five

2829
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:17,800
percent I found enough benefit through

2830
01:38:15,909 --> 01:38:19,930
researching Terra Preta and biochar and

2831
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:21,460
all that to find a benefit and it's

2832
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:23,710
really interesting I've got our worm

2833
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:25,510
casting producer they just got a new

2834
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:28,500
facility they've got massive indoor

2835
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:30,369
space and they go do a really good job

2836
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:31,659
but one of the things they notice is

2837
01:38:30,369 --> 01:38:34,689
that they were doing a lot of farm

2838
01:38:31,659 --> 01:38:37,269
trials and they had a number of studies

2839
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:39,729
one of them in particular was a growing

2840
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:41,410
elephant grass and it was like 11 foot

2841
01:38:39,729 --> 01:38:43,089
tall grass and I think it the seeds are

2842
01:38:41,409 --> 01:38:45,279
something created like biofuel and it

2843
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:48,460
was popular for a while to use organic

2844
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:50,800
feeds our fermented feeds and stuff like

2845
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:53,500
that and create biofuel and you get

2846
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,820
grants for it whatever so they hired the

2847
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,960
worm casting producer to come out there

2848
01:38:54,819 --> 01:38:57,579
and talk to him about increasing

2849
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:59,260
production and one of the things they

2850
01:38:57,579 --> 01:39:00,970
were looking at was nodules on the root

2851
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:03,100
zone and each one could be removed and

2852
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:04,180
grow another plant and no matter what

2853
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,740
they did the best they could come up

2854
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:07,570
with with all the synthetic fertilizers

2855
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:10,840
and nitrates were about four to five

2856
01:39:07,569 --> 01:39:14,259
nodules per plant and they invited our

2857
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:16,480
worm casting guy out he put 50% worm

2858
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:18,579
castings that he made in 50% biochar

2859
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:21,399
about the size of a rice whole that kind

2860
01:39:18,579 --> 01:39:23,710
of texture fifty-fifty and he put a cup

2861
01:39:21,399 --> 01:39:26,679
next to each little planting site and

2862
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:29,369
they were getting 50 to 60 nodules on

2863
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:32,560
those plants it's significant multiple

2864
01:39:29,369 --> 01:39:33,729
hundred thousand percent increase with

2865
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,500
corn they did the same thing a little

2866
01:39:33,729 --> 01:39:36,819
biochar little castings and they were

2867
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:39,520
able to get that third or fourth year

2868
01:39:36,819 --> 01:39:40,179
corn that really increased a 33%

2869
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,590
increase

2870
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:43,090
yield across that sweet corn that was

2871
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:46,270
taken to market at a high dollar price

2872
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:48,100
so the biochar for some reasons seemed

2873
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:49,570
to be a key link and adding that organic

2874
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:50,890
matter that couldn't be instantly added

2875
01:39:49,569 --> 01:39:52,989
to the field that sequestered carbon

2876
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:55,210
they've been behind nitrogen worm

2877
01:39:52,989 --> 01:39:59,079
castings next to it balance the two out

2878
01:39:55,210 --> 01:40:02,380
and when it was done at planting it had

2879
01:39:59,079 --> 01:40:03,970
altered the trajectory enough whereby by

2880
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:06,069
the time it was yielding there was a big

2881
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:08,470
difference here's the problem we're

2882
01:40:06,069 --> 01:40:10,329
facing our soils are already built how

2883
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:11,800
the castings have the compost the cec

2884
01:40:10,329 --> 01:40:15,550
all the nutrients and now we're gonna

2885
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:17,920
add biochar and so we won't notice as

2886
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:19,630
significant as an impact in a situation

2887
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,609
like that because it can't impart as

2888
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:23,650
much with luxury on the such a special

2889
01:40:21,609 --> 01:40:25,269
soil we're in a native soil devoid of

2890
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:27,250
everything it acts as a little sponge

2891
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:30,400
slow real slowly releasing the benefits

2892
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:33,310
to the plant next to it so I believe in

2893
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:34,359
biochar but like squeezing a sponge if

2894
01:40:33,310 --> 01:40:36,550
you were to put that in your soil look

2895
01:40:34,359 --> 01:40:39,089
and soak up some of the goodies people

2896
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:41,289
are pre charging their biochar with

2897
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:44,680
bacteria and with nitrogen and things

2898
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:46,659
and for the cost of it and the fact it

2899
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:48,700
has all that carbon I see no reason not

2900
01:40:46,659 --> 01:40:50,590
to do it I really like using it but I

2901
01:40:48,699 --> 01:40:52,210
didn't notice it double my yield or

2902
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:54,279
anything silly like that it will hold

2903
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:55,720
five times its weight in water so be

2904
01:40:54,279 --> 01:40:58,090
careful if you want to use biochar as a

2905
01:40:55,720 --> 01:41:00,970
aeration of it but it can't act as one

2906
01:40:58,090 --> 01:41:03,909
but it can also hold a lot of water yeah

2907
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:06,280
so um so I guess maybe what you the rule

2908
01:41:03,909 --> 01:41:10,269
of thumb is that like the the better the

2909
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:11,559
soil the the less effect it has yeah but

2910
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:13,150
here's the other thing too we're looking

2911
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:14,830
at water filtering and we're looking at

2912
01:41:13,149 --> 01:41:16,659
heavy metals we're looking at all these

2913
01:41:14,829 --> 01:41:18,970
different properties that a soil might

2914
01:41:16,659 --> 01:41:20,680
take any consideration and alternate

2915
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:22,930
uses for these products like pumice is

2916
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:26,260
used in beauty products as used in water

2917
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:27,369
filters so as biochar so adding these

2918
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,930
things to our filter that could

2919
01:41:27,369 --> 01:41:31,239
potentially filter out heavy metals or

2920
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:33,670
be a part of that complex of increased

2921
01:41:31,239 --> 01:41:35,079
cation exchange this is always a benefit

2922
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,579
and so if you're going to add a little

2923
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:38,649
bit of clay and a little bit of biochar

2924
01:41:36,579 --> 01:41:40,689
I feel like your soil is going to have a

2925
01:41:38,649 --> 01:41:42,789
higher CEC we talked about the beginning

2926
01:41:40,689 --> 01:41:44,319
of this that having that CEC higher

2927
01:41:42,789 --> 01:41:46,180
means you can hold more nutrients which

2928
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:48,399
means you can go longer without having

2929
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:50,200
additional inputs which means that a

2930
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:53,159
smaller container of soil should perform

2931
01:41:50,199 --> 01:41:54,659
better yeah so

2932
01:41:53,159 --> 01:41:57,960
so instantly we've seen a bit of a

2933
01:41:54,659 --> 01:42:00,510
movement to replace perlite with some

2934
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:02,550
alternative aeration amendments as we've

2935
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:05,100
been talking about do you think that the

2936
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:08,310
the buckwheat hole is a good suitable

2937
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:09,600
replacement for that I don't know and I

2938
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:11,960
only say that because I bought buckwheat

2939
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,370
hole they were available locally as a

2940
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:17,460
natural alternative to stuffing pillows

2941
01:42:14,369 --> 01:42:19,349
with and so that's what they're used for

2942
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:21,510
I bought some I mixed it in a soil and I

2943
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:22,800
had the worst nitrogen robbing I've ever

2944
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:24,420
experienced everything was yellow

2945
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:28,079
couldn't get nitrogen to save my life

2946
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:30,119
and so I I don't know if that was just

2947
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:35,189
my batch I just never went back to it I

2948
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:37,109
didn't give it a fair shot and I think

2949
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:38,309
that if it was maybe compost at first it

2950
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:41,309
could have an effect but I'm using rice

2951
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:45,150
hulls and those have been sterilized and

2952
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:46,590
they work fantastic the problem that the

2953
01:42:45,149 --> 01:42:48,179
rice whole industry faced was that on

2954
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:50,610
greenhouse and large scale in very small

2955
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:52,110
containers the rice whole company had

2956
01:42:50,609 --> 01:42:54,089
too high of a percentage of viable rice

2957
01:42:52,109 --> 01:42:55,829
seed they germinated fermented and

2958
01:42:54,090 --> 01:42:58,050
caused anaerobic conditions and killed

2959
01:42:55,829 --> 01:42:59,579
entire greenhouses and so they had to

2960
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:01,440
put conditions in place to make sure

2961
01:42:59,579 --> 01:43:03,600
they knew that how much seed was viable

2962
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:05,250
in it you know if it was clean if it had

2963
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,810
chemicals on it and so now a lot of

2964
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:10,140
testings done we can get great rice

2965
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:11,730
holes where the other holes we were

2966
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:13,590
talking about the buckwheat I don't know

2967
01:43:11,729 --> 01:43:14,819
if they're gonna Rob nitrogen and I

2968
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:16,350
don't know how they're grown and all

2969
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:18,299
that enough to tell you if that's you

2970
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:20,130
know really gonna be the next go-to so I

2971
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:21,630
would just research and see on

2972
01:43:20,130 --> 01:43:23,640
small-scale mix it up and see how it

2973
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:24,810
works for you yeah I'd be adding

2974
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:27,240
nitrogen for sure

2975
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:30,420
so in general do you want to move away

2976
01:43:27,239 --> 01:43:32,010
from the perlite I do I've never used

2977
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,340
the perlite since I've started build a

2978
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:34,619
soil

2979
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:37,079
we use pumice which looks similar but

2980
01:43:34,619 --> 01:43:38,279
it's actually just mined as is and

2981
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:39,859
doesn't have to have energy required

2982
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:42,359
into expanding it to look that way

2983
01:43:39,859 --> 01:43:47,250
pumice will actually float in water but

2984
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:48,359
it's a lot heavier than perlite and if

2985
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:49,800
you're on a farm you can buy some

2986
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:51,359
comments make a water filter that would

2987
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:54,750
be you know at least a little bit better

2988
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:56,579
than not so it has a lot of benefits it

2989
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:58,439
works really good in our soil so I like

2990
01:43:56,579 --> 01:43:59,850
using pumice we use a mixture of pumice

2991
01:43:58,439 --> 01:44:01,559
and the rice hulls the rice hulls are

2992
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:03,360
really high in silica so they take a

2993
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:04,440
while to break down I think the

2994
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:06,750
buckwheat holes would probably break

2995
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:07,099
down a lot faster that's why we use the

2996
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:08,779
rice

2997
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:10,070
they also do have the celica so if

2998
01:44:08,779 --> 01:44:12,139
you've got those available and look at

2999
01:44:10,069 --> 01:44:13,849
it other than that I know people who use

3000
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:15,800
peat gravel so I'm sure you can replace

3001
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:17,480
it with something but in a one gallon

3002
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,279
container perlite has some very unique

3003
01:44:17,479 --> 01:44:21,409
properties that will really be dialed in

3004
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:23,149
so it may not be a one-to-one

3005
01:44:21,409 --> 01:44:24,680
replacement you may not have to relearn

3006
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:26,750
how to water your soil on how to work

3007
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:30,950
with it if you find something that isn't

3008
01:44:26,750 --> 01:44:34,430
as ideal as pumice or rice hulls yeah so

3009
01:44:30,949 --> 01:44:37,189
it can't be done yeah cool so how do you

3010
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:39,050
feel about um people who I keep bringing

3011
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:40,399
him up I'm the Rev you know and the

3012
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:41,420
reason why I bring the Rev up Pilates is

3013
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:42,649
because he was actually one of the

3014
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:44,149
people who initially got me into

3015
01:44:42,649 --> 01:44:49,699
organics thank you very much for that

3016
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:51,349
the Rev but you are really cool and so

3017
01:44:49,699 --> 01:44:54,079
one of the things he advocates really

3018
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:57,500
strongly is that you use AA road water

3019
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:59,659
now for me I found this to be like a bit

3020
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:01,039
of a long term annoyance because you

3021
01:44:59,659 --> 01:45:05,359
have to then supplement with your

3022
01:45:01,039 --> 01:45:07,130
calcium sometimes but I found that my

3023
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:10,369
tap water is like it's got like just the

3024
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:11,690
perfect amount of calcium in it and but

3025
01:45:10,369 --> 01:45:12,739
he would say you know we know the

3026
01:45:11,689 --> 01:45:14,779
chlorine in the world is gonna be

3027
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:16,939
detrimental to the micro life but I've

3028
01:45:14,779 --> 01:45:18,769
always thought well you know if I use a

3029
01:45:16,939 --> 01:45:21,529
little bit of micronutrient to boost

3030
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:23,360
those numbers of my microbes its kind of

3031
01:45:21,529 --> 01:45:25,579
countering it out and it's just really

3032
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:27,289
easy to just use tap water are you of

3033
01:45:25,579 --> 01:45:29,329
the same mindset or do you think no it's

3034
01:45:27,289 --> 01:45:30,680
really got to be ro because I mean you

3035
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:32,210
know God bless the Rebbe he's very

3036
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:33,800
strict on this you know he said that you

3037
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:35,480
know if you can't get RO water don't

3038
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:37,250
bother and I thought that was a bit of a

3039
01:45:35,479 --> 01:45:40,549
you know maybe there's not so much truth

3040
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:42,229
to that yeah we'd never use RO water I

3041
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:46,820
grew up using our old water it was in my

3042
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:48,469
house and long story short I ended up

3043
01:45:46,819 --> 01:45:50,359
getting involved in this company through

3044
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:51,829
a few friends that was a short period of

3045
01:45:50,359 --> 01:45:53,719
my life and I really just used the

3046
01:45:51,829 --> 01:45:56,930
product but that a sales opportunity and

3047
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:58,789
they sold a product that made alkaline

3048
01:45:56,930 --> 01:46:00,230
water and so it caused you to do a ton

3049
01:45:58,789 --> 01:46:02,840
of research on the properties of water

3050
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:04,909
and all this different stuff and it was

3051
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:07,310
called a kangen and magic water machine

3052
01:46:04,909 --> 01:46:10,300
it was like 9.5 pH water you can push a

3053
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:12,350
button make 5.5 pH water and it used

3054
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:15,110
electricity and some other things to do

3055
01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:16,160
that if I was really cool and turns out

3056
01:46:15,109 --> 01:46:18,199
there's some health benefits to the

3057
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:19,828
actual antioxidant property of some of

3058
01:46:18,199 --> 01:46:21,510
that water but

3059
01:46:19,828 --> 01:46:23,519
when I looked into it that company

3060
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:24,809
called ro water dead water they said the

3061
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,460
Japanese referred to his dead water

3062
01:46:24,809 --> 01:46:27,779
completely mineral devoid you put it in

3063
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:29,039
your body it's actually gonna suck stuff

3064
01:46:27,779 --> 01:46:31,078
out into it instead of the other way

3065
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:32,760
around and it's not found in nature that

3066
01:46:31,078 --> 01:46:33,118
way and so I started thinking about it a

3067
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,159
night

3068
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:36,719
since haven't been using oral water and

3069
01:46:35,158 --> 01:46:37,618
the same thing is true in a garden you

3070
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:39,029
find that people have to supplement

3071
01:46:37,618 --> 01:46:41,308
sometimes with it it can potentially

3072
01:46:39,029 --> 01:46:42,630
leach I think if you already were paying

3073
01:46:41,309 --> 01:46:44,400
for all water and it's the only thing

3074
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:46,618
you could use I would consider using it

3075
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:49,229
other than that I would never pay for it

3076
01:46:46,618 --> 01:46:50,908
because it's a waste you know there's no

3077
01:46:49,229 --> 01:46:52,919
RO system that doesn't waste water and

3078
01:46:50,908 --> 01:46:54,328
if you're using all of your waste water

3079
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,590
and filtering it back again you're gonna

3080
01:46:54,328 --> 01:46:58,319
go through those expensive filters

3081
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:59,940
fairly quickly and so how our water

3082
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:01,859
works is it takes all the bad stuff it

3083
01:46:59,939 --> 01:47:03,808
puts it in you know waste in the waste

3084
01:47:01,859 --> 01:47:05,250
water and you throw that away the other

3085
01:47:03,809 --> 01:47:07,110
water is the good water so it's kind of

3086
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:08,368
splitting the good from the bad I'd

3087
01:47:07,109 --> 01:47:11,098
rather just filter it and keep the

3088
01:47:08,368 --> 01:47:13,380
contaminant and even above that if you

3089
01:47:11,099 --> 01:47:14,940
don't have a great filter just like you

3090
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:16,800
found chlorines never hurt my grow I

3091
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:18,868
used the hose on tons of grows and not

3092
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,610
caused the detriment using the mulch

3093
01:47:18,868 --> 01:47:22,769
layer having the organic matter in that

3094
01:47:20,609 --> 01:47:24,988
top that actually hits that chlorine and

3095
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:26,849
turns it and breaks it apart and off

3096
01:47:24,988 --> 01:47:28,589
gases it you can bubble the water to get

3097
01:47:26,849 --> 01:47:30,630
the chlorine out if it has chloramine

3098
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:32,969
it's been proven to bind to organic

3099
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:34,590
matter so some people use like vitamin C

3100
01:47:32,969 --> 01:47:36,420
or use a little worm castings or

3101
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:38,880
whatever they have that's affordable to

3102
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:40,739
actually bind to that chlorine and get

3103
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,929
rid of it so I wouldn't go waste money

3104
01:47:40,738 --> 01:47:45,419
on a big RO water thing I prefer to just

3105
01:47:42,929 --> 01:47:46,949
use tap water if your water is good and

3106
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:48,868
if it's got a ton of chlorine in it for

3107
01:47:46,948 --> 01:47:50,279
some reason you're worried about it you

3108
01:47:48,868 --> 01:47:51,808
could put some organic matter in that or

3109
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:54,590
bubble it for a day and then use it and

3110
01:47:51,809 --> 01:47:57,150
I think you'll have a great results yeah

3111
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:59,760
so have you ever looked seriously in

3112
01:47:57,149 --> 01:48:03,238
actually aquaponic cannabis and is it

3113
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:05,780
something you'd want to pursue more no I

3114
01:48:03,238 --> 01:48:09,209
haven't looked seriously in it enough to

3115
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:10,649
really talk intelligently about it and I

3116
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:12,300
probably should do some more research

3117
01:48:10,649 --> 01:48:13,920
but I'm just turned off initially by the

3118
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:15,300
fact that I need electricity and pumps

3119
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,340
and containers and I'm gonna raise fish

3120
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:19,860
in this little pond and it seems to me

3121
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:21,869
like it's more of an idea of how to have

3122
01:48:19,859 --> 01:48:23,279
more profit on a smaller square foot by

3123
01:48:21,868 --> 01:48:25,979
raising protein at the same time as

3124
01:48:23,279 --> 01:48:27,420
plants to me that's not my ideal my deal

3125
01:48:25,979 --> 01:48:29,339
is to have the best plant regardless of

3126
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:31,679
what happens secondarily to that and so

3127
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:33,090
that's not my main motive also speaking

3128
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:33,500
with like the local college they'll come

3129
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,569
down and

3130
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:37,100
worked with the college in Gunnison with

3131
01:48:35,569 --> 01:48:38,779
their agricultural department doing some

3132
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:41,539
education with some of their students

3133
01:48:38,779 --> 01:48:42,559
and they had an aquaponic setup and I

3134
01:48:41,539 --> 01:48:43,760
said what's your favorite part about it

3135
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,350
they said well the kids love it

3136
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,060
other than that I didn't have a huge

3137
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:49,070
answer for why it was so important and

3138
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:52,010
so some growers haven't really found

3139
01:48:49,069 --> 01:48:55,519
great ways to even cultivate cannabis in

3140
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:58,460
that method as far as aquaponic but I've

3141
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,780
not seen it done properly usually the

3142
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:01,279
nutrients that the cannabis needs are

3143
01:48:59,779 --> 01:49:03,050
too intense for the fish and you have to

3144
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:04,039
have bio filters and plants growing and

3145
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:07,310
all these other things to make it work

3146
01:49:04,039 --> 01:49:09,079
so to me is the ultimate complication of

3147
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:10,190
what could be simple I can go fish in

3148
01:49:09,079 --> 01:49:11,809
the lake I can grow my food in the

3149
01:49:10,189 --> 01:49:14,239
ground and I can go spend the rest of my

3150
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:16,160
time having fun of tinkering with a

3151
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:18,829
hybrid combination of the both of them

3152
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:20,210
but I know that there's gonna be a

3153
01:49:18,829 --> 01:49:21,920
couple people that'll do some amazing

3154
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:23,689
things with aquaponics and areas where

3155
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,909
the land is awful there's no fish to

3156
01:49:23,689 --> 01:49:28,579
fish and there's going to be a purpose

3157
01:49:25,909 --> 01:49:29,899
for it and it'll have a place to be it's

3158
01:49:28,579 --> 01:49:31,550
not the ideal like we don't live on the

3159
01:49:29,899 --> 01:49:35,659
moon yet and I don't need to do it that

3160
01:49:31,550 --> 01:49:37,039
way so yeah so this is gonna be the one

3161
01:49:35,659 --> 01:49:40,189
question that's gonna be a little bit

3162
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:42,680
biased towards synthetics but here we go

3163
01:49:40,189 --> 01:49:45,349
what's the one thing or maybe even a few

3164
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:47,960
things you would give to synthetics that

3165
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:50,510
they have over organics or if if maybe

3166
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,800
you don't want to concede that was the

3167
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:55,150
one thing about organics you would

3168
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:56,750
change what you know from a permaculture

3169
01:49:55,149 --> 01:49:58,250
perspective one of the things that's

3170
01:49:56,750 --> 01:50:00,319
unique is well come up with like um

3171
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:01,850
there's one I forget the MIT Linder I

3172
01:50:00,319 --> 01:50:03,710
forget the guys name there's a method

3173
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:04,670
where you just bring the minerals to

3174
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:07,010
your garden and you can produce

3175
01:50:04,670 --> 01:50:09,050
phenomenal results and their argument is

3176
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:10,730
that if you know in times hit a few of

3177
01:50:09,050 --> 01:50:12,529
these small bags of mine you know

3178
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:14,449
synthetic minerals so to speak or

3179
01:50:12,529 --> 01:50:15,889
minerals without the carbon in it they

3180
01:50:14,449 --> 01:50:17,359
could be your fastest way to produce on

3181
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:20,900
the farm and so they've kind of got that

3182
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:23,029
beat rather than having a constantly you

3183
01:50:20,899 --> 01:50:24,319
know work the farm have it always there

3184
01:50:23,029 --> 01:50:26,569
and working so that if [ __ ] hits the fan

3185
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:28,069
you can go produce some food and so they

3186
01:50:26,569 --> 01:50:29,899
have that a little bit of like startup

3187
01:50:28,069 --> 01:50:31,130
right first year I can just go throw out

3188
01:50:29,899 --> 01:50:32,750
some hydroponics be growing and

3189
01:50:31,130 --> 01:50:34,550
harvesting mediately but if I need to

3190
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:36,680
turn an acre of clay soil into good soil

3191
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:37,760
it might take me a while the ultimate

3192
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:39,140
benefit is though that the soils going

3193
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,850
to be there for you forever and give

3194
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:43,970
back and be a lot better investment and

3195
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:45,320
so then when you look at permaculture

3196
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:47,060
and you start talking about these guys

3197
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:48,670
that can dial in nutrition and use

3198
01:50:47,060 --> 01:50:50,990
minerals and it's so much better you

3199
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:52,579
start to look at how permaculture can

3200
01:50:50,989 --> 01:50:54,590
actually create whether it's just

3201
01:50:52,579 --> 01:50:56,989
there's a question of whether the rain

3202
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:59,119
came first or the trees came first and I

3203
01:50:56,989 --> 01:51:00,619
believe the trees came first then I

3204
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:02,539
started to attract the clouds through

3205
01:51:00,619 --> 01:51:04,460
their atmosphere that they create and

3206
01:51:02,539 --> 01:51:06,130
Matt creates the rain that creates more

3207
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:10,369
plants and more of an ecosystem and so

3208
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:12,170
ultimately from permaculture organics is

3209
01:51:10,369 --> 01:51:14,569
going to be the ultimate and will create

3210
01:51:12,170 --> 01:51:15,920
ecosystems but in between there we're

3211
01:51:14,569 --> 01:51:18,380
going to have to use all these other

3212
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,480
systems to help get there and well from

3213
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:22,279
managing resources it's going to be

3214
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:24,109
important to move resources from one

3215
01:51:22,279 --> 01:51:25,369
area to another to start these farms and

3216
01:51:24,109 --> 01:51:27,739
that's where some of these synthetic

3217
01:51:25,369 --> 01:51:31,039
processes can have an advantage but when

3218
01:51:27,739 --> 01:51:32,539
you look at the 35-year farm trials the

3219
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:34,430
data is there that organic is gonna be

3220
01:51:32,539 --> 01:51:36,829
the best and so I think that in the long

3221
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:38,030
term organics will always win these

3222
01:51:36,829 --> 01:51:41,000
synthetics have these short-term

3223
01:51:38,029 --> 01:51:43,670
advantages where I feel like we really

3224
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,439
got duped but if we're aware that they

3225
01:51:43,670 --> 01:51:46,819
are just short-term and have other plans

3226
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:49,219
in place there might be some leverage

3227
01:51:46,819 --> 01:51:50,539
their leverage I'm not really willing to

3228
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:53,539
play with but I feel like a lot of

3229
01:51:50,539 --> 01:51:55,550
people will interestingly enough on that

3230
01:51:53,539 --> 01:51:58,670
thirty five-year farm report that Rodale

3231
01:51:55,550 --> 01:52:02,119
does the least performing corn crop was

3232
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:04,340
actually on the conventional no-till so

3233
01:52:02,119 --> 01:52:07,159
incorporating both the synthetic and the

3234
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:07,550
non was the worst kind of kind of

3235
01:52:07,159 --> 01:52:10,430
interesting

3236
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:12,199
mmm yeah so I mean staying on that idea

3237
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:14,450
of like how you've got to put the time

3238
01:52:12,199 --> 01:52:16,699
and the kind of your time investment

3239
01:52:14,449 --> 01:52:19,059
into organics how do you feel about the

3240
01:52:16,699 --> 01:52:21,649
statements like would you agree with

3241
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:24,440
organic gardening requires forethought

3242
01:52:21,649 --> 01:52:26,689
and preparation however is multitudes of

3243
01:52:24,439 --> 01:52:29,539
factor easier cheaper and yields a

3244
01:52:26,689 --> 01:52:32,000
better product yep yep and that's the

3245
01:52:29,539 --> 01:52:33,289
thing it's the key pieces it tends to

3246
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,970
attract an audience that's a little bit

3247
01:52:33,289 --> 01:52:37,010
more mature because they're considering

3248
01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:38,990
you know planning pre-planning thinking

3249
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:42,289
ahead how it impacts other things in

3250
01:52:38,989 --> 01:52:44,719
their lives and there hasn't been a very

3251
01:52:42,289 --> 01:52:48,800
profitable system to enable a brand new

3252
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:51,380
person to start organically and so it's

3253
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,560
just faster so you know I agree with

3254
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:53,329
that

3255
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:55,490
organics better but it just has a little

3256
01:52:53,329 --> 01:52:56,720
bit more of forethought pre-planning and

3257
01:52:55,489 --> 01:52:58,609
then you know the other thing that I

3258
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:59,480
find a bit of fallacy is that a lot of

3259
01:52:58,609 --> 01:53:01,279
times people would say

3260
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:02,899
only that but if he mess up in organics

3261
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:04,819
there's no way you're in a correct it in

3262
01:53:02,899 --> 01:53:07,099
time it's gonna take months to turn it

3263
01:53:04,819 --> 01:53:08,809
around I found that if your soil is

3264
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:10,489
built right you have an issue usually a

3265
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:12,320
compost tea or a top dress can turn it

3266
01:53:10,488 --> 01:53:15,379
around pretty quickly so long as you've

3267
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:17,119
been training that plant properly yeah

3268
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:19,220
so that's actually one of the questions

3269
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:21,590
I was going to bring up is people often

3270
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:23,449
the one of the I call it one of the

3271
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:25,699
hydro mindsets when you're growing

3272
01:53:23,449 --> 01:53:28,309
organically is that you see a problem

3273
01:53:25,699 --> 01:53:30,859
and you want to fix it straight away as

3274
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:33,230
you said you can fix them fairly quickly

3275
01:53:30,859 --> 01:53:34,849
but it's not like like hydro or

3276
01:53:33,229 --> 01:53:37,939
synthetics where it's just you know like

3277
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:41,150
overnight fixed do that fix

3278
01:53:37,939 --> 01:53:43,969
yeah do you think that this is you know

3279
01:53:41,149 --> 01:53:46,009
kind of a fallacy for people to use this

3280
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:47,390
as a negative of organics when really

3281
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:49,970
maybe they just need to change their

3282
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:52,280
mindset a little to not want this kind

3283
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:53,630
of instant gratification of change you

3284
01:53:52,279 --> 01:53:56,238
know their nitrogen deficiency or

3285
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:57,980
whatever yeah and I think it's also fear

3286
01:53:56,238 --> 01:53:59,629
of the unknown you know you have so much

3287
01:53:57,979 --> 01:54:02,659
control the steering wheels in your hand

3288
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:05,659
the problem is is that we don't require

3289
01:54:02,659 --> 01:54:06,949
that control remove the ego the plants

3290
01:54:05,659 --> 01:54:08,329
are more intelligent at this they can

3291
01:54:06,949 --> 01:54:09,889
tell what they need and how do they need

3292
01:54:08,329 --> 01:54:12,050
it so our job is to provide all of that

3293
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:13,880
in the necessary proportions and given

3294
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:15,020
the right environment and so a lot of

3295
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:16,550
times we're banging our head against the

3296
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:17,900
wall and it's not a nitrogen issue in

3297
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:19,909
the soil it's that your humidity is too

3298
01:54:17,899 --> 01:54:21,289
low the plants have been dried and now

3299
01:54:19,909 --> 01:54:23,238
you're trying to add nitrogen to it well

3300
01:54:21,289 --> 01:54:24,769
in hydro the humidity didn't matter

3301
01:54:23,238 --> 01:54:27,409
they're sitting in a bed full of water

3302
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:29,989
and changing it out might actually fix

3303
01:54:27,409 --> 01:54:31,519
that so there's some false benefits

3304
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:33,319
there and they can become your worst

3305
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,420
enemy in hydro because you do the wrong

3306
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:37,639
thing didn't fix it killed it

3307
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:39,230
organics it's not gonna happen and so

3308
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:40,430
once you realize that you don't need to

3309
01:54:39,229 --> 01:54:41,719
change anything as long as you build it

3310
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:43,820
right you're never going to have to

3311
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:45,230
interrupt one of these problems and by

3312
01:54:43,819 --> 01:54:47,329
doing a little topdressing you can get

3313
01:54:45,229 --> 01:54:49,669
weeks ahead of any potential issues and

3314
01:54:47,329 --> 01:54:51,619
by using large volumes of soil you

3315
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:53,210
eliminate the problem already just

3316
01:54:51,619 --> 01:54:54,829
flower a plant that's too small offer

3317
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:56,899
for its container and it's never gonna

3318
01:54:54,829 --> 01:54:59,119
run out it's when we're pushing the

3319
01:54:56,899 --> 01:55:00,439
boundaries growing the maximum yield and

3320
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:01,670
the smallest amount of medium that we're

3321
01:55:00,439 --> 01:55:04,879
always going to run into problems

3322
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:05,960
organics is no different the thing is

3323
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:07,190
though is that

3324
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:08,510
there's a few tricks that we could use

3325
01:55:07,189 --> 01:55:09,829
once you get into organics where that

3326
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:12,469
whether it be an amino acid or like a

3327
01:55:09,829 --> 01:55:14,448
compost tea a fish fertilizer or a top

3328
01:55:12,469 --> 01:55:16,250
dress that typically can turn it around

3329
01:55:14,448 --> 01:55:19,339
instead of maybe a couple hours it might

3330
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:21,289
take two or three days but the detriment

3331
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:23,329
of that negative effect won't be so bad

3332
01:55:21,289 --> 01:55:26,269
and so I think that we can still pull

3333
01:55:23,329 --> 01:55:28,670
through pretty well yeah so how

3334
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:32,870
prevalent do you think the propaganda of

3335
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:36,109
the hydroponic industry is in our kind

3336
01:55:32,869 --> 01:55:37,789
of community I guess when I look at it

3337
01:55:36,109 --> 01:55:39,619
you know the thing that I think of is

3338
01:55:37,789 --> 01:55:43,789
every every breeder that we've ever

3339
01:55:39,619 --> 01:55:46,429
spoken to they've expressed a preference

3340
01:55:43,789 --> 01:55:47,960
for organic cannabis over hydroponic so

3341
01:55:46,429 --> 01:55:50,149
we're in this situation where like kind

3342
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:51,550
of the tops of our industry or you know

3343
01:55:50,149 --> 01:55:54,289
I shouldn't say industry our field

3344
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:56,000
promote and endorse organic cannabis and

3345
01:55:54,289 --> 01:55:58,010
yet the tops of the industry the

3346
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,750
hydroponic industry you know obviously

3347
01:55:58,010 --> 01:56:01,400
do not how do you think we've gotten to

3348
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:03,439
this point where we've got you know the

3349
01:56:01,399 --> 01:56:07,460
leaders saying one thing and the masses

3350
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:10,939
doing the opposite because we're trying

3351
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:12,890
to appeal to the masses so if you were

3352
01:56:10,939 --> 01:56:14,359
to set a demand for a product that

3353
01:56:12,890 --> 01:56:16,610
doesn't exist you can't fulfill the need

3354
01:56:14,359 --> 01:56:17,988
and so you know talking about organics

3355
01:56:16,609 --> 01:56:19,609
being the best and not having a new

3356
01:56:17,988 --> 01:56:21,889
organic to share if anybody does anybody

3357
01:56:19,609 --> 01:56:23,179
nobody good so the money being spent on

3358
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:24,739
marketing is gonna be for what they can

3359
01:56:23,179 --> 01:56:26,239
sell and that's gonna be for the

3360
01:56:24,738 --> 01:56:27,649
hydroponics the synthetics and all that

3361
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:29,678
but I've got a number of synthetic

3362
01:56:27,649 --> 01:56:31,698
customers that call me that run

3363
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:33,469
unbelievable warehouses with phenomenal

3364
01:56:31,698 --> 01:56:34,609
results that are duplicatable that are

3365
01:56:33,469 --> 01:56:37,100
crushing it that are at the peak of

3366
01:56:34,609 --> 01:56:39,049
their game they're implementing organics

3367
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:41,329
into their hydro recipes to get that

3368
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:42,500
best of both worlds and still even then

3369
01:56:41,329 --> 01:56:43,880
they're saying it's not a hundred

3370
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:47,090
percent on point and they still would

3371
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:48,710
prefer for their ads - organic soil to

3372
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:50,750
be that's like a really big compliment

3373
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:52,429
because these are people that have seen

3374
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:54,079
all of it seeing the big yields the

3375
01:56:52,429 --> 01:56:55,520
small yields they know all the [ __ ]

3376
01:56:54,079 --> 01:56:56,630
they know what to lie what's not they've

3377
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:59,239
grown all the different genetics and

3378
01:56:56,630 --> 01:57:00,440
like you're seeing at the pinnacle of it

3379
01:56:59,238 --> 01:57:02,658
they're still saying there's some sort

3380
01:57:00,439 --> 01:57:04,488
of Janus a quoi some preference that is

3381
01:57:02,658 --> 01:57:08,750
there and they don't know exactly why

3382
01:57:04,488 --> 01:57:10,309
and I think that the mainstream is

3383
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:11,689
starting to understand that and hear

3384
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:14,989
about it and for the first time I'm

3385
01:57:11,689 --> 01:57:17,428
hearing in hip hop and in music growing

3386
01:57:14,988 --> 01:57:19,169
it organic and it better be that organic

3387
01:57:17,429 --> 01:57:21,179
as opposed to that hydro and I'm like

3388
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:23,118
yes this is pretty cool it's starting to

3389
01:57:21,179 --> 01:57:25,590
happen and as we get that tipping point

3390
01:57:23,118 --> 01:57:28,259
where for instance when I was in college

3391
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:30,809
it was just weed and I had no clue you

3392
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:32,519
could spray stuff on it get chemicals

3393
01:57:30,809 --> 01:57:35,248
involved in it and have powdery mildew

3394
01:57:32,519 --> 01:57:37,079
and bugs and I probably smoked more some

3395
01:57:35,248 --> 01:57:39,719
pesticides and all that when I was

3396
01:57:37,078 --> 01:57:42,359
growing up and I care to admit but I'm

3397
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:43,979
now burdened with that new knowledge and

3398
01:57:42,359 --> 01:57:45,299
I realize holy [ __ ] you really can't

3399
01:57:43,979 --> 01:57:47,219
take just a plant that I thought was a

3400
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:49,439
plant that was called weed and really

3401
01:57:47,219 --> 01:57:50,939
ruin it and not only that but now

3402
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:53,189
there's a million flavors and cultivars

3403
01:57:50,939 --> 01:57:57,360
and genetics and so it just gets more

3404
01:57:53,189 --> 01:57:59,670
and more exciting yeah so um how long

3405
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:03,899
will it be till we see build a soil oje

3406
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:06,630
being wrapped about I have no idea it's

3407
01:58:03,899 --> 01:58:08,698
so funny you mention that um I've got a

3408
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:11,069
friend that is in the hip hop industry

3409
01:58:08,698 --> 01:58:13,049
he's done some stock done a song with

3410
01:58:11,069 --> 01:58:15,478
some big names like Snoop Dogg and he's

3411
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:18,479
got a charity and a lot of his friends

3412
01:58:15,479 --> 01:58:20,729
were lost to overdoses and drugs and

3413
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:22,559
just living that fast lifestyle and he's

3414
01:58:20,729 --> 01:58:24,329
since come to appreciate everybody and

3415
01:58:22,559 --> 01:58:27,239
has it's just a huge heart a lot of love

3416
01:58:24,328 --> 01:58:29,578
and he gives away CBD oil these grows

3417
01:58:27,238 --> 01:58:31,888
for the medicinal aspects of it and so

3418
01:58:29,578 --> 01:58:34,529
we donate to him and we also sent a

3419
01:58:31,889 --> 01:58:37,409
whole bunch of soil to him and we've

3420
01:58:34,529 --> 01:58:39,149
also got nicotine famous hash maker out

3421
01:58:37,408 --> 01:58:40,920
here and in the hip hop world we just

3422
01:58:39,149 --> 01:58:42,958
sent a pallet of soil to him so who

3423
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:44,458
knows maybe there will be some sudden

3424
01:58:42,958 --> 01:58:46,019
hip hop joke about it at some point but

3425
01:58:44,458 --> 01:58:48,179
that's certainly not the goal our goal

3426
01:58:46,019 --> 01:58:50,039
is to get more people learning about

3427
01:58:48,179 --> 01:58:51,208
organics experiencing the benefits from

3428
01:58:50,038 --> 01:58:52,498
it and realizing they don't have to

3429
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:54,328
spend a lot of money or time to get

3430
01:58:52,498 --> 01:58:55,349
their own grow and if they want to spend

3431
01:58:54,328 --> 01:58:57,359
a lot of money in time they can

3432
01:58:55,349 --> 01:59:00,269
certainly geek out on it just as hard as

3433
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:02,969
hydro so yeah and so have you ever

3434
01:59:00,269 --> 01:59:05,699
considered maybe doing something like an

3435
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:07,920
online web series kind of you know

3436
01:59:05,698 --> 01:59:10,738
showing people how to do all the things

3437
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:13,408
we're talking about I have and it just

3438
01:59:10,738 --> 01:59:14,698
runs into time and problems and I've got

3439
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:16,170
one going right now I posted the first

3440
01:59:14,698 --> 01:59:17,879
post maybe two months ago and I'm about

3441
01:59:16,170 --> 01:59:19,469
to update it with all that's happened

3442
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:21,659
since then and training the plants and

3443
01:59:19,469 --> 01:59:23,309
taking sex in the seedlings and doing

3444
01:59:21,658 --> 01:59:25,348
the transplanting and that'll be finally

3445
01:59:23,309 --> 01:59:28,439
documented last year I tried to do that

3446
01:59:25,349 --> 01:59:30,599
my house got burglarized and the plants

3447
01:59:28,439 --> 01:59:31,170
ripped few weeks into flower because I

3448
01:59:30,599 --> 01:59:33,060
had some plan

3449
01:59:31,170 --> 01:59:34,739
outdoor and so these are problems that

3450
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:35,730
are real that happened to growers and I

3451
01:59:34,739 --> 01:59:37,380
thought it couldn't happen to be a

3452
01:59:35,729 --> 01:59:39,359
little the middle of nowhere so my doors

3453
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:40,829
are unlocked half the time didn't have

3454
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:43,259
any security system and now everything's

3455
01:59:40,829 --> 01:59:44,399
different in my life and so I got really

3456
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:46,079
scared and I didn't want to post the

3457
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:47,789
rest of the videos for some of those

3458
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:49,800
grows the few months after that and so

3459
01:59:47,789 --> 01:59:51,269
now I'm kind of doubling down circling

3460
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:52,650
back around and just like build a soil

3461
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:54,390
has been from the beginning it's been

3462
01:59:52,649 --> 01:59:55,859
hey I know you're scared to talk about

3463
01:59:54,390 --> 01:59:57,360
this with everybody in your family I

3464
01:59:55,859 --> 01:59:59,219
know you don't want to just go be public

3465
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:01,229
about it so we'll do that and we'll bare

3466
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:04,949
some of that burden it helps that it can

3467
02:00:01,229 --> 02:00:06,539
help us all learn a little bit and so it

3468
02:00:04,949 --> 02:00:08,699
would be very rewarding to have those

3469
02:00:06,539 --> 02:00:09,960
videos and so we'll be working on it and

3470
02:00:08,699 --> 02:00:11,729
if you guys do something like that I'd

3471
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,939
be cool too I hope more people share

3472
02:00:11,729 --> 02:00:17,069
their methods yeah for sure

3473
02:00:13,939 --> 02:00:19,529
so I'm something that's kind of come up

3474
02:00:17,069 --> 02:00:21,899
as a new craze is the whole fermented

3475
02:00:19,529 --> 02:00:24,689
plant juice do you think that these

3476
02:00:21,899 --> 02:00:26,309
products I mean obviously the fermented

3477
02:00:24,689 --> 02:00:29,099
plant juice to me seems like a really

3478
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:30,360
cheap alternative to some other products

3479
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:33,600
and you can you can just make it at home

3480
02:00:30,359 --> 02:00:36,389
really easily but on the actual benefit

3481
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:38,250
level put a slide cost do you think it

3482
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:40,260
outweighs say using some coconut water

3483
02:00:38,250 --> 02:00:42,619
and Bokashi like I'm a firm believer

3484
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:47,100
that coconut water is the bee's knees

3485
02:00:42,619 --> 02:00:48,359
what do you think yes I actually think

3486
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:49,920
there's some benefit there greater than

3487
02:00:48,359 --> 02:00:52,199
I thought when I initially got into it

3488
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,760
you know fermentation you use in very

3489
02:00:52,199 --> 02:00:55,139
smart small parts-per-million

3490
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:57,090
botanical teas you can use a hundred

3491
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:58,590
percent it's mostly water so for

3492
02:00:57,090 --> 02:01:00,180
instance you know bubbling some kelp and

3493
02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:02,250
alfalfa you could just use it if you

3494
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:03,960
were to ferment you're gonna use you

3495
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:06,689
know a couple of drops per gallon it's

3496
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:08,159
very different and one of the things

3497
02:01:06,689 --> 02:01:09,509
that we're finding benefit from now this

3498
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:11,609
is anecdotal I don't have the evidence

3499
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:13,800
in front of me but I tend to trust these

3500
02:01:11,609 --> 02:01:15,210
resources because one of the unique

3501
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:16,949
positions I get put it and build the

3502
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:18,449
soil is to talk to a lot of people that

3503
02:01:16,949 --> 02:01:19,920
are on the ground doing this every day

3504
02:01:18,449 --> 02:01:21,899
they're not online they're not sharing

3505
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,220
with anybody they're just doing it and

3506
02:01:21,899 --> 02:01:25,319
they're sharing with me some of their

3507
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:27,060
results and I've found that people that

3508
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:29,250
have access to massive amounts of

3509
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:30,570
testing because they are at a dispensary

3510
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:32,460
or whatever and they're getting

3511
02:01:30,569 --> 02:01:36,689
everything tested even for terpenoids

3512
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:39,079
we're finding increases by using some of

3513
02:01:36,689 --> 02:01:41,819
these fermented plant juices of the

3514
02:01:39,079 --> 02:01:44,010
fruits like papaya mango and some of

3515
02:01:41,819 --> 02:01:44,609
that stuff and they're actually finding

3516
02:01:44,010 --> 02:01:46,530
some Bennett

3517
02:01:44,609 --> 02:01:51,420
and taste translation to that and that's

3518
02:01:46,529 --> 02:01:52,679
exciting to me so I I don't know I know

3519
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:54,210
that there's not a downside from it

3520
02:01:52,679 --> 02:01:58,170
unless you overdo it and it is pretty

3521
02:01:54,210 --> 02:02:00,210
cheap I haven't seen that effect though

3522
02:01:58,170 --> 02:02:02,039
where I see a grower use just peat moss

3523
02:02:00,210 --> 02:02:04,289
or pearl mix it may make their own

3524
02:02:02,039 --> 02:02:07,019
nutrient line from fermented extracts

3525
02:02:04,289 --> 02:02:08,519
actually have success it just seems to

3526
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:10,260
me that it's not balanced enough and

3527
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:12,420
it's more of an addition to a balanced

3528
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:14,250
system for some extra added effect that

3529
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:18,739
it would be to completely be your

3530
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:21,090
nutritional source yeah

3531
02:02:18,738 --> 02:02:22,979
another thing there is the sugars you

3532
02:02:21,090 --> 02:02:27,329
know I'm not a huge believer I'm like

3533
02:02:22,979 --> 02:02:30,000
adding sugar to the soil but coconut

3534
02:02:27,329 --> 02:02:31,408
water is a sugar source molasses is a

3535
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,389
mineral source that has sugar with it

3536
02:02:31,408 --> 02:02:35,039
too and you know in the right amounts

3537
02:02:33,389 --> 02:02:36,840
we're finding that there is some benefit

3538
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:39,630
to taste and flavor to having some of

3539
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:41,250
these complex sugars that realistically

3540
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:44,840
the plant should be shouldn't be able to

3541
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:47,039
update so doing something else there and

3542
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:48,619
obviously it's not like putting kool-aid

3543
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:50,880
in the soil you know you get that joke

3544
02:02:48,618 --> 02:02:52,079
purple kool-aid in my hydro and it

3545
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:54,569
tastes but it's like that's not how

3546
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:56,819
freakin works okay but something about

3547
02:02:54,569 --> 02:02:58,289
that sugar something about the carbs

3548
02:02:56,819 --> 02:03:01,019
that are there a little bit of microbe

3549
02:02:58,289 --> 02:03:02,760
food and so maybe that's what the

3550
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:05,670
fermented plant extract is also bringing

3551
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:07,350
to the table but in cho when he talks

3552
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:09,060
about in korean natural farming he says

3553
02:03:07,350 --> 02:03:10,739
like a pregnant woman starts to crave

3554
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:13,590
fermented foods that are high in

3555
02:03:10,738 --> 02:03:14,908
phosphorus and go that direction when

3556
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:16,949
we're starting to flour some of these

3557
02:03:14,908 --> 02:03:19,379
fermented plant extracts might be able

3558
02:03:16,948 --> 02:03:21,138
to hit the nail on the head with what we

3559
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:23,190
need it in that transitional period

3560
02:03:21,139 --> 02:03:24,900
because we're not in this big bed of

3561
02:03:23,189 --> 02:03:26,669
soil that has everything to it then we

3562
02:03:24,899 --> 02:03:28,859
are limited by being indoors with lights

3563
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:30,810
and so I don't know what the benefit is

3564
02:03:28,859 --> 02:03:32,549
but what I'm hearing is that there is

3565
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:35,070
some sort of even on testing data

3566
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:37,230
they're finding increased chirping

3567
02:03:35,069 --> 02:03:40,889
terpene counts by using some of these F

3568
02:03:37,229 --> 02:03:42,000
PJ's or FP es as you'll call yeah so

3569
02:03:40,889 --> 02:03:44,368
time will tell but I think there's gonna

3570
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,789
be some benefit there for sure okay

3571
02:03:44,368 --> 02:03:47,219
awesome

3572
02:03:44,789 --> 02:03:50,069
so what do you think is one of the

3573
02:03:47,219 --> 02:03:52,408
current you know techniques or methods

3574
02:03:50,069 --> 02:03:53,759
or products that people are using that

3575
02:03:52,408 --> 02:03:55,138
you don't think it's gonna stand the

3576
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,760
test of time you know maybe five years

3577
02:03:55,139 --> 02:03:58,179
from now we won't really see a lot of it

3578
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:02,380
being used

3579
02:03:58,179 --> 02:04:03,940
huh you're gonna see a million probiotic

3580
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:05,469
companies kind of go selling some new

3581
02:04:03,939 --> 02:04:06,969
blend of microbes that's gonna be the

3582
02:04:05,469 --> 02:04:08,859
latest and greatest and I feel like

3583
02:04:06,969 --> 02:04:10,630
there'll be a few at the top that are

3584
02:04:08,859 --> 02:04:11,889
working with major major agriculture

3585
02:04:10,630 --> 02:04:16,119
that are really doing research and

3586
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:18,280
finding benefit purple non sulfur

3587
02:04:16,119 --> 02:04:19,689
bacteria was that magical one that you

3588
02:04:18,279 --> 02:04:20,738
see come around and it's still important

3589
02:04:19,689 --> 02:04:22,539
but it's like everybody was talking

3590
02:04:20,738 --> 02:04:24,428
about it like every other word for a

3591
02:04:22,539 --> 02:04:28,988
while and now you just kind of hear the

3592
02:04:24,429 --> 02:04:30,550
background isn't as normal knowledge but

3593
02:04:28,988 --> 02:04:31,718
it's weird when you first start talking

3594
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:33,159
to growers that are brand new they all

3595
02:04:31,719 --> 02:04:34,960
start using the super thrived for some

3596
02:04:33,158 --> 02:04:36,579
reason those vitamin B ones and some of

3597
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:38,408
those fads that kind of happen that come

3598
02:04:36,579 --> 02:04:44,198
and go I feel like they're gonna revisit

3599
02:04:38,408 --> 02:04:45,189
us from time to time so I don't know I

3600
02:04:44,198 --> 02:04:48,939
guess I don't have really good answer

3601
02:04:45,189 --> 02:04:50,678
for that one yeah no worries so on the

3602
02:04:48,939 --> 02:04:54,039
Builder soil site you've got a little

3603
02:04:50,679 --> 02:04:56,710
kit to kind of revitalize your soil so

3604
02:04:54,039 --> 02:04:58,510
my question is if someone says to me my

3605
02:04:56,710 --> 02:05:00,130
soil is depleted do you think that most

3606
02:04:58,510 --> 02:05:02,020
of the time they need that kit or

3607
02:05:00,130 --> 02:05:03,550
there's just something they need to fix

3608
02:05:02,020 --> 02:05:05,050
and then they'll realize it's all

3609
02:05:03,550 --> 02:05:06,460
actually still there they've just made

3610
02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:09,010
because some lock out or something like

3611
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:10,719
that it depends you know if they know

3612
02:05:09,010 --> 02:05:12,460
they've grown in the soil a lot watered

3613
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:13,840
a lot it's possibly gotten leached I

3614
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:17,198
think that kit would probably do really

3615
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:19,239
good but the kit derived from me not

3616
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:20,559
having a succinct enough answer for my

3617
02:05:19,238 --> 02:05:21,908
customers they kept on saying you just

3618
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:23,890
have something I could buy and put it in

3619
02:05:21,908 --> 02:05:26,319
there I'm like [ __ ] if I only worked

3620
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:28,840
that easy right so I'll do my best

3621
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:30,130
right and my my best was looking at a

3622
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:31,810
lot of soil tests where there were

3623
02:05:30,130 --> 02:05:33,130
smaller containers and it did grow a lot

3624
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:35,380
now this is not looking at really

3625
02:05:33,130 --> 02:05:37,420
no-till in particular I feel like

3626
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:38,949
no-till should baby be some less inputs

3627
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:41,079
and some worms and a little compost

3628
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:42,789
maybe not exactly the kit because that's

3629
02:05:41,079 --> 02:05:44,738
more for remitting and dumping and

3630
02:05:42,789 --> 02:05:46,658
tilling and all that but what we found

3631
02:05:44,738 --> 02:05:49,599
is that nitrogen was a little low

3632
02:05:46,658 --> 02:05:51,488
calcium was a little low PK were mostly

3633
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:52,780
fine though so our ream indicate was

3634
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:54,189
adding the gypsum that brought that

3635
02:05:52,779 --> 02:05:56,500
calcium with the sulfur that would help

3636
02:05:54,189 --> 02:05:58,599
shuffle the nutrients it added back the

3637
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:59,920
crustacean Needham kelp because normally

3638
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:01,449
in a no-till you're advised to put a

3639
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:03,190
half cup or a cup of those materials

3640
02:06:01,448 --> 02:06:05,710
back in anyway since we're harvesting a

3641
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:08,229
plant and most the time the grain size

3642
02:06:05,710 --> 02:06:11,529
of the nutrients we're using or like for

3643
02:06:08,229 --> 02:06:11,919
instance the kelp meal that's pretty

3644
02:06:11,529 --> 02:06:13,750
common

3645
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:16,750
number fourteen grind and it lasts like

3646
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:18,250
five to six months in soil it's really

3647
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:20,229
microbial active it might go a little

3648
02:06:18,250 --> 02:06:24,219
faster so what about we just add back

3649
02:06:20,229 --> 02:06:27,189
kind of guessing but what we can't guess

3650
02:06:24,219 --> 02:06:28,659
at what we benefit from soil tests that

3651
02:06:27,189 --> 02:06:30,879
I'm hoping to start to add to our

3652
02:06:28,659 --> 02:06:33,729
customers and our soil is boron iron

3653
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:35,859
manganese copper or zinc things that may

3654
02:06:33,729 --> 02:06:37,718
not show themselves is important I mean

3655
02:06:35,859 --> 02:06:39,880
they are but may not be as drastically

3656
02:06:37,719 --> 02:06:42,039
important in an indoor grow when you

3657
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:44,350
plant a full season 10-pound plant

3658
02:06:42,039 --> 02:06:45,880
outdoors we're starting to see some of

3659
02:06:44,350 --> 02:06:47,469
the weaknesses and our soil recipes for

3660
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:49,539
the first time where boron it's just too

3661
02:06:47,469 --> 02:06:51,399
little copper is so low that we're

3662
02:06:49,539 --> 02:06:53,619
getting powdery mildew in some areas and

3663
02:06:51,399 --> 02:06:55,779
so as I learn about this I want to teach

3664
02:06:53,619 --> 02:06:57,250
others or maybe just buying that repin

3665
02:06:55,779 --> 02:06:58,960
kits not enough you should do a soil

3666
02:06:57,250 --> 02:07:00,429
test we should add back all of those

3667
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:03,789
things so we have the best chance of

3668
02:07:00,429 --> 02:07:05,500
success but most often just added a

3669
02:07:03,789 --> 02:07:06,969
Riemann kit top dressing with compost is

3670
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:08,140
more than enough for an immuno almost

3671
02:07:06,969 --> 02:07:12,159
every grower unless they're really

3672
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:14,410
pushing the extremes yeah so how would

3673
02:07:12,159 --> 02:07:19,448
you characterize the difference between

3674
02:07:14,409 --> 02:07:21,159
say hybrid soil versus say like the

3675
02:07:19,448 --> 02:07:22,839
coots mix would you just say that the

3676
02:07:21,159 --> 02:07:25,300
hybrid switch has been around for quite

3677
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:27,130
a while is more comparable to say a

3678
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:29,199
super soil mixture or you think maybe

3679
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:33,819
it's somewhere in between the two of

3680
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:34,928
super soil and coots that is hydric soil

3681
02:07:33,819 --> 02:07:36,969
are you regarding to that you know

3682
02:07:34,929 --> 02:07:40,539
gardening philosophy of Brix testing and

3683
02:07:36,969 --> 02:07:42,640
growing from yeah yeah yeah yeah I just

3684
02:07:40,539 --> 02:07:44,920
make everyone talking about a brand you

3685
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:49,420
know high Brix methodology is typically

3686
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:51,819
going to be lower in potassium lower in

3687
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:54,340
phosphorus and more on the trace mineral

3688
02:07:51,819 --> 02:07:56,799
balancing and not really heavily reliant

3689
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:58,449
on compost they find that compost brings

3690
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:00,100
way too much potassium and that and

3691
02:07:58,448 --> 02:08:02,169
causes an imbalance and they're just

3692
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:04,390
adamant that you can't high high Brix

3693
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:06,100
while involving that and I just don't

3694
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:07,900
find that to be the case with these

3695
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:09,579
fast-growing annual plants I've not

3696
02:08:07,899 --> 02:08:11,920
found Brix testing to be something that

3697
02:08:09,579 --> 02:08:14,350
was super informative as far as you know

3698
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:16,060
making decisions in the garden but I'm

3699
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:17,980
fully willing to change my opinion on

3700
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:19,870
that as I do more research certainly

3701
02:08:17,979 --> 02:08:22,319
higher Brix a lot of times it does

3702
02:08:19,869 --> 02:08:24,948
correlate to a you know more nutritional

3703
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:26,630
product when it comes to like apples

3704
02:08:24,948 --> 02:08:29,029
on a higher Brix Apple or whatever we're

3705
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:30,229
talking about the sugar content when it

3706
02:08:29,029 --> 02:08:31,849
comes around to high Brix garden

3707
02:08:30,229 --> 02:08:33,409
practices though I feel like the compost

3708
02:08:31,849 --> 02:08:35,420
is so important it's really hard for me

3709
02:08:33,408 --> 02:08:36,859
to to focus on that so what I want to

3710
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:39,679
look at is not only having the compost

3711
02:08:36,859 --> 02:08:40,998
but also having a mineral balancing and

3712
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:42,469
so I think bringing the best of both

3713
02:08:40,998 --> 02:08:44,269
worlds is going to be important and I've

3714
02:08:42,469 --> 02:08:45,859
found with premium compost it doesn't

3715
02:08:44,269 --> 02:08:49,998
have to be so imbalanced that the

3716
02:08:45,859 --> 02:08:52,458
potassium is out of whack so like we're

3717
02:08:49,998 --> 02:08:54,948
finding there's little jewels and each

3718
02:08:52,458 --> 02:08:56,479
one of these different methodologies but

3719
02:08:54,948 --> 02:08:59,689
I find when you get to the extremist

3720
02:08:56,479 --> 02:09:04,519
crowd of any of these groups I have a

3721
02:08:59,689 --> 02:09:06,678
little rub you know yeah so what's the

3722
02:09:04,519 --> 02:09:08,780
most wasteful thing that you see organic

3723
02:09:06,679 --> 02:09:13,940
growers do that you would like them to

3724
02:09:08,779 --> 02:09:18,679
improve don't know that's a good

3725
02:09:13,939 --> 02:09:19,879
question you know it said is it in

3726
02:09:18,679 --> 02:09:21,109
particular I guess it depends on the

3727
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:22,519
crowd a lot of times throwing all their

3728
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:28,939
soil away starting from scratch is

3729
02:09:22,519 --> 02:09:30,260
pretty wasteful using you know I don't

3730
02:09:28,939 --> 02:09:31,698
know do you have any suggestions on what

3731
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:33,079
you think might be a wasteful practice I

3732
02:09:31,698 --> 02:09:35,598
can't think of anything organics is

3733
02:09:33,078 --> 02:09:37,880
typically about not being wasteful well

3734
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:39,860
I've got a friend and he's of the belief

3735
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:43,219
that because cannabis is like a top

3736
02:09:39,859 --> 02:09:45,288
feeder that the top soil gets much more

3737
02:09:43,219 --> 02:09:47,569
depleted than the bottom so he always

3738
02:09:45,288 --> 02:09:49,189
throws out the top bit where all the

3739
02:09:47,569 --> 02:09:50,748
feeder roots have been you know like by

3740
02:09:49,189 --> 02:09:52,728
the end of the grow it's kind of all

3741
02:09:50,748 --> 02:09:56,840
locked with roots he gets rid of that

3742
02:09:52,729 --> 02:09:58,789
and recycles the bottom our container is

3743
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:01,369
all topsoil you know I mean we're not in

3744
02:09:58,788 --> 02:10:03,768
nature where you have that different sub

3745
02:10:01,368 --> 02:10:05,630
level layers of minerals and clays and

3746
02:10:03,769 --> 02:10:08,030
then finally the organic matter on the

3747
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:09,739
top we have all high organic matter our

3748
02:10:08,029 --> 02:10:11,179
whole potting soil is the topsoil and

3749
02:10:09,738 --> 02:10:13,218
it's all feeder roots in there we don't

3750
02:10:11,179 --> 02:10:14,809
have a deep taproot so I would argue

3751
02:10:13,219 --> 02:10:15,939
that if you were to test the top and

3752
02:10:14,809 --> 02:10:18,229
bottom going to be pretty much identical

3753
02:10:15,939 --> 02:10:20,089
except for in my soil where I'm top

3754
02:10:18,229 --> 02:10:21,650
dressing a lot it would be richer on top

3755
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:25,729
so I certainly won't want to throw that

3756
02:10:21,649 --> 02:10:29,868
portion away yeah so in general we kind

3757
02:10:25,729 --> 02:10:32,809
of advise top dressing overusing juice

3758
02:10:29,868 --> 02:10:34,938
like ferments because you know you can

3759
02:10:32,809 --> 02:10:36,439
improve that both the humic and the

3760
02:10:34,939 --> 02:10:38,320
nutritional content of the soil through

3761
02:10:36,439 --> 02:10:39,850
the top dressing long term

3762
02:10:38,319 --> 02:10:41,439
yeah yeah and you also get the benefit

3763
02:10:39,850 --> 02:10:42,970
where you're giving additional material

3764
02:10:41,439 --> 02:10:44,619
for the roots to dig into and I find

3765
02:10:42,970 --> 02:10:45,850
that roots at their tip where they're

3766
02:10:44,619 --> 02:10:47,979
sloughing off and where they're getting

3767
02:10:45,850 --> 02:10:50,829
that actual absorption and exchanging

3768
02:10:47,979 --> 02:10:52,779
cations that tip is where the magic

3769
02:10:50,829 --> 02:10:54,850
happens and so when you top dress you

3770
02:10:52,779 --> 02:10:57,849
get fresh new feeder roots digging into

3771
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:59,470
that adding an explosion of growth along

3772
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:01,620
with the nutritional benefits of that

3773
02:10:59,470 --> 02:11:04,180
top dress and then the bottom stays

3774
02:11:01,619 --> 02:11:06,250
whereas a more balanced not so due to

3775
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:07,960
rich and a kid get water and moisture

3776
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:10,720
and it can have those two zones just

3777
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:12,460
like in nature and so when you do that

3778
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:13,900
you're constantly trading these feeder

3779
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:16,090
roots where if you're a guy that does

3780
02:11:13,899 --> 02:11:17,379
know mulch no top dress and all of a

3781
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:19,420
sudden you notice the deficiency and you

3782
02:11:17,380 --> 02:11:21,369
go I got a top dress you might as well

3783
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:23,289
as grab a tea but if you've been top

3784
02:11:21,369 --> 02:11:24,909
dressing and mulching the whole time the

3785
02:11:23,289 --> 02:11:26,560
second you put that top dress down

3786
02:11:24,909 --> 02:11:28,779
there's feeder roots just dig it into it

3787
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:32,740
the next day or two yeah it really has a

3788
02:11:28,779 --> 02:11:34,889
much faster effect and so yeah I think

3789
02:11:32,739 --> 02:11:37,710
that's kind of a difference there

3790
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:40,270
awesome so for this next little pot

3791
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:42,220
we'll just go through some nutrients and

3792
02:11:40,270 --> 02:11:43,810
maybe you could just fire off some

3793
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:47,829
answers as to where people might be able

3794
02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:52,720
to source them from okay so obvious ones

3795
02:11:47,829 --> 02:11:55,750
nitrogen coffee hits and one a lot of us

3796
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:57,190
drink I think that ad greed material any

3797
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:58,569
fast Graham weed on your property you

3798
02:11:57,189 --> 02:12:00,219
can drop down and harvest will have some

3799
02:11:58,569 --> 02:12:01,509
nitrogen you could top dress with it you

3800
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:03,760
could feed it to the warm beds get

3801
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:06,159
nitrogen that way

3802
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:07,750
I think nitrogen will be pretty easy

3803
02:12:06,159 --> 02:12:09,970
it's the number one limiting factor so

3804
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:11,409
any any any country that's farming is

3805
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:12,850
gonna have access to some sort of organ

3806
02:12:11,409 --> 02:12:14,319
you know nitrogen source you mentioned

3807
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:16,270
you use the blood meal that was what was

3808
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:18,099
there if that's the only source you

3809
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:20,980
might want to consider you know

3810
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:23,530
continuing to use it but unfortunately

3811
02:12:20,979 --> 02:12:25,809
for me I don't know really what your

3812
02:12:23,529 --> 02:12:27,369
resources out there are so I'm gonna you

3813
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:30,250
know need some guidance from you on that

3814
02:12:27,369 --> 02:12:31,869
but nitrogen should be easy yeah I mean

3815
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:34,270
there's a lot of nitrogen options to be

3816
02:12:31,869 --> 02:12:36,010
honest phosphorus this is an interesting

3817
02:12:34,270 --> 02:12:37,840
one for Australia because I mentioned

3818
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:39,250
earlier we don't um we don't have a lot

3819
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:41,470
of phosphorus something I didn't mention

3820
02:12:39,250 --> 02:12:43,659
is that the Australian government has

3821
02:12:41,470 --> 02:12:45,670
actually limited the amount of

3822
02:12:43,659 --> 02:12:47,500
phosphorus you can have in certain

3823
02:12:45,670 --> 02:12:50,140
products so I think it was about a year

3824
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:51,520
ago now Kanna had to redesign their

3825
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:54,160
whole leak

3826
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:56,020
would product because it was deemed to

3827
02:12:54,159 --> 02:12:58,239
have too high of a phosphorous level and

3828
02:12:56,020 --> 02:12:59,410
so that kind of caused a bit of issue is

3829
02:12:58,239 --> 02:13:01,149
because a lot of people will have to

3830
02:12:59,409 --> 02:13:03,099
change their whole feeding regiments and

3831
02:13:01,149 --> 02:13:04,869
whatnot but um I guess at the heart of

3832
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:06,550
the question is yeah we don't have a lot

3833
02:13:04,869 --> 02:13:08,920
of available sources of phosphorus and

3834
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:11,260
even guano as much as your against it is

3835
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:13,829
not readily available so what would be

3836
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:17,590
kind of the lesser known ways to get it

3837
02:13:13,829 --> 02:13:21,250
well you know we use fish bone meal

3838
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:23,529
which is a 4:20 zero and BK kind of

3839
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:24,939
thing which means that the nitrogen has

3840
02:13:23,529 --> 02:13:28,449
a lot of phosphorus though so the bone

3841
02:13:24,939 --> 02:13:29,589
is what's you know congruent you know

3842
02:13:28,449 --> 02:13:31,929
the bone meal that you're using may not

3843
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:32,980
it's probably bovine but either way if

3844
02:13:31,930 --> 02:13:35,440
you can get some bones that would be a

3845
02:13:32,979 --> 02:13:36,759
good source of phosphorus yep and help

3846
02:13:35,439 --> 02:13:38,319
them you may have some more grass fed

3847
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:39,369
cattle sources you may have other ways

3848
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:41,079
of getting that that's better than what

3849
02:13:39,369 --> 02:13:42,189
I'm currently get it and so that might

3850
02:13:41,079 --> 02:13:45,519
be a great way for you to get your

3851
02:13:42,189 --> 02:13:49,119
phosphorus other than that chicken

3852
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:50,440
manure okay good for phosphorus alfalfa

3853
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:51,760
Brewers out here number one limiting

3854
02:13:50,439 --> 02:13:53,199
factor is phosphorus then I'll use

3855
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:55,180
chicken manure and it's excellent for

3856
02:13:53,199 --> 02:13:56,710
that the problem is it can be a little

3857
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:58,360
hot so if you compost that chicken

3858
02:13:56,710 --> 02:14:00,520
manure may be a really really good

3859
02:13:58,359 --> 02:14:02,769
source of phosphorus that's at least in

3860
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:04,930
a proportion that probably wouldn't be

3861
02:14:02,770 --> 02:14:06,100
illegal since it's all natural and then

3862
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:07,840
the other thing to consider is using

3863
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:09,100
phosphorus all you baizen microbes and

3864
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:11,650
here's what we got that talked about

3865
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:13,570
indigenous microbes I'm guessing they're

3866
02:14:11,649 --> 02:14:15,039
really good at soluble phosphorus in a

3867
02:14:13,569 --> 02:14:16,809
low phosphorus soil where you're having

3868
02:14:15,039 --> 02:14:18,609
trouble buying those amendments these

3869
02:14:16,810 --> 02:14:21,100
indigenous microbes might be perfect and

3870
02:14:18,609 --> 02:14:22,960
so looking at you know guild Karen bangs

3871
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:24,400
website the unconventional farmer or

3872
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:26,619
looking at doctor you know looking at

3873
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:30,399
chose natural farming using some of

3874
02:14:26,619 --> 02:14:32,170
those the rice boxes to culture your

3875
02:14:30,399 --> 02:14:37,299
microbes might be a worthwhile venture

3876
02:14:32,170 --> 02:14:39,489
there yeah okay cool so as phosphorus is

3877
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:41,260
pretty immobilize I croak microbial

3878
02:14:39,489 --> 02:14:44,109
based micro rise I is gonna be another

3879
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:46,360
great addition yeah so that'll really

3880
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:49,559
kind of allow it to get moved into the

3881
02:14:46,359 --> 02:14:53,289
plant you reckon yep yep I think so

3882
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:57,039
awesome so what about the other big on

3883
02:14:53,289 --> 02:14:58,600
potassium grow comfrey plant you'll have

3884
02:14:57,039 --> 02:15:01,899
plenty of potassium I think you guys

3885
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:03,340
have comfrey available yeah so that'll

3886
02:15:01,899 --> 02:15:04,859
be potassium kelp would be good for

3887
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:07,529
potassium

3888
02:15:04,859 --> 02:15:08,729
I think you'll find potassium sources

3889
02:15:07,529 --> 02:15:09,960
and so this is what I want to impart

3890
02:15:08,729 --> 02:15:14,000
more than just talking about the

3891
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:16,619
ingredients if someone can have enough

3892
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,630
comfort researching amendments based on

3893
02:15:16,619 --> 02:15:20,159
what plants contain it's fine I mean for

3894
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:22,319
instance the guy read about making

3895
02:15:20,159 --> 02:15:23,939
world-record Tomatoes thousands of

3896
02:15:22,319 --> 02:15:25,619
pounds of tomatoes on one plant growing

3897
02:15:23,939 --> 02:15:27,239
in a cage system vertically where he

3898
02:15:25,619 --> 02:15:29,550
asked to get on huge ladders to harvest

3899
02:15:27,239 --> 02:15:31,529
it he did so making his own compost and

3900
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:33,900
his compost source for nitrogen was the

3901
02:15:31,529 --> 02:15:35,759
kudzu vine which was a very fast-growing

3902
02:15:33,899 --> 02:15:37,859
vine that grew there that was almost

3903
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:39,720
like taking over it grow across a road

3904
02:15:37,859 --> 02:15:41,969
and then it was like it was a it was a

3905
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:43,980
problem well he chopped it up and use it

3906
02:15:41,970 --> 02:15:46,079
for his compost and so if you guys can

3907
02:15:43,979 --> 02:15:48,329
locally find products would just be

3908
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:49,739
comfortable using them for the nitrogen

3909
02:15:48,329 --> 02:15:52,559
potassium or phosphorus I think you'll

3910
02:15:49,739 --> 02:15:54,539
be fine it doesn't have to be comfrey as

3911
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,280
long as you find a fast growing weed

3912
02:15:54,539 --> 02:15:59,100
that's on your property that's no dab

3913
02:15:56,279 --> 02:16:01,349
potassium that'd be great yeah well I

3914
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:03,660
mean do you feel like in some ways we're

3915
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:06,210
going through a bit of a renaissance in

3916
02:16:03,659 --> 02:16:07,649
that you know go back five years there

3917
02:16:06,210 --> 02:16:09,869
weren't that many people who knew that

3918
02:16:07,649 --> 02:16:12,000
comfrey was a good potassium and

3919
02:16:09,869 --> 02:16:14,819
nitrogen source do you think that as we

3920
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:16,829
learn more about these kind of ways to

3921
02:16:14,819 --> 02:16:19,049
get the the nutrients from just the

3922
02:16:16,829 --> 02:16:20,670
plants around us that will slowly fades

3923
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:22,320
out things like bone meal and eventually

3924
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:25,560
one day you'll be making your soil mix

3925
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:26,909
from just a mixture of plants yes for

3926
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:28,740
sure I'd love to do that it's always

3927
02:16:26,909 --> 02:16:30,180
gonna be economies of scale it's always

3928
02:16:28,739 --> 02:16:32,340
going to be that invisible guiding hand

3929
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:33,960
of profit and when you look at people

3930
02:16:32,340 --> 02:16:36,090
that are telling me hey man I got you

3931
02:16:33,959 --> 02:16:37,799
know 300 yards of soil I got a mix and

3932
02:16:36,090 --> 02:16:40,558
the only thing my I'm gonna afford as

3933
02:16:37,799 --> 02:16:42,718
bone meal you're still gonna have that

3934
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:44,218
and so until it becomes more affordable

3935
02:16:42,718 --> 02:16:45,388
and so the ways this happened is for

3936
02:16:44,218 --> 02:16:47,250
instance I was thinking about this the

3937
02:16:45,388 --> 02:16:48,959
other day computers it's like it's got

3938
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:51,329
to be a so expensive to buy the first

3939
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:52,919
computer ever right and that market

3940
02:16:51,329 --> 02:16:55,079
price but it was those early adopters

3941
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:56,700
willing to invest money and tinkering

3942
02:16:55,079 --> 02:16:59,370
with stuff that wasn't very easy to use

3943
02:16:56,700 --> 02:17:00,630
that just for some reason they got it it

3944
02:16:59,370 --> 02:17:02,370
added value to their life they were

3945
02:17:00,629 --> 02:17:04,679
willing to spend all the money to do it

3946
02:17:02,370 --> 02:17:06,480
well now decades later all of us who

3947
02:17:04,679 --> 02:17:08,219
just wanna you know watch Netflix are

3948
02:17:06,479 --> 02:17:09,779
benefiting from all of their struggle to

3949
02:17:08,218 --> 02:17:10,949
spend the money on all this stuff and

3950
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:13,739
bring it down to a level where was

3951
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:15,389
produced at a low cost and so the

3952
02:17:13,739 --> 02:17:17,260
biomass that country can produce on a

3953
02:17:15,388 --> 02:17:18,789
property is so unbelievable

3954
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:20,050
we're finally finding people that are

3955
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:21,341
starting to grow it for us and I'm

3956
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:23,050
buying it for way too high of a price

3957
02:17:21,341 --> 02:17:25,569
and selling it for way too high of a

3958
02:17:23,050 --> 02:17:27,789
price so it's not really ready but once

3959
02:17:25,569 --> 02:17:29,469
we get you know multiple acreage plots

3960
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:31,690
and hundreds of acres and people are

3961
02:17:29,469 --> 02:17:33,760
harvesting lots of biomass and we can

3962
02:17:31,690 --> 02:17:36,329
get the cost down certainly it'll be a

3963
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:39,909
very good it'll it'll really give a run

3964
02:17:36,329 --> 02:17:40,841
for bone meal but right now a lot of

3965
02:17:39,909 --> 02:17:42,700
these products we're buying as

3966
02:17:40,841 --> 02:17:46,270
fertilizer you better remember they're a

3967
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:48,671
waste product they're trash how can you

3968
02:17:46,270 --> 02:17:50,409
beat free they already have a business

3969
02:17:48,671 --> 02:17:52,000
that is slaughtering cattle and they're

3970
02:17:50,409 --> 02:17:54,880
just making extra money selling us the

3971
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,530
blood and so to go create a business who

3972
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:57,939
asked a profit by selling the country

3973
02:17:56,530 --> 02:18:00,131
and growing it and buying the land and

3974
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:00,370
all that they're going to be up against

3975
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:03,849
it

3976
02:18:00,370 --> 02:18:08,591
competing with trash so yeah so they're

3977
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:11,770
up against the big companies yep so some

3978
02:18:08,591 --> 02:18:13,899
of the the nutrients that I've found her

3979
02:18:11,770 --> 02:18:16,180
a little more harder to find in organic

3980
02:18:13,899 --> 02:18:18,609
you micronutrients are you trace

3981
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:20,530
elements and things maybe that aren't

3982
02:18:18,610 --> 02:18:22,060
trace elements like silica are often

3983
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:23,950
hard to come across in the organic

3984
02:18:22,059 --> 02:18:25,630
setting for a lot of people

3985
02:18:23,950 --> 02:18:27,310
well you recommend people get their

3986
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:29,859
trace minerals from zoar things like

3987
02:18:27,309 --> 02:18:33,130
silica well silica covers most of

3988
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:36,310
Earth's and even though it's not a you

3989
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:37,750
know via necessary nutrient for plant

3990
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:39,219
growth as far as they say it's in almost

3991
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:42,341
all the plants they find a way to get it

3992
02:18:39,219 --> 02:18:44,429
even though we shouldn't be able to so I

3993
02:18:42,341 --> 02:18:46,809
think that just rock dust will be fine

3994
02:18:44,430 --> 02:18:48,399
beyond that you know there's other

3995
02:18:46,809 --> 02:18:50,889
products there that are out there like

3996
02:18:48,399 --> 02:18:52,210
the potassium silicates but those are

3997
02:18:50,889 --> 02:18:53,500
only approved for organic used as a

3998
02:18:52,210 --> 02:18:55,840
foliar spray and so I've been moving

3999
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:57,610
away from those other products will have

4000
02:18:55,841 --> 02:18:59,350
silica like the rice hulls and so you

4001
02:18:57,610 --> 02:19:00,909
can start to find out what in your area

4002
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:02,770
might have a silica content and then

4003
02:19:00,909 --> 02:19:05,500
ferment that or feed it to the soil so

4004
02:19:02,770 --> 02:19:07,180
when it breaks down at add silica and

4005
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:08,770
when it comes to trace minerals anything

4006
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:11,470
from the oceans gonna have all of it so

4007
02:19:08,770 --> 02:19:13,239
adding that's why I added fish to the

4008
02:19:11,469 --> 02:19:14,699
old pile with the corn and the beans in

4009
02:19:13,239 --> 02:19:17,949
the in you know the Native American

4010
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:19,480
principles it works and adding kelp meal

4011
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:22,600
works it has all the trace minerals

4012
02:19:19,479 --> 02:19:24,639
organically chelated ready to go and it

4013
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:26,290
can even you know kelp grows in a high

4014
02:19:24,639 --> 02:19:28,421
salt environment so it doesn't take salt

4015
02:19:26,290 --> 02:19:30,050
into itself it's not super super salty

4016
02:19:28,421 --> 02:19:32,510
it will have some to it

4017
02:19:30,049 --> 02:19:33,679
but it works other than that rock dust

4018
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:35,659
I'll have all your trace minerals too

4019
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:37,610
and so it need be that it's you know too

4020
02:19:35,659 --> 02:19:39,319
hard to find what was probably hard to

4021
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:43,130
find is a specific like manganese

4022
02:19:39,319 --> 02:19:44,389
sulfate or copper sulfate the map being

4023
02:19:43,129 --> 02:19:45,319
said a lot of your organic gardeners

4024
02:19:44,389 --> 02:19:47,689
aren't really using those right now

4025
02:19:45,319 --> 02:19:49,101
they're still scared by that good so I'm

4026
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:50,630
having to it I'm wanting to create a

4027
02:19:49,101 --> 02:19:51,920
soil that has some of those in it that's

4028
02:19:50,629 --> 02:19:53,930
fully been really balanced for our

4029
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:55,579
larger scale customers I'll probably

4030
02:19:53,931 --> 02:19:59,210
still keep two soils one with those in

4031
02:19:55,579 --> 02:20:03,789
it one without you know yeah so you just

4032
02:19:59,209 --> 02:20:06,829
kind of spurred on this question often

4033
02:20:03,790 --> 02:20:09,950
whenever someone looks up a kind of a

4034
02:20:06,829 --> 02:20:11,659
deficiency diagnostic chart there will

4035
02:20:09,950 --> 02:20:13,670
be all these different photos of you

4036
02:20:11,659 --> 02:20:16,129
know this is a boron deficiency this is

4037
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:17,780
how iron deficiency I have for the life

4038
02:20:16,129 --> 02:20:20,270
of me never seen any of those

4039
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:22,070
deficiencies in an organic grow do you

4040
02:20:20,271 --> 02:20:25,221
think that getting something like you

4041
02:20:22,069 --> 02:20:27,681
know a zinc deficiency is fairly

4042
02:20:25,220 --> 02:20:30,439
exclusive to a hydroponic grow and that

4043
02:20:27,681 --> 02:20:32,659
organic growing tends to just work those

4044
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:36,710
kind of fine a nutrient see out

4045
02:20:32,659 --> 02:20:38,090
themselves I thought so but you know

4046
02:20:36,709 --> 02:20:40,339
when we're seeing fall season plants

4047
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:41,450
grown ten fifteen pounds people are

4048
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:43,010
experiencing some of these similar

4049
02:20:41,450 --> 02:20:45,650
results and so we're really pushing the

4050
02:20:43,010 --> 02:20:48,110
boundaries and at at an agricultural

4051
02:20:45,649 --> 02:20:49,399
scale micronutrient balancing is very

4052
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:51,530
important and they're aware of the

4053
02:20:49,399 --> 02:20:53,270
downfalls I guess the way I look at it

4054
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:54,620
is yeah you can build a house with wood

4055
02:20:53,271 --> 02:20:56,329
and you need a ton of wood to do it but

4056
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:59,601
those little tiny nails hold it all

4057
02:20:56,329 --> 02:21:01,579
together and so those would be the boron

4058
02:20:59,601 --> 02:21:03,079
and so if if you're a building block and

4059
02:21:01,579 --> 02:21:04,549
a boron is necessary to make something

4060
02:21:03,079 --> 02:21:07,610
you don't have it it's going to be a

4061
02:21:04,549 --> 02:21:09,199
problem now nature can diversify doesn't

4062
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:10,790
put all its eggs in one basket it has

4063
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,170
more than one way of doing things but

4064
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:14,540
you're certainly gonna put stress on

4065
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:16,819
this system once you get past that once

4066
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:18,351
you get to that limiting factor and so I

4067
02:21:16,819 --> 02:21:20,090
mentioned earlier one over some of our

4068
02:21:18,351 --> 02:21:21,530
growers in fact there's a thread on IC

4069
02:21:20,090 --> 02:21:23,450
mag that I'm involved in right now and

4070
02:21:21,530 --> 02:21:24,771
the advancing eco agriculture thread

4071
02:21:23,450 --> 02:21:26,840
where I just posted some of our soil

4072
02:21:24,771 --> 02:21:29,000
test results under my moniker Mile High

4073
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:30,200
guy I've not used it in a long time the

4074
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,250
reason why is something that people grow

4075
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:33,021
in full season we're having problems

4076
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:34,549
with our soil and other people are

4077
02:21:33,021 --> 02:21:36,079
having really good success with our soil

4078
02:21:34,549 --> 02:21:37,430
and so we're trying to improve we're

4079
02:21:36,079 --> 02:21:39,649
trying to find out what's going on and

4080
02:21:37,431 --> 02:21:41,090
it looks like the boron it looks like

4081
02:21:39,649 --> 02:21:43,279
the copper and some of these things are

4082
02:21:41,090 --> 02:21:43,489
becoming really really important when it

4083
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:45,739
comes

4084
02:21:43,489 --> 02:21:47,959
two full season plants and balancing the

4085
02:21:45,739 --> 02:21:49,760
soil because if the calcium is there but

4086
02:21:47,959 --> 02:21:51,789
the water has tons of carbonate sand

4087
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:53,899
it's locking some of the calcium out and

4088
02:21:51,790 --> 02:21:55,101
Boren might help that or whatever the

4089
02:21:53,899 --> 02:21:58,039
case is you know I'm just kind of

4090
02:21:55,101 --> 02:21:59,450
talking out of my ass now I know it

4091
02:21:58,040 --> 02:22:01,130
can't be important and I really feel

4092
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:04,010
like every detail will be important when

4093
02:22:01,129 --> 02:22:06,759
we get to that level so we're looking

4094
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:09,710
into all of that but certainly

4095
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:11,569
hydroponics has you in control where you

4096
02:22:09,709 --> 02:22:12,890
have to add all of these at exact

4097
02:22:11,569 --> 02:22:14,420
proportions and I don't think we're

4098
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:16,069
intelligent enough to know that so as

4099
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:17,810
long as we get it to the point where

4100
02:22:16,069 --> 02:22:20,390
it's into soil and it's above the

4101
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:21,860
limiting factor I feel like organics is

4102
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:23,209
not going to have those issues it's

4103
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:24,829
going to sort it out on its own it's

4104
02:22:23,209 --> 02:22:26,899
gonna do significantly better but in

4105
02:22:24,829 --> 02:22:28,670
hydro it's very clear you don't have

4106
02:22:26,899 --> 02:22:30,250
boron it's not there it's not gonna get

4107
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:32,390
it you'll have a boron deficiency

4108
02:22:30,250 --> 02:22:34,069
somehow a nature we're able to overcome

4109
02:22:32,390 --> 02:22:36,709
that there's some more on there and it's

4110
02:22:34,069 --> 02:22:38,119
going to do a little bit but it's much

4111
02:22:36,709 --> 02:22:42,140
more apparent hydro that's what those

4112
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:44,210
photos come from so yeah so let's talk

4113
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:45,890
about some of mistakes that um you know

4114
02:22:44,209 --> 02:22:48,799
converted growers make when they're

4115
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:52,459
transitioning to organics you know maybe

4116
02:22:48,799 --> 02:22:55,970
we'll talk about some some likely

4117
02:22:52,459 --> 02:22:57,739
reasons yeah some likely reasons as to

4118
02:22:55,970 --> 02:22:59,329
why they're running into problems so I

4119
02:22:57,739 --> 02:23:01,039
just give you some topics and you can

4120
02:22:59,329 --> 02:23:02,750
just let us know what you think so yeah

4121
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:04,400
if someone's got bugs and they've just

4122
02:23:02,750 --> 02:23:06,260
converted to organic we're talking you

4123
02:23:04,399 --> 02:23:08,390
know fungus gnats

4124
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:11,260
you know annoying bugs not spider mites

4125
02:23:08,390 --> 02:23:13,970
what do you think their problem is oh

4126
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:15,560
that's tough to say the ecosystems not

4127
02:23:13,970 --> 02:23:17,329
fully developed and so in a no-till

4128
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:18,649
system that's been going on a long time

4129
02:23:17,329 --> 02:23:20,659
you'll pull back the mulch and you'll

4130
02:23:18,649 --> 02:23:23,329
find so much diversity it's ridiculous

4131
02:23:20,659 --> 02:23:25,399
and so what what's more challenging in

4132
02:23:23,329 --> 02:23:28,310
that system is for any one thing to get

4133
02:23:25,399 --> 02:23:30,140
out of proportion and scale and when we

4134
02:23:28,310 --> 02:23:31,760
have a fresh soil that's a really wet on

4135
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:33,199
top we're trying to keep the mulch and

4136
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:35,300
top dress and do all these fantastic

4137
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:37,670
things we learn about we're breeding the

4138
02:23:35,299 --> 02:23:39,439
perfect habitat for fungus gnats and if

4139
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:41,120
they're implemented and you know the

4140
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:42,319
ecosystem isn't so developed and things

4141
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:44,000
that eat fungus gnats because they

4142
02:23:42,319 --> 02:23:46,520
haven't been there we're gonna have that

4143
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,319
problem and so like I said outdoors and

4144
02:23:46,521 --> 02:23:49,880
it may not be an issue though fungus

4145
02:23:48,319 --> 02:23:51,319
gnats indoors in a tent it's a big

4146
02:23:49,879 --> 02:23:53,359
problem they get in your fan and your

4147
02:23:51,319 --> 02:23:54,709
light they get in the buds and so now

4148
02:23:53,360 --> 02:23:55,819
all of a sudden we can't wait for these

4149
02:23:54,709 --> 02:23:57,409
predators to come in

4150
02:23:55,819 --> 02:24:00,649
we have to sort of create that ecosystem

4151
02:23:57,409 --> 02:24:03,079
on our own and so I think a brand new

4152
02:24:00,649 --> 02:24:04,909
grower number one mistake they're making

4153
02:24:03,079 --> 02:24:07,789
is potentially maybe a little over

4154
02:24:04,909 --> 02:24:09,440
watering maybe there's just up against

4155
02:24:07,790 --> 02:24:12,370
it maybe they had fungus not larva in

4156
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:14,899
there there's nothing they can do and so

4157
02:24:12,370 --> 02:24:16,610
from there having a big nurse oil having

4158
02:24:14,899 --> 02:24:17,869
a fuller ecosystem having the predator

4159
02:24:16,610 --> 02:24:21,801
mites having all of those different

4160
02:24:17,870 --> 02:24:23,420
variables is really it helped that but

4161
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:25,640
it's tough to say exactly what they're

4162
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:28,040
doing wrong yeah and so let's just say

4163
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:30,020
someone did have some fungus gnats what

4164
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:31,221
would be and they're the new convert to

4165
02:24:30,021 --> 02:24:33,561
organic what would be your

4166
02:24:31,220 --> 02:24:35,209
recommendations for how they handle the

4167
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:37,190
pest management you know like their IPM

4168
02:24:35,209 --> 02:24:38,869
because this is something I get asked a

4169
02:24:37,190 --> 02:24:41,329
lot because I'm always trying to convert

4170
02:24:38,870 --> 02:24:43,579
people over and they usually get fungus

4171
02:24:41,329 --> 02:24:45,351
gnats and then my usual answer is get

4172
02:24:43,579 --> 02:24:47,690
some neem or some predator and nematodes

4173
02:24:45,351 --> 02:24:50,450
what would be your recommendation as

4174
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:51,649
like a first port of call yep that would

4175
02:24:50,450 --> 02:24:53,301
be my recommendation and if they've

4176
02:24:51,649 --> 02:24:54,979
noticed it's because the top is wet and

4177
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:56,899
they are mulching and maybe over watered

4178
02:24:54,979 --> 02:24:58,550
Allah as I previously mentioned just

4179
02:24:56,899 --> 02:24:59,899
scraping that entire mulch layer off put

4180
02:24:58,550 --> 02:25:02,149
it in a trash bag getting it out of the

4181
02:24:59,899 --> 02:25:03,920
house going in sprinkling down you know

4182
02:25:02,149 --> 02:25:05,029
the frass or the neem cake or whatever

4183
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:07,101
you've got that's gonna help as a

4184
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:09,230
preventative and then covering that with

4185
02:25:07,101 --> 02:25:10,880
a premium barrier like a compost or a

4186
02:25:09,229 --> 02:25:13,011
vermicompost that's not you know

4187
02:25:10,879 --> 02:25:14,329
infested with larvae and I feel like

4188
02:25:13,011 --> 02:25:16,940
that should almost wipe it out because

4189
02:25:14,329 --> 02:25:18,979
it removes most of the larvae and it

4190
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:20,899
covers it with a drier layer of a

4191
02:25:18,979 --> 02:25:23,930
material that has a lot of bacteria and

4192
02:25:20,899 --> 02:25:25,670
benefits and it should be good but

4193
02:25:23,931 --> 02:25:27,351
here's where it adds insult to injury I

4194
02:25:25,670 --> 02:25:28,879
tell somebody that may take compost full

4195
02:25:27,351 --> 02:25:31,641
of fungus gnat larvae and pile it on and

4196
02:25:28,879 --> 02:25:32,839
it probably just getting worse now I've

4197
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:34,729
had people that have gotten all the

4198
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:36,409
nematodes all the mites and everything

4199
02:25:34,729 --> 02:25:38,149
had still had a problem and it's only

4200
02:25:36,409 --> 02:25:39,950
one of their areas and one of their own

4201
02:25:38,149 --> 02:25:42,261
rooms and I cannot figure it out and so

4202
02:25:39,950 --> 02:25:43,909
if one thing is proven for sure it's

4203
02:25:42,261 --> 02:25:45,440
that farmers are never gonna have it a

4204
02:25:43,909 --> 02:25:46,909
hundred percent Easy Street we're gonna

4205
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:48,681
have to earn a little bit of this and in

4206
02:25:46,909 --> 02:25:50,479
nature when we have you know hundred

4207
02:25:48,681 --> 02:25:53,420
acres there's a certain percentage of

4208
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:54,800
crop loss it's just a given it doors

4209
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:57,200
with two plants we're not gonna allow

4210
02:25:54,800 --> 02:26:00,949
for any of that and so it's one of those

4211
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:02,570
things where we're not gonna win every

4212
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:04,311
single battle and sometimes having to

4213
02:26:02,569 --> 02:26:07,579
start over and scrap it build new soil

4214
02:26:04,310 --> 02:26:09,350
maybe what has to happen to artificially

4215
02:26:07,579 --> 02:26:11,600
create this mono crop indoors

4216
02:26:09,350 --> 02:26:14,210
you know lights but still be organic

4217
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:15,350
there it's kind of hypocritical and so

4218
02:26:14,209 --> 02:26:17,179
we're gonna have some of these issues

4219
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:19,908
that are a byproduct of our own creation

4220
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:21,170
like Masanobu Fukuoka says as soon as

4221
02:26:19,908 --> 02:26:23,420
you prune the first branch on the tree

4222
02:26:21,170 --> 02:26:25,189
well you're in control of it for from

4223
02:26:23,420 --> 02:26:26,658
now on out as soon as we put the

4224
02:26:25,189 --> 02:26:28,040
container indoors and throw the light up

4225
02:26:26,658 --> 02:26:30,228
well we're gonna have some of these

4226
02:26:28,040 --> 02:26:32,300
issues to deal with and so it becomes

4227
02:26:30,228 --> 02:26:34,309
more in building your confidence and how

4228
02:26:32,299 --> 02:26:36,289
little it might affect you or how able

4229
02:26:34,309 --> 02:26:37,789
you are to get rid of it and I think

4230
02:26:36,290 --> 02:26:38,659
that you know that's really the main

4231
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:40,880
difference maker

4232
02:26:38,658 --> 02:26:42,469
I had powdery mildew on an outdoor plant

4233
02:26:40,879 --> 02:26:44,568
this year and all in one area none of

4234
02:26:42,469 --> 02:26:47,059
the others had it well I tested a

4235
02:26:44,568 --> 02:26:50,778
treatment which is the product we carry

4236
02:26:47,059 --> 02:26:52,939
with peppermint bora-bora and some

4237
02:26:50,779 --> 02:26:53,810
enzymes it's totally harmless but I was

4238
02:26:52,939 --> 02:26:55,729
worried it would taste like peppermint

4239
02:26:53,809 --> 02:26:57,648
on the buds and talk to the manufacturer

4240
02:26:55,728 --> 02:26:58,938
they didn't feel like it was a high

4241
02:26:57,648 --> 02:27:00,590
enough percentage to do that it would be

4242
02:26:58,939 --> 02:27:02,119
too volatile and went off gas so I

4243
02:27:00,590 --> 02:27:04,369
sprayed the whole plant down three times

4244
02:27:02,119 --> 02:27:05,869
and the pattern is completely gone and

4245
02:27:04,369 --> 02:27:07,520
so I was willing to gamble a little bit

4246
02:27:05,869 --> 02:27:09,109
to learn that lesson and if I have a

4247
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:10,488
problem again next year I guarantee well

4248
02:27:09,109 --> 02:27:13,908
what about that same thing it'll work

4249
02:27:10,488 --> 02:27:15,439
but preventatively we talked about hydro

4250
02:27:13,908 --> 02:27:17,510
versus organic before and a lot of times

4251
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:19,309
the differences like Western medicine

4252
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:21,199
treats symptoms by covering them up a

4253
02:27:19,309 --> 02:27:23,148
lot of times hydro methods will do the

4254
02:27:21,199 --> 02:27:24,890
same organically we're trying to get

4255
02:27:23,148 --> 02:27:26,478
back to what's causing that problem and

4256
02:27:24,889 --> 02:27:29,809
fix it and that would be like I said

4257
02:27:26,478 --> 02:27:31,519
maybe the copper was why that plant got

4258
02:27:29,809 --> 02:27:33,170
powdery mildew whatever but I don't know

4259
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:34,699
that I don't pretend to I just know that

4260
02:27:33,170 --> 02:27:37,369
I'm learning more about it that you know

4261
02:27:34,699 --> 02:27:40,970
everyday yeah so what would be your

4262
02:27:37,369 --> 02:27:42,829
advice to the new convert on how to

4263
02:27:40,969 --> 02:27:44,868
approach troubleshooting because this is

4264
02:27:42,829 --> 02:27:48,260
something I find is the biggest issue is

4265
02:27:44,869 --> 02:27:50,180
the way they try to solve problems if

4266
02:27:48,260 --> 02:27:52,189
you start to think about the soil you

4267
02:27:50,180 --> 02:27:55,398
say okay the soil was recently made I

4268
02:27:52,189 --> 02:27:57,439
follow a proven recipe most likely it's

4269
02:27:55,398 --> 02:27:59,478
not a lack of nutrients but more a lock

4270
02:27:57,439 --> 02:28:01,729
out in there what I'm gonna look at is

4271
02:27:59,478 --> 02:28:04,368
the over water did i under water and how

4272
02:28:01,728 --> 02:28:06,019
do I verify that well keeping track of

4273
02:28:04,369 --> 02:28:08,600
the weight of the container and how

4274
02:28:06,020 --> 02:28:10,010
heavy it feels at its ultimate moisture

4275
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:11,270
content should tell you if it's heavier

4276
02:28:10,010 --> 02:28:13,520
than that you've over watered if it's

4277
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:15,050
much lighter you're under watering then

4278
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:16,340
from there what affects the moisture

4279
02:28:15,049 --> 02:28:17,448
uptake is going to be the root movement

4280
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:19,250
so one of the things that a lot of

4281
02:28:17,449 --> 02:28:21,079
growers don't look at which can be very

4282
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:21,810
important with energy-efficient lights

4283
02:28:21,079 --> 02:28:25,950
in organics

4284
02:28:21,810 --> 02:28:27,751
oil is the VPD or vapor pressure deficit

4285
02:28:25,950 --> 02:28:30,181
which is the relationship with humidity

4286
02:28:27,751 --> 02:28:31,351
and temperature in the grow room and so

4287
02:28:30,181 --> 02:28:33,271
if you've gotten way too high of a

4288
02:28:31,351 --> 02:28:34,711
humidity it creates this pressure where

4289
02:28:33,271 --> 02:28:36,329
the plants can't drink and then just

4290
02:28:34,710 --> 02:28:37,979
slow down and they're not growing even

4291
02:28:36,329 --> 02:28:39,870
the like bacon and even though the

4292
02:28:37,979 --> 02:28:41,880
nutrients are there and then you have

4293
02:28:39,870 --> 02:28:44,041
the opposite where you have a 40% grow

4294
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:45,329
room humidity and it's at 80 degrees

4295
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:48,029
because you're not wanting mold but

4296
02:28:45,329 --> 02:28:49,380
certain cultivars are not going to be

4297
02:28:48,030 --> 02:28:52,079
able to transpire they will shut down

4298
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:53,069
three three hours into that grow all the

4299
02:28:52,079 --> 02:28:54,050
nutrients are there but they're not

4300
02:28:53,069 --> 02:28:56,761
gonna take it up because they're not

4301
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:58,649
photosynthesizing in photosynthesis is

4302
02:28:56,761 --> 02:29:01,110
so important that's what we have to look

4303
02:28:58,649 --> 02:29:02,940
at if the nutrients are in there we know

4304
02:29:01,110 --> 02:29:04,771
we made the soil Dennis look in an

4305
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:06,181
environment looking at watering them and

4306
02:29:04,771 --> 02:29:08,579
if you go through those every time oh my

4307
02:29:06,181 --> 02:29:10,771
god I got a problem well [ __ ] this is

4308
02:29:08,579 --> 02:29:12,511
really old soil it might actually be a

4309
02:29:10,771 --> 02:29:13,711
lack of nutrients well then I want you

4310
02:29:12,511 --> 02:29:15,780
to consider that look at topdressing

4311
02:29:13,710 --> 02:29:17,420
your failure if you go oh my god what's

4312
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:19,771
gone I got a deficiency it's yellowing

4313
02:29:17,421 --> 02:29:21,511
well then you just start to think is it

4314
02:29:19,771 --> 02:29:23,159
new soil yes it shouldn't be nutrients

4315
02:29:21,511 --> 02:29:24,989
then okay how's my environment oh [ __ ]

4316
02:29:23,159 --> 02:29:27,210
my environments off problem solved

4317
02:29:24,989 --> 02:29:28,800
oh my environments dull my soils fresh

4318
02:29:27,210 --> 02:29:30,149
and that's dialed what could this

4319
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:31,890
possibly be well I'm gonna look at

4320
02:29:30,149 --> 02:29:34,109
moisture is it too heavy is it over

4321
02:29:31,890 --> 02:29:36,421
water is it under water if I'm positive

4322
02:29:34,110 --> 02:29:38,730
then across the board perfect the water

4323
02:29:36,421 --> 02:29:40,021
is right the environments right I know I

4324
02:29:38,729 --> 02:29:42,569
made the soil and I followed all the

4325
02:29:40,021 --> 02:29:43,980
protocol well if it's every single plant

4326
02:29:42,569 --> 02:29:45,421
a grow room I'm gonna go Ollie [ __ ]

4327
02:29:43,979 --> 02:29:46,800
maybe that compost wasn't as good as I

4328
02:29:45,421 --> 02:29:48,450
thought it was or look at some of those

4329
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:50,310
variable inputs if it's only one or two

4330
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:52,291
plants I'm gonna say okay is this a

4331
02:29:50,310 --> 02:29:53,729
different genetic or if it's not a

4332
02:29:52,290 --> 02:29:54,840
different genetic is it potentially in

4333
02:29:53,729 --> 02:29:57,060
the corner of the grow room where the

4334
02:29:54,841 --> 02:29:59,280
fan is hitting it is it right under the

4335
02:29:57,060 --> 02:30:00,899
light in the hottest area it's after

4336
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:03,211
I've ruled out all of those basic

4337
02:30:00,899 --> 02:30:04,319
variables I'm gonna get a friend

4338
02:30:03,210 --> 02:30:06,239
involved and you're like what the hell

4339
02:30:04,319 --> 02:30:09,001
am I not seeing that you might you know

4340
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:10,739
be able to see here it's kind of like

4341
02:30:09,001 --> 02:30:12,659
proofreading your own report in school

4342
02:30:10,739 --> 02:30:14,130
let's just sometimes you just skim over

4343
02:30:12,659 --> 02:30:16,369
the same exact mistakes over and over

4344
02:30:14,130 --> 02:30:18,239
again and it could be really simple

4345
02:30:16,370 --> 02:30:20,221
shoot maybe it's your first time

4346
02:30:18,239 --> 02:30:21,659
experiencing a really bad Russert my

4347
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:24,239
problem and you think it's a nutrient

4348
02:30:21,659 --> 02:30:26,011
uptake issue so adding a professional

4349
02:30:24,239 --> 02:30:28,591
help at some point even if it's just a

4350
02:30:26,011 --> 02:30:31,890
friend can be a big time help but the

4351
02:30:28,591 --> 02:30:34,200
main things environment muttering how

4352
02:30:31,890 --> 02:30:35,728
old how do the soil is you know when -

4353
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:37,560
the last time I Teeter talk press

4354
02:30:35,728 --> 02:30:39,028
you answer all those honestly you'll

4355
02:30:37,559 --> 02:30:41,879
know if it's a lockout or a deficiency

4356
02:30:39,029 --> 02:30:43,380
and you know how to go forward so yeah

4357
02:30:41,879 --> 02:30:45,148
and I think that's kind of funny that

4358
02:30:43,379 --> 02:30:48,028
you mentioned that resset might thing

4359
02:30:45,148 --> 02:30:50,340
because anyone who watches a really cool

4360
02:30:48,029 --> 02:30:51,810
grower on YouTube or MIDI cropper he

4361
02:30:50,340 --> 02:30:53,340
were he had a very similar thing

4362
02:30:51,809 --> 02:30:54,959
happened to him and it it took like

4363
02:30:53,340 --> 02:30:57,930
months before he realized what happened

4364
02:30:54,959 --> 02:30:59,219
but I mean it was really really like new

4365
02:30:57,930 --> 02:31:01,139
lights and he thought it was the lights

4366
02:30:59,219 --> 02:31:02,519
and it turns out it wasn't bad yeah he

4367
02:31:01,139 --> 02:31:03,898
thought it was the nutrients at first

4368
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:05,908
and then he thought it was the lights

4369
02:31:03,898 --> 02:31:07,439
and they thought it was blower blah but

4370
02:31:05,908 --> 02:31:08,879
yeah and he couldn't he was just

4371
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:09,840
visually looking for the Russert mites

4372
02:31:08,879 --> 02:31:11,868
and he couldn't see them and obviously

4373
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:14,130
they're a lot smaller than spider mites

4374
02:31:11,869 --> 02:31:15,840
that point everything that was a problem

4375
02:31:14,129 --> 02:31:17,549
you could see and so this is the first

4376
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:19,619
time you have to scope every week as a

4377
02:31:17,549 --> 02:31:21,349
part of your IPM to look for things you

4378
02:31:19,619 --> 02:31:24,659
can't even see as a potential problem

4379
02:31:21,350 --> 02:31:27,390
yeah that's very become a lot door that

4380
02:31:24,658 --> 02:31:28,770
get you know wilt some sort of fungus or

4381
02:31:27,389 --> 02:31:30,959
Foose Aryan problem that is just

4382
02:31:28,770 --> 02:31:32,729
horrific and so then we look at

4383
02:31:30,959 --> 02:31:34,498
micronutrients as potentially the cause

4384
02:31:32,728 --> 02:31:37,078
of that excess phosphorus not enough

4385
02:31:34,498 --> 02:31:39,270
micronutrients causing these little

4386
02:31:37,078 --> 02:31:42,148
festering problems that can become you

4387
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:44,699
know really good home just for pathogens

4388
02:31:42,148 --> 02:31:46,680
and so I think that's probably why

4389
02:31:44,699 --> 02:31:47,939
Australia is monitoring the phosphorus

4390
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:49,318
and how it affects the water how it

4391
02:31:47,939 --> 02:31:50,880
affects the plants and all these things

4392
02:31:49,318 --> 02:31:53,010
is there aware the larger ecosystem

4393
02:31:50,879 --> 02:31:54,568
impact that we're starting to learn

4394
02:31:53,010 --> 02:31:56,728
about where we you know grow in these

4395
02:31:54,568 --> 02:31:58,078
methods yeah I mean I would love to

4396
02:31:56,728 --> 02:31:59,639
think the government has that kind of

4397
02:31:58,078 --> 02:32:04,889
forethought but based on other issues

4398
02:31:59,639 --> 02:32:08,309
I'm not quite so sure but anyway so last

4399
02:32:04,889 --> 02:32:10,559
one for this section reusing soil what

4400
02:32:08,309 --> 02:32:12,299
would be your advice to the new so

4401
02:32:10,559 --> 02:32:14,010
someone just finish their first organic

4402
02:32:12,299 --> 02:32:16,078
grow and they've been hearing about

4403
02:32:14,010 --> 02:32:18,680
reusing their soil how should they

4404
02:32:16,078 --> 02:32:22,078
actually do it for their first time I

4405
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:24,328
take the plant and I would let's say I

4406
02:32:22,078 --> 02:32:25,859
just harvested and I brought it out of

4407
02:32:24,328 --> 02:32:27,840
the rib now I'm left with one container

4408
02:32:25,859 --> 02:32:30,748
it's got a stock sticking out of it and

4409
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:33,328
I'm ready to go for ease we'll just

4410
02:32:30,748 --> 02:32:34,889
pretend this is a 15 gallon because

4411
02:32:33,328 --> 02:32:38,850
that's kind of what we recommend as a

4412
02:32:34,889 --> 02:32:40,260
minimum size for started yeah and you'll

4413
02:32:38,850 --> 02:32:42,029
take that you'll you'll cut the plant

4414
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:44,789
down and from there there's a couple

4415
02:32:42,029 --> 02:32:46,710
different questions in a no-till in a

4416
02:32:44,789 --> 02:32:48,060
big bed one might just plant a clone a

4417
02:32:46,709 --> 02:32:49,560
foot to the right of that

4418
02:32:48,059 --> 02:32:50,699
well the 15 gallon

4419
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:51,899
foot to the right I mean you're not in

4420
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:53,610
the container anymore so you're probably

4421
02:32:51,899 --> 02:32:55,079
gonna dig out that stock in that root

4422
02:32:53,610 --> 02:32:57,090
ball and put your clone right back in

4423
02:32:55,079 --> 02:32:58,709
that hole and when I do that I'm gonna

4424
02:32:57,090 --> 02:33:00,780
sprinkle my coryza in the hole but the

4425
02:32:58,709 --> 02:33:02,369
cloning once it's in there I will

4426
02:33:00,780 --> 02:33:04,261
sprinkle back some nutrients that I know

4427
02:33:02,370 --> 02:33:06,360
are never gonna hurt but could be

4428
02:33:04,261 --> 02:33:08,460
lacking and that could be whatever I

4429
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:10,771
have kelp crustacean neem anything

4430
02:33:08,459 --> 02:33:12,359
well-rounded the blend of all three if I

4431
02:33:10,771 --> 02:33:15,360
just had neem I would do that - pretty

4432
02:33:12,360 --> 02:33:16,980
good NPK well well-rounded and I would

4433
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:19,739
top dress that and then cover that with

4434
02:33:16,979 --> 02:33:21,750
a little compost that's all you have to

4435
02:33:19,739 --> 02:33:23,129
do if you really wanted to you could

4436
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:24,450
like put some gypsum in and a few other

4437
02:33:23,129 --> 02:33:27,680
things and really start thinking about

4438
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:30,570
it but for the most part if that plant

4439
02:33:27,681 --> 02:33:32,940
when harvested wasn't completely just

4440
02:33:30,569 --> 02:33:34,199
your brain it wasn't like ten times the

4441
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:35,971
size that it should have been in that

4442
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:37,710
little container and it wasn't just

4443
02:33:35,970 --> 02:33:39,209
completely flushed meaning it was just a

4444
02:33:37,709 --> 02:33:40,589
nice transition good sized plant

4445
02:33:39,209 --> 02:33:42,390
probably still had some more nutrients

4446
02:33:40,590 --> 02:33:43,799
in there I would just harvest it

4447
02:33:42,390 --> 02:33:45,600
immediately plants another one in there

4448
02:33:43,799 --> 02:33:47,699
sprinkle some nutrients on top cover it

4449
02:33:45,601 --> 02:33:50,159
with compost and I'm ready to go and I

4450
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:51,320
do that all the time if you know we have

4451
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:53,399
a real big

4452
02:33:51,319 --> 02:33:54,750
but if they've got their own organic

4453
02:33:53,399 --> 02:33:57,181
nutrients at home a lot of times when

4454
02:33:54,750 --> 02:33:58,829
was talk of in and doing that and so for

4455
02:33:57,181 --> 02:34:01,649
a 15 gallon container we know that

4456
02:33:58,829 --> 02:34:03,299
that's about two cubic feet and normally

4457
02:34:01,649 --> 02:34:05,879
our recommendation would building soil

4458
02:34:03,299 --> 02:34:07,529
is about one and a half to three cups of

4459
02:34:05,879 --> 02:34:10,439
nutrients at the very most per cubic

4460
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:12,300
foot so in a top dress I would probably

4461
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:15,120
never put more than three cups of

4462
02:34:12,299 --> 02:34:16,770
nutrients on top you could probably

4463
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:18,150
realize I do six without hurting

4464
02:34:16,771 --> 02:34:19,829
anything but I would just put a cup of

4465
02:34:18,149 --> 02:34:21,329
this cup of that up to three cups cover

4466
02:34:19,829 --> 02:34:23,220
it with compost and that's how you go

4467
02:34:21,329 --> 02:34:25,681
and you'll experience some really good

4468
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:26,970
results doing them if you really want to

4469
02:34:25,681 --> 02:34:28,860
take it to the next level you can send

4470
02:34:26,970 --> 02:34:31,140
some of that soil off for a sample at

4471
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:32,730
the soil lab get a report back and

4472
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:34,590
analyze it and I guarantee you're gonna

4473
02:34:32,729 --> 02:34:37,770
be surprised at how little that report

4474
02:34:34,590 --> 02:34:39,630
is gonna have you add back the only

4475
02:34:37,771 --> 02:34:41,311
caveat there's if you grew a really big

4476
02:34:39,629 --> 02:34:42,869
plant and you really did water a lot it

4477
02:34:41,310 --> 02:34:45,659
might be really low in nitrogen and

4478
02:34:42,870 --> 02:34:47,040
calcium and stuff once you're done but

4479
02:34:45,659 --> 02:34:48,511
certainly even those few cups of

4480
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:50,011
amendments and compost would probably be

4481
02:34:48,511 --> 02:34:52,620
enough to get you going on that next

4482
02:34:50,011 --> 02:34:54,090
cycle and before a flower you could

4483
02:34:52,620 --> 02:34:58,891
judge again if you wanted a top dress

4484
02:34:54,090 --> 02:35:00,420
again so on that same note like the the

4485
02:34:58,890 --> 02:35:03,109
nutrients potentially needing

4486
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:05,751
replacement if they've been leached out

4487
02:35:03,110 --> 02:35:09,230
do you find that it's necessary /

4488
02:35:05,751 --> 02:35:11,300
advisable for people to water until

4489
02:35:09,229 --> 02:35:13,161
there is that 10 percent runoff like

4490
02:35:11,300 --> 02:35:16,341
what people advised in hydroponics or

4491
02:35:13,161 --> 02:35:17,720
not necessarily no I didn't know runoff

4492
02:35:16,341 --> 02:35:19,489
and the reason why is we don't have

4493
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:21,710
salts that we need to exchange and get

4494
02:35:19,489 --> 02:35:22,940
out and we're not replacing what

4495
02:35:21,710 --> 02:35:27,340
nutrients are in there with a new

4496
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:29,541
balance the water is more of just the

4497
02:35:27,341 --> 02:35:31,819
carrying medium it's just keeping it

4498
02:35:29,540 --> 02:35:33,109
moist so I don't do any runoff if

4499
02:35:31,819 --> 02:35:34,610
anything I will notice a little runoff

4500
02:35:33,110 --> 02:35:36,951
and I'll stop so I'm not like I'm

4501
02:35:34,610 --> 02:35:38,721
worried about it but I like in Cocoa you

4502
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:40,580
have to have an exchange you have to

4503
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:42,319
push all the old out get all the new in

4504
02:35:40,581 --> 02:35:44,210
and you need a large amount of runoff to

4505
02:35:42,319 --> 02:35:47,300
do that properly which is wasteful and

4506
02:35:44,210 --> 02:35:48,501
so the main problem we have is probably

4507
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:49,911
the opposite when you're not getting

4508
02:35:48,501 --> 02:35:51,229
runoff and you're in a big container

4509
02:35:49,911 --> 02:35:52,761
making sure that you don't get that

4510
02:35:51,229 --> 02:35:56,810
bottom of the container just totally

4511
02:35:52,761 --> 02:35:58,310
soaking wet all the time yeah okay well

4512
02:35:56,810 --> 02:36:00,050
I will alternate between little light

4513
02:35:58,310 --> 02:36:02,569
water and on top to a deeper watering

4514
02:36:00,050 --> 02:36:04,880
but but definitely not to run off yeah

4515
02:36:02,569 --> 02:36:07,011
well I mean have you ever run wicking

4516
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:09,649
style grow system and how did it go if

4517
02:36:07,011 --> 02:36:11,271
you have yeah well I guess so I mean the

4518
02:36:09,649 --> 02:36:12,831
earth boxes that I currently use and

4519
02:36:11,271 --> 02:36:15,021
recommend a lot of newer growers to use

4520
02:36:12,831 --> 02:36:17,001
has a wicking system in it it's a sub

4521
02:36:15,021 --> 02:36:18,711
irrigated planter holds about a cubic

4522
02:36:17,001 --> 02:36:20,601
foot and a half of soil on a tray and

4523
02:36:18,710 --> 02:36:23,120
below there is two and a half gallons of

4524
02:36:20,601 --> 02:36:26,301
water the corners of the plastic

4525
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:28,130
rectangular grow box are impressed down

4526
02:36:26,300 --> 02:36:29,751
into the water and you pack that soil

4527
02:36:28,130 --> 02:36:31,671
tight and that acts as a sponge that

4528
02:36:29,751 --> 02:36:36,681
wicks the water up to the rest of the

4529
02:36:31,671 --> 02:36:39,050
soil unbelievable results with it I put

4530
02:36:36,681 --> 02:36:40,671
a clone in there put the soil in and

4531
02:36:39,050 --> 02:36:42,140
then maybe the benefit is you're not top

4532
02:36:40,671 --> 02:36:44,421
watering so you can actually mound

4533
02:36:42,140 --> 02:36:46,040
compost and nutrients well above the

4534
02:36:44,421 --> 02:36:48,319
size of the container and put the

4535
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:50,000
plastic cover back on the top and that

4536
02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:52,460
keeps the moisture all inside the

4537
02:36:50,001 --> 02:36:54,649
container constantly wicking and I found

4538
02:36:52,460 --> 02:36:56,510
that you can take that earth box that's

4539
02:36:54,649 --> 02:36:59,120
only about you know 10 gallons of soil

4540
02:36:56,511 --> 02:37:02,541
and it'll mimic very closely what a 20

4541
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:06,050
30 gallon container of soil can do in a

4542
02:37:02,540 --> 02:37:08,149
geo pot no didn't from there outdoors

4543
02:37:06,050 --> 02:37:09,680
I found it better just use the ground or

4544
02:37:08,149 --> 02:37:11,210
large volumes of soil not to build a

4545
02:37:09,681 --> 02:37:13,851
swimming pool to do a sub irrigated

4546
02:37:11,210 --> 02:37:15,140
planter unit and so I'm finding that

4547
02:37:13,851 --> 02:37:16,579
there's you know each one of these is a

4548
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:19,430
tool to be used in a certain

4549
02:37:16,579 --> 02:37:21,250
and I'm also seeing permaculture people

4550
02:37:19,430 --> 02:37:24,139
doing these big wicking beds and

4551
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:26,059
sub-irrigation was a big part of nature

4552
02:37:24,139 --> 02:37:30,079
with underground currents and water and

4553
02:37:26,059 --> 02:37:31,369
underground aquifers and so I I don't

4554
02:37:30,079 --> 02:37:34,010
know I know that there's definitely

4555
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:36,020
benefit to both like humor culture also

4556
02:37:34,010 --> 02:37:40,068
uses some sub irrigation in that in the

4557
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:41,780
rotting wood so yep okay so for this

4558
02:37:40,068 --> 02:37:43,699
final part of the interview we're just

4559
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:47,930
gonna go over some questions we had sent

4560
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:50,270
in by our listeners the very first one

4561
02:37:47,930 --> 02:37:52,880
this is the only one I'm gonna read in

4562
02:37:50,270 --> 02:37:58,430
the terminology they sent it in why you

4563
02:37:52,879 --> 02:38:02,509
know more ship to Canada haha man

4564
02:37:58,430 --> 02:38:04,220
you mad bro it's funny because it's been

4565
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:06,710
a big challenge and we were flying under

4566
02:38:04,219 --> 02:38:08,209
the radar we are actively working on

4567
02:38:06,709 --> 02:38:09,709
switching our Canadian shipping so that

4568
02:38:08,209 --> 02:38:10,969
we could be back and we had to turn it

4569
02:38:09,709 --> 02:38:12,919
off the other day because we started

4570
02:38:10,969 --> 02:38:13,969
just losing hundreds of dollars the

4571
02:38:12,920 --> 02:38:14,898
reason why is that a number of our

4572
02:38:13,969 --> 02:38:17,629
orders were just sliding through the

4573
02:38:14,898 --> 02:38:19,699
radar no problem but in order to avoid

4574
02:38:17,629 --> 02:38:22,099
the taxes and tariffs and fees that come

4575
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:23,840
with importing to Canada the best way is

4576
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:26,149
to use the USPS and the reason why is

4577
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:27,620
they have a standing reciprocating

4578
02:38:26,148 --> 02:38:29,809
agreement between the United States to

4579
02:38:27,620 --> 02:38:31,700
work with each other where FedEx and UPS

4580
02:38:29,809 --> 02:38:32,750
is going to charge us a lot of money and

4581
02:38:31,700 --> 02:38:34,430
charge you a lot of money without

4582
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:36,290
telling us how much so we have to

4583
02:38:34,430 --> 02:38:38,540
involve like a specialist and we have to

4584
02:38:36,290 --> 02:38:41,120
guess at the fees so you're not

4585
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:43,310
surprised so the only way is USPS well

4586
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:44,569
we don't have international tariff codes

4587
02:38:43,309 --> 02:38:45,829
on all of our items because we

4588
02:38:44,568 --> 02:38:47,119
manufacture them and don't know what the

4589
02:38:45,829 --> 02:38:49,309
hell an international tariff code even

4590
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:50,930
is and so all of a sudden in customs

4591
02:38:49,309 --> 02:38:52,519
this product that should be charged no

4592
02:38:50,930 --> 02:38:54,439
taxes is just held up and said hey you

4593
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:56,000
don't have international terror and

4594
02:38:54,439 --> 02:38:57,470
we're holding it and so our customers

4595
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:59,600
would order items they needed and then

4596
02:38:57,469 --> 02:39:00,858
get turned around held in customs they

4597
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:02,870
wouldn't get their money back for 30 to

4598
02:39:00,859 --> 02:39:04,818
45 days we'd ship them more product than

4599
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:06,350
an extremely high expense and then it

4600
02:39:04,818 --> 02:39:09,439
would just fail and we would just be

4601
02:39:06,350 --> 02:39:10,909
left apologizing to the customer holding

4602
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:12,318
the bag and so right now we're going

4603
02:39:10,909 --> 02:39:14,389
through with a team but getting every

4604
02:39:12,318 --> 02:39:15,799
single international tariff code and if

4605
02:39:14,389 --> 02:39:18,318
you're in Canada and you want to order

4606
02:39:15,799 --> 02:39:20,090
right now email the order to support

4607
02:39:18,318 --> 02:39:21,769
that bill to soil tell us the items you

4608
02:39:20,090 --> 02:39:23,600
want we'll look up the tariff codes and

4609
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:24,950
we'll use your order as a test and

4610
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:26,960
probably even give you a discount to do

4611
02:39:24,950 --> 02:39:27,579
so so let me know we're working on it

4612
02:39:26,959 --> 02:39:30,158
right now

4613
02:39:27,579 --> 02:39:35,468
great so the

4614
02:39:30,158 --> 02:39:38,288
be very happy so next question on your

4615
02:39:35,468 --> 02:39:40,448
IPM mixture on the site we've got a

4616
02:39:38,289 --> 02:39:42,729
listener who wants to use it in light

4617
02:39:40,449 --> 02:39:44,918
flower but they were wondering does this

4618
02:39:42,728 --> 02:39:47,438
render the parts of the plants

4619
02:39:44,918 --> 02:39:48,939
specifically the leaves unusable so for

4620
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:50,588
example if they wanted to say use it a

4621
02:39:48,939 --> 02:39:52,869
few weeks before harvest and then maybe

4622
02:39:50,588 --> 02:39:54,488
juice those leaves after harvest

4623
02:39:52,869 --> 02:39:58,270
are they still good to go or you think

4624
02:39:54,488 --> 02:40:00,609
those leaves probably no longer edible I

4625
02:39:58,270 --> 02:40:02,560
think they're probably totally fine

4626
02:40:00,609 --> 02:40:05,529
but the only caveat to that is just like

4627
02:40:02,559 --> 02:40:07,988
produce I'd have to wash the leaves and

4628
02:40:05,529 --> 02:40:09,609
all that stuff yes so if I had it was

4629
02:40:07,988 --> 02:40:11,020
totally natural sprayed on there and I

4630
02:40:09,609 --> 02:40:12,998
could actually put it in a salad spinner

4631
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:14,799
and so come and wash them and yeah great

4632
02:40:12,998 --> 02:40:16,389
juice oh it's not a big deal but you

4633
02:40:14,799 --> 02:40:18,279
know the flowers are where the oil comes

4634
02:40:16,389 --> 02:40:19,748
in and so that's where becomes a little

4635
02:40:18,279 --> 02:40:21,100
bit more of a sticky situation and

4636
02:40:19,748 --> 02:40:22,898
people are really scared about it and

4637
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:24,488
the other reason is you know juicing we

4638
02:40:22,898 --> 02:40:25,599
have our liver we have our stomach we

4639
02:40:24,488 --> 02:40:27,639
have our kidneys all these things that

4640
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:29,229
help us process when we light it on fire

4641
02:40:27,639 --> 02:40:30,939
it's going right into the blood it's

4642
02:40:29,228 --> 02:40:34,028
bypassing all of that and so it becomes

4643
02:40:30,939 --> 02:40:35,559
very important and so in considering

4644
02:40:34,029 --> 02:40:37,119
some of that the products that I've felt

4645
02:40:35,559 --> 02:40:39,698
the most safe with are the big time

4646
02:40:37,119 --> 02:40:42,039
exterminator and the treatment and those

4647
02:40:39,699 --> 02:40:44,199
are both enzyme based I've also got the

4648
02:40:42,039 --> 02:40:47,020
owner of Terry Ganic cm-1 says that you

4649
02:40:44,199 --> 02:40:49,209
could spray e-m1 mixed with yucca

4650
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:50,649
extract up until you know the last week

4651
02:40:49,209 --> 02:40:52,869
of harvest or whatever and then wash

4652
02:40:50,648 --> 02:40:55,148
after and not have any problems and it's

4653
02:40:52,869 --> 02:40:56,799
a great fungicide and a great way to

4654
02:40:55,148 --> 02:40:58,929
out-compete powdery mildew and things

4655
02:40:56,799 --> 02:41:01,449
like that so I'm not sure what your

4656
02:40:58,929 --> 02:41:02,439
exact problem is the only answer I can

4657
02:41:01,449 --> 02:41:04,239
give you that's the number one

4658
02:41:02,439 --> 02:41:06,398
recommended is never ever spray your

4659
02:41:04,238 --> 02:41:07,568
flowers with anything from personal

4660
02:41:06,398 --> 02:41:09,368
experience that's not always the case

4661
02:41:07,568 --> 02:41:11,408
then if it's for personal use and you're

4662
02:41:09,369 --> 02:41:13,088
willing to test it out I tried that

4663
02:41:11,408 --> 02:41:14,498
tweetment product I'm guessing you might

4664
02:41:13,088 --> 02:41:16,449
be able to get it international I don't

4665
02:41:14,498 --> 02:41:17,949
I don't know but it's an enzyme based

4666
02:41:16,449 --> 02:41:20,350
cleaning product that's got really

4667
02:41:17,949 --> 02:41:22,748
nothing in it but enzymes water the

4668
02:41:20,350 --> 02:41:25,509
peppermint oil and the borax and the

4669
02:41:22,748 --> 02:41:28,238
boric and it works phenomenal and I

4670
02:41:25,509 --> 02:41:29,770
haven't had any issues also the big-time

4671
02:41:28,238 --> 02:41:31,658
exterminator we've had a number of

4672
02:41:29,770 --> 02:41:33,578
people do testing and enter contests and

4673
02:41:31,658 --> 02:41:35,679
never fail due to anything that's in

4674
02:41:33,578 --> 02:41:36,728
there but the nature of these tests is

4675
02:41:35,679 --> 02:41:39,549
they only test for what they're looking

4676
02:41:36,728 --> 02:41:40,778
for and so the purist will said that

4677
02:41:39,549 --> 02:41:42,100
spraying on your flowers could

4678
02:41:40,779 --> 02:41:43,810
potentially lead to something that's a

4679
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:46,270
health and we just don't know and so the

4680
02:41:43,809 --> 02:41:47,500
only guaranteed way is don't spray that

4681
02:41:46,270 --> 02:41:49,300
being said I think there's a number of

4682
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:52,270
things that you can do yeah including

4683
02:41:49,299 --> 02:41:53,889
essential oils in a small amount I think

4684
02:41:52,270 --> 02:41:58,300
we'll volatilize it not be part of the

4685
02:41:53,889 --> 02:42:01,539
final product yeah okay so annex

4686
02:41:58,299 --> 02:42:03,488
listener says I don't live in the USA

4687
02:42:01,540 --> 02:42:05,350
but I wanted to make my own fish compost

4688
02:42:03,488 --> 02:42:08,020
after seeing your video however I'm

4689
02:42:05,350 --> 02:42:13,420
scared of composting meat is there any

4690
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:15,970
tips you know I don't know I've never

4691
02:42:13,420 --> 02:42:17,199
done fish compost and the guys that do

4692
02:42:15,969 --> 02:42:18,608
the fish compost have a pretty good

4693
02:42:17,199 --> 02:42:20,079
process for it they've got huge piles

4694
02:42:18,609 --> 02:42:22,540
that put the whole fish in and got

4695
02:42:20,079 --> 02:42:23,529
hardwood and all this other stuff to me

4696
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:27,970
it sounds pretty straightforward just

4697
02:42:23,529 --> 02:42:30,100
put the fish in there have at it but you

4698
02:42:27,969 --> 02:42:31,898
know I both know that certain issues can

4699
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:34,300
arise that you didn't expect to plan for

4700
02:42:31,898 --> 02:42:36,430
and so I maybe look at making your own

4701
02:42:34,299 --> 02:42:38,920
fish hydrolysate and you can make your

4702
02:42:36,430 --> 02:42:40,779
own lactobacillus and grind the fish up

4703
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:43,148
blend it and by the time it's has no

4704
02:42:40,779 --> 02:42:44,649
odor and is back to a stable pH you have

4705
02:42:43,148 --> 02:42:46,629
your own fish fertilizer has no

4706
02:42:44,648 --> 02:42:49,090
stabilizing agent in it and it shouldn't

4707
02:42:46,629 --> 02:42:51,250
work really really well other than that

4708
02:42:49,090 --> 02:42:52,689
I mean people have buried whole fish

4709
02:42:51,250 --> 02:42:53,949
right in their planting hole for corn

4710
02:42:52,689 --> 02:42:55,270
and stuff so I gotta imagine making

4711
02:42:53,949 --> 02:42:56,500
compost with it wouldn't be too

4712
02:42:55,270 --> 02:42:58,689
different just put in the pile

4713
02:42:56,500 --> 02:43:01,029
I would Google and I would look up maybe

4714
02:42:58,689 --> 02:43:03,639
some loose percentages on what percent

4715
02:43:01,029 --> 02:43:04,840
of fish to add but other than that it's

4716
02:43:03,639 --> 02:43:06,760
gonna be a part of your carbon to

4717
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:08,318
nitrogen ratio so worst case if there's

4718
02:43:06,760 --> 02:43:10,389
no help I would look up the nitrogen

4719
02:43:08,318 --> 02:43:11,769
content of average fish per pound and I

4720
02:43:10,389 --> 02:43:13,689
would balance that against the standard

4721
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:16,420
carbon to nitrogen ratio of compost and

4722
02:43:13,689 --> 02:43:18,460
I bet you work just fine okay awesome

4723
02:43:16,420 --> 02:43:20,408
and just as a bit of a side question

4724
02:43:18,459 --> 02:43:22,509
I've read a lot of stuff lately saying

4725
02:43:20,408 --> 02:43:25,090
that um you should opt for just in

4726
02:43:22,510 --> 02:43:26,469
general I know that you just said it and

4727
02:43:25,090 --> 02:43:29,170
I'm gonna pronounce it wrong but hydro

4728
02:43:26,469 --> 02:43:31,568
so lights over emotions do you think

4729
02:43:29,170 --> 02:43:32,859
that that's true yeah yeah what a

4730
02:43:31,568 --> 02:43:36,269
percent an emulsion is a chemical

4731
02:43:32,859 --> 02:43:39,609
extraction and and hydrolyze say it is

4732
02:43:36,270 --> 02:43:40,869
blended in water and so a lot of times

4733
02:43:39,609 --> 02:43:42,609
the hydrolyzed state is still gonna have

4734
02:43:40,869 --> 02:43:44,949
a stabilizing agent and the reason why

4735
02:43:42,609 --> 02:43:46,300
is these fish hydrolyzed states the

4736
02:43:44,949 --> 02:43:48,819
product that we're currently purchasing

4737
02:43:46,299 --> 02:43:50,978
they're fishing a very deep water fish

4738
02:43:48,818 --> 02:43:52,568
that's very fatty and bony and so it's

4739
02:43:50,978 --> 02:43:54,158
low and heavy metal and it's very well

4740
02:43:52,568 --> 02:43:55,930
tested and the reason why they buy it is

4741
02:43:54,158 --> 02:43:57,818
they're making a

4742
02:43:55,930 --> 02:43:59,828
Glucosamine Chondroitin product for the

4743
02:43:57,818 --> 02:44:01,840
health market and so if you need a bony

4744
02:43:59,828 --> 02:44:03,309
fish well a bony fatty fish is also

4745
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:05,709
great for fertilizer and so they have a

4746
02:44:03,309 --> 02:44:08,168
good secondary market for it but they

4747
02:44:05,709 --> 02:44:09,789
use citric I'm sorry to use phosphoric

4748
02:44:08,168 --> 02:44:11,619
acid and it's kinda kinda it like makes

4749
02:44:09,789 --> 02:44:14,050
soda pop like coca-cola has phosphoric

4750
02:44:11,619 --> 02:44:15,489
acid they use that kind and it stabilize

4751
02:44:14,049 --> 02:44:16,988
it get a number of growers are like hey

4752
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:19,629
phosphoric acid what the hell that's not

4753
02:44:16,988 --> 02:44:20,918
organic I don't want it my soil well the

4754
02:44:19,629 --> 02:44:22,059
amount they use is very small and as

4755
02:44:20,918 --> 02:44:23,799
soon as you diluted it becomes a

4756
02:44:22,059 --> 02:44:26,019
non-issue kind of like how honey is

4757
02:44:23,799 --> 02:44:27,698
antibacterial but if you dilute honey it

4758
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:30,640
immediately grows mold it's a non-issue

4759
02:44:27,699 --> 02:44:32,709
once it's diluted the thing is those

4760
02:44:30,639 --> 02:44:34,418
it's not the best and so it the reason

4761
02:44:32,709 --> 02:44:36,668
they use it is it makes the pee number

4762
02:44:34,418 --> 02:44:38,949
on their NPK label a lot higher using

4763
02:44:36,668 --> 02:44:41,680
phosphoric acid and it is a peace horse

4764
02:44:38,949 --> 02:44:43,930
but the company we're working with they

4765
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:45,818
have a market that once a year gets a

4766
02:44:43,930 --> 02:44:47,168
citric acid stabilized version and we're

4767
02:44:45,818 --> 02:44:49,478
gonna try and get that and the next

4768
02:44:47,168 --> 02:44:50,949
batch and beyond that I'm hoping one day

4769
02:44:49,478 --> 02:44:53,918
in the future they make a lactobacillus

4770
02:44:50,949 --> 02:44:56,319
version known so then hydrolyze that

4771
02:44:53,918 --> 02:44:57,789
would be great it's a waste product we

4772
02:44:56,318 --> 02:44:58,958
need to do something with it and either

4773
02:44:57,789 --> 02:45:00,880
composting it or turning it into

4774
02:44:58,959 --> 02:45:02,168
fertilizer makes a lot of sense that

4775
02:45:00,879 --> 02:45:03,969
being said there's a subset of people

4776
02:45:02,168 --> 02:45:06,010
that will say any fertilizer like that

4777
02:45:03,969 --> 02:45:08,469
liquid is feeding the plant not feeding

4778
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:09,789
the soil and on an agricultural level

4779
02:45:08,469 --> 02:45:11,168
they'll say it actually does feed the

4780
02:45:09,789 --> 02:45:12,729
soil and they can prove it by measuring

4781
02:45:11,168 --> 02:45:14,498
how much nitrogen is left over after

4782
02:45:12,728 --> 02:45:17,049
these feedings even after the crops are

4783
02:45:14,498 --> 02:45:19,629
harvested and it seems to be true but

4784
02:45:17,049 --> 02:45:21,728
the main source we see for selling right

4785
02:45:19,629 --> 02:45:23,349
now is the Ingham crowd and a lot of the

4786
02:45:21,728 --> 02:45:25,179
compost tea brewers that are using fish

4787
02:45:23,350 --> 02:45:26,979
hydrolysate as a food source for the

4788
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:28,510
microbes and they're using such a small

4789
02:45:26,978 --> 02:45:30,129
amount but by the time the tea is brewed

4790
02:45:28,510 --> 02:45:33,998
there's no fish hydrolyze I didn't even

4791
02:45:30,129 --> 02:45:37,599
left it just fed the microbes yeah so um

4792
02:45:33,998 --> 02:45:40,260
just just to clarify when you say I'm

4793
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:43,149
potentially adding some lactobacillus

4794
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:45,969
that's the same stuff that's in kombucha

4795
02:45:43,148 --> 02:45:48,340
right did the drink yeah I know kombucha

4796
02:45:45,969 --> 02:45:52,358
would be a whole bunch of other

4797
02:45:48,340 --> 02:45:54,100
different consortium there the kombucha

4798
02:45:52,359 --> 02:45:55,869
the material that makes it is called a

4799
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:58,149
Scobie or a sin biotic colony of

4800
02:45:55,869 --> 02:45:59,739
bacteria and yeast and you know there's

4801
02:45:58,148 --> 02:46:01,629
a lot of research on what specifics

4802
02:45:59,738 --> 02:46:03,309
some people do use kombucha cuz it's got

4803
02:46:01,629 --> 02:46:04,750
a very low pH and they can use that for

4804
02:46:03,309 --> 02:46:07,989
powdery mildew but

4805
02:46:04,750 --> 02:46:09,430
the lactobacillus is actually a lot of

4806
02:46:07,989 --> 02:46:11,140
people would be lactose intolerant

4807
02:46:09,430 --> 02:46:13,870
that's a sugar that's a milk and so the

4808
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:16,000
lactobacillus is the cerements made from

4809
02:46:13,870 --> 02:46:18,040
taking a rice wash water high in

4810
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:19,959
carbohydrate and getting all of the

4811
02:46:18,040 --> 02:46:22,960
indigenous lactobacillus that's any air

4812
02:46:19,959 --> 02:46:24,699
in there and then putting that milk to

4813
02:46:22,959 --> 02:46:27,399
stifle all the other bacteria and just

4814
02:46:24,700 --> 02:46:29,950
feed the lactobacillus it turned way and

4815
02:46:27,399 --> 02:46:31,719
curd the curd is the cheese the way is

4816
02:46:29,950 --> 02:46:34,750
the clear liquid that is the

4817
02:46:31,719 --> 02:46:36,819
lactobacillus serum it's basically a

4818
02:46:34,750 --> 02:46:37,930
whey protein powder the liquid version

4819
02:46:36,819 --> 02:46:40,090
while it's still alive

4820
02:46:37,930 --> 02:46:44,200
it's high in amino acids high in protein

4821
02:46:40,090 --> 02:46:45,729
and in the farming world feeding animals

4822
02:46:44,200 --> 02:46:48,820
with high protein turning over to

4823
02:46:45,729 --> 02:46:50,920
agriculture means a high nitrogen and so

4824
02:46:48,819 --> 02:46:52,690
when you use that lactobacillus it's a

4825
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:54,969
great decomposer for some reason it can

4826
02:46:52,690 --> 02:46:56,950
break down that fish remove the odor and

4827
02:46:54,969 --> 02:46:59,049
keep it stable and lower that pH down to

4828
02:46:56,950 --> 02:47:01,570
about 3.5 so you don't have to add the

4829
02:46:59,049 --> 02:47:03,129
phosphoric acid it's pretty cool yeah

4830
02:47:01,569 --> 02:47:05,799
that is actually really interesting you

4831
02:47:03,129 --> 02:47:07,179
mention that because anyone if they want

4832
02:47:05,799 --> 02:47:09,219
to check out my Instagram page they'll

4833
02:47:07,180 --> 02:47:12,310
see that I'm a bit of an avid cheese

4834
02:47:09,219 --> 02:47:13,629
maker fan and and so yeah I didn't

4835
02:47:12,310 --> 02:47:15,489
realize until right now I've actually

4836
02:47:13,629 --> 02:47:17,409
got lactobacillus hanging around all the

4837
02:47:15,489 --> 02:47:18,360
time when I separate my weight off the

4838
02:47:17,409 --> 02:47:20,771
top of the curds

4839
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:22,360
an indigenous cheese making a lot of

4840
02:47:20,771 --> 02:47:24,190
times for instance um everybody's heard

4841
02:47:22,360 --> 02:47:25,960
of San Francisco sourdough bread well

4842
02:47:24,190 --> 02:47:27,851
it's called that because the San

4843
02:47:25,959 --> 02:47:29,619
Francisco bacteria that's in the area is

4844
02:47:27,851 --> 02:47:31,329
only native to that region it imparts a

4845
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:34,120
certain flavor you can send me your

4846
02:47:31,329 --> 02:47:36,370
culinary chef prepared sourdough starter

4847
02:47:34,120 --> 02:47:37,811
from from San Francisco but if I make it

4848
02:47:36,370 --> 02:47:39,820
at my house by about the second time

4849
02:47:37,810 --> 02:47:41,770
it's totally different and so that's

4850
02:47:39,819 --> 02:47:43,360
where the indigenous microorganisms come

4851
02:47:41,771 --> 02:47:45,130
to play and that's where when we're

4852
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:46,870
talking about lactobacillus it's crazy

4853
02:47:45,129 --> 02:47:48,609
but all the protein powders on the

4854
02:47:46,870 --> 02:47:50,440
market here in the United States

4855
02:47:48,610 --> 02:47:52,000
fat free became a huge thing and that's

4856
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:53,290
what cheese became popular because fat

4857
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,459
free milk was being sold they had to

4858
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:56,110
take all the fat off and all of a sudden

4859
02:47:54,459 --> 02:47:59,079
you had grated cheese cheese slices

4860
02:47:56,110 --> 02:48:01,060
government cheese and then from there

4861
02:47:59,079 --> 02:48:03,250
you have the next waste product all of

4862
02:48:01,060 --> 02:48:05,409
the way from the cheese making that they

4863
02:48:03,250 --> 02:48:07,659
end up using for the protein powders and

4864
02:48:05,409 --> 02:48:09,640
so we find the premium protein companies

4865
02:48:07,659 --> 02:48:12,101
use grass-fed cattle and all that so at

4866
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:16,420
home if you've got your own goats or if

4867
02:48:12,101 --> 02:48:17,439
you've got you know some raw all natural

4868
02:48:16,420 --> 02:48:20,109
milk that would be the best

4869
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:20,979
but certainly any milk I think would

4870
02:48:20,109 --> 02:48:22,600
work

4871
02:48:20,978 --> 02:48:24,099
yeah and that's like kind of an

4872
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:25,630
interesting I we're probably going down

4873
02:48:24,100 --> 02:48:27,640
a bit of a rabbit hole here but that's a

4874
02:48:25,629 --> 02:48:29,108
bit of an interesting one um the quality

4875
02:48:27,639 --> 02:48:30,728
of protein because yeah I read some

4876
02:48:29,109 --> 02:48:32,559
studies and they say that you know the

4877
02:48:30,728 --> 02:48:35,469
cheaper the quality of protein you find

4878
02:48:32,559 --> 02:48:38,170
the higher the glycine content in it is

4879
02:48:35,469 --> 02:48:40,478
a glycine is kind of the least useful of

4880
02:48:38,170 --> 02:48:42,219
all the amino acids so it's interesting

4881
02:48:40,478 --> 02:48:43,448
that it does translate the way it does

4882
02:48:42,219 --> 02:48:45,458
especially when you mentioned the the

4883
02:48:43,449 --> 02:48:47,408
grass-fed cattle and then how that

4884
02:48:45,459 --> 02:48:50,619
translates into protein powder being

4885
02:48:47,408 --> 02:48:52,748
better quality yep yeah there's so many

4886
02:48:50,619 --> 02:48:54,520
crossovers I always tell people cannabis

4887
02:48:52,748 --> 02:48:56,498
is a gateway gateway to a healthier

4888
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:59,199
lifestyle and realizing you know that

4889
02:48:56,498 --> 02:49:02,859
there's a lot more going on than I knew

4890
02:48:59,199 --> 02:49:06,039
before so yeah awesome so our next

4891
02:49:02,859 --> 02:49:08,559
question it's a little bit extended

4892
02:49:06,039 --> 02:49:10,689
what's the cheapest way to start an

4893
02:49:08,559 --> 02:49:13,629
organic cannabis grow so this person has

4894
02:49:10,689 --> 02:49:15,488
said is it possible for me to veg a plan

4895
02:49:13,629 --> 02:49:17,679
in a bag of potting mix just some

4896
02:49:15,488 --> 02:49:19,689
regular potting mix and then transplant

4897
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:22,689
it into a big pot the bottom half is

4898
02:49:19,689 --> 02:49:25,090
compost the top half is just the same

4899
02:49:22,689 --> 02:49:26,920
potting mix would that work essentially

4900
02:49:25,090 --> 02:49:29,469
with just water only so I guess what the

4901
02:49:26,920 --> 02:49:31,389
question is is can you grow a nice plan

4902
02:49:29,469 --> 02:49:33,578
with just a bag of compost and a bag of

4903
02:49:31,389 --> 02:49:34,868
potting soil hundred percent in fact

4904
02:49:33,578 --> 02:49:36,549
I've been challenged before people said

4905
02:49:34,869 --> 02:49:38,319
oh you love nature so much why don't

4906
02:49:36,549 --> 02:49:40,448
just throw a seed outside see what

4907
02:49:38,318 --> 02:49:42,158
happens well [ __ ] I did that it was one

4908
02:49:40,449 --> 02:49:43,959
of the best girls I've ever had of

4909
02:49:42,158 --> 02:49:45,068
course each soil is gonna be different

4910
02:49:43,959 --> 02:49:46,479
and then happened to be an old chicken

4911
02:49:45,068 --> 02:49:48,760
coop and the soil was pretty good in

4912
02:49:46,478 --> 02:49:50,260
there the challenge I would have to have

4913
02:49:48,760 --> 02:49:51,520
is the opposite that put the compost on

4914
02:49:50,260 --> 02:49:53,920
top of the potting soil underneath

4915
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:55,180
that's how nature works the compost

4916
02:49:53,920 --> 02:49:56,498
isn't you know just underneath that's

4917
02:49:55,180 --> 02:49:58,059
where all the minerals are and so I

4918
02:49:56,498 --> 02:49:59,469
would do the opposite and that's why I

4919
02:49:58,059 --> 02:50:01,538
had a challenge with the super soil the

4920
02:49:59,469 --> 02:50:02,708
hot part was on the bottom then I get it

4921
02:50:01,539 --> 02:50:04,600
because the roots are eventually gonna

4922
02:50:02,709 --> 02:50:06,039
hit that but wait you don't what they

4923
02:50:04,600 --> 02:50:07,630
don't talk about is that the first thing

4924
02:50:06,039 --> 02:50:08,949
a plant does is search for the walls of

4925
02:50:07,629 --> 02:50:10,958
its container within the first couple of

4926
02:50:08,949 --> 02:50:13,149
days it's ending roots everywhere so

4927
02:50:10,959 --> 02:50:15,340
putting it up top would be more where it

4928
02:50:13,148 --> 02:50:17,349
can balance what to do with those and

4929
02:50:15,340 --> 02:50:18,520
certainly just growing with some compost

4930
02:50:17,350 --> 02:50:20,439
than everything the number one limiting

4931
02:50:18,520 --> 02:50:22,420
factor meeting if your compost is

4932
02:50:20,439 --> 02:50:24,789
imbalanced it would be better to have a

4933
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:26,228
lot of it so that I could just eat the

4934
02:50:24,789 --> 02:50:29,109
portion that it needs as opposed to

4935
02:50:26,228 --> 02:50:31,188
reaching that imbalance sooner so what

4936
02:50:29,109 --> 02:50:34,010
we lack in quality we can make up for

4937
02:50:31,189 --> 02:50:35,658
at least a little bit in organics in the

4938
02:50:34,010 --> 02:50:38,059
beginning and that's how cheap it can be

4939
02:50:35,658 --> 02:50:39,350
from there the cheapest way as far as

4940
02:50:38,059 --> 02:50:41,898
following all these recipes would be to

4941
02:50:39,350 --> 02:50:44,209
get the cocoa core get your own compost

4942
02:50:41,898 --> 02:50:45,708
get some sort of aeration mix it

4943
02:50:44,209 --> 02:50:48,709
together in plant that's gonna be the

4944
02:50:45,709 --> 02:50:50,510
cheapest way but I've I've even seen

4945
02:50:48,709 --> 02:50:53,090
people make 50/50 their own homemade

4946
02:50:50,510 --> 02:50:54,469
compost they just use that in aeration

4947
02:50:53,090 --> 02:50:59,600
and I plant into it their plants do

4948
02:50:54,469 --> 02:51:01,309
great fantastic final question for this

4949
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:03,949
interview I think we've already kind of

4950
02:51:01,309 --> 02:51:05,568
answered it but uh obviously the person

4951
02:51:03,949 --> 02:51:08,479
didn't know that submitting it

4952
02:51:05,568 --> 02:51:11,208
beforehand can organic growing

4953
02:51:08,478 --> 02:51:13,549
consistently yield as much as a hydro on

4954
02:51:11,209 --> 02:51:15,560
a small commercial scale with the same

4955
02:51:13,549 --> 02:51:17,809
or less amount of input so I'm assuming

4956
02:51:15,559 --> 02:51:19,788
this person they're from the states I'm

4957
02:51:17,809 --> 02:51:21,769
assuming that they're wanting to switch

4958
02:51:19,789 --> 02:51:24,170
over their little home grow that they

4959
02:51:21,770 --> 02:51:25,578
probably sell for a living yeah do you

4960
02:51:24,170 --> 02:51:28,180
think it can consistently yield as much

4961
02:51:25,578 --> 02:51:30,648
with the same or less effort / input

4962
02:51:28,180 --> 02:51:32,630
yeah and here's the question though um

4963
02:51:30,648 --> 02:51:33,708
I'll always have hydro growers that are

4964
02:51:32,629 --> 02:51:35,028
gonna tell me they can do better and

4965
02:51:33,709 --> 02:51:38,180
I'll always have organic growers that

4966
02:51:35,029 --> 02:51:39,680
can tell me they can do better and what

4967
02:51:38,180 --> 02:51:40,908
I pay attention to in particular is the

4968
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:42,318
growers that have done boast at the

4969
02:51:40,908 --> 02:51:43,549
pinnacle and they always say that

4970
02:51:42,318 --> 02:51:46,158
there's always room for improvement

4971
02:51:43,549 --> 02:51:47,420
there's ways to get better but certainly

4972
02:51:46,158 --> 02:51:48,949
I think one of the benefits is you could

4973
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:50,478
probably could force a little more yield

4974
02:51:48,949 --> 02:51:53,180
out of hydro it's just going to be the

4975
02:51:50,478 --> 02:51:54,618
case and the factor is is at that point

4976
02:51:53,180 --> 02:51:57,050
where you push it beyond almost like

4977
02:51:54,619 --> 02:51:58,880
steroid usage isn't really healthy is it

4978
02:51:57,049 --> 02:52:01,429
taste is good or we push it beyond the

4979
02:51:58,879 --> 02:52:04,549
balance and so I would say that with a

4980
02:52:01,430 --> 02:52:06,020
quality and perspective yes you can hit

4981
02:52:04,549 --> 02:52:08,328
those yields every time and when we look

4982
02:52:06,020 --> 02:52:10,130
at that actual farm trial of Agriculture

4983
02:52:08,328 --> 02:52:12,139
not horticulture but you know large

4984
02:52:10,129 --> 02:52:14,139
scale for sure if you go look at the

4985
02:52:12,139 --> 02:52:16,908
Rodale farm study you're gonna see that

4986
02:52:14,139 --> 02:52:18,858
every year you're in you're out and over

4987
02:52:16,908 --> 02:52:21,350
the whole 30 years organics not only did

4988
02:52:18,859 --> 02:52:24,140
just as good but one and so that is

4989
02:52:21,350 --> 02:52:25,399
definitely interesting I feel like kind

4990
02:52:24,139 --> 02:52:27,260
of like I've mentioned steroids before

4991
02:52:25,398 --> 02:52:28,519
you're gonna see a dramatic result in

4992
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:30,949
the beginning but down the road if

4993
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:32,390
you're not keeping every else everything

4994
02:52:30,949 --> 02:52:34,369
else perfect you're gonna see that it's

4995
02:52:32,389 --> 02:52:35,930
artificial it doesn't translate to as

4996
02:52:34,369 --> 02:52:38,449
much real strength and then it could be

4997
02:52:35,930 --> 02:52:40,010
detrimental to your health same same

4998
02:52:38,449 --> 02:52:41,840
thing with using synthetic a number of

4999
02:52:40,010 --> 02:52:43,219
countries that adopted synthetic

5000
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:44,359
practices or worse often there were

5001
02:52:43,219 --> 02:52:46,368
before

5002
02:52:44,359 --> 02:52:47,658
they're having super weeds and all sorts

5003
02:52:46,369 --> 02:52:49,189
of problems and they're doubling down

5004
02:52:47,658 --> 02:52:50,270
and going back to their old practices

5005
02:52:49,189 --> 02:52:56,568
and the government's right there behind

5006
02:52:50,270 --> 02:52:57,680
themself indoors on a facility and main

5007
02:52:56,568 --> 02:53:01,878
limiting factor is going to be that

5008
02:52:57,680 --> 02:53:04,068
grower and that goes for hydro that goes

5009
02:53:01,879 --> 02:53:05,779
for you know organics but here's the

5010
02:53:04,068 --> 02:53:08,600
other thing to consider the Phantom

5011
02:53:05,779 --> 02:53:10,520
yield is what I call it if I could get

5012
02:53:08,600 --> 02:53:12,229
10 pounds hydro or 10 pounds organic

5013
02:53:10,520 --> 02:53:14,569
there's apples to apples but what if I

5014
02:53:12,228 --> 02:53:17,688
only get 8 and organic and 10 in the

5015
02:53:14,568 --> 02:53:20,090
hydro but I made twice as much money off

5016
02:53:17,689 --> 02:53:21,350
the 8 than I did the 10 that phantom

5017
02:53:20,090 --> 02:53:22,520
yields are gonna be more important to me

5018
02:53:21,350 --> 02:53:25,158
and that's what real investors are

5019
02:53:22,520 --> 02:53:26,810
looking at and the way that's done and

5020
02:53:25,158 --> 02:53:28,520
let's say commercial real estate is it's

5021
02:53:26,809 --> 02:53:29,930
called the cap rate yeah it might be a

5022
02:53:28,520 --> 02:53:31,310
billion dollar building but if you only

5023
02:53:29,930 --> 02:53:33,738
make a thousand bucks a month why would

5024
02:53:31,309 --> 02:53:34,818
you spend so much money contrary to an

5025
02:53:33,738 --> 02:53:36,078
area where you could buy a cheaper

5026
02:53:34,818 --> 02:53:38,600
building and make a lot more money per

5027
02:53:36,078 --> 02:53:40,878
month so when we're looking at growing

5028
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:43,550
organic versus hydro keeping quality and

5029
02:53:40,879 --> 02:53:45,169
perspective the profits can be there or

5030
02:53:43,549 --> 02:53:46,368
better and to me that's what we're

5031
02:53:45,168 --> 02:53:48,109
talking about when we're talking to

5032
02:53:46,369 --> 02:53:49,459
yield otherwise I can go spend a whole

5033
02:53:48,109 --> 02:53:52,340
bunch of money and get a lot of yield it

5034
02:53:49,459 --> 02:53:52,760
doesn't mean it was efficient yeah for

5035
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:55,430
sure

5036
02:53:52,760 --> 02:53:57,859
and I like to use the again the Reds

5037
02:53:55,430 --> 02:53:59,809
analogy of synthetics being like you

5038
02:53:57,859 --> 02:54:01,158
know your force feeding it like sure you

5039
02:53:59,809 --> 02:54:04,128
can get it bigger than it wants to be

5040
02:54:01,158 --> 02:54:05,988
but is it the right thing yep is it the

5041
02:54:04,129 --> 02:54:07,249
right thing yeah and I guess you know

5042
02:54:05,988 --> 02:54:09,918
you can get a strawberry in the store

5043
02:54:07,248 --> 02:54:11,059
that's the size of us no golf bigger you

5044
02:54:09,918 --> 02:54:13,279
know maybe the size of a tennis ball

5045
02:54:11,059 --> 02:54:14,628
it's not gonna have as much flavors that

5046
02:54:13,279 --> 02:54:16,399
one you find on the forest floor that's

5047
02:54:14,629 --> 02:54:18,079
the size of a quarter well we're hoping

5048
02:54:16,398 --> 02:54:19,368
to do is find the limit at which we can

5049
02:54:18,078 --> 02:54:21,199
get between there and keep all of the

5050
02:54:19,369 --> 02:54:23,209
flavor I mean can you imagine the

5051
02:54:21,199 --> 02:54:25,189
translation if we were able to really do

5052
02:54:23,209 --> 02:54:26,390
this on scale and then take maybe let's

5053
02:54:25,189 --> 02:54:28,279
say a product like wine

5054
02:54:26,389 --> 02:54:30,528
that has to historically have a drought

5055
02:54:28,279 --> 02:54:32,060
to have any flavor and actually be able

5056
02:54:30,529 --> 02:54:33,890
to produce at a higher quantity and keep

5057
02:54:32,059 --> 02:54:35,719
the flavor we're not gonna be pretty

5058
02:54:33,889 --> 02:54:38,180
cool but there's that limiting factor

5059
02:54:35,719 --> 02:54:40,010
yield versus that relationship of that

5060
02:54:38,180 --> 02:54:42,918
flavor and taste and there's no way to

5061
02:54:40,010 --> 02:54:45,559
have all of it at the very top because

5062
02:54:42,918 --> 02:54:46,878
the biggest producing genetics a lot of

5063
02:54:45,559 --> 02:54:49,038
times aren't even the ones that you want

5064
02:54:46,879 --> 02:54:50,270
so now taking the same genetic with all

5065
02:54:49,039 --> 02:54:52,489
the flavor and getting the most yield

5066
02:54:50,270 --> 02:54:55,550
out of that I think is really the

5067
02:54:52,488 --> 02:54:58,239
question so yeah awesome

5068
02:54:55,549 --> 02:55:01,149
and so I guess my personal final quite

5069
02:54:58,239 --> 02:55:03,190
News do you believe personally that with

5070
02:55:01,149 --> 02:55:05,379
the cannabis plant it is kind of that

5071
02:55:03,190 --> 02:55:07,271
invisible seesaw of you know like the

5072
02:55:05,379 --> 02:55:08,470
yield on the one end or the flavor and

5073
02:55:07,271 --> 02:55:11,351
potency on the other or do you think

5074
02:55:08,470 --> 02:55:12,489
like no you can find a happy medium so

5075
02:55:11,351 --> 02:55:15,790
certainly you can find a happy medium

5076
02:55:12,489 --> 02:55:18,521
and what's crazy is when you get too

5077
02:55:15,790 --> 02:55:20,230
narrow in any niche like yield and

5078
02:55:18,521 --> 02:55:23,620
specific plants there's gonna be people

5079
02:55:20,229 --> 02:55:24,760
wanting more yield no matter what and so

5080
02:55:23,620 --> 02:55:26,351
at a certain point you have to ask is

5081
02:55:24,760 --> 02:55:27,790
there enough flavor as my yield good and

5082
02:55:26,351 --> 02:55:29,891
that's gonna be a genetic base but like

5083
02:55:27,790 --> 02:55:31,061
for instance squash right now you know

5084
02:55:29,890 --> 02:55:32,770
if you grow one squash plant you can

5085
02:55:31,060 --> 02:55:34,209
feed five families off the damn thing

5086
02:55:32,771 --> 02:55:36,700
you'll have a hundred of them every year

5087
02:55:34,209 --> 02:55:37,810
and so you go talk to the squash

5088
02:55:36,700 --> 02:55:39,909
breeders and what are they trying to do

5089
02:55:37,810 --> 02:55:41,860
get more freakin yield it's like I don't

5090
02:55:39,909 --> 02:55:44,799
need more yield I want a better tasting

5091
02:55:41,860 --> 02:55:46,239
one oh and so that's where we start

5092
02:55:44,799 --> 02:55:47,949
looking at heirloom seeds and stuff

5093
02:55:46,239 --> 02:55:50,021
that's whole focus wasn't yield but

5094
02:55:47,950 --> 02:55:52,150
flavor and color and beauty and reasons

5095
02:55:50,021 --> 02:55:54,010
why individual home gardeners kept these

5096
02:55:52,149 --> 02:55:55,270
things and that's why we're seeing

5097
02:55:54,010 --> 02:55:56,739
certain cultivars they don't produce

5098
02:55:55,271 --> 02:55:58,181
very well being popular in the market

5099
02:55:56,739 --> 02:55:59,771
and they command a better price because

5100
02:55:58,181 --> 02:56:02,771
those flavors tastes and appearance of

5101
02:55:59,771 --> 02:56:04,150
that so we'll find a happy medium but

5102
02:56:02,771 --> 02:56:05,920
that's gonna be based on genetics and

5103
02:56:04,149 --> 02:56:07,229
grow room environment and really just

5104
02:56:05,920 --> 02:56:10,181
getting better every year

5105
02:56:07,229 --> 02:56:12,459
awesome well I think that brings us to

5106
02:56:10,181 --> 02:56:15,880
the end of it was there any comments or

5107
02:56:12,459 --> 02:56:17,319
shoutouts you wanted to make no J guess

5108
02:56:15,879 --> 02:56:19,029
just keep an open mind like you

5109
02:56:17,319 --> 02:56:21,899
mentioned get out of that minefield of

5110
02:56:19,030 --> 02:56:24,190
being on the high horse of organics and

5111
02:56:21,899 --> 02:56:25,720
even learn from all the synthetics and I

5112
02:56:24,190 --> 02:56:29,079
think that you'll be a well more well

5113
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:30,310
rounded grower but but I really do want

5114
02:56:29,079 --> 02:56:33,819
to leave people that are on the fence

5115
02:56:30,310 --> 02:56:35,500
considering organics it can be easy you

5116
02:56:33,819 --> 02:56:38,681
don't have to have all these potential

5117
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:40,629
problems and you can get yields you can

5118
02:56:38,681 --> 02:56:41,681
get flavor and I think that if you're

5119
02:56:40,629 --> 02:56:44,020
going down to the shop and the only

5120
02:56:41,681 --> 02:56:46,210
opportunity you have is hydro it maybe

5121
02:56:44,021 --> 02:56:48,250
start that way but reach out follow the

5122
02:56:46,209 --> 02:56:49,839
podcast find some of these resources
