168
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,479
be smoking on that tonight probably in

169
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,359
the next two hours or so once the kids

170
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,839
go

171
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,598
down beautiful I love that I love that

172
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:24,198
the evening Smoke's always a pleasure is

173
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:26,519
that grape cream cake the one from Bloom

174
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,759
yeah so it's grap cream grape cream cake

175
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,359
2.1 and then um I crossed that with that

176
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,919
blueberry frosting and I think that's

177
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,520
what we talked about last time is I was

178
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:38,318
trying to come up like some candy gas

179
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,240
and so my buddy partytime Farm sent me

180
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,400
the pollen so I I made a bunch of

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,800
crosses with that and then we just

182
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,038
hunted a bunch of stuff with that and so

183
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,879
the grape cream 2.1 Cross of the

184
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,598
blueberry frosting number 11 is probably

185
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:56,598
like the most I would say candy but it

186
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:58,439
has gas and so it's like yeah it has a

187
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,360
oh it's OG Kush breath excuse me OG Kush

188
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,038
breath 2.1 so yeah so it has that like

189
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,759
OG a little bit in there but it's mostly

190
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,318
it's mostly candy but it has that gas to

191
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,680
it too so it's like the perfect combo

192
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,560
but yeah so be smoke on that for sure

193
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,038
it's it's dank dude can't wait to get

194
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,038
you guys some over there in Australia as

195
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:16,279
a matter of fact oh beautiful that that

196
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,598
sounds lovely I'm sure it's an absolute

197
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,559
killer it's it's cool that you touched

198
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,598
on that point about the candy gas

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,519
because in the episode where we did the

200
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,878
breeder Awards we we had a chat to Chris

201
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,918
compound and he sort of said that his

202
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,720
prediction for the future is that the

203
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:34,439
candy gas is here to stay what's your

204
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,160
thoughts on the uh the future of strains

205
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,399
and flavors where do you think we're

206
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,439
heading well I'll say this that certain

207
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,120
like gas strains that I've had this just

208
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,959
like all gas or cush strains certain

209
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,158
strains that I'll have some of them like

210
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,120
they smell just super dank right but

211
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:50,719
then when you smoke them they'll taste

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,158
like an ashtray or something you know

213
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
what I mean and I'm not I'm not talking

214
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:55,079
about rosin or anything like that but

215
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,319
like I only smoke flour for the most

216
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,839
part and so for me I'm like all right

217
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,560
you know what I mean it just it doesn't

218
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,878
it doesn't taste great after the second

219
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,800
or third hit you're like all right um so

220
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,919
I think the candy portion adds a little

221
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,280
bit of sweetness or a little bit of

222
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,279
flavor to it that's like you know just I

223
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,399
don't know it just kind of adds to the

224
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,559
flavor so yeah I would say that candy

225
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,959
gas might be the thing who knows what's

226
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,959
going to happen there's literally only

227
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,318
so many combinations we can come up with

228
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,359
though right but like I think the candy

229
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,840
gas for sure is like a long-term a

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,520
long-term winner because it it takes

231
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,758
away the it the the uh from the gas

232
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,758
portion it's not just you know Ash

233
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,240
or whatever whatever I'm thinking right

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,200
it adds like a little bit of flavor to

235
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,959
it so yeah for me like candy gas is

236
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,640
definitely the way to go it hits all

237
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,759
buckets right especially for what people

238
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,720
want yeah certainly and it feels like

239
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,240
we're heading into this era where uh

240
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
potency is almost becoming a secondary

241
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,799
Factor whereas it used to be a lot of

242
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,838
the focus for many people and these days

243
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,278
it's more about like getting that flavor

244
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,120
right and if the potency is lower that's

245
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:02,240
almost okay cuz you know like I want to

246
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,078
hit it a few times for that flavor would

247
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,399
you say you're sort of in agreeance with

248
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:08,319
that I'm I'm glad you're talking about

249
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,958
this cuz I'm a big beer guy so I'm a big

250
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,040
beer nerd right so I'm a craft beer nerd

251
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,759
and so some of my favorite breweries

252
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,078
will have like these seven point per

253
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,879
something or others and I'm like I don't

254
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,359
want that I want these five point

255
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,679
something or others right because like I

256
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,959
like to drink multiple beers and I like

257
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,679
to smoke multiple joints so I don't want

258
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:31,439
to drink a triple IPA and get faded off

259
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,399
two of them right and then be hurting

260
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,680
the next day and so yes I do agree with

261
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,519
that I like to smoke multiple joints I

262
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,559
don't want to take two rips or three

263
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,799
rips and then be in some [ __ ] up world

264
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,799
where I'm like tripping out you know

265
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,799
what I mean like I like to smoke and I

266
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:47,319
like to drink and I like to chill and I

267
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,759
like to do it for a long time I don't

268
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,360
want to just do like let me get as high

269
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,799
as I want to get it's like taking a shot

270
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,560
of vodka or or you know what I mean or

271
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,519
enjoying a couple glasses of wine right

272
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,199
yeah definitely definitely I can relate

273
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,278
to you on the wine one

274
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,640
yeah so like I like to I like to chill I

275
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,200
like to have fun I like to drink and I

276
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,838
like to keep it I like to keep the party

277
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,920
going I don't want to black out you know

278
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,600
what I mean yeah I don't want to get you

279
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,719
faded I don't you know I want to have

280
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,720
fun and I want to enjoy it so yeah I do

281
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,000
agree with that and I think that I was

282
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,480
listening to this thing um I don't know

283
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,559
I don't remember what was on but it was

284
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,200
uh it's from lumpy flowers and they were

285
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,078
talking the the guy from lumpies was

286
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,519
talking about you can always smoke more

287
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,639
to get higher right but you can't change

288
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,200
the flate

289
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,120
so he's like I like to smoke things that

290
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,320
have more flavor than I do to get with

291
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,720
as opposed to things with higher THC

292
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,120
he's like I could always smoke more and

293
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,680
get higher but if I'm not enjoying the

294
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,078
[ __ ] that I'm smoking on what's the

295
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,078
point I'm like dude bang on so he just

296
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,039
said that like exactly perfect so and I

297
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,799
was like of course that's exactly what

298
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:53,519
like what I say about craft beers as

299
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:55,359
well as weed I want my uh ABV and or THC

300
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,919
to be lower so that I can drink more

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,200
than one or two or three and not be

302
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:02,599
[ __ ] the next day so yeah yes 100%

303
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,560
agreed yeah that that's awesome to hear

304
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,639
that you're on that same page and and I

305
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:10,879
guess it does raise the question in

306
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:13,200
terms of you see a lot of these um like

307
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,519
products manifesting in various forms it

308
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,839
might be a spray it might be like a

309
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,879
humidity bag but they're all about like

310
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,079
tpine infusion I wonder what effect do

311
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,399
you think this is going to have on the

312
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,519
market do you think it's going to help

313
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,759
promote tpin so that people can get like

314
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,159
better access to flavored sort of stuff

315
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,720
and like they're going to become more of

316
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,000
the school of thought describing or do

317
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,399
you think overall these sort of tpine

318
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,399
modifying products are maybe just a a

319
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,440
way to fix up a a sort of inferior

320
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,320
product so I think those are like

321
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,959
artificial tpes and I don't think they

322
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,600
do much for the actual THC per right

323
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,518
they don't do anything really so they're

324
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,159
really just like uh from what I know of

325
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,560
them I don't I don't have a ton of

326
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,759
research on these things but like I just

327
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,078
know that some people will spray like

328
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,838
some Booth batches with tpin of whatever

329
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:04,838
to make it like oh smells good right but

330
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,240
it's like boof so I don't know I

331
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,399
honestly don't think that's a good way

332
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,000
like Turpin added to you know some some

333
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:12,639
cartridges or something maybe makes

334
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,440
sense obviously yeah because it gets

335
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,879
like extracted but like to add to flower

336
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,519
no I don't think that's I don't think

337
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,480
that's the way it's not it's not I don't

338
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,159
think that's the way at all yeah like

339
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,600
it's an interesting conundrum because

340
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,600
like I tried to think about it a lot in

341
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,000
like the really foundational elements

342
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,199
and I thought well in in a in a sense

343
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,799
would be happy for someone to smoke bud

344
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,359
that's got more Ts than less so to speak

345
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,240
but I guess the problem is is that it's

346
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,480
not being done for that reason purely

347
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,440
it's been done to try to get like a

348
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,560
higher ticket price right that's exactly

349
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,880
right so it's not and and so here's the

350
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,759
thing like whatever strain it is has its

351
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,519
own natural tpen so if you're adding

352
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,919
tpin to it that means it doesn't already

353
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,720
have tpin you're adding to it so it's

354
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,078
already it's not it's lacking turine so

355
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,278
to me you're just selling Booth batches

356
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,078
and you're trying to cover it up it's

357
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,919
like uh you know you're spraying with

358
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,319
something it's like spraying it with

359
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,799
perfume it's like it doesn't smell that

360
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,040
way right doesn't it's not it's not

361
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,599
going to change and I understand I think

362
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,559
what you're asking is too like there's

363
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,639
that Entourage effect or whatever with

364
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,719
tpin but I don't think it works if it's

365
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,399
sprayed on versus their natural tpin you

366
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,079
know what I mean so I think more than

367
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,519
anything like what you just said I think

368
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,879
it's just adding a turine to sell the

369
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,320
bag to get a higher ticket but I I mean

370
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,399
I could be wrong but I think that's the

371
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,199
reason why people do it to and like no

372
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,919
no disrespect to anybody that has boo

373
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,799
batches like if you're doing that you're

374
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,360
doing it for a reason right like if it

375
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,439
was dank dude and it smell great like

376
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,039
why you why are you spraying it with

377
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,680
turkeys it doesn't make any sense to me

378
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,198
yeah no I get what you mean and I I

379
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,799
think I'd have to be on the same page

380
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,039
about like I I have my doubts about

381
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,120
whether it would elicit the same

382
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,919
Entourage effect for sure so it it leads

383
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,278
us to this interesting realm that really

384
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:54,000
is quite undiscussed in cannabis which

385
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:57,000
is like this whole idea of like mixing

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,078
and I guess the simplest sort of way of

387
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,278
um discussing this topic would be for

388
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:03,758
the longest time you know tobacco has

389
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,360
been mixed with cannabis and it's sort

390
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,199
of phased out what's your thoughts on

391
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,079
Tobacco encounters out of

392
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,879
curiosity um that's a good one I haven't

393
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,278
done that in a long time but when I was

394
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,399
a kid we used to it enhances it

395
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,198
essentially so when I was a kid this is

396
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,559
uh I'm not going to name yours but like

397
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,240
when I was a kid uh if I didn't have any

398
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,399
weed and I had to like you know jump on

399
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,879
somebody else's uh party real quick I

400
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,759
get a little hit of like you know an ash

401
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,439
bowl or something uh and I didn't smoke

402
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,000
cigarettes I would take a hit of like a

403
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,959
cigarette after that and it would

404
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,159
enhance the effect right so it get me it

405
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,958
would get me higher than I should have

406
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:46,879
been essentially so um to add to that

407
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,679
yeah you would get higher um what my

408
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,799
thoughts are on it is it's like it's up

409
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,159
to you like I think that's big in in

410
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,838
Europe and like um it's not really huge

411
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:58,919
here in the states that I know of but

412
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,360
like it'll definitely get you high as

413
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:02,599
[ __ ] you know what I mean like so it

414
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,079
depends on what you're into like I'm not

415
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,800
into tobacco so I don't I don't I don't

416
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,000
personally like it but I remember doing

417
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,039
that as a kid because like I would take

418
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,440
a puff off a off a Sig and I'll be like

419
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:13,879
all right now I'm faded you know what I

420
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,079
mean so I don't know I don't know I

421
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:19,320
don't know uh if it's good or bad or

422
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,958
what but like it's just it's not for me

423
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,920
but like I understand why people do it

424
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,559
like you get like it's it it's like a uh

425
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,799
enhancer if you will you know what I

426
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,039
mean to add the tobacco so I get it but

427
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,198
it's just not for me cuz I'm like

428
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,439
tobacco do you guys do wait do you guys

429
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,078
do that a lot out there in the in

430
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,800
Australia or do you guys mix it or you

431
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:38,559
guys put it in blones or what oh yeah

432
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,318
very common in Australia it's called

433
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,838
spin so oh there you go yeah because

434
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:44,879
you'll [ __ ] yeah exactly because

435
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,959
you'll you'll probably get the spins

436
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,679
yeah exactly and you yeah if you drink a

437
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,399
couple bottles of whatever a couple

438
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,039
glasses of whatever and then you take a

439
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,000
a joint with some buddies or even worse

440
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,318
a

441
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,198
blunt yeah you're going to be faded

442
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:02,479
you're definitely going to get the spin

443
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,479
so yeah for me I don't yeah I'm I'm more

444
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,800
of a purist guy but what I like to do

445
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,039
personally is like I like to drink a

446
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:12,359
couple beers and and then smoke a joint

447
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,879
and like that's like my perfect tie it

448
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,318
takes uh it's like a combo effect but

449
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,439
it's not nothing is too much right so

450
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:20,639
like I don't puke I don't black out I

451
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,399
love you know all of a sudden I'm like

452
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,198
I'm stoked get on music I'm like having

453
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,159
good times I can conversate still it

454
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,278
takes away like the social anxiety

455
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,600
aspect of any weed it kind of balances

456
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,838
each other out and that's just my

457
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,440
perfect little cocktail I guess if you

458
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,839
will but yeah to add the cigarette or

459
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,759
the tobacco portion yeah it's I think it

460
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,560
would definitely get you high as [ __ ] so

461
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,079
there's that yeah yeah look I I wonder

462
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,399
if we'll ever get to the point where we

463
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,758
have like this crazy sort of mixing

464
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,278
protocol down and it's like you know

465
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:54,120
eventually everyone's smoking like

466
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,480
Amnesia haze bud with blue dream TPS

467
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,318
with you know tobacco whatever like I

468
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,120
wonder if we're going to distill it so

469
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,958
so here's what I would do that's

470
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,720
different from the tobacco so I would

471
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,000
call it this is this is like me when I

472
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,199
was younger I would do salad tosses so

473
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,919
that's what I would call it because I

474
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,400
would basically take a little chip off

475
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,120
each bud and then I pack it in a bong

476
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,439
and I just take a just gnarly like

477
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,119
yellow thick disgusting smoke I just be

478
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,600
faded like I was on acid or something it

479
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,198
was gnarly so I used to do that when I

480
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,558
was a kid but the salad tosses got to

481
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,079
the point when I was older I was like

482
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,519
[ __ ] I don't like it man it's just like

483
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,038
I can't even differentiate with you know

484
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,200
what I mean like I'm too high so it was

485
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:33,160
like to the point where I was

486
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,480
uncomfortable I was like this ain't that

487
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,000
fun so now I kind of stick with like

488
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,079
it's just like for me like with the beer

489
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,359
thing I'm like all right I know what

490
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,519
this thing does for me I know what this

491
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,678
thing does for me and it's like it's

492
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,639
easier to gauge I don't like to add all

493
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,080
kinds of stuff but like I think as a as

494
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,799
a younger person like you want to

495
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,359
experiment with like how far you can go

496
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,240
what tastes like what what does what to

497
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,359
you and so for me like I just wanted to

498
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,839
get high as [ __ ] when I was a kid so I

499
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,519
would literally just put like you know

500
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,158
three or four freaking uh strains and

501
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,319
and back when I was a kid

502
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,520
we didn't have names we didn't have

503
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,599
strains nothing it was just like here's

504
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,359
the next batch right so it was totally

505
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:09,240
different we didn't have Inda stea

506
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,038
hybrid nothing no names it was just dank

507
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,599
or not and so like I would keep so I I

508
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:16,440
used to sell uh I would sell bud but uh

509
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,798
I'll keep like the I'll go through each

510
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,480
batch and I'll keep like a couple like

511
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,679
favorite mugs from each batch like that

512
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,038
I thought were like the best looking

513
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,360
ones and I have this full [ __ ]

514
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:26,919
Tupperware of all these different buds

515
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,399
so like when I would do those salad

516
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,240
tosses ID just be like randomly picking

517
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,880
like four or five from all these random

518
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,319
[ __ ] strains and who knew what they

519
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,520
were I don't know if they're sativas

520
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,879
Inda dominant hybrids whatever like I

521
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:42,000
didn't give a [ __ ] either I was like

522
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:45,000
just get faded but yeah so anyways

523
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
um I'm gonna whip whip that name out in

524
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,519
front of all the homies with no

525
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,880
context yeah saladas boys but yeah and

526
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,400
you could do like with the joint same

527
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,039
thing yeah I love that so I think a lot

528
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,759
of people would be familiar with having

529
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:04,079
heard the word super Boo or the word

530
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,879
blockberry uh I'd love I'd love to get

531
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,599
an account now that we're doing a a

532
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,039
standalone episode what's the backstory

533
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:14,558
on the blockberry how did it come to be

534
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:18,519
well it just came to be that I didn't

535
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:20,079
want to pay $150 for seeds so to be 100%

536
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:23,720
honest with everybody out here I didn't

537
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:25,879
have any um Grand plans I didn't want to

538
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,600
do anything I wasn't trying to be

539
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,400
anybody it was just me paying for these

540
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:33,240
seeds that were so expensive to me and

541
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,559
like I had always collected seeds for

542
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,960
years but I didn't know how to store

543
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,399
them right so

544
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,400
like I used to sell weed when I was a

545
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,840
kid all the way up till I was an adult

546
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,120
and like I would save all these seeds

547
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,240
and uh it got to a point where I tried

548
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,918
to start popping them but they're all

549
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,798
like dead essentially so when I came

550
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,880
back into the game I was like [ __ ] dude

551
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:55,158
these things are $15 like we used we

552
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,520
used to throw these things out now

553
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,000
they're charging us for them so it was

554
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,720
it was mindboggling to me that they

555
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,720
would charge us for seeds and I was like

556
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,319
holy [ __ ] so I started buying these seed

557
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,600
packs and I became somewhat of a seed

558
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,119
junkie I was trying to collect all these

559
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:09,839
packs like Pokemon or something and then

560
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:12,000
I was like [ __ ] this so the reason why

561
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,879
that block barrier came to be was

562
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,679
because I was like got a dope mail here

563
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,520
dope F here and that was it there was

564
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:21,679
literally nothing behind that and so I

565
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,960
was like I'm just going to shake these

566
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,200
two up this one smells like blueberry

567
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,038
muffins this one smells like rotten

568
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,600
tangerines I'm like it'll smell like

569
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,879
some type of berry or something right

570
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,199
and that was like that was my thing and

571
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,840
I was like this one has great structure

572
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,200
this one has great structure they both

573
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,678
look dope boom and so I just crossed

574
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,240
them and so um I was like I didn't want

575
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,120
to waste anything either so that was the

576
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,279
other key thing since seeds were so

577
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,119
expensive I didn't even want to waste

578
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,879
males I was like [ __ ] dude I gotta I

579
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,439
gotta make this thing prolong itself so

580
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,280
I just created that for myself and so um

581
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
then I sent the seeds I sent some seeds

582
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,279
to to Jay because he and I were buddies

583
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,759
on Instagram and we trade seeds back and

584
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,639
forth before uh way before anything else

585
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,440
happened so like I sent him a couple

586
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,280
seeds and then he threw them in the back

587
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,400
of his I think it was his basement back

588
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,798
then and then uh and then he sent me a

589
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,320
pictures like holy [ __ ] bro these things

590
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,480
are blasting off and then so from there

591
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,038
I was like holy [ __ ] like I gotta pop

592
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,798
these myself and like I said I think in

593
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:22,319
our first um podcast I was like without

594
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,798
him dude I probably I don't know I don't

595
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,918
know if I would ever even pop these

596
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:28,119
seeds so he sent me a bunch of pics he

597
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,640
was like damn dude this thing is

598
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,918
cracking and so I was like [ __ ] I need

599
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,400
to pop these myself so I popped five

600
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,320
seeds and a I had a a shed so I popped

601
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,480
him my little shed and like I I think I

602
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,960
got like two or three males a mutant and

603
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,679
like by default I got my [ __ ] breeder

604
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,278
cut and I was like stok and I thought it

605
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,759
was a male because it was just blasting

606
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,359
off it was like it was like the Beast of

607
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,119
the group and then uh yeah so that's how

608
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:55,278
it started man and then and then mobile

609
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,839
J or J he took his cut and then he

610
00:21:55,278 --> 00:22:00,000
started like marketing it and selling it

611
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,119
in uh Michigan and I'm in California so

612
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,159
he's it's like you know like we're half

613
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:05,359
a country apart right so he started

614
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,799
doing his thing and then that started

615
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,798
taking off and I was like [ __ ] dude I

616
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,240
gotta I gotta see what's up with these

617
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:11,798
things so then that's when I started

618
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,359
popping my seeds and that's when I found

619
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,839
my cut and then eventually at some point

620
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,399
I got um both the cuts he sent me that

621
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,639
um I had it grown next to mine and I

622
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,000
just likeed mine better so I ended up

623
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,520
keeping mine but the super boo cut and

624
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,798
everybody else's cut everybody else has

625
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,480
pop seeds that guy in O OS grown like

626
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,759
everybody finds winners in that in that

627
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,839
in that uh in that cross so but yeah

628
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,119
that's how it

629
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,199
started wow what a what a really

630
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,158
interesting story I have to ask a few

631
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,679
specifics there I mean the first one is

632
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,400
how would you describe the differences

633
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,480
between the super Booth cut that

634
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,519
circulates from mobile J versus your

635
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:50,839
keeper cut of what we call blockberry

636
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:55,200
yeah yeah so his is um it's tighter node

637
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:56,720
structure and it has um giant colas

638
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,319
right because it has tighter node

639
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,319
structure so that's his and it doesn't

640
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:03,918
go as purple and it doesn't stretch as

641
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,599
much so these are the key differences

642
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,120
that I noticed because I ran them both

643
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,678
multiple times back to back and no

644
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,439
matter what like I don't care which one

645
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,200
anybody prefers like it doesn't matter

646
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,679
to me right I like all the all the fenos

647
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,720
are like my babies right like I don't I

648
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:22,278
don't care which one you prefer um and

649
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,919
then so mine the one that I chose it's

650
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:27,400
basically it's a little bit lankier it

651
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:31,320
it kind of It kind of uh took on more of

652
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:34,960
the black cherry punch um structure from

653
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,759
from from the mom and it it got darker

654
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,960
so like the other key thing is to me is

655
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:40,480
like the the breeder cut it goes more

656
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,440
purple it goes like magenta it's not

657
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,000
even like purple it's like magenta and

658
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,960
if you can control all these factors

659
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,400
like the whole thing will go magenta um

660
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,038
and then the super boo cut doesn't go

661
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,400
all magenta so the key difference this

662
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,640
is is that the Blackberry breeder cut

663
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,640
will get a little bit lankier it'll

664
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,679
stretch a little bit harder it won't

665
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:06,640
have the giant TW foot um colas but

666
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,840
giant colas but it won't be as um tight

667
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
so the key differences as well from that

668
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,038
and that's part of the reason why I

669
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:15,519
chose the breeder cut I didn't keep the

670
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:17,158
super boo cut was because um when you

671
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,278
have giant colas that are really tightly

672
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,760
stacked it's harder to control with mold

673
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:26,119
so I've heard some people tell me that

674
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,519
they're super boo cut molds so it is

675
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,278
what it is and I don't know what they're

676
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,000
doing right so like everybody's

677
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:34,359
everybody's environment is different so

678
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,119
but they both yielded super high they

679
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,558
both freaking smelled pretty much

680
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,119
exactly the same I I mean I just I love

681
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:42,720
them both dude there's there's no reason

682
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,319
why like anybody wouldn't love them both

683
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,798
unless they're like you know they could

684
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:48,798
be very picky but like they're both

685
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,839
they're both bangers bro like they both

686
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:54,000
test super high uh

687
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:56,959
apparently the super boo washes really

688
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,278
well the [ __ ] Blackberry washes well

689
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,759
um it just it's just just comes out a

690
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:04,720
personal preference really but yeah

691
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:07,960
those are the key differences are the um

692
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,399
the node spacing so for for Instagram I

693
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,480
would say the super boo probably looks

694
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:12,239
better in the sense of like you have

695
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,599
these giant [ __ ] two foot coals that

696
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,640
are just stacked you know what I mean

697
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,278
but then if you look at the breeder cut

698
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,399
it's purple or or magenta and it's

699
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,880
stacked but it's not as like tightly no

700
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:26,000
space and it's just it's just a bigger

701
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,440
more vigorous plant but like I said man

702
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,079
it's it's really splitting hairs like I

703
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,480
and just so you know to for for

704
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:36,199
everybody else to know as well I finally

705
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,880
just popped all kinds of new uh

706
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,360
Blackberry seeds all f1s right so I'm

707
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,799
finally searching for [ __ ] F2 dude so

708
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,199
so I'm finally there everybody's always

709
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,119
oh when when you can I get some seeds so

710
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,840
I just did that right now probably like

711
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:53,359
a week ago so we're on to the f2s now

712
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:55,439
I'm searching for this dope male uh I'll

713
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,000
probably cross it to my breeder cut

714
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,960
unless I find just some crazy female out

715
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,440
of the uh out of the f1s but most lik

716
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
I'll do both but uh yeah so there's

717
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,840
going to be some f2s

718
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,720
coming Ah that's really really exciting

719
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,319
I mean seeds for everybody yeah so it's

720
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,480
about time I know everybody's talking

721
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,519
[ __ ] and to me I was like does anybody

722
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,079
really want this [ __ ] like it's old in

723
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,798
the sense of like I think I created

724
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,519
these things in I don't even know when

725
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:25,038
it's been years right I'm like does

726
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,798
anybody still give a [ __ ] but like

727
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,919
people still hit me up so I'm like [ __ ]

728
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,639
might as well make them so it's finally

729
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,520
on to that yeah nice and is the goal to

730
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,360
be able to like eventually line breed it

731
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,038
to the point where like you can offer it

732
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,199
as like a a seed line that's like really

733
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:41,839
consistent in the outcome or is it more

734
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,759
just to take it to the F2 and not

735
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,038
necessarily go like further oh no yeah

736
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm trying to definitely make it to

737
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:51,200
where it's like my my key thing in in

738
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,720
all breeding projects is to make it so

739
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,278
you don't have to pop 800 seeds to find

740
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,558
a winner like can you find a [ __ ]

741
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,558
prod uction strain within five or six

742
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:04,000
seeds most likely not but that's my goal

743
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:05,879
like I want to make it to where like

744
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,200
everybody can find a winner because like

745
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,720
you and I were just talking about before

746
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,919
this podcast

747
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,159
started one to two seeds is not going to

748
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,440
give you an accurate representation as

749
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,960
to what this line does but what I want

750
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,840
is like if you pop because like I'm I'm

751
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,558
a small Tent Guy right so like I started

752
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:25,158
there I want every tent guy and girl to

753
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,599
be able to pop a couple seeds and find

754
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,480
something that's dope I don't want them

755
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:32,798
to have to like you shouldn't have to

756
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,079
buy 30 packs or bulk to find a winner in

757
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,319
my eyes right so like that I want it I

758
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,798
want it to be for the everyday person

759
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:42,000
and that's my goal so what I'm looking

760
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:43,798
for in f2s is I'm gonna look for a

761
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,440
[ __ ] Banger ass mail that's like

762
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:49,000
structurally pretty much the same

763
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,120
vigorous um if not the same as as my

764
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
blockberry or the super boo color Etc um

765
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,599
tpen obviously huge um structure

766
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,759
obviously huge and I'm going to I'm

767
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,158
going to do that but I'm going to

768
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,798
probably make multiples of them I'm GNA

769
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,240
most likely I'm going to have multiple

770
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,720
different um phenotype crosses but yeah

771
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,440
so the goal will be for me is to make

772
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,880
sure that everybody

773
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,278
has consistency in the sense that like

774
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,480
they're always going to find like four

775
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,599
or five seeds you're gonna have you're

776
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,240
gonna have a banger you're not gonna

777
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,519
have to [ __ ] hunt a thousand seeds to

778
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,640
find that one gem yeah nice I like that

779
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,640
sentiment and you you sort of preempted

780
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,159
my next question which was I noticed you

781
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,640
put a post up the other day and you were

782
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:31,799
sort of referencing that uh some of your

783
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,440
best Keepers like the Halle Berry and

784
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:37,079
the the blockberry came from all off

785
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,558
five seeds yep so is that sort of the

786
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,798
number you think is a good number like

787
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,000
you should be able to find something

788
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:45,158
from around five seeds that's that's not

789
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,319
even a that's not a that's just for me a

790
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:51,240
personal goal and like I said if you are

791
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,639
if you're popping seeds in a tent and

792
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,038
you're because let's be honest the

793
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,480
people that are usually buying the bulk

794
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:57,558
of the seeds are people that are hom

795
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,798
Growers the hom Growers don't have have

796
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,678
a giant facility to grow [ __ ]

797
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:03,158
thousands of seeds and find this [ __ ]

798
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,080
winner and Whittle them down like they

799
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,919
don't have that like those are the

800
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,599
people that are buying I'm trying to I'm

801
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,278
trying to make it so like everybody

802
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:13,759
who's buying my seeds finds something

803
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:16,480
dope and my point on that uh post was

804
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,038
that I found all those literally within

805
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,399
five seeds because I don't have I don't

806
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:21,359
have a giant space I have a tiny little

807
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:23,599
space in my garage and then like I have

808
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,759
other stuff too now but like when I

809
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,918
found those I was just like smalltime

810
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,079
hom grower essentially right so like I

811
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,640
want to make sure that everybody gets

812
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,278
there's their money's worth and like I

813
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,480
just saw this post the other day some

814
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:38,919
somebody popped a whole pack he didn't

815
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,079
get any any to even Sprout I'm like what

816
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,519
the [ __ ] dude like so I couldn't even

817
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,558
imagine that like they didn't test their

818
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,120
ger rates anyways I'm not trying to bag

819
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:50,440
on anybody but like I want to make sure

820
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,398
a my [ __ ] pops and B like you get a

821
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,159
[ __ ] Banger at least a decent Banger

822
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,599
you know what I mean like so anyways

823
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,320
that's my goal in breeding I just want

824
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:01,519
to make things better versus just hype

825
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:03,519
on hype but I will say this to my

826
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,000
detriment I have done a couple hype on

827
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,159
hype crosses recently and I don't know

828
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,398
if they're going to be good or not so

829
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,200
I'm trying to test them beforehand but

830
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:13,439
um yeah but that that's my goal man I

831
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,640
want to make it so it's like every

832
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,038
person out there buys a pack of seeds

833
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,640
they can get something at least decent

834
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:21,960
does it have to be full-on production

835
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,960
strain production strain I mean does it

836
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,480
yield three light and does it have all

837
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,640
these [ __ ] you know boxes checked may

838
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,440
or may not right but like will it yield

839
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,480
fairly well will it have [ __ ] turps

840
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,759
will it have uh Power behind it will it

841
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,079
have uh you know the bag ofel etc etc

842
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,200
I'm trying to check as many boxes as I

843
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,678
can for everybody so yeah nice well look

844
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,919
before we move on I'd love to quickly

845
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,840
ask you know because you sort of touched

846
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,880
on it just there tell us about some of

847
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,918
the upcoming hype on hype I'd love to

848
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,039
know what you got in the future uh yeah

849
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,759
so we did um I teamed up with belief uh

850
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:59,200
Dan from belief we did a chimera 3 Cross

851
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:01,278
of blockberry those are fem but

852
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,679
unfortunately it didn't yield that many

853
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,038
seeds so um we're trying that again so

854
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,120
right now I I sent him a bunch of clones

855
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,000
and like he's gonna try and do it

856
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,199
because he just sent me the pollen so

857
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,558
the pollen didn't give that that many fs

858
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,319
and um so we have enough to test but I'm

859
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,960
testing a couple of those right now and

860
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,519
then I sent him a bunch of packs to test

861
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,278
as well so we're doing that so that's

862
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,638
going to be a big one hopefully right um

863
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:26,798
and then I also sent him some clones so

864
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:28,798
we're going to make some if if it's

865
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:31,000
viable it's not a Herm Fest it's it's

866
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:34,240
it's a banger we'll send that out to the

867
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,798
masses so we've got that um I did this

868
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,839
thing with um tsunami seeds where they

869
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,918
did the animal tsunami so I I I uh

870
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,079
crossed out with blockberry again didn't

871
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,960
yield a [ __ ] ton of seeds so I'm hunting

872
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:49,439
those um I did some uh black uh or

873
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,880
excuse me some C

874
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:57,120
junkie um f crosses I did uh GMO cross

875
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,360
with root beer th crosses I did some s1s

876
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,119
Blackberry to

877
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,519
Blackberry

878
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:06,398
um the other one it's a black cherry

879
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,720
gelato cross a Blackberry did a baby

880
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,038
Yoda cross a blockberry so I've got a

881
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,679
lot of these I just got to hunt through

882
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:13,679
them and then see if they're viable

883
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,120
because like the hard part

884
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,880
is is you can make all these crosses and

885
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:19,158
it's really no way to test them all

886
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,440
right so like you have to send them out

887
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:22,840
to testers but the problem with testers

888
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,278
is a lot of these people just go they

889
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,158
just on you so they just throw them in

890
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,480
their I don't know what they do with

891
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,080
them but they don't hit you back man

892
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,919
once they get the SE that's it so for me

893
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:33,918
what I've learned is I'm like I just got

894
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:35,759
hun on myself so whether or not certain

895
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,679
ones of these will be available or not

896
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,599
will be based on me basically hunting

897
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,480
myself making sure they're not Herm Fest

898
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,879
really and if they're good so yeah those

899
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,759
are some of the some of the hyper

900
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,000
crosses I guess there's probably some

901
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,679
more in there that I forgot but those

902
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,398
are the recent that's like the recent

903
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,440
lot yeah nice that's cool I mean the the

904
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:55,839
Cher certainly been making a lot of

905
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,840
waves so it no no surprises there that

906
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,879
one's probably going to be pretty pop

907
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,959
shout out to my boy at uh uh at at

908
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,320
tsunami as well dude that animal tsunami

909
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,558
so far like that [ __ ] looks amazing dude

910
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,638
so that I think that one's going to be

911
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,278
like the one but anyways but yeah the

912
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:12,079
the chamra ones also as well look great

913
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:14,159
but like I think the animal tsunami

914
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,000
One's Gonna Be Like that's G to be

915
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,399
that's going to be the one but we'll see

916
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,440
still young nice nice look you mentioned

917
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:24,199
making the blockberry f2s I'm going to

918
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,240
use this as a sneaky spot to do a bit of

919
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,519
Shameless self-promotion here um you

920
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,919
know we've already discussed this so

921
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,319
hopefully it's nothing too surprising

922
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,840
but um you know shout out to two dudes

923
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,798
in Australia Wizard of Oz and Os grown

924
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,918
who were the two guys who were like

925
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,918
clued in enough to grab a pack of the

926
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:44,159
blockberry f1s off you um a few years

927
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,880
ago and we're going to do some f2s and

928
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,320
I'd love to get you some but my question

929
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,360
is how how are you going to do the f2s

930
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:51,000
are you planning on just doing a

931
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,278
straight open pollination or do you want

932
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,398
to try to whittle it down to maybe one

933
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,480
select male and go from there what's

934
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:59,518
your plans

935
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah so basically the way I do it is I

936
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,720
it's it's just like anything else right

937
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,519
so you're you're like um you're a

938
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,600
breeder at some point so you got to look

939
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,398
for genetic traits that you're looking

940
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:10,719
for or that you want or it depends on

941
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:13,000
what you're looking for so for me I want

942
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:17,078
to have consistency so I want to

943
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,358
have at least consistent

944
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,519
um obviously growth patterns uh

945
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,598
structure it's hard to do Turing

946
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,918
profiles with males you can you can kind

947
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,519
of do them like some of them will wreak

948
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,519
obviously and you can do like a stem rub

949
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:32,000
but it's it's not guaranteed but like

950
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,519
you want to have like Vigor etc etc

951
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,679
right and like some some males will even

952
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:38,679
turn color so like it depends on what

953
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,398
you're looking for so for me what I'm

954
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,639
personally looking for is I want to

955
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,719
match something because essentially with

956
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,440
f2s what I'm trying to do is lock down

957
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:52,759
exact traits that match up right so to

958
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,639
me the breeder cut is a [ __ ] beast so

959
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,639
I want to match that so I want to find

960
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,640
something Viger for Viger structure to

961
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,880
structure structure color to color TP to

962
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,000
turp even though that's hard to do with

963
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,079
a mail and that's what I want to do so

964
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,280
that's what I'm personally looking for

965
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,480
um in terms of your question in terms of

966
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,440
open

967
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,519
pollination um I I I I won't do that

968
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,679
personally but like if if you just yeah

969
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:19,000
I mean if you just want to do that just

970
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,239
to make some seeds for yourself for sure

971
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,960
100% there's nothing wrong with it you

972
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,519
can still hunt through you could have

973
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,159
thousands of seeds for free now right so

974
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,239
now you got like that genetic as a

975
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,319
backup so I wouldn't I wouldn't tell

976
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,159
anybody not to do that but for me to try

977
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,559
and sell so it's different right if

978
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,159
you're trying to sell seeds I'm trying

979
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:37,759
to sell somebody the fact that they're

980
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,440
going to get something very similar to

981
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,920
what I have and and it has to be

982
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,200
consistent so for me like I have to be a

983
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,880
little bit more um rigorous in in my in

984
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,480
my

985
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,119
selections yeah sure that makes sense

986
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,358
and and what sort of plants do you think

987
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,119
would in general pair well with

988
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,078
blockberry do you think like oh well the

989
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,519
blockberry has got like the the flavor

990
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,880
so I pair it with

991
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:06,119
potency so uh that's a good question so

992
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,000
I will say this I my only thing is is

993
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,480
I'm literally trying to take everything

994
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,880
blockberry switch out CPS and flavor

995
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,519
because the that's the only thing that I

996
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,519
think is missing in the sense that uh

997
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,119
not everybody likes Citrus right so like

998
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,838
somebody like [ __ ] blockberry that

999
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,838
tastes like f whatever Tangi so I'm like

1000
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:28,400
I get it not everybody likes vanilla

1001
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:30,599
everybody likes chocolate or strawberry

1002
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,480
right so like what I'm trying to do is

1003
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm trying to swap out the turps so I

1004
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,920
want to make a full [ __ ] gnarly Heavy

1005
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,079
Gas just like earthy burnt rubber Vibe

1006
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,318
with the same structure same yield same

1007
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,359
look right I want to take a [ __ ]

1008
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:47,759
papaya I want to take a orange I want to

1009
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:50,480
take a strawberry I want to take the

1010
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,880
whole gamut that we have hops right I

1011
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,358
want to take them all uh

1012
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,280
lemon uh pine trees pine whatever I want

1013
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:59,598
to take them all and just add it to the

1014
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,880
[ __ ] blockberry structure because

1015
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,039
like to me it's going to be a guaranteed

1016
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,920
Banger for facilities because at this

1017
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:08,039
stage in our game at least here in

1018
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,200
California people are closing down left

1019
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,440
and right and they need these unicorns

1020
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:14,358
right so they need these things to be

1021
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,800
able to yield like a monster and they

1022
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:17,440
have to hit all these other boxes the

1023
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,000
problem is if you have all these other

1024
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,200
hype strains a lot of them will hit a

1025
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,039
certain amount of boxes but they don't

1026
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,358
hit them all so I'm trying to make it to

1027
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,239
where like every single one of these are

1028
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:27,400
production strains and like that's my

1029
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,159
goal

1030
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,599
so if it can hit different flavor

1031
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,199
profiles and different tur profiles but

1032
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:35,880
keep the same structure and look like I

1033
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,159
did with like the super cush right that

1034
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,838
was a uh blockberry Cross or triangle

1035
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:44,960
cush dude it's a g it's a it's it's a

1036
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:47,599
game changer so like uh triangle Kush

1037
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,199
was never like a giant stacking big it

1038
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,280
was some like satellite buds like some

1039
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,960
Top Knots right um but now mixing with a

1040
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,800
blockberry you get these [ __ ] like

1041
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,400
like with super Boo or or or or whatever

1042
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,280
so super we get these giant colas now

1043
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,358
that are stacked or [ __ ] coated in

1044
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,519
crystals or you know tricomes and now

1045
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:09,039
they have cush turps it's like bang dude

1046
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:10,800
this exactly what I wanted so things

1047
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,358
like that that's all I'm trying to do so

1048
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,359
I'm trying to I'm basically trying to

1049
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:18,559
create flavors for everybody with the

1050
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:21,000
same structure and yield and color and

1051
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,599
bag of Peel etc etc so that everybody

1052
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,599
can [ __ ] grow it everybody can be

1053
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,039
stoked on how much they yield because

1054
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,960
really it comes down to if it's

1055
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,519
shielding one and a half a light

1056
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,760
nobody's going to grow that long term

1057
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,400
unless it's just for a head stash like

1058
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,240
it's nowadays it just doesn't make any

1059
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,838
sense like the prices are too low so

1060
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:42,000
like you need to literally come as close

1061
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:43,880
to three light or more as possible so

1062
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,519
that's my goal I want to make it so

1063
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,400
every tent grower as well as every

1064
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,960
facility is like bang on dude let me

1065
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,240
just change out these [ __ ] turps

1066
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,079
right because not everybody's going to

1067
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:56,239
like whatever so that's the goal I love

1068
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,200
it and I I love that you dropped the the

1069
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,239
T K in the mix there uh cuz I know that

1070
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:04,919
you've done some breeding old school

1071
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:07,838
dude I had to so first first question is

1072
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,960
what's your favorite OG oh [ __ ] dude I

1073
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,078
like the Skywalker OG for some [ __ ]

1074
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,240
reason dude I always go back to that one

1075
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,280
I don't know if you guys have ever had

1076
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,078
that out there but it's just like that's

1077
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,319
my

1078
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,920
go-to Skywalker

1079
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:22,960
OG that's cool well the reason why I ask

1080
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,559
is because and it's again good you

1081
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,440
mentioned the TK I noticed you done some

1082
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,920
breeding with the TK bx1 M tell us a bit

1083
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,240
about that who'd that one come from was

1084
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,800
it jungle boys no se junkie so SE junkie

1085
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,399
um that was like one of the first CED

1086
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,359
packs I ever bought I think it I think

1087
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,318
the first two CED packs I ever bought

1088
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:42,799
like bought bought when I tried to do

1089
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:47,159
this thing um

1090
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:50,599
was on seeds and it was like papaya OG

1091
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,960
and it was uh SE junkie triangle cush

1092
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,480
bx1 and so those things have sat the

1093
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,838
longest in the fridge right so um those

1094
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,480
were the ones that I was like I'm just

1095
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:01,279
going to throw in some dirt see how it

1096
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,240
goes and then it was outdoor and I was

1097
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,920
like they got eaten alive by [ __ ] bug

1098
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,519
it was boof because it's you know

1099
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,240
whatever so those are the ones that I

1100
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:13,559
started with um and

1101
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:16,959
then uh my dog she actually she actually

1102
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:18,318
I had a bunch of the uh the sea junkie

1103
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,880
uh triangle cush out there and she

1104
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,838
[ __ ] ate them all sheing like ravaged

1105
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,440
them and so uh I think I only had like

1106
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:28,119
three seeds left and so towards the end

1107
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,880
so I I can't lie and say that I had a

1108
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:34,480
full you know uh pack or multiple packs

1109
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,760
and I got to hunt a male to do this

1110
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,079
cross with I literally was stuck with

1111
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,480
like well I got this mail so I'm not

1112
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,280
trying to lie to anybody like so I

1113
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,719
literally had this last mail and I was

1114
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,000
like [ __ ] dude I I gotta use

1115
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:52,000
it because it was my it was like my last

1116
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,599
three seeds so thanks to my dog yeah my

1117
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,838
dog ain't my homework right so uh yeah

1118
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,800
dude that [ __ ] so uh I so I had to use

1119
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,400
that one and um turns out it wasn't a

1120
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,599
bad meil like I like it it was just a

1121
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,760
little bit it was a little bit too TK

1122
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,280
for me in the sense that like um if you

1123
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,400
grew TK a lot of it sometimes it it

1124
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,960
grows kind of lanky and like satellite

1125
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,039
buds so like I will have um some fenos

1126
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,960
for each one of those crosses that are

1127
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,318
traditional TK which is not a bad thing

1128
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,480
but like I personally would have wanted

1129
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,318
a little something different a little

1130
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,280
bit more variance but yeah so now that's

1131
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,199
interesting to hear the backstory and

1132
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,040
part of the reason I bring it up is I

1133
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:33,159
see you did some crosses with the soap

1134
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,279
and the emergency and you know you you

1135
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:37,078
mentioned J bezy tell us a bit about

1136
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,640
those crosses and the mothers did you

1137
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:43,280
like them the soap is [ __ ] insane so

1138
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,960
the only problem with the soap is that

1139
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,400
uh I've got barely any

1140
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:53,079
seeds and I and like I sold some to some

1141
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,400
seed um some seed banks but like I

1142
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:57,200
didn't have that many seeds but I pop

1143
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,000
some myself and the [ __ ] turps are

1144
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:02,759
amazing dude like they're so [ __ ]

1145
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,519
good all gas obviously right um so I

1146
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,280
love that one but like it's not a huge

1147
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:09,000
yielder it it's it's it's on the

1148
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,800
triangle Kush Vibe right so it's not a

1149
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,519
huge it's not it's not a production

1150
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,359
trrain from from what I've hunted right

1151
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,519
but I only hunted like you know 10 seeds

1152
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,480
or something so it's for me when I hunt

1153
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,400
the seeds I'm just trying to do proof of

1154
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,599
concept because I don't have the room so

1155
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,599
I'm try I'm trying to do proof of

1156
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,079
concept make sure they're not Herms make

1157
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,318
sure I don't have a [ __ ] a much mutants

1158
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:31,640
make sure that the U germination rate is

1159
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:33,358
is right um but anyways that soap one

1160
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:36,358
though dude for personal smokees [ __ ]

1161
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,199
gas bro like It's banging um and it's

1162
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:39,639
beautiful bro but it doesn't I don't

1163
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,519
think it washes well either so if people

1164
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:43,799
are trying to get it for washers like

1165
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,800
it's oily as [ __ ] like you touch it's so

1166
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,680
greasy like but for me like I only smell

1167
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,318
flour so like it's [ __ ] dank dude

1168
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,639
it's like you know what I mean it's like

1169
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,880
it's hard to roll a joint this is so

1170
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,838
[ __ ] greasy so for me it's like

1171
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,200
perfect um what was the other one you

1172
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:59,838
asked about the emergency

1173
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,000
yeah yeah so I've had uh I haven't

1174
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,440
popped in those myself I had a bunch of

1175
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,440
testers and the emergency is supposed to

1176
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,679
be [ __ ] fire but

1177
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,159
like the only people that I've talked to

1178
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:12,719
that have had it that have made it that

1179
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:16,960
have pulled it out and like showed me

1180
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:18,399
it's it's like it has orange turp like I

1181
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,000
know a lot of people that are trying to

1182
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,440
do the TK crosses aren't down for the

1183
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,358
orange turs but there are the under

1184
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,800
liers that aren't orange turps as and

1185
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,480
and same with the emergencies like there

1186
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,440
are some that are not Orange turs

1187
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,719
they're [ __ ] gas so there are those

1188
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,480
under liers but the emergency that I

1189
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:34,719
cross it with is such a beast dude it

1190
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,240
was a [ __ ] giant just monstrosity

1191
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:40,719
just super vigorous heavy yields

1192
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,879
beautiful plant um so if you don't hate

1193
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,639
orange turrets and you're willing to

1194
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,400
risk it dude that's a that's a big one

1195
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:48,719
for sure ah cool no that's a good

1196
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,920
insight and I mean you know while we're

1197
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,679
on the topic of jbzy there's been a lot

1198
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,280
of uh you know sort of ripples in the

1199
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,480
industry regarding jbz and then also you

1200
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,760
know given the whole thing with cookies

1201
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,358
do you do you take any sides in that one

1202
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,880
do you do you see much of that whole

1203
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:08,159
thing going down oh I don't know

1204
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,920
anything about the um the personal stuff

1205
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,799
I just know that there were like on our

1206
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,000
side over here on the on the states it

1207
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,240
was like it wasn't necessarily A cookies

1208
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,318
thing it was a uh glass house thing so

1209
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:23,039
like when he partnered with glass house

1210
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:25,880
like everybody chose sides and they lost

1211
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,400
their [ __ ] cuz the guy from glass house

1212
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,519
um it's like a big big deal out here

1213
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,880
like the guy was a was an ex cop and

1214
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:36,079
whatever yeah K kazin yeah a lot of

1215
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,880
people lost their [ __ ] on that one so I

1216
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,200
think that one's more so like with the

1217
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,200
cookie stuff like I don't know man I

1218
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,318
assume that burner is probably pretty

1219
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:48,719
shady dude because like a lot of people

1220
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,239
talk about it and like no disrespect

1221
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:54,078
anybody but like you I assume that like

1222
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,479
you have to have your lawyers involved

1223
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,839
before you do anything with that guy

1224
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,159
because I don't think he plays by like

1225
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:02,480
you know the same set of rules I think

1226
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,799
he changes the the rules of the game as

1227
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,159
he goes and I don't know what their

1228
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,039
situation is so I don't know how to

1229
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,920
comment on it but like based on from an

1230
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,480
Outsiders perspective like based on what

1231
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,680
I've seen like he seems to change the

1232
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,440
rules as it goes and that's just I don't

1233
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,000
know it's it's part for the course man I

1234
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,559
I I'll tell you this

1235
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,800
dude the unfortunate part of this whole

1236
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:25,519
industry is that there are a lot of

1237
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,039
people that you can and cannot trust but

1238
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,318
you don't know until you go down the

1239
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,719
road with them and so it's kind of

1240
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:34,199
[ __ ] it's it's kind of like fenal

1241
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,399
hunting for for partners in all honesty

1242
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,159
so it's it's hard man it's like what do

1243
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,358
you do like this person has seemed legit

1244
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:41,639
and then at the end of the game at the

1245
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:46,159
end of the day like they could screw you

1246
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:47,759
over like you don't know so um yeah I

1247
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,239
honestly don't know what their situation

1248
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,960
is behind the behind closed doors so I

1249
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,919
couldn't really comment but I would say

1250
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,800
the the more important or the more I

1251
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,200
guess uh

1252
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,000
controversial was The Glass House combo

1253
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:04,519
or and then and then and then supposedly

1254
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,079
like that thing fizzled so I don't I

1255
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:08,960
don't know what happened but um yeah I

1256
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,880
don't know man that's between all them

1257
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,000
right like I don't I don't really have

1258
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,480
an opinion I'm just Outsider just like

1259
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,239
you know I like to hear everybody's side

1260
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,318
before I I choose right but I didn't

1261
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,759
hear everybody's side so from Jay beey

1262
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,440
standpoint sounds like he got [ __ ]

1263
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,200
over but I didn't hear everybody else as

1264
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,880
side so I don't know yeah while we're on

1265
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:28,480
the topic of the industry I was uh you

1266
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,119
know doing some research for this

1267
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,639
episode as I generally do and when I was

1268
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,358
Googling around I feel like I got the

1269
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:39,358
strong impression that blockberry has

1270
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:41,119
got to be one of the most sold clones on

1271
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,078
the market like in terms of like

1272
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,400
everyone's offering blockberry as a

1273
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,318
cutting for sale how does that how does

1274
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,079
that play into what you're doing do you

1275
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:51,400
do you find that like that's humbling

1276
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,119
that's awesome or how does it um

1277
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,240
interplay with your operation and how do

1278
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,680
you feel about

1279
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,759
it oh it's amazing amaz so for me my

1280
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,440
goal is not to just make a [ __ ] ton of

1281
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,400
money and and [ __ ] people over like my

1282
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:08,000
initial goal like I said was just to

1283
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,119
make more seed for myself so my

1284
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,239
impression to answer your question is if

1285
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:13,599
that's the most sold clone like that's

1286
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,118
[ __ ] awesome because all I really

1287
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,640
want to do with this whole strain is

1288
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,838

1289

1291
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:29,719

1297
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,760
charge for it right if you ask me I'm

1298
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:44,159

1299

have so many but like to me like yeah

1300

dude that's [ __ ] awesome man like i'

1301
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,199
I've never heard this stat so um that's

1302
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,960
great man I I love

1303
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:56,318
it yeah look I mean it's it's honestly

1304
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,079
just observation I could be wrong but it

1305
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,440
seems like it's extremely popular and I

1306
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,400
mean on that same note I'd love to ask

1307
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,200
you I saw a few companies that were

1308
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,559
getting like really top dollar for for

1309
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,318
uh you know they label it as super boo

1310
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:12,359
super boo but obviously it's blockberry

1311
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:13,558
but I I found one notable instance where

1312
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,000
there was a company it looked like it

1313
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:19,960
was high quality they were selling uh a

1314
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,039
quarter of Smalls for $75 and I thought

1315
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,800
that's actually really good like that's

1316
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:27,480
surprisingly good how how does that

1317
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,119
impact your whole um Dynamic do you

1318
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,119
stoked that like you know it's able to

1319
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,240
command that sort of

1320
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:37,559
price yeah and and the crazy part is is

1321
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:39,479
that it's been years since this came out

1322
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:41,200
so like certain people are like I'm

1323
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,079
tired of it right but other people still

1324
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,318
hav't caught onto it so that's the thing

1325
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,720
it's literally been an underground slow

1326
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:49,199
roller slow player the whole time so

1327
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:51,480
it's just been building and building and

1328
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:53,078
building and so it's [ __ ] amazing

1329
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,199
that it's still even in the conversation

1330
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:58,680
to me and then to add to that if it

1331
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,399
commands anything like that's amazing

1332
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:01,759
right because like how many people go

1333
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,639
through so many hype strains or on to

1334
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,520
the next onto the next onto the next and

1335
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:08,039
this was never a hype strain this is

1336
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,519
some random dude in [ __ ] California

1337
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:10,798
that everybody thinks is in Michigan you

1338
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,039
know what I'm saying so like to me

1339
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:15,119
that's [ __ ] awesome to me the fact

1340
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:18,558
that anybody's even talking about it

1341
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,519
anymore is amazing so I'm super stoked

1342
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,480
and like like I said man my only thing

1343
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:25,039
is I want this [ __ ] to go out to the

1344
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,039
world like I want everybody to have it

1345
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,519
it's a [ __ ]

1346
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,599
it's a it's a production strain right

1347
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,039
like you could literally like let me

1348
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,039
just tell you something dude so side

1349
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:38,440
note side note um I partner with this

1350
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,358
company called zenleaf and uh they're

1351
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,838
they're legal here in California and

1352
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:44,078
like they flat out told me like dude

1353
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,558
it's a [ __ ] unicorn it hits numbers

1354
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,680
it hits [ __ ] weight it hits all these

1355
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:50,040
things right so it hits all these these

1356
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,598
these these uh these these metrics that

1357
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:54,079
they that they account for and then

1358
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,599
they're like dude it adds however much

1359
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,160
I'm not going to say that however much

1360
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,160
but it adds however much to our bottom

1361
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:03,199
end every month it's [ __ ] insane so

1362
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:05,399
it brings people back from the brink

1363
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,078
like that's huge to me I'm like dude so

1364
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,838
humbling to hear that like that's

1365
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,920
[ __ ] amazing like dude trust me bro

1366
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:13,400
it's a [ __ ] unicorn whether or not

1367
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,400
you like the you know the the the turps

1368
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,400
are one thing right so that's why I'm

1369
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,559
still trying to look for the other turps

1370
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,000
but uh yeah man it's very humbling so to

1371
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,559
hear that it still commands anything

1372
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,599
because it's been around to me for so

1373
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:28,599
long I think it was 200 19 when I made

1374
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:31,480
that so what's it four years yeah it's

1375
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:34,318
[ __ ] amazing so yeah I love it that's

1376
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,119
awesome that's awesome and um I wanted

1377
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,719
to ask you know I I had seen in your

1378
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:40,440
stories it it came across to me like

1379
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,159
there might have been at some point at

1380
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,039
least a little bit of friction between

1381
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:46,239
you and mobile J and I wanted to just

1382
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,838
ask are we reclaiming the name we trying

1383
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:49,558
to get rid of the super Booth title and

1384
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,119
just get it blockberry once and for all

1385
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,920
or are we happy to let the super Booth

1386
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:58,079
slide oh no it was always Blackberry was

1387
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:00,680
the strin name he changed his um to to

1388
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:04,599
Super boo and I we talked about that in

1389
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:06,078
the first uh podcast and it's like to me

1390
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:09,440
that's just the

1391
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,760
cut but it's never been the strain name

1392
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,639
so like I'm not trying to regain

1393
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,359
anything in the sense of that it's just

1394
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,879
that's the that's his specific cut is

1395
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,798
the blockberry or excuse me the super

1396
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,358
boo cut of blockberry so for me I'm just

1397
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:24,000
like asserting myself in the sense of

1398
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:25,960
like it was never The Strain was never

1399
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,519
super boo it was always blockberry like

1400
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,559
we never I never changed that he changed

1401
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:31,880
it to Super boo it's kind of like a

1402
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,040
little [ __ ] you know it's like it's

1403
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,000
like my little brother right he's like

1404
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:38,279
[ __ ] you like we're just talking [ __ ] to

1405
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,280
each other um which is fine but yeah so

1406
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,798
the name itself it's always going to be

1407
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,920
blockberry and there's there's no

1408
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,960
there's no talk about that the cut

1409
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,280
itself you can call it whatever you want

1410
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,960
so super boo cut a blockberry it's game

1411
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,200
so good on him and not I don't but yeah

1412
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,720
the The Strain name is never going to

1413
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,318
change it's blockberry it's not it's

1414
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:59,000
never been super Pro but never will be

1415
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:02,079
that's awesome that's awesome to hear

1416
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,880
okay um so I wanted to ask what line

1417
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,519
that you've created are you most excited

1418
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,760
to work with

1419
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,880
next ah so just uh what were we just

1420
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,839
talking about so I just did here's

1421
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,160
something I just did these

1422
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:18,279
um so I just did these Blackberry AC

1423
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,480
cross with uh blueberry frosting and

1424
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,119
like what we were just talking about

1425
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,838
this all kind of leaves it it all kind

1426
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,760
of melts together so like I'm trying to

1427
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:26,880
find those blueberry turps now so

1428
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,319
initially when I had the black cherry

1429
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,318
punch the mom I had was full blueberry

1430
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:33,838
bread it was amazing it smelled like

1431
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,400
when it was on the vine it smelled like

1432
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,960
[ __ ] artificial blueberries and then

1433
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,599
when it cured it smelled like [ __ ]

1434
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,240
blueberry bread it was so [ __ ] good

1435
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:44,280
but the problem was it didn't get you

1436
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:45,558
that high it was kind of low on the te

1437
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:49,000
was like it was like it was like a quick

1438
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:50,319
High it kind of went away um so I'm just

1439
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,719
trying to get back to those blueberry

1440
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,279
TPS so I just did the blueberry frosting

1441
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,838
cross to the blockberry I'm hunting

1442
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,880
those right now

1443
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:01,159
um so I'm hoping for that hope hopefully

1444
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:03,599
I find something that has the the THC

1445
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:06,480
percentage as well as all the other uh

1446
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,280
attributes of the original block barrier

1447
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,440
and then with a different turp so that's

1448
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,359
one that I'm very excited about the

1449
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,639
other one I'm excited about it's

1450
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:16,639
obviously that cha the chra has a [ __ ]

1451
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:20,318
ton of [ __ ] I behind it he just did a

1452
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:23,719
uh uh he just did a uh whatever it's

1453
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:26,159
called a uh [ __ ] blanket he just did

1454
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:29,519
a collab with c junky right so he's got

1455
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:31,118
his uh his he C junkie collab it was

1456
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,239
like permanent Chimera or something like

1457
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,039
that so that's so we're going to be

1458
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:36,078
riding on that heel right so hopefully

1459
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:37,599
those things turn out well and then

1460
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,559
hopefully this one turns out well the

1461
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,440
blockberry with CR so that's another big

1462
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:44,040
one that I'm hyped about but like I

1463
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,400
would say after all said and done like

1464
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:47,039
what I've what I've grown out and I've

1465
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,680
crossed it's going to be the blueberry

1466
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:50,119
AC Cross or excuse me the Blackberry AC

1467
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:51,759
cross a blueberry frosting it's going to

1468
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:53,720
be probably my number one and then the

1469
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,799
number two will be the uh blockberry

1470
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:58,439
cross with the animal Stam

1471
00:53:55,798 --> 00:54:00,838
shout out to uh tsunami seeds dude like

1472
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,440
I think that one's going to be a banger

1473
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:05,480
and they already are looking [ __ ]

1474
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,079
insane so like uh everything that I've

1475
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,480
known about the animal tsunami it's a

1476
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:14,039
[ __ ] heavy Inda heavy [ __ ] gassy

1477
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,400
it has a little sweet tone to it too so

1478
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:19,279
like if we can get that heavy sweet

1479
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,838
gassy note with uh the Blackberry

1480
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,480
structure just to add a little bit of

1481
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:24,119
weight to it it would be a [ __ ] fire

1482
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,318
Banger dude so that those are probably

1483
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,838
the two most that I'm excited about yeah

1484
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:31,639
nice that that sounds awesome tell me a

1485
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:33,400
little bit about the Hal Berry and the

1486
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:36,039
block party cuz I feel like I you know

1487
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,480
the general public may be not so

1488
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:41,480
aware yes so the H Berry that thing

1489
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,159
hasn't had its time to shine yet so the

1490
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,039
H Berry is a cross between ice cream

1491
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:47,480
cake and blockberry right I only made

1492
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:51,440
like 12 or 15 seeds or something

1493
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:55,480
ridiculous um it was a it was a reversal

1494
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:58,280
that didn't take that well so uh like

1495
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,798
five seeds I got my [ __ ] Banger so

1496
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,359
that's the halberry number three um and

1497
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,920
that's what everybody has so the

1498
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:07,239
halberry number three is a [ __ ] beast

1499
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,280
dude it's insane it's more vigorous than

1500
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:11,199
the Blackberry breeder cut which is more

1501
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,798
vigorous than the than the super boo cut

1502
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,598
it's the most vigorous plant I've ever

1503
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:18,358
had and or made um it's a [ __ ] giant

1504
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,079
Christmas tree right it blasts off so if

1505
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:23,440
you have if you have um triplets or or

1506
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:26,359
double Stacks it's probably not good for

1507
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,240
that um but if have no Headroom issues

1508
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:32,598
like it's a it's it's it's a [ __ ]

1509
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:36,199
beast uh it goes full dark purple

1510
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:38,559
throughout without any um uh

1511
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:41,358
environmental um attributes whatsoever

1512
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,640
so it just does it genetically right and

1513
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:47,480
then it just is [ __ ] super coated in

1514
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:48,759
tricomes and it has a cream saber turp

1515
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,480
so it tastes

1516
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,480
like uh like it has a vanilla from the

1517
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,280
ice cream cake it has the vanilla back

1518
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,440
but on the on the front side it has like

1519
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,079
the Blackberry front so it's like a not

1520
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,440
full Tangy but has like a earthy kind of

1521
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,318
citrus Vibe with a vanilla finish and

1522
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,880
it's [ __ ] so good bro it's like

1523
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:11,480
tasting a Cream Saver and then um yields

1524
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,480
super heavy and in the bag it looks

1525
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:16,798
[ __ ] crazy it's straight up it almost

1526
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,960
looks black and it throws these giant

1527
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:22,838
donks like [ __ ] baby arm dunks it's

1528
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:25,920
just huge heavy [ __ ] colas it's

1529
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:28,759
amazing uh that one just want in the Z

1530
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,240
Olympics in Michigan for I think it was

1531
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,520
like I first or second place for best

1532
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:35,439
turffs and best bag appeal so it was in

1533
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,759
it was in the top two for each one of

1534
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,599
those categories uh and that was grown

1535
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,039
out by Ghostbusters in Michigan I gave

1536
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:45,160
that to him a long time ago and a side

1537
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:46,480
note on that he uh I don't know if I

1538
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:52,038
should be telling people but it's too

1539
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:54,358
late so he he has the um so Ghostbusters

1540
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:56,319
took my blockberry my breeder cut that's

1541
00:56:54,358 --> 00:56:59,598
Ray from move Tang Clan that's his

1542
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:02,480
signature strin that's my blockberry uh

1543
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:05,440
the halberry is

1544
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,159
uh Matt Barnes he's like a basketball

1545
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,039
player ex- basketball player that's his

1546
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:12,078
signature strain they're off of Michigan

1547
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:14,400
apparently and then Royce the 59 has my

1548
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:17,880
block party as his signature strain he's

1549
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,720
he's he's a rapper um but anyway so so

1550
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,000
so that's the H Berry so that thing just

1551
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:24,078
started getting

1552
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
going um that company that I talked to

1553
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,760
you about earlier that I started with a

1554
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,760
partnership with with zenleaf here in

1555
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,039
San Diego they are finally building out

1556
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,599
some moms they just they just did a

1557
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:35,520
couple runs just real quick to see if it

1558
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,680
would be viable for their system right

1559
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:40,960
so it is and so now they're building out

1560
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,838
the mom block so we're going to have um

1561
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,318
a ton of Instagram footage here probably

1562
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:46,679
the next three four months of it and

1563
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:48,199
like people will really get to see

1564
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:50,318
because like for me I'm just you know I

1565
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:52,159
don't have the facilities and the space

1566
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:54,558
to do like giant grows so I can only do

1567
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,199
a couple plants at a time but we'll be

1568
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,480
able to to see soon like what it

1569
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:00,159
actually looks like on a production

1570
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,798
scale so it's it's it's Bonkers so

1571
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,798
that's the that's the halleberry and

1572
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:07,400
then the block party was super sherb

1573
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:11,000
which is uh it was a freebie from

1574
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:13,200
in-house genetics and it was uh uh

1575
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,599
Sunset Sher cross a GMO and it might be

1576
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:16,439
backwards I'm not sure which one went

1577
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:20,079
first I think it was sunset Sher cross a

1578
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,720
GMO and it was a freebie so I popped a I

1579
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,880
think I got like six or seven seeds of

1580
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:28,000
that as a freebie um I found this one

1581
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,480
was just like it was gassy but it was

1582
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
like

1583
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,480
blueberry uh turps and it was it was it

1584
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,239
was so good um so I used that one for

1585
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,318
for the mom and then some of them were

1586
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:42,598
like gimo they're kind of like ugly long

1587
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:44,119

1592
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:57,798
only popped however manyi but but that's

1593
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,720
the block party so the block party

1594
00:58:57,798 --> 00:59:03,798

1596
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:06,798

1598
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:11,280
if it has wet pots consistently it won't

1599
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:14,838

1602
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:20,000

1603

00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,519
these super wet pots but um that one's

1606
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,079
super nice dude people love it or hate

1607
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:30,880
it it's kind of the same thing it has

1608
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:34,318
like a it's it's all gas it has a slight

1609
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,880
lemon I would say finish to it but uh

1610
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:39,480
yeah that one's also awesome so block

1611
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,119
party to me is awesome but like if you

1612
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,519
don't grow right it's not it's not it's

1613
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,880
not going to be it's not going to be

1614
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:47,199
great so the H Berry is kind of like the

1615
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,119
blockberry in the sense that like you

1616
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,279
could do whatever the hell you want to

1617
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,720
it it's still going to be great you know

1618
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,440
what I mean yeah wow that's that's

1619
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,838
really cool I I just want to quickly

1620
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,039
pick pivot for a second back to

1621
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:59,480
something you mentioned earlier where

1622
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:01,640
you were talking about um you know some

1623
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,400
of the high-profile rappers and former

1624
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:05,679
NBA players having signature strains

1625
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,680
what what do you mean by signature

1626
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,480
strain like as in like that's the one

1627
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,879
they're repping and as a follow-up do

1628
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,000
you think that this sort of um collabing

1629
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,680
between bigname people outside of the

1630
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,440
Cannabis industry like what we've seen

1631
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,639
already um do you think that's something

1632
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,599
that's going to

1633
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,440
continue I don't really know to be

1634
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:24,640
honest but I I know what they do they

1635
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,720
basically come to Big Growers and big

1636
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,038
facilities because they're doing

1637
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,159
business ventures right they're not

1638
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:32,000
Growers they're not anything but

1639
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,239
marketing really so they're just trying

1640
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,519
to look for strands that they like and

1641
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:37,159
then they just want to attach their name

1642
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,519
to it so like boom it's this and then

1643
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:41,879
like you know it's Wu tangs whatever you

1644
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:43,000
know what I mean so um I don't know how

1645
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,880
to answer your question in the sense of

1646
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,559
like I don't know if it's going to be a

1647
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,960
continued thing but I think it would be

1648
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,480
because there's always been like let's

1649
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,000
go back a little bit like the cookies

1650
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:55,280
thing like cookies they don't grow their

1651
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,920
weed like they find local um um growers

1652
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,440
in whatever area to where their

1653
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,000
dispensaries are at and then they give

1654
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,679
them the strains and they grow them and

1655
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,880
they buy them back for like a certain

1656
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:06,639
price it's negotiated so it's a little

1657
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,920
bit behind the scenes info but um same

1658
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:10,159
kind of vibe you know what I mean it's

1659
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,480
just somebody just basic I mean no

1660
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:12,759
offense ready but it's like somebody

1661
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,358
just changing the name you know what I

1662
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,799
mean adding their add their label to it

1663
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:18,598
um and that's kind of the way it works

1664
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,880
with them but uh I don't know if it's

1665
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:20,760
going to be a long-term thing or not I

1666
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,000
don't know if I don't know if they

1667
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:27,200
continue to do it after a while or what

1668
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,119
but as you probably know the weed game

1669
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,919
has a lot to do with hype right so if

1670
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:35,480
you have a big time

1671
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:37,720
whoever you know saying hey this is my

1672
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,838
this is my clothing line This is my food

1673
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:41,358
line This is my whatever line weed line

1674
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:42,759
like people are probably more apt to go

1675
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,199
get it because like they have a bigger

1676
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,960
reach than a normal everyday person you

1677
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:50,679
know what I mean so I think it'll still

1678
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,838
probably go yeah but yeah okay yeah it

1679
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:53,038
makes sense right it's like as the

1680
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:55,239
industry is moving forward I'm

1681
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,799
interested in the ways in which sort of

1682
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:59,759
you know we're going to further roll out

1683
01:01:57,798 --> 01:02:01,838
and become more mainstream to the point

1684
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,599
where eventually you know I'm sure most

1685
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:08,400
NBA players will have you know signature

1686
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:11,240
strains yeah UF there's UFC fighters

1687
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,639
there's a there's a guy in Arizona that

1688
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:15,000

as [ __ ] for sure yeah that's awesome

1744
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:10,159
from my interactions with those guys you

1745
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:12,440
mentioned they've all been really cool

1746
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:13,719
um I guess I wanted to ask as sort of a

1747
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,039
follow-up but maybe it should have been

1748
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:20,358
a preamble to it all you know when when

1749
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:22,440
you made the the blockberry um were you

1750
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:24,400
aware that when you were grabbing for

1751
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:27,200
example the Tropicana cookies is the one

1752
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,920
that stands out to me more so that like

1753
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:31,439
this was a strain that was going to

1754
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:33,960
really pave the way and become like this

1755
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,559
super fire strain or was it totally sort

1756
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,318
of just coincidence that you happened to

1757
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:39,480
have these two strains that like you

1758
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:42,400
know went on to be reasonably

1759
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:45,159
popular it was absolutely the opposite

1760
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,880
so when I was doing it everybody was on

1761
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:49,598
the tail end of trop

1762
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,519
cookies because it was already at the

1763
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:55,480
f2s a lot of people had already done the

1764
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:57,038
f1s they're like oh I'm at the end of my

1765
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,240
they had their own specific cut a lot of

1766
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,359
people had the mountain trop cut or

1767
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:03,759
whatever it was um so people were

1768
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:06,598
already anti uh trop cookies and then

1769
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:09,680
same with anything punch so this the

1770
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,680
funny thing is is is that everybody

1771
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:14,118
hated everything punch related and

1772
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:17,440
everything [ __ ] cookies or chop

1773
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:19,160
cookies related so it was a mind [ __ ]

1774
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,920
for me that anybody wanted my [ __ ]

1775
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:24,239
because literally here in the states

1776
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,920
everybody was anti-p punch crosses

1777
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:27,598
everything was purple punch purple punch

1778
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,278
purple punch cross right they're like

1779
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,599
[ __ ] purple punch crosses it's all

1780
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:33,480
[ __ ] doesn't do this doesn't do that

1781
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:36,798
everybody's like [ __ ] trop cookies [ __ ]

1782
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:39,119
cookies in general and so I was I was

1783
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:40,318
blowing away that anybody like still

1784
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,880
like I'll tell people and they're like

1785
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,278
you could see them like you could see

1786
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,519
their brains like um I don't know about

1787
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:48,599
this cross so and that's the funny thing

1788
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:51,838
right so that just goes to show you that

1789
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:54,798
like people and I do it myself people

1790
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:56,440
will look at AC cross like no not doing

1791
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:58,599
that that looks like [ __ ] like there's

1792
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,798
no way like I don't want those two

1793
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:03,640
crosses but guess what it may be a

1794
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:04,719
[ __ ] Banger right you just don't know

1795
01:06:03,639 --> 01:06:07,598
and you don't know their fenot types

1796
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:09,399
that they're working with Etc so um yeah

1797
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,440
it was it was it was mindblowing that

1798
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,400
anybody even wanted any of the [ __ ] and

1799
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,480
and to be honest if it wasn't for Jay

1800
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,039
let's go back to him it wasn't for him

1801
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,679
popping the seeds and selling the

1802
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,079
[ __ ] the [ __ ] out of this these

1803
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:22,759
clones and growing it to Perfection

1804
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:24,640
people would have never wanted this [ __ ]

1805
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,160
at all so

1806
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:29,118
based on the cross alone they would have

1807
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:30,798
been like I'm good so yeah it was it was

1808
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,838
a mind [ __ ] that anybody wanted to [ __ ]

1809
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:35,440
with it yeah sure sure and look you know

1810
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:37,239
you sort of touched on to something

1811
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,720
which I've been hoing on for a long time

1812
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:40,519
which is that like I think the most

1813
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:43,480
interesting part about plants is not

1814
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:46,798
when you get like say um you know let's

1815
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:50,039
let's say that you were looking for you

1816
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:52,639
know GMO cross sh not when you get just

1817
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:53,960
purely GMO smell on the Sher body but

1818
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:55,598
when you get a little extra out of it

1819
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,960
you know something a little unexpected

1820
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,640
because as you said sometimes people

1821
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,318
look at stuff on paper and they're like

1822
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,879
oh not into it but it's the unexpected

1823
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:04,480
that comes out of it that can often be

1824
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,119
the most

1825
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,159
interesting yes and I've done that a few

1826
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:13,318
times in the sense of

1827
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:14,838
like I'm trying to also disseminate

1828
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:18,199
what's going to be good right so like

1829
01:07:14,838 --> 01:07:20,519
people are like oh this one to this one

1830
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:21,879
but like everybody's trying to do that

1831
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:24,000
when they see the cross right they're

1832
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,160
like oh this got to be a banger cuz this

1833
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,960
is cross with that and they're both

1834
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:29,440
bangers that's not always the case so

1835
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,000
but I try to do the same thing I'm not

1836
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,960
I'm not immune to this [ __ ] so like when

1837
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,358
I saw that tiger cake from [ __ ]

1838
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,838
compound I was like that [ __ ] looks dank

1839
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:41,719
to me dude like I think it was like

1840
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:44,599
layer cake cross with uh Menthol or

1841
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:46,558
something and and and it was like to me

1842
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:48,798
I don't know for whatever reason nobody

1843
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,599
nobody took to that like I was like that

1844
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:53,358
[ __ ] looks [ __ ] dope and I grabbed it

1845
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:54,559
popped it it's amazing but everybody's

1846
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:57,078
different than what they're looking for

1847
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,440
so um it's hard not to fall into that

1848
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:01,079
trap because you're trying to figure out

1849
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,880
like because you're not going to

1850
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:06,400
see everybody has let's say a a line

1851
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,720
that they drop right and then there's

1852
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,318
let's say there's 10 breeders they all

1853
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:11,239
drop a line the line will have at least

1854
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:13,278
10 so that's like 100 right so it's like

1855
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:15,000
100 strange like [ __ ] dude how do I

1856
01:08:13,278 --> 01:08:17,198
figure out which ones to buy so you have

1857
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
to look at it and be like oh that thing

1858
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,479
looks like yeah that'll be like good

1859
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,640
with that but you don't get to see them

1860
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:25,079
all right you don't get to see what they

1861
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,319
all look like and finish FL Etc and and

1862
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:28,479
that's the other key thing a lot of

1863
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,440
readers just so you know like take a

1864
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:33,838
look at this you'll never most likely

1865
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,479
you won't see finished flower hardly

1866
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:39,198
ever they won't show you that why is

1867
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,318
that I don't know but like they'll show

1868
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,838
you what it looks like on a plant

1869
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,560
they'll show you this [ __ ] giant dunk

1870
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:46,439
Etc right so it's hard to to Wade

1871
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,480
through all the options to figure out

1872
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:49,079
what you know because you got to spend

1873
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:50,318
your money on something but you got to

1874
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:53,000
figure out which one you think is going

1875
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,120
to be the best but uh it's not easy man

1876
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,759
so it's hard to it's hard to it's hard

1877
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,318
to differentiate between all the

1878
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:00,319
different dope breeders especially like

1879
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,960
the Legacy guys you know what I mean

1880
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,560
like you fall through your own little

1881
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,880
rabbit holes and it's just hard to

1882
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,000
figure out like what's going to be dope

1883
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,000
but like a lot of the times you really

1884
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,319
don't know even if it's like Banger to

1885
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,960
Banger it could be [ __ ] you just never

1886
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:16,159
know yeah completely completely I uh I

1887
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,600
don't know where to SL this one in so

1888
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:19,358
we're going to do it right here would

1889
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,520
you ever do blockberry

1890
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:25,199
s1s I already did blockberry s1's yes I

1891
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:27,159
I did them and they they here's the

1892
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:30,079
problem did they go out to the

1893
01:09:27,158 --> 01:09:32,838
public no okay I was about to say did I

1894
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:35,759
do such a bad job researching

1895
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:38,640
that so I have them so here's the

1896
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:41,439
problem with blockberry for for at least

1897
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:44,759
my cut every time I reverse it it'll

1898
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:47,278
throw like a [ __ ] ton of uh of male male

1899
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:48,920
sacks and and whatnot but they don't

1900
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,839
dump

1901
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,319
so and that's the problem so for me like

1902
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:55,760
when when we talk about let's go back

1903
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:58,239
for a second right when I did the the

1904
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,119
super sure you know created the uh the

1905
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:02,000
block party when I did the H Berry cross

1906
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:03,679
the ice cream cake all all those things

1907
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,399
and I said like I only got 10 seeds 20

1908
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:10,000
seeds 30 seeds it's because the

1909
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:13,000
blockberry my personal cut it'll

1910
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,039
reverse fine but it doesn't throw a [ __ ]

1911
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,520
ton of pollen and that's the problem so

1912
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:21,640
I'll I I mean for the s1's I probably

1913
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:23,000
have like I don't know 30 to 50 seeds so

1914
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,079
it's it's I'm not going to sell them

1915
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,640
like what am I getting you know what am

1916
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:27,960
I going to get out of that doesn't make

1917
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:31,320
sense I'll just keep them but I do have

1918
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:34,880
them and uh I think the better option

1919
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:36,000
for the blockberry is to um I don't know

1920
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,960
if I don't know if the fs are ever going

1921
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,359
to be great for at least my cut so

1922
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,719
that's why I'm trying to do these f2s

1923
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:44,479
now it it receives regular pollen really

1924
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:48,719
well and it shoots out thousands of

1925
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:50,559
seeds so um on that note that blockberry

1926
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,000
cross of blueberry frosting that'll be

1927
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,120
coming out soon I'm going to be doing

1928
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,079
these uh blockberry f2s probably at the

1929
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:57,399
same time and some other stuff too so

1930
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:59,238
I'm going to probably be doing all kinds

1931
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:01,319
of stuff at that point but uh most of

1932
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:03,678
them well pretty much all of them will

1933
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:06,519
be regular seeds because like I said it

1934
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:08,359
doesn't it doesn't it doesn't reverse

1935
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,080
well yeah that's that's really

1936
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:11,519
interesting to hear definitely revers

1937
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,119
was something we've discussed on the

1938
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,520
show being very like um not just strain

1939
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:17,079
to strain but cutting to cutting

1940
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,960
specific and so while we're on that

1941
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:20,760
topic I'd love to quickly ask do you

1942
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,399
have any preference regular versus

1943
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,960
feminized

1944
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:28,399
breeding I personally like regulars um

1945
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:30,399
because it's it's much more viable it

1946
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:32,599
lasts longer the pollen itself as well

1947
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:33,519
so like for instance I had some pretty

1948
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,960
fresh

1949
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:40,120
pollen um didn't make that many seeds of

1950
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,319
some reversal and then I had some old

1951
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:44,359
ass blueberry frosting right I had a

1952
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:46,639
little bit left and it created thousands

1953
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:48,759
of seeds it's just much more viable

1954
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:52,400
right it lasts longer you could store it

1955
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:56,679
longer um you get better to me you know

1956
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:59,319
more healthy seeds not as many Herms um

1957
01:11:56,679 --> 01:12:00,960
the the reversals are great for people

1958
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:04,000
that want to obviously guarantee that

1959
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,000
they're going to females but the the

1960
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,760
issue is also what I don't think a lot

1961
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,439
of people take into into consideration

1962
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,760
is this even though you may get all

1963
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:15,519
females you're also going to get mutants

1964
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,880
and you're also going to get uh Herms so

1965
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,800
you're gonna have to call those as well

1966
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,440
so let's say you have a 10 Pac boom you

1967
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,920
got this many mutants this many Herms

1968
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:26,039
you're left with three or four females

1969
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,158
so to me I'd rather have the the males

1970
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:31,479
i' I'd rather pack a or excuse me I'd

1971
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:34,719
rather pop a pack of 10 RS get the four

1972
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:37,919
females have the six males pick a a dope

1973
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:39,600
male pick a dope female maybe and then

1974
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,520
and then blast them off in the backyard

1975
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,960
or something you know what I mean and

1976
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,239
then create my own thousands of seeds

1977
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,920
for future reference just to bank the

1978
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:47,678
genetic so that's me personally but I

1979
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,480
get it why people want F because they're

1980
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,199
guaranteed but like I said what they're

1981
01:12:49,479 --> 01:12:54,879
not taking into account is the Herm rate

1982
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:58,719
as well as the uh uh mutant

1983
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,079
rate yeah um I I want to I wanted to ask

1984
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,239
because you you mentioned it a little

1985
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:04,439
earlier and I keep forgetting that some

1986
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:05,959
people may not have heard the the little

1987
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:08,039
shorter segment we did on the breeder of

1988
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,840
the Year Awards so tell us a little bit

1989
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:11,359
about the blueberry frosting which I'm

1990
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,199
sure other people have seen pop up in

1991
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:15,880
some of your

1992
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:19,119
work yeah so the blueberry Fring was

1993
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,520
from a guy in Santa Cruz um Party Time

1994
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:23,960
Farms

1995
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:25,880
basically uh he created it and it's

1996
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:29,719
Wedding Crasher Cross of blueberry

1997
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:31,520
cookies I believe and he replied to one

1998
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:32,719
of my stories I was like asking about

1999
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,120
blueberry turps or something like that

2000
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:36,239
he's like dude I got this [ __ ] cross

2001
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:37,800
that I made that's got blueberry turps

2002
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:39,439
because like like we were talking about

2003
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,719
earlier it's all connected right I was

2004
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:43,359
like I just want to switch out the turs

2005
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:45,079
to something else so he basically said

2006
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:48,039
he's like hey man and I have pollen I

2007
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:50,800
was like no [ __ ] so he sent me seeds

2008
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:53,399
weed and pollen I was like [ __ ] yeah bro

2009
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,279
so like I got to smoke the weed I got to

2010
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:57,960
see all I got to pop some seeds and I

2011
01:13:55,279 --> 01:14:00,079
got PA so blueberry frosting came from

2012
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:02,239
him Party Time Farm shout out the only

2013
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:04,800
unfortunate thing is that he's not gonna

2014
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:06,919
probably hear this he might hear it but

2015
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,320
he I think he moved I think he went to

2016
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,880
like Columbia or some [ __ ] he like

2017
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:14,079
closed down um so that's where I got the

2018
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,440
pollen from and it was and um I haven't

2019
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:18,359
heard back from him for a long time but

2020
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:20,879
that's where the pollen came from and

2021
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:23,000
then uh what was the other part of the

2022
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,639
question what sort of stuff can people

2023
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:29,679
expect from it in the crosses they say

2024
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:31,440
it pop up in oh yeah so um so far what

2025
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:35,520
I've gotten from what I've what I've

2026
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:38,000
hunted and or popped uh full candy gas

2027
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:41,159
it was [ __ ] amazing so like this

2028
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
grape cream cake cross with uh the grap

2029
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:44,879
cream cake 2.1 cross with blueberry

2030
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,880
frosting number 11 is a [ __ ] Banger

2031
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,359
so I have that on my Instagram right now

2032
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:53,520
it's so [ __ ] sweet it's like sweet

2033
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:56,599
candy blueberries with gas at the end

2034
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,080
it's insane like it's like a gas in the

2035
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:00,120
sense that like it hits you in the top

2036
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,880
of your sinuses if you know what I mean

2037
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:04,559
it's like it's like a vix Vapor Rub I

2038
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,960
you guys have that right Menthol like

2039
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,440
hits you in the top of your sinuses like

2040
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,960
opens up your sinuses like holy [ __ ] but

2041
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:13,879
with like blueberries looks great smells

2042
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:16,239
great tastes great smokes [ __ ] great

2043
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:19,119
that's the one so at least for now for

2044
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:20,678
me um but that's that's like one of the

2045
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:23,399
C that and that's one of the ones that I

2046
01:15:20,679 --> 01:15:24,679
have right now I also did this one uh

2047
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:26,960
with that with that blueberry frosting

2048
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:30,079
crossed with tiger cake we just talked

2049
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:33,920
about that randomly um and that [ __ ] is

2050
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:36,600
[ __ ] ridiculous so the

2051
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,239
uh the one that I have it's also so

2052
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:42,800
Random it's also a number

2053
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:45,519
11 it [ __ ] threw this giant like

2054
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:48,239
um for you'd be like rugby ball right

2055
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:51,040
like a [ __ ] giant huge Cola it's like

2056
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:54,238
a giant rugby ball I was like what the

2057
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:55,840
[ __ ] and it was like it's insane

2058
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:57,638
um same thing but this one has a little

2059
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:01,760
bit of funk to it because the tiger cake

2060
01:15:57,639 --> 01:16:04,119
has this nasty burnt Tire uh

2061
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,480
halosis vibe to it that's just like

2062
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:09,519
super gas heavy Earth just nasty but it

2063
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:11,479
has candy on the front so that's another

2064
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,840
one so I've got both of those I've got

2065
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:14,039
like the whole I've got a [ __ ] ton of

2066
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:17,199
them but those are the two that are like

2067
01:16:14,039 --> 01:16:19,479
my favorite so um what to expect is from

2068
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:20,839
any of those if you get a good one is

2069
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:22,839
you're going to get that [ __ ] candy

2070
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,039
ass gas with whatever else you makes it

2071
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,679
with so the ones that I mix it with

2072
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:28,560
pretty much have gas to them so you're

2073
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,158
going to get either candy with some funk

2074
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,000
or just candy with some gas or just

2075
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:35,638
candy candy so uh it's really but like

2076
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,319
or candy Menthol so that's that's what

2077
01:16:35,639 --> 01:16:39,760
I've gotten so far from all the ones and

2078
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:42,479
like these uh blockberry across of the

2079
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,840
blueberry frosting I'm assuming that I

2080
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:46,238
have some blueberry I'll probably find

2081
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,480
some blueberry leaners with like just a

2082
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:48,678
little bit of earthy maybe a little bit

2083
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:52,279
of Tangi I don't know hopefully there's

2084
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:53,600
no Tangi in some El but uh yeah we we'll

2085
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:55,719
see what happens with those you'll

2086
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,159
you'll get a just keep following me on

2087
01:16:55,719 --> 01:16:58,359
the Instagram I'll I'll start posting

2088
01:16:57,158 --> 01:16:59,719
some pigs probably in the next like two

2089
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:01,759
months I just literally popped seeds

2090
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:03,719
like maybe two weeks ago so those are

2091
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,560
going right now oh that's that's really

2092
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:08,000
exciting and I love that you mentioned

2093
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,600
the the Menthol I feel like it's um

2094
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,679
really nice flavor that you don't hear

2095
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,560
about quite as much as you might expect

2096
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,520
but I want to quickly draw us back you

2097
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,560
said the word halosis and you got me

2098
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,840
thinking have you ever been into the

2099
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,000
chems like specifically the chem D often

2100
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,520
gets described as being very

2101
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,319
halosis

2102
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:29,199
yeah and that's why that's why I love

2103
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:31,880
that one so I had uh two tiger cake

2104
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:34,719
fenos the tiger

2105
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,639
cake so I apologize because I eventually

2106
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,840
got them mixed up it was like a two and

2107
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,520
a one or something like that I don't

2108
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,400
know it was like the first two they're

2109
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,280
not that big they're kind of medium

2110
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:46,198
structure they kind of grow like a

2111
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:48,559
candleabra like kind of wide and weird

2112
01:17:46,198 --> 01:17:49,919
and they don't grow that well in veg but

2113
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,880
then once you hit that switch you when

2114
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,639
they go to flower they [ __ ] blast off

2115
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,000
and uh

2116
01:17:53,639 --> 01:18:00,119
peras this one it was just so [ __ ]

2117
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:03,238
rank it was like the loudest um and so

2118
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:05,519
and like uh I think it's a voyage voyage

2119
01:18:03,238 --> 01:18:06,638
Bloom I think in uh in Michigan has it

2120
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,679
right now they've been doing a bunch of

2121
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:12,279
hype about it uh they have that one I

2122
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:14,480
think Frank's finest in Arizona also has

2123
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:17,759
that one I didn't sell it to too many

2124
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:19,759
people but they have it and it's [ __ ]

2125
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,119
disgusting in the best way and it's like

2126
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,600
this it's like if you had a gram of it

2127
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:26,119
and you walk into house like the whole

2128
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,560

2129
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:31,319

2130
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:34,000

2148
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,880
sinuses it's a trip dude but it's out

2149
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:15,119
there it's still out there I got rid of

2150
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,920
it um because I had to keep moving on

2151
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,559
and keep hunting new [ __ ] but it's it's

2152
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,639
still out there so I can get it back at

2153
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,199
some point but yeah I still have some

2154
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:24,440
crosses with it uh I did a Blackberry

2155
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:26,719
cross to it did a blueberry fros and

2156
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:28,839
cross to it and I think that was it but

2157
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,239
I have those uh seeds in my in my house

2158
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:33,639
for sure in the bank ah lovely lovely

2159
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:35,238
you you got me realizing I didn't

2160
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:37,760
actually ask you are you are you more of

2161
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:41,759
an indicor or a sativa

2162
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:43,639
guy uh Indica if I can help it Inda

2163
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,679
leaner right because they're all hybrids

2164
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:49,480
at this point I'm more of an Inda leaner

2165
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:52,880
guy um if it's more heavy sativa like it

2166
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:54,599
just like I have to 100% drink to uh

2167
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,880
even it out because like I'll get bugged

2168
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,719
out right like I get paranoid like I

2169
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,199
just can't it's not it's not my cup of

2170
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,560
tea so like I like more inders but like

2171
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:04,799
the block bear and all that [ __ ] it's

2172
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,560
it's to me it's like it's like a true

2173
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,480
hybrid it's like a widget in the sense

2174
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,120
that like it it fits right in the middle

2175
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:12,559
perfectly

2176
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:13,880
um but I would like more indicia Vibe

2177
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,360
out of it so like that's why I'm try

2178
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,840
like that's why I'm so excited about

2179
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:19,238
this uh animal tsunami cross dude I

2180
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,719
think that's going to be the [ __ ] one

2181
01:20:19,238 --> 01:20:23,479
dude like I think that's going to be

2182
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:25,960
like blast off like for all the indicia

2183
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:28,439
heavy Vibes like boom like we'll see

2184
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,560
what happens but like unfortunately

2185
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:32,678
again like what we were talking about

2186
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:35,039
earlier the uh it doesn't it doesn't

2187
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:37,158
yield a great ton of uh viable pollen so

2188
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:38,399
I only have high many seeds of the uh of

2189
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:40,599
the Cross but I'm just going to hunt

2190
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:41,839
them and yeah right now I've got some in

2191
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,199
in the hopper just to see proof of

2192
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,840
concept see if it you know a The Germ

2193
01:20:44,198 --> 01:20:48,198
rates are 100% which is great um

2194
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,560
structure looks great so far they're

2195
01:20:48,198 --> 01:20:52,238
only a few weeks old but uh they look

2196
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,360
very vigorous and like I obviously have

2197
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:56,279
to see her rates so if they're good I'll

2198
01:20:54,359 --> 01:20:58,000
I'll probably pop more but yeah that's

2199
01:20:56,279 --> 01:21:00,359
one that I'm super super excited about

2200
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,198
but um to answer your question more more

2201
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:04,839
indicia Vibe than anything or hybrid I

2202
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:07,599
don't like super heavy sativas that like

2203
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:09,480
make your heart race and [ __ ] not it's

2204
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,920
not for me bro I already did my acid in

2205
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:11,919
[ __ ] shroom trips a thousand times

2206
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,158
you know what I'm saying like I don't

2207
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:17,239
need to I don't need to reash that [ __ ]

2208
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:18,960
unless I want to you know so I got to I

2209
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:21,238
got to give credit you know you've

2210
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,880
mentioned the animal tsunami three times

2211
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:25,039
now you have to tell us a little little

2212
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,960
bit about it I I'll be honest I cheated

2213
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:29,399
I quickly Googled it and I can see it's

2214
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,960
animal cookies by caramel tsunami what's

2215
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:34,879
the plant

2216
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:37,840
like um I've only grown it from the

2217
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,920
actual breeder and it is a great

2218
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:43,600
structured plant it's

2219
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:45,158
vigorous uh medium to to large

2220
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,400
yields

2221
01:21:45,158 --> 01:21:49,879
um coated in [ __ ] tricomes it has a

2222
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:54,198
sweet almost

2223
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:58,000
caramel um TP to it on the back end Inda

2224
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:59,759
dominant I would say and um side note

2225
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,479
just to add to all this is that if

2226
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,679
anybody wants to try it because I don't

2227
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:06,238
really produce it um uh the jungle boys

2228
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:08,158
have it in their repertoire and they'll

2229
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:10,799
post about it from time to time so I

2230
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:12,638
know that they grow it and the the guy

2231
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,400
that uh met with the the the original

2232
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:17,480
breeder he's also down here in Southern

2233
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:20,719
California so he tries

2234
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:22,079
to um he's he's better than me at Fen

2235
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,158
hunt I'll tell you that so he he'll do

2236
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:28,359
like a and Caesar you know he's looking

2237
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:31,519
for those unique super unique um

2238
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:33,399
outliers so he spends his time so he

2239
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,960
finds he finds the gems out of all of

2240
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:37,638
his crosses for me I'm just trying to

2241
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,760
find the I want to make everything

2242
01:22:37,639 --> 01:22:41,480
pretty good right like I don't want to

2243
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,679
have to hunt a thousand seeds to find it

2244
01:22:41,479 --> 01:22:44,079
and I I don't know what he's doing but

2245
01:22:42,679 --> 01:22:47,600
like I just know that he picks that he

2246
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:50,439
picks the the crem de crem so um and

2247
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:53,039
it's his cut so it's a [ __ ]

2248
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:55,678
Banger yeah beautiful that's it's

2249
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:57,359
exciting something we we ask all guests

2250
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:00,880
when they come on the show what style of

2251
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:06,158
growing do you use so basically I use

2252
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:09,239
coco um yeah for for my personal stuff

2253
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:11,839
I'm a small timer right so I don't have

2254
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:13,439
like everything set up as I should

2255
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,000
probably if I was a if I was a

2256
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:17,039
production guy i' would have like rock

2257
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,079
wool and everything would be on timers

2258
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:22,158
etc etc so for me personally what I do

2259
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:24,158
is I don't have the time to spend on all

2260
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:25,719
of it because like I said I think I told

2261
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:27,879
you this in the maybe one of the first

2262
01:23:25,719 --> 01:23:30,039
ones or first podcast I'm not sure if I

2263
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:33,279
told you this but um I'm doing this just

2264
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:35,000
as like a kind of side hobby that I just

2265
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:37,519
enjoy so I don't didn't really have any

2266
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,439
plans to be like a breeder per se so for

2267
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:43,400
me I'm still like a hom grower so um I

2268
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:44,678
just do the the cocoa and pots and they

2269
01:23:43,399 --> 01:23:46,679
change obviously throughout this

2270
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:48,679
throughout the the course of the uh of

2271
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:51,440
the grow I'll probably end it like two

2272
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:53,199
to three gallon pots and I [ __ ] hand

2273
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:55,319
water dude and so so like I'm I'm

2274
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:57,000
Antiquated bro like I'm I'm a I'm a I'm

2275
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:59,158
a rookie right I know how to do all the

2276
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,800
other [ __ ] obviously um throughout the

2277
01:23:59,158 --> 01:24:03,119
course of my my growing tenure but like

2278
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:07,800
for me I only have so much time to spend

2279
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:12,439
on it so uh cocoa hand water

2280
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:15,400
salts um but I will do um

2281
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:16,839
organic uh little attributes you know

2282
01:24:15,399 --> 01:24:18,399
what I mean like I'll do I'll do some

2283
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,719
I'll do some uh I'll do some feeds with

2284
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:23,279
some some Organics stuff here and there

2285
01:24:19,719 --> 01:24:25,480
but mostly it's mostly just salts

2286
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:27,679
yeah nice cool I can certainly relate I

2287
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:30,519
love that you're uh still hand ordering

2288
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,679
as someone who does that I uh I love the

2289
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:36,000
time you get to spend with the

2290
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:38,399
plants I will say this it's literally it

2291
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,319
is it's it's a break from you know the

2292
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:43,439
kids and the family I'm like I gota go

2293
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:44,920
like so it literally is time to just get

2294
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:46,759
away it's like my man cave right it's

2295
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,440
like my little hobby so I'm like that's

2296
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,600
part of it if I had everything on

2297
01:24:48,439 --> 01:24:52,960
automation my wife would be like why I'm

2298
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:55,000
like uh I got to check the but that's

2299
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,719
part of it so you're so you you touched

2300
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:01,118
on something but the other thing is is

2301
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:02,439
that uh uh if I was a production guy you

2302
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:04,319
know more than anything I I would

2303
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:07,439
definitely have like automated

2304
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:08,920
everything um like I said man I'm small

2305
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,118
dude I'm not I'm never trying to blast

2306
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,760
my head up I'm trying to stay as humble

2307
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:14,839
as I can I'm nobody big I'm just dude

2308
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:16,520
just trying to make seeds that people

2309
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:19,440
can make good [ __ ] out of so like I

2310
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:22,040
don't have a bunch of fancy equipment or

2311
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:24,279
or or or you know locations but I do

2312
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:26,960
part with some people so can't lie I

2313
01:25:24,279 --> 01:25:29,599
can't say like I don't have like those

2314
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,239
facilities Avail available to me but for

2315
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,000
me personally yeah just dude I'm just a

2316
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:33,959
hand waterer chilling at the crib you

2317
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,719
know what I mean like I don't have

2318
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:38,480
anything fancy man and in terms of uh

2319
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:39,880
just just so just so you know so people

2320
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:42,359
ask me all the time what NES do you use

2321
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:43,760
I'm like NES are like the last thing

2322
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:45,198
that I care about the things that I care

2323
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,119
about the most are environment and

2324
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,039
genetics so if you have the environment

2325
01:25:47,118 --> 01:25:50,960
and the genetic style in the NES are

2326
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:53,198
just an additive to that right so I'm

2327
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,600
like H I don't want to put too much on

2328
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:57,359
NES because NES aren't going to change

2329
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,920
your grow if you [ __ ] have a shitty

2330
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:02,759
environment and or shitty genetics right

2331
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:04,520
does that make sense a lot of people put

2332
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,719
too much on NES like oh what NES you

2333
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:08,639
using I'm like who gives a [ __ ] like you

2334
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:10,960
know you can use whatever NES but if you

2335
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:12,920
have shitty ass genetics and or shitty

2336
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,439
environment and shitty environment

2337
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:17,480
controls you're never going to be you're

2338
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:20,279
never going to let that plant shine you

2339
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:22,399
know what I'm saying so um I'm not

2340
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:24,039
trying to diss anybody or plug anybody

2341
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:26,679
I'm just saying that the most important

2342
01:26:24,039 --> 01:26:29,238
factors are are environment and genetics

2343
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:31,239
and then after that I think all NES have

2344
01:26:29,238 --> 01:26:33,158
their their pros and their conss I've

2345
01:26:31,238 --> 01:26:35,359
used Athena great that [ __ ] Works

2346
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:37,158
[ __ ] perfect right I love it some

2347
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:39,000
people talk about cardboard turps I've

2348
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:42,799
never had that right the [ __ ] tastes

2349
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:46,079
good smells good Athena is great uh uh

2350
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:48,079
crop salt banging same [ __ ] they all

2351
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,039
have their their goods and their bads uh

2352
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:51,000
front row a at least in the states I

2353
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:53,319
don't know if you guys have that out

2354
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,800
there all good dude they all have the

2355
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:59,399
same [ __ ] you just have to kind of work

2356
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:00,480
each one I did um uh Fox Farms when I

2357
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:01,879
first started you know what I mean like

2358
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:03,839
they're all different so everything you

2359
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,840
just have to work with so I would say

2360
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:07,800
the nutrient portion is just like an

2361
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,079
additive U but like if you don't know

2362
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,920
what you're doing overall it's not going

2363
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:13,279
to help no matter what Nutri what

2364
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:15,600
nutrient line you use sorry I went off

2365
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:17,319
on the tangent there no it's you're

2366
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,960
you're totally correct you know like

2367
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:21,198
there's no point having the best nudes

2368
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:24,399
in the game if your environment's trash

2369
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:26,879
so I like that answer for sure I I

2370
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:29,000
wanted to quickly ask you are there any

2371
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,679
older lines that you would be interested

2372

in playing with you know like something

2373

line because like I don't know what

2388
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,279
happened with gg4 or Gorilla Glue

2389
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,679
whatever happened I don't know if you

2390

2394
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:27,000
been lucky enough to have tried it a few

2395
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:28,840
times while in the states yeah it

2396
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,520
[ __ ] it did its thing right so like

2397
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,600
that's one that i' like I'm trying to go

2398
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:35,000
back on um but that's like one of the

2399
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,520
only ones that I'm like dude that's like

2400
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,079
the one so that's like just for me just

2401
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,480
off the top of my head but there's like

2402
01:28:39,079 --> 01:28:45,279
a bunch of [ __ ] dude like I had uh

2403
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:48,000
somebody's grow up blue dream recently

2404
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:49,880
um I forgot I'm like [ __ ] dude this

2405
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,359
thing is a giant [ __ ] beast of a

2406
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,440
plant it's like it's amazing but it's

2407
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,519
like super leafy you know what I mean so

2408
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:57,678
I'm like eh probably wouldn't want that

2409
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,719
but there's some old hazes that are

2410
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,760
[ __ ] big old bangers you know nl's

2411
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,239
Etc dude I don't know but like the one

2412
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:07,400
that sticks out to me is that is that

2413
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:09,399
unbroken chain that's the one for me

2414
01:29:07,399 --> 01:29:12,719
right now at least and then like we were

2415
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:16,759
talking about earlier the uh the uh the

2416
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:18,359
G or excuse me the uh the Skywalker OG

2417
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,679
I've got a couple of those online that

2418
01:29:18,359 --> 01:29:22,039
I'm like still trying to find out who

2419
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,560
like has them like I've got a couple ogs

2420
01:29:22,039 --> 01:29:26,319
I still want to [ __ ] with um but yeah

2421
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,400
for the old school it's obviously

2422
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,799
everybody is always talking about OG but

2423
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,319
probably get that OG and that gg4 cross

2424
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,600
and like I think those would be the ones

2425
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:36,479
for me for

2426
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,119
sure beautiful stuff I got to admit I

2427
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:39,839
feel like gg4 is having a bit of a

2428
01:29:38,118 --> 01:29:41,279
Resurgence I've heard a few people sort

2429
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,039
of make comments along the lines of

2430
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:45,759
yours being like you know it's it's

2431
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:46,960
Killer really yeah I'm surprised dud

2432
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,520
because like it fell off and I'm like

2433
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,480
dude this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire dude like

2434
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,119
you know what I mean but people are

2435
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:54,799
bringing back old school [ __ ] like I

2436
01:29:52,118 --> 01:29:56,880
said people just brought back blue dream

2437
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,279
of all things I'm like holy [ __ ] right

2438
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,039
but like people I think are just

2439
01:29:58,279 --> 01:30:03,439
bringing back cookies crosses old school

2440
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:09,639
cookies [ __ ] Forum Cuts etc etc um

2441
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:12,279
obviously the uh the uh ogs big time so

2442
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:14,679
yeah there's a bunch of [ __ ] um the

2443
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:17,118
problem with older ones is that they're

2444
01:30:14,679 --> 01:30:19,279
not production strains and that's kind

2445
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:22,359
of how we got led to where we got led to

2446
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:25,158
like the big guys are doing like they

2447
01:30:22,359 --> 01:30:26,839
need a certain amount of volume

2448
01:30:25,158 --> 01:30:27,920
otherwise it doesn't pay their bills you

2449
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,880
know what I mean like they have to do

2450
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,039
[ __ ] thousands of plants and rooms

2451
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:35,560
Etc to pay their bills so they're not

2452
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:38,840
willing to really risk pulling an old

2453
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,920
school you know headyy ass stash cut you

2454
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:42,719
know what I mean like it just doesn't

2455
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:45,880
make sense for them so

2456
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:47,399
um my goal if I ever if I ever cross

2457
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,920
these is going to be to be like just

2458
01:30:47,399 --> 01:30:50,799
like like what I said is like I want to

2459
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,480
I want to get those chps and that flavor

2460
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:55,400
into a different body

2461
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:56,879
so that that'll be my that'll be my goal

2462
01:30:55,399 --> 01:30:58,920
and it's it's on it's on the to-do list

2463
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,600
D I tried it with the [ __ ] TK and

2464
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,679
apparently that works like the uh it's

2465
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,880
called super Kush I took the super boof

2466
01:31:02,679 --> 01:31:07,480
name even though I didn't use a super

2467
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:09,920
boof cut that one does exactly that has

2468
01:31:07,479 --> 01:31:12,198
it it's it'll be either a Kush leaner or

2469
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,520
a [ __ ] uh blockberry

2470
01:31:12,198 --> 01:31:18,559
leaner uh but yeah that [ __ ] yields and

2471
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:22,040
it's heavy it's big so yeah and where in

2472
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:24,080
general do you think the commercial

2473
01:31:22,039 --> 01:31:25,560
producing scene is heading you know do

2474
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:28,439
you think that the big commercial

2475
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:31,679
producers are going to slowly narrow

2476
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:33,759
their window their menu sorry of strains

2477
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:35,440
they offer and eventually it's just

2478
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:37,039
going to be like a small number of

2479
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:38,839
things that are really big yielding

2480
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:39,920
super well smoking or what do you think

2481
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,679
is going to happen in the long term do

2482
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,600
you think will retain

2483
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:47,760
diversity exactly what you said in the

2484
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:48,880
first part the big producers are I would

2485
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,480
say most of them are going to have to

2486
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,760
pay their bills and what the prices of

2487
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:57,359
every everything going down they're

2488
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:59,039
going to only keep like the big

2489
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:00,799
yielding I don't know if they're

2490
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:02,479
cardboard turfs for like the low I don't

2491
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:05,360
know man I think that it's going to be

2492
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:07,959
like just the big yields bag

2493
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:11,079
appeal stuff it's not going to matter as

2494
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,719
much for quality in the sense of like um

2495
01:32:11,079 --> 01:32:14,760
turps and flavor I think they're going

2496
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:18,399
to care more about like bag appe

2497
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:19,760
peel CH percentage and yield right so

2498
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:23,000
like those are the boxes that I think

2499
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:25,199
they're going to check um I think though

2500
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,560
like let's let's let's so like I said

2501
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:29,158
I'm a big Beer Guy let's bring it back

2502
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:31,199
to that there's the anheiser bush

2503
01:32:29,158 --> 01:32:33,439
there's the K there's the nickel or

2504
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:37,118
whatever right the paps so there these

2505
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:39,719
old um generational giant conglomerates

2506
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:41,439
of beer and then now they have these

2507
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:42,679
small micro breweries that are popping

2508
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:44,319
up so I think what's going to end up

2509
01:32:42,679 --> 01:32:46,719
happening is there's going to be the big

2510
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:48,960
time guys that do all these [ __ ]

2511
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,960
traditional strains that you know that's

2512
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,480
going to be their

2513
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:56,520
cardboard [ __ ] you know uh loggers

2514
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:57,879
right no no disrespect to loggers but

2515
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:00,320
then they're going to be these little

2516
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:02,279
guys that are going to be like local uh

2517
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:05,079
local guys that are like really into

2518
01:33:02,279 --> 01:33:06,599
whatever flavors um and then they're

2519
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:09,118
going to produce that that's not like a

2520
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:11,760
high yielder but it's [ __ ] you know

2521
01:33:09,118 --> 01:33:13,238
tastes great looks great doesn't yield

2522
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,000
that great but like they don't have such

2523
01:33:13,238 --> 01:33:16,799
a high overhead so they can focus on

2524
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,679
Flavor right so I think that's what's

2525
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,000
going to

2526
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:22,440
happen it's going to open the way to a

2527
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,279
smaller

2528
01:33:22,439 --> 01:33:27,559
craft grower is what I'm is what I'm

2529
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:29,759
hoping and that's what I'm banking on

2530
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,280
actually well you just read my mind cuz

2531
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,199
I was going to say you know with that

2532
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:36,198
sort of forecast there how do you think

2533
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:37,719
that relates to sort of the hom grower

2534
01:33:36,198 --> 01:33:39,799
on average do you think there is a

2535
01:33:37,719 --> 01:33:43,520
future for

2536
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:45,920
them um at this price point right now it

2537
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:50,119
doesn't really make much sense it's more

2538
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:52,359
of just like to do a hobby uh as you or

2539
01:33:50,118 --> 01:33:54,960
may not know if you grow it's a [ __ ] ton

2540
01:33:52,359 --> 01:33:57,319
of work you never get any days off um

2541
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,000
it's hard and it's just never ending

2542
01:33:57,319 --> 01:34:00,920
right so like some days are easy some

2543
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,158
days are hard some days are long some

2544
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:05,359
days are short but like the point is is

2545
01:34:03,158 --> 01:34:06,679
that it doesn't end it's not like if

2546
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:08,079
you're sick you still have to attend to

2547
01:34:06,679 --> 01:34:09,039
the Garden the plants will die like if

2548
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:12,479
you don't feed them right or if you

2549
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:14,800
don't water them so um yes there will

2550
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:16,959
still always be that uh hobby

2551
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:19,480
grower uh there will

2552
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,039
be new people that coming into the scene

2553
01:34:19,479 --> 01:34:22,399
that kind of you know replace the other

2554
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:24,600
ones just depends on what your what your

2555
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:26,359
goal is so if you're if you're going to

2556
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,679
be you know just growing for yourself

2557
01:34:26,359 --> 01:34:29,880
because it's fun for you like yeah

2558
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,719
there's always going to be that but like

2559
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:33,239
uh to answer your question as well like

2560
01:34:31,719 --> 01:34:34,920
I just I just went to the grow store the

2561
01:34:33,238 --> 01:34:37,158
other day and it was [ __ ] closed it's

2562
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:40,440
like what the [ __ ] man it's it's

2563
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:41,638
gone like this is crazy so like and like

2564
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:42,919
the only reason why I used to go to that

2565
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:44,359
one is because my other one closed I'm

2566
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:46,079
like dude so those are closing left and

2567
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:48,519
right so I think it's going to get

2568
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:50,439
smaller and smaller harder and harder um

2569
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:52,600
and like the best will survive right so

2570
01:34:50,439 --> 01:34:54,359
it'll be a weeding out process process

2571
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,800
and then like I said at some point

2572
01:34:54,359 --> 01:35:00,719
people are going to be like dude these

2573
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:02,440
[ __ ] rock hard little [ __ ] you

2574
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,399
know asteroid looking nuggets that don't

2575
01:35:02,439 --> 01:35:07,198
even look like weed that are dry as [ __ ]

2576
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:08,559
they turn into powder ain't my jam like

2577
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:09,839
I can do better than this and they're

2578
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,719
GNA be like [ __ ] this and they're going

2579
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:13,719
to start from scratch and learn the

2580
01:35:11,719 --> 01:35:15,439
whole [ __ ] or already have some type of

2581
01:35:13,719 --> 01:35:16,679
some type of H industry industry

2582
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:18,439
knowledge and every like [ __ ] this I'm

2583
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:19,639
going to do my own [ __ ] and then they're

2584
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:20,839
going to create their own little craft

2585
01:35:19,639 --> 01:35:23,319
thing you know what I mean so like I

2586
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:26,560
think craft always be there

2587
01:35:23,319 --> 01:35:29,198
because nobody wants the Budweiser of

2588
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:32,320
weed you know what I'm saying like it's

2589
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:34,039
cool but like the the the mass in my

2590
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:36,198
opinion the people that are [ __ ] weed

2591
01:35:34,039 --> 01:35:37,920
heads they're already hardcore in the

2592
01:35:36,198 --> 01:35:39,319
game they're deep in the game right

2593
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,920
they're not [ __ ]

2594
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:44,559
newbies you know moms the moms are going

2595
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:45,920
to be eating Edibles they're going to be

2596
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,800
eating gummies like they don't give a

2597
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,199
[ __ ] they don't say daytime like okay

2598
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:51,400
that's what I want oh night time that's

2599
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:52,678
what I want like they don't give a [ __ ]

2600
01:35:51,399 --> 01:35:55,079
the [ __ ] real weed heads they're

2601
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:56,800
going to be into [ __ ] flavor potency

2602
01:35:55,079 --> 01:35:58,039
Etc whatever they think that they want

2603
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,360
right and then they're going to be like

2604
01:35:58,039 --> 01:36:01,359
this that and the third so I think

2605
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:05,799
there's always going to be a market for

2606
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:08,599
the um I would say craft aspect of it

2607
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:10,920
but in terms of the hom

2608
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,239
grower I mean I don't know man it's

2609
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:14,480
expensive as hell if they come down if

2610
01:36:13,238 --> 01:36:16,879
if the home grower looks at their

2611
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:18,279
electric bill looks at the amount of uh

2612
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,800
you know the cost for the seed all the

2613
01:36:18,279 --> 01:36:22,319
equipment etc etc etc the return on

2614
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,000
investment

2615
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:26,559
it's gonna take them years as opposed to

2616
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,279
like the prices they can get at at a

2617
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:32,000
dispensary or from their local dude so I

2618
01:36:30,279 --> 01:36:33,800
don't know man I think the the uh the

2619
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,079
local hom grower guy will have to be the

2620
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:38,440
hardcore heady person the guy or girl

2621
01:36:37,079 --> 01:36:40,158
like they got to really want it to

2622
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:42,960
really make it make

2623
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:45,759
sense yeah certainly it certainly feels

2624
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,359
that way doesn't it let me let me take

2625
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:50,440
us back to the question we used to start

2626
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:53,960
the show with tell me about your first

2627
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:56,839
ever experience with cannabis oh man

2628
01:36:53,960 --> 01:37:00,920
this is funny so I was in high school

2629
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:04,520
and uh I was like maybe 14 or 15 I was a

2630
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:06,319
freshman and and uh I grew up in the Bay

2631
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:08,719
Area so it's like San Francisco Bay area

2632
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:11,039
and so uh drugs are really prevalent up

2633
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,920
there um you have hate Street and all

2634
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:15,880
that [ __ ] it's like it's just it's just

2635
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:17,760
drugs are not like um out of the

2636
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:19,079
ordinary if you will so they're

2637
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,199
everywhere like you can just go to ha

2638
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:24,079
Street and get whatever the [ __ ] you

2639
01:37:20,198 --> 01:37:26,359
want um from some homeless guy but uh

2640
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:27,719

2641
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:30,238
because I'm like 14 15 something like

2642
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:34,000

2643
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:36,198
I'm not doing drugs and then uh I was

2644
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,800
like one homie after the other fell off

2645
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:40,079
they're all [ __ ] doing drugs and I

2646
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:41,400
was like [ __ ] I was the last guy and I

2647
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:42,960

2660
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:11,960
like hey dude it's coming out of your

2661
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,679
nose so he's plugging my nose while I'm

2662
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:17,359
sucking on it and uh nothing happened I

2663
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:20,359
was like all that was cool whatever so I

2664
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:21,880
didn't get high at all um and that was

2665
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:23,359
my first experience but then after that

2666
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:24,840
but then I was like open to it it was

2667
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:26,359
like kind of fun just hanging out these

2668
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,639
guys were laughing their asses off and

2669
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:29,598
like I was like hanging out just

2670
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:31,039
unstoned didn't get me [ __ ] up because

2671
01:38:29,599 --> 01:38:34,199
it probably just came out of my nose

2672
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:36,800
right so um the second time I got Stone

2673
01:38:34,198 --> 01:38:38,879
I got [ __ ] ripped and I was like

2674
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,639
giggling uncontrollably couldn't stop

2675
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,520
laughing like the whole world was on on

2676
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,719

2684
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,760

2685
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:09,198

that was the first time I smoked man and

2690
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:22,000
then after that it was like it went from

2691
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:23,799
um like once in a while to

2692

you know once a week twice a week three

2693
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:27,840
times a week then it became a [ __ ] it

2694
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:29,800
it escalated quickly bro it was not good

2695
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,920
like literally like seven days a week

2696
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,880
and then every day I'd wake up and like

2697
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,920

2703
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:54,800
first time beautiful I love that so how

2704
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:58,520
did that progress to your first grow so

2705
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:59,880
as a kid um all I like you had to pay

2706
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:02,599
for it you have to you had to find a

2707
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:04,000
hookup it was like at that age it's not

2708
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:05,639
easy unless you have like an uncle or a

2709
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,279
cousin or somebody that's like linked

2710
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:09,719
right so it was like how the [ __ ] do I

2711
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:12,079
find weed people were selling fake [ __ ]

2712
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:13,840
like they're just you know uh we would

2713
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:15,719
uh Liv in next to San Francisco we would

2714
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,800
drive up to San Francisco like it wasn't

2715
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:20,079
it never happened to me luckily but like

2716
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:23,239
people get fake sacks filled with like

2717
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:24,880
[ __ ] uh shredded paper like you're

2718
01:40:23,238 --> 01:40:26,479
getting jacked left and right right so

2719
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:30,679
you like you had to have somebody who

2720
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:33,519
who was like somewhat in the know so um

2721
01:40:30,679 --> 01:40:35,840
and and back in these days dude it was

2722
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:40,000
like [ __ ] if you were lucky you would

2723
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:42,880
get $50 an e it was $60 e and it was

2724
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,840
like no breaks it was insane and it was

2725
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,440
eyeballed like you like we didn't have

2726
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:49,319
scales okay like then we'd [ __ ] I

2727
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:51,559
would try like I was always a business

2728
01:40:49,319 --> 01:40:52,920
mind minded guy so like I'd crack it up

2729
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:54,880
in the sacks and like try and get like

2730
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:56,118
most of my money back to smoke for free

2731
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,359
and that's kind of how I started my

2732
01:40:56,118 --> 01:40:59,880
selling quote unquote career right and

2733
01:40:58,359 --> 01:41:02,920
that's how I kind of started the game

2734
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:04,400
but uh to grow like I was like [ __ ] dude

2735
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:07,118
and like it was seasonal it was only

2736
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:09,479
outdoor at least where I was at and I I

2737
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:10,719
was a few hours away from Humble so like

2738
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:15,158
we would get these seeds and I would

2739
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:16,760
plant them and man the the unfortunate

2740
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:20,079
thing is is like when you're at that

2741
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:22,360
stage of Life as a kid like you're too

2742
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:24,039
stupid man you talk about it you let

2743
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:25,439
somebody know about it and the next

2744
01:41:24,039 --> 01:41:29,599
thing you know they're [ __ ] stolen

2745
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:32,919
and like I had literally I've never I

2746
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:34,960
literally never got to harvest any grow

2747
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:37,399
I would grow like every [ __ ] year and

2748
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:39,560
every year it would get stolen and and

2749
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:40,960
and and and vice versa like I was stupid

2750
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:42,440
I was like a little prick so I would

2751
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:43,760
steal people's plants too when I found

2752
01:41:42,439 --> 01:41:46,399
out it was like it was like that's just

2753
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,320
what happened and uh but even then even

2754
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:52,319
if I saw him I never got to Har them

2755
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:54,039
Karma right so um I would do it every

2756
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:56,840
[ __ ] year it would be like my parents

2757
01:41:54,039 --> 01:41:58,439
found out or oh here's here's a good one

2758
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:01,119

2759
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:03,000

2760

watt HPS in my [ __ ] closet in my

2762
01:42:05,198 --> 01:42:10,039
bedroom and like every every time the

2763
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:12,359
was [ __ ] like a thousand degrees in

2764
01:42:10,039 --> 01:42:14,719

2767
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,840
temperature controls and uh it was like

2768
01:42:19,118 --> 01:42:22,198
maybe 2 feet from the plant I was like

2769
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:24,560
holy [ __ ] D it was constantly almost

2770
01:42:22,198 --> 01:42:26,158
melting and dying and like every time

2771
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,039
some you turn the microwave on the whole

2772
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:30,158
house would go out like what the [ __ ]

2773
01:42:28,039 --> 01:42:31,198
I'm like I don't know and I would always

2774
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:33,359
have go have to [ __ ] flip the

2775
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:35,479
breakers and [ __ ] was hilarious and

2776
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:36,359
somehow that even [ __ ] got swiped for

2777
01:42:35,479 --> 01:42:37,519
me I don't even know what happened with

2778
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:39,479
that I think I put it outside at some

2779
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,840
point my parents threw it away but um

2780
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:43,718
that's what was the initial right and I

2781
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:46,279
used to stack all these so back in the

2782
01:42:43,719 --> 01:42:49,198
days what we got for information I'm

2783
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:52,960
going back a little bit before um we

2784
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:54,719
didn't have uh there was no internet

2785
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,960
like literally the internet didn't exist

2786
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,480
so like we had High Times magazines like

2787
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,079
every week or every month whatever it

2788
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:01,519
was so I had stacks of high times

2789
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:03,439
magazines on my desk I would literally

2790
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,760
collect them every week or or I think it

2791
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:07,198
was every month uh and I would just read

2792
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,480
those from cover to cover and I was just

2793
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:10,079
trying to learn about everything and as

2794
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:12,879
a kid it's funny that we we're talking

2795
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:14,920
about this because as a kid 15 16 17

2796
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,599
years old I was like I just want to grow

2797
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:20,840
weed that was my [ __ ] life goal dude

2798
01:43:17,599 --> 01:43:23,800
which is funny um that's all I want to

2799
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:25,159
do and so uh so I I would collect these

2800
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,360
High Times magazines that's where you

2801
01:43:25,158 --> 01:43:28,039
gain all your knowledge from and I

2802
01:43:26,359 --> 01:43:30,238
remember the High Times cups from the

2803
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:32,679
beginning they had like AK-47 bubble gum

2804
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:35,559
da I like oh need mouth watering like I

2805
01:43:32,679 --> 01:43:38,279
can't wait to get to that point um but

2806
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:40,440
yeah man uh I would start there and then

2807
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:41,880
there was like like I said it would

2808
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:44,519
always get stolen there was never any

2809
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:46,199
like real it wasn't like a trap thing I

2810
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:49,400
was I was a young kid so I didn't

2811
01:43:46,198 --> 01:43:51,559
couldn't really trap anywhere and uh at

2812
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:54,679
some point I gave up the whole thing

2813
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:56,440
because it was uh it was uh it was

2814
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:59,118
pretty heavy man like I got robbed at

2815
01:43:56,439 --> 01:44:01,198
gunpoint for an ounce of weed and like

2816
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:02,479
they didn't get the ounce it it just

2817
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:04,000
[ __ ] me up in my head I was like this

2818
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:05,238
is not worth it dude it was like 300

2819
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,039
bucks somebody's trying to take my life

2820
01:44:05,238 --> 01:44:09,519
so I basically [ __ ] I was like [ __ ]

2821
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:11,238
this I'm done with this [ __ ] um and

2822
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,719
changed my whole trajectory in life

2823
01:44:11,238 --> 01:44:16,919
right and then I came back to it when uh

2824
01:44:13,719 --> 01:44:18,158
what 2018 2019 I was like older

2825
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,760
established I was like you know what

2826
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:21,319
dude I'm I'm I'm just going to see it

2827
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,560
and like literally like what we're were

2828
01:44:21,319 --> 01:44:25,039
talking about earli this all comes back

2829
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,440
full circle right I basically took a

2830
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:28,158
couple seed packs that I thought were

2831
01:44:26,439 --> 01:44:30,799
way too expensive and threw them in in

2832
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:32,399
my backyard some of which my dog ate

2833
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,960
right and then it started from there and

2834
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:36,920
then from there I was like e they got

2835
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:38,639
eaten by bugs hated it Outdoors was [ __ ]

2836
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:40,359
for me I was like this [ __ ] sucks got

2837
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,960
every problem in the world and then I

2838
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:44,279
was like I'm GNA do a light then I did a

2839
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,480
[ __ ] dehumidifier then I did a AC

2840
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:47,639
unit you know what I mean I started

2841
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:50,039
building building building and then then

2842
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:53,679
then that led us to today so yeah in a

2843
01:44:50,039 --> 01:44:56,079
short con against obviously fashion wow

2844
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:59,520
love it that's cool it's all full circle

2845
01:44:56,079 --> 01:45:01,920
isn't it I mean sort of not not quite as

2846
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,880
similar but like interestingly I wanted

2847
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,960
to ask you about how like there had been

2848
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:08,480
some reports that came out I think it

2849
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:10,599
might have been yesterday maybe today um

2850
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:13,879
about how like MasterCard was like not

2851
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:16,000
going to accept payments from Cannabis

2852
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:19,000
stuff what's your thoughts in regards to

2853
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,920
that and like how America is traj on the

2854
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,399
way to like Federal legalization you

2855
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:24,239
know do you think this represents like

2856
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:26,118
stagnation in a

2857
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:27,799
sense I think it's just a bunch of

2858
01:45:26,118 --> 01:45:32,479
[ __ ] CU like it doesn't make any

2859
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:35,320
sense um most dispensaries have ATMs in

2860
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:37,399
them it's a [ __ ] joke dude it it to

2861
01:45:35,319 --> 01:45:40,359
me it's just like a uh it's a false F

2862
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:42,439
it's like it's a bunch of [ __ ] so

2863
01:45:40,359 --> 01:45:46,198
you just you you declined it from from

2864
01:45:42,439 --> 01:45:48,960
vendor to to the uh to the uh uh patient

2865
01:45:46,198 --> 01:45:51,598
or or or customer right but guess what

2866
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:53,840
that customer can now go to the [ __ ]

2867
01:45:51,599 --> 01:45:55,679
ATM that's already in their dispensary

2868
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:57,800
and get charged three or four bucks I'm

2869
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,920
like What's the difference like they're

2870
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:01,239
I don't know dude I think it's I think

2871
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:03,319
it's a bunch of [ __ ] but stagnation

2872
01:46:01,238 --> 01:46:05,198
in terms of the federal like

2873
01:46:03,319 --> 01:46:07,880
unfortunately um it has become a

2874
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:10,319
political issue

2875
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:12,319
and uh depending on what side of the

2876
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:14,319
aisle you're on it's not up I don't

2877
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:16,359
dislike or like you anymore any less but

2878
01:46:14,319 --> 01:46:18,639
like it seems like the Republicans are

2879
01:46:16,359 --> 01:46:21,039
always voting against it for federal

2880
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:23,239
legal legalization and I'm like it's

2881
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:24,960
just like it's just like old and

2882
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:28,000
stagnant like like what you said yes it

2883
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:30,560
is stagnating it and uh it's like old

2884
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,039
[ __ ] they're like oh makes you

2885
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,639
whatever and this and that I'm like dude

2886
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:37,279
it's all [ __ ] it's all debunked

2887
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:38,960
[ __ ] so um I don't know man Federal

2888
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:40,439
legalization does need to happen though

2889
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,399
because like all these people are

2890
01:46:40,439 --> 01:46:44,198
rolling around with [ __ ] all these

2891
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:45,000
people being like legalized dispensaries

2892
01:46:44,198 --> 01:46:47,118
they're they're rolling around with

2893
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,679
hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash

2894
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:50,920
they can't even they can't even deposit

2895
01:46:48,679 --> 01:46:53,079
it like they have to go and pay tax with

2896
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:55,480
cash that's [ __ ] insane dude there

2897
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:58,158
should be like regardless of whether or

2898
01:46:55,479 --> 01:46:59,718
not it's legal federally there should

2899
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:02,039
still be some safeguards in place to

2900
01:46:59,719 --> 01:47:03,840
where people aren't risking their lives

2901
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:05,800
getting robbed you know what I'm saying

2902
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:07,239
just to just to deposit your taxes that

2903
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:10,039
you're charging them doesn't make any

2904
01:47:07,238 --> 01:47:13,000
sense it's it's a bunch of [ __ ] so

2905
01:47:10,039 --> 01:47:14,439
um where it's going who the [ __ ] knows

2906
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,760
right I'm assuming it's going to depend

2907
01:47:14,439 --> 01:47:18,079
on who

2908
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:21,360
is uh controlling the house and the

2909
01:47:18,079 --> 01:47:22,760
Senate and as well as the presidency

2910
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:23,598
and who knows what the [ __ ] they're

2911
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,560
going to do and if they're actually

2912
01:47:23,599 --> 01:47:27,880
going to do it right because everybody

2913
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:29,320
on that level seems to lie like crazy no

2914
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:30,679
matter what side of the aisle they're on

2915
01:47:29,319 --> 01:47:31,920
right they just say what you want they

2916
01:47:30,679 --> 01:47:33,639
just say what you want to hear until

2917
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:36,840
they get in the office and they do or

2918
01:47:33,639 --> 01:47:38,840
don't do it but um yeah I don't know man

2919
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:41,199
I think I think we're at a stalemate I I

2920
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:42,560
hope that it gets legalized and like

2921
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:44,559
there's more and more States coming

2922
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,080
online so at some point like what's the

2923
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,039
hold up

2924
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:49,559
right I don't know how many states are

2925
01:47:48,039 --> 01:47:51,198
online you probably have more re

2926
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:53,320
research done than I have but like I'm

2927
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:55,719
I'm assuming there's probably like 20ish

2928
01:47:53,319 --> 01:47:57,479
states that are already online in a

2929
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:59,639
medical or uh

2930
01:47:57,479 --> 01:48:02,598
recreational capacity I'm like what what

2931
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:04,719
the [ __ ] is a hold up dude like let's go

2932
01:48:02,599 --> 01:48:07,920
you know what I mean so I don't know

2933
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:09,359
that's it that's it uh one of the final

2934
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,000
questions we've got on breeding before

2935
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:14,439
we get to our quickfire ones was do you

2936
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,039
consider the concentrate potential of

2937
01:48:14,439 --> 01:48:17,359
strains when you make them or is it more

2938
01:48:16,039 --> 01:48:18,719
of like a secondary thing and if

2939
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:21,359
something happens to be good for that

2940
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:24,079
you're like oh that's cool

2941
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:26,960
yeah secondary for me um I don't breed

2942
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:30,279
for hash so some people do right and so

2943
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:31,719
I honestly I don't even smoke Dabs or do

2944
01:48:30,279 --> 01:48:33,479
hash like I don't I don't really smoke

2945
01:48:31,719 --> 01:48:35,679
hash like I'll [ __ ] I'll smoke it if

2946
01:48:33,479 --> 01:48:37,158
somebody's got it in like a in a joint

2947
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:39,800
or something but like I don't do dabs

2948
01:48:37,158 --> 01:48:41,000
like I'm just I'm older now man like i'

2949
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:43,119
I've already gotten the size I need to

2950
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,359
get and so like I just like to like what

2951
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:45,679
we were talking about earlier like I

2952
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:48,598
would like to smoke

2953
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:50,599
more uh and not get as high and like and

2954
01:48:48,599 --> 01:48:53,199
control my high easier than getting just

2955
01:48:50,599 --> 01:48:54,880
[ __ ] blast it off but back in the

2956
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:56,238
days when I was younger I used to get as

2957
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:57,639
high as I [ __ ] could to the point

2958
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:59,718
where joints wouldn't even get me a head

2959
01:48:57,639 --> 01:49:02,279
Buzz so I've kind of like come full

2960
01:48:59,719 --> 01:49:04,158
circle in the sense that like I kind of

2961
01:49:02,279 --> 01:49:05,920
see what works best for my body plus

2962
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:08,158
like I was having health effects health

2963
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:11,760
problems like smoking that much it

2964
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:15,719
wasn't good so um yeah so personally I

2965
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:18,840
don't uh create streams for hash

2966
01:49:15,719 --> 01:49:20,520
um but that's just me um so yeah I don't

2967
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:22,560
I don't do that personally if it comes

2968
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:24,719
out great then that's great but yeah but

2969
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,719
the good news is um I've heard that the

2970
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:29,079
super boo cut as well as the uh just

2971
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:31,560
blockberry in general wash pretty well I

2972
01:49:29,079 --> 01:49:33,639
think they're like 4ish fiveish percent

2973
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:35,880
from what I've heard so I guess that's

2974
01:49:33,639 --> 01:49:39,359
great returns so that was just luck

2975
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:41,480
though I didn't mean to have that happen

2976
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:45,000
H yeah happy accident cool I get it I

2977
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:46,238
get it yep I uh I also I think you kind

2978
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,198
of touched on it a bit earlier but I

2979
01:49:46,238 --> 01:49:50,638
wanted to ask you just specifically do

2980
01:49:48,198 --> 01:49:52,279
you have any tips or tricks tricks for

2981
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:54,440
picking males do you like to sort of

2982
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:56,399
pair it up with like what a a female you

2983
01:49:54,439 --> 01:49:58,279
like looks like or is it a bit more of

2984
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:00,079
like a feeling and you're like this one

2985
01:49:58,279 --> 01:50:02,920
just looks the best

2986
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:04,880
overall so yeah it's going to be Vigor

2987
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:07,480
it's going to be structure and then when

2988
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:11,079
it flowers like I want to

2989
01:50:07,479 --> 01:50:12,919
see what it does right so like um

2990
01:50:11,079 --> 01:50:16,158
similar to females like it could have

2991
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:19,158
tight noted Stacks giant colas it could

2992
01:50:16,158 --> 01:50:21,598
have [ __ ] spread out sparse little

2993
01:50:19,158 --> 01:50:24,039
satellite bus if you will of male

2994
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:25,880
flowers so um the only thing that I

2995
01:50:24,039 --> 01:50:27,359
can't really gauge on a male as much

2996
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,639
like you could smell the [ __ ] plant

2997
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:30,198
right like it'll it'll have some turbs

2998
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:31,920
to it but it's not the same as like a

2999
01:50:30,198 --> 01:50:34,198
female like you can't smell a dried flow

3000
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,039
off a male so that's the only kind of X

3001
01:50:34,198 --> 01:50:37,118
Factor but like you could still smell

3002
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:38,599
the plant if you move it around

3003
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:42,399
specifically like oh [ __ ] this thing is

3004
01:50:38,599 --> 01:50:45,560
[ __ ] loud so umh but what I look for

3005
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:47,519
as in in terms of choosing male is Vigor

3006
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:49,119
structure and that's pretty much the

3007
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,800
gist of it dude because like structure

3008
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:55,559
in the sense of

3009
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:58,199
branching um spacing as well as the

3010
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:59,840
structure of the male flower so the

3011
01:50:58,198 --> 01:51:01,879
flower structure so those things are all

3012
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,119
kind of considered in my personal aspect

3013
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:07,400
of structure and then the Vigor so I

3014
01:51:04,118 --> 01:51:10,799
want it to be personally like I like

3015
01:51:07,399 --> 01:51:12,238
quick um plants I don't like slow

3016
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,159
vegging like I don't want these tiny

3017
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:16,439
little [ __ ] like and I know that

3018
01:51:14,158 --> 01:51:19,359
those things work well in a double stack

3019
01:51:16,439 --> 01:51:21,638
system triple stack even some cases

3020
01:51:19,359 --> 01:51:23,439
people have that but like I like my [ __ ]

3021
01:51:21,639 --> 01:51:25,000
to blast off you know what I mean like I

3022
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:26,598
want to have a short ass veg time and I

3023
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,599
want it to [ __ ] Blast Off in the

3024
01:51:26,599 --> 01:51:34,039
atmosphere so I look for that I look for

3025
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:37,239
quick quick veg big big frame like like

3026
01:51:34,039 --> 01:51:40,760
strong I don't like um oh again

3027
01:51:37,238 --> 01:51:44,519
structure I don't like um

3028
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:47,840
thin uh branches at all like I hate when

3029
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:49,280
there's like um colas that need to be or

3030
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:51,360
or buds that need to be like held up

3031
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:53,559
with a lot of a lot of help like I I'd

3032
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:55,319
love for a plant to hold up its own self

3033
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:58,800
if that makes any sense like I want it

3034
01:51:55,319 --> 01:52:00,319
to be a strong female or a strong male

3035
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,400
to where it holds itself up like I don't

3036
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:04,158
want these little thin ass branches like

3037
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,158
oh I clipped that branch and snapped in

3038
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:08,519
half like I don't want that so again it

3039
01:52:06,158 --> 01:52:12,559
goes down to structure so that's what I

3040
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:14,159
look for in males nice I dig it I dig it

3041
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,880
I uh I also wanted to quickly ask you

3042
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:17,799
before we do our final five I see you

3043
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:20,359
did some crosses with a plant called

3044
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:23,480
lemon Rosé is that right tell us about

3045
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:26,920
that oh yeah yes from dying breed seeds

3046
01:52:23,479 --> 01:52:30,839
those are the guys that uh created uh

3047
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:32,960
Skittles for my understanding um and

3048
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:35,119
that dude check this out so this was

3049
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:36,480
actually for my buddy blood and fire

3050
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:37,679
dude so he was like dude you got to

3051
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:40,158
check this out he was like he like I

3052
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:42,158
found this I found this winter uh it has

3053
01:52:40,158 --> 01:52:44,039
like all OG leaves there's only three

3054
01:52:42,158 --> 01:52:45,279
leaves this and that and then so I

3055
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:47,158
looked up the turps I looked up

3056
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:50,559
everything about it I was like [ __ ] dude

3057
01:52:47,158 --> 01:52:53,078
that [ __ ] is sick so um yeah I used that

3058
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:55,000
um but yeah a buddy of mine gave me that

3059
01:52:53,078 --> 01:52:58,000
pollen as well that he actually hunted

3060
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,158
so I didn't actually hunt the male and

3061
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,158
that was more of a uh I I I didn't know

3062
01:53:01,158 --> 01:53:03,719
if I was going to give that out to

3063
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:05,118
people but like I talked to a couple

3064
01:53:03,719 --> 01:53:06,599
people that had popped those seeds they

3065
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:07,960
like dude it's a [ __ ] Banger so like

3066
01:53:06,599 --> 01:53:09,000
that's why that's why I sent it out to

3067
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:11,399
the to the

3068
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,359
Lexicon but yeah that's where that came

3069
01:53:11,399 --> 01:53:16,078
from but it was from dying breeds Dying

3070
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:19,039
Breed seeds yeah nice sounds like it

3071
01:53:16,078 --> 01:53:21,880
would have been super turpy cool cool so

3072
01:53:19,039 --> 01:53:24,920
onto our final five questions so first

3073
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:26,639
one what is the single most memorable

3074
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:28,399
experience you have with cannabis so

3075
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:30,039
just whatever is left the most lasting

3076
01:53:28,399 --> 01:53:31,839
impact doesn't have to be like the most

3077
01:53:30,039 --> 01:53:32,639
high you ever got or anything but the

3078
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,639
most

3079
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:36,159
memorable oh

3080
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:39,078
[ __ ]

3081
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:40,719
H I guess it' probably be right now man

3082
01:53:39,078 --> 01:53:44,519
like this is the most memorable now I'm

3083
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:46,920
on a [ __ ] podcast in Australia like

3084
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:48,560
this is the most memorable for weed like

3085
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:50,440
and I'll honestly besides the fact when

3086
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:53,320
I was a little kid Laugh at My ass off

3087
01:53:50,439 --> 01:53:56,319
choking on sandwiches you know I like

3088
01:53:53,319 --> 01:53:58,639
out of my tree just learning about weed

3089
01:53:56,319 --> 01:54:01,279
um yeah man I think right now is the

3090
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:02,679
most memorable so uh I've never thought

3091
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:05,039
like I said when I started this whole

3092
01:54:02,679 --> 01:54:07,078
thing wasn't to start anything it was

3093
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:09,800
just to just to make seed for myself to

3094
01:54:07,078 --> 01:54:11,158
have genetic backup so that I can

3095
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:13,079
continue on because like I said I was a

3096
01:54:11,158 --> 01:54:14,799
seed junkie to an extent in the sense

3097
01:54:13,078 --> 01:54:15,960
that like I was hunting all these seeds

3098
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,599
and always getting all these new seed

3099
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:19,439
packs and I was like [ __ ] it's going to

3100
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:20,960
take me like 10 years or 20 years to get

3101
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:22,879
through all these so I was like all

3102
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:24,599
right pop a couple from this pack pop a

3103
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:26,599
couple from that pack get through it and

3104
01:54:24,599 --> 01:54:27,560
then I would be like all right but I

3105
01:54:26,599 --> 01:54:30,039
didn't want to get rid of them for

3106
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:31,920
forever so I like I'll try to make seed

3107
01:54:30,039 --> 01:54:33,840
as a backup for a genetics right so I'm

3108
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,599
like all right I I can get these later

3109
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:38,560
so I never thought that this was going

3110
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:40,199
to be anything so um right now man the

3111
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:42,400
fact that I'm on the I'm on the horn

3112
01:54:40,198 --> 01:54:44,000
with you dude in Australia is amazing

3113
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:47,158
like this is probably the most memorable

3114
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,039
by far not just you but just in general

3115
01:54:47,158 --> 01:54:51,879
right like that I am even looked at you

3116
01:54:50,039 --> 01:54:54,679
know and or cared about so it's it's

3117
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:56,760
huge to me very humbling bro I really

3118
01:54:54,679 --> 01:55:00,319
appreciate it dude you're too kind glad

3119
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:02,960
to have you here so next question what's

3120
01:55:00,319 --> 01:55:05,000
a strain where like everyone maybe your

3121
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:07,198
friends but just in general strain was

3122
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,800
getting really hyped you finally got to

3123
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:12,439
try it and you were like a bit

3124
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:15,760
disappointed oh there's a there's a lot

3125
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:17,559
of those um for growing or for smoking

3126
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,599
or like do you w or you just want to

3127
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:22,199
leave

3128
01:55:18,599 --> 01:55:24,679
it Oreos dude sorry like that [ __ ] is

3129
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:27,839
[ __ ] fire right but it doesn't taste

3130
01:55:24,679 --> 01:55:28,960
great it's beautiful get you high though

3131
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,679
you know what I'm saying but it doesn't

3132
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:33,078
it just it just looks so [ __ ] good

3133
01:55:30,679 --> 01:55:34,279
doesn't really have any turps um that

3134
01:55:33,078 --> 01:55:36,439
was probably one of the biggest ones

3135
01:55:34,279 --> 01:55:38,158
that like as big as it got like I

3136
01:55:36,439 --> 01:55:40,759
[ __ ] love I love it the way it looks

3137
01:55:38,158 --> 01:55:42,078
like I said it's there's all kinds of

3138
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:43,840
good things about it but like that's the

3139
01:55:42,078 --> 01:55:45,519
only thing bro it just doesn't it just

3140
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:47,480
doesn't it just kind of let down in like

3141
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:50,639
in the terms of the taste and everything

3142
01:55:47,479 --> 01:55:52,718
sorry bro like I don't I know it's Max

3143
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:54,239
sorry bro [ __ ] disc dude I'm not

3144
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:56,679
trying to but that was like one of the

3145
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:58,879
ones that sticks out so the next

3146
01:55:56,679 --> 01:56:00,920
question we do is I'm going to drop you

3147
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,800
off on a desert island you get to take

3148
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:03,960
three strains with you you get to have

3149
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,560
them for the rest of your life what

3150
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,880
three

3151
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:10,840
strains oh

3152
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:14,159
[ __ ] [ __ ] you dude this is these are

3153
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:16,920
hard questions man uh here's the problem

3154
01:56:14,158 --> 01:56:18,000
with me I don't have favorites like

3155
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,560
people ask me what's your favorite I'm

3156
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,800
like I don't have a favorite it

3157
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:24,960
constantly

3158
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:28,239
changes so this is a very hard one um

3159
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:30,520
let's just go with a uh I love that

3160
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:32,519
Skywalker OG man like I always go back

3161
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:34,639
to that like whoever bred that more

3162
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:37,840
power to you dude [ __ ] amazing that

3163

3166
01:56:41,198 --> 01:56:44,598
that's just it's just a widget in the

3167
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:46,479
sense that like you could [ __ ] fit

3168
01:56:44,599 --> 01:56:48,960
that into any situation you're not going

3169
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:51,759
to be too indic out sativa out you could

3170

3194
01:57:46,279 --> 01:57:50,000
come by there are like some people who

3195
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:53,399
have done some back crosses and stuff so

3196
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,920
maybe maybe I can try to reach out you

3197
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:57,158

3198
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:59,800
here in San Diego bro uh shout out to

3199
01:57:57,158 --> 01:58:03,279
Shawn Kon dude this [ __ ] guy has like

3200
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:05,000
everything dude like he has literally

3201
01:58:03,279 --> 01:58:06,639
all the dope [ __ ] from forever I'll hit

3202
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,078
that guy but the hard part is he doesn't

3203
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:09,118
give a [ __ ] up so I'll never get it

3204
01:58:08,078 --> 01:58:11,198
anyways but I could probably buy some

3205
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:12,559
flower off him if he has it I'll let you

3206
01:58:11,198 --> 01:58:13,799
know I'll let you know that works out

3207
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:15,480
but yeah I would love to get some old

3208
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:17,279
school blackhead bro for sure but no I

3209
01:58:15,479 --> 01:58:18,919
haven't smoked it that I'm aware of

3210
01:58:17,279 --> 01:58:22,479
that's cool that's cool I've seen his

3211
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:25,760
Instagram it looks gnarly um all right

3212
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:28,279
so on to the last question I got a time

3213
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:30,599
machine you can go back in time anywhere

3214
01:58:28,279 --> 01:58:33,238
any place presumably to collect either

3215
01:58:30,599 --> 01:58:36,400
some seeds or a clone of something where

3216
01:58:33,238 --> 01:58:36,399
you going to go what are you going to

3217
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:42,920
get

3218
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:45,359
[ __ ] these are mindboggling here

3219
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:47,599
um honestly don't know which one I would

3220
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:50,279
get but I know what time frame I'll go

3221
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:52,440
back to I'll go back to the uh

3222
01:58:50,279 --> 01:58:53,920
early 90s and exactly what we were

3223
01:58:52,439 --> 01:58:56,359
talking about those High Times back in

3224
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:58,078
the days they were only held at um for

3225
01:58:56,359 --> 01:59:00,519
my recollection they were only held in

3226
01:58:58,078 --> 01:59:02,319
Amsterdam and like they had the AK-47

3227
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:04,920
the bubble gum all these [ __ ] gnarly

3228
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:06,439
ass strains and like I probably go back

3229
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:09,399
and get the original cut of bubble gum

3230
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:12,279
or something dude like that's I don't

3231
01:59:09,399 --> 01:59:14,158
know I think that but at the same time I

3232
01:59:12,279 --> 01:59:15,559
never really smoked the original Bubble

3233
01:59:14,158 --> 01:59:18,519
Gum then they then they had the Indiana

3234
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:20,920
bubble gum so I don't know U but I'll go

3235
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:23,239
back to that time frame and I'll go back

3236
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:24,840
to Amsterdam and I'll be able to smoke

3237
01:59:23,238 --> 01:59:26,638
all those [ __ ] strains and figure out

3238
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:27,800
exactly what was what and then I would

3239
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:29,560
cross some of those to some newer

3240
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:31,639
strains that maybe yield more or you

3241
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:34,039
know maybe do better indoors or whatever

3242
01:59:31,639 --> 01:59:36,719
so I'll probably go back to the time

3243
01:59:34,039 --> 01:59:40,920
frame being 93 to

3244
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:44,560
95 and then Amsterdam yeah but I'm old

3245
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:46,719
dude who knows bro like I'm I'm old

3246
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,320
apparently that's cool I like that

3247
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:50,520
people like I was just [ __ ] born then

3248
01:59:48,319 --> 01:59:52,679
dude [ __ ] what the yeah well there's

3249
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:54,679
some bombass hazes back then too you

3250
01:59:52,679 --> 01:59:56,078
know nl5 all this stuff there's a ton of

3251
01:59:54,679 --> 01:59:58,000
[ __ ] you can get back in the days that

3252
01:59:56,078 --> 02:00:00,158
were like building blocks to today's

3253
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,960
weed you know what I'm saying like pre-

3254
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:03,719
cookies pre Etc like I think that would

3255
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:05,800
be the dopest time to go back to I think

3256
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:08,520
that was when I just started blasting

3257
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:12,440
off especially for indoor so yeah that's

3258
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:14,199
the time frame hugely hugely so I think

3259
02:00:12,439 --> 02:00:15,839
that just about brings us to the end of

3260
02:00:14,198 --> 02:00:17,158
it for this one were there any general

3261
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:20,319
