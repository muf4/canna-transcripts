1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,318
one thing i find with the australians is

2
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,919
i never get any negativity and i just

3
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,400
think that is

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,519
i think something everyone could learn

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,199
from

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,759
seriously just

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,919
never get any negativity or any rude

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,320
anything from anybody in australia and i

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,320

thank you for having me

31
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,879
so a little mix up to the normal

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
question what are you currently smoking

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,438
well um right now

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,400
i just finished smoking a joint of

35
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,438
the rainbow ssog by smell boat seeds

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,759
actually

37
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,359
so is that is that some like sneaky

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,519
product placement that's been popping up

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,478
everywhere is this intentional

40
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,280
no actually it's not i just happen to

41
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,719
sit down and roll a joint i i actually

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,759
haven't been smoking a whole lot of

43
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,560
flour lately i've been smoking mostly

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,599
concentrates um

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,118
we haven't had any of our own dry flour

46
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,000
for a while because we've been pretty

47
00:01:53,118 --> 00:02:00,399
busy lately with everything going on

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,040
um but no i was lucky my brother-in-law

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
gifted me some of his concentrates and

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,920
some of his

51
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,598
dry flowers so

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,598
i figured i'd twist it up and sample it

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,679
no sneaky placement

54
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,439
no no no i i wouldn't think so anyway

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,920
it's it's great i was lucky enough to be

56
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,759
able to try it but the the question that

57
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,958
i really want to ask so are you like a

58
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,759
joints person primarily

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,640
depends um i just

60
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,439
i just like to honestly smoke um but

61
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,878
like i said daily lately

62
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,239
most of the time throughout the day i

63
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:39,840
smoke concentrates um

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,560
right now i have uh

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,120
some extreme cream from the jennison

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,080
project there are some local friends of

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
ours

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,800
it's actually really good um

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
and then a friend of ours named bang

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,439
mingo he's

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,840
gifted me some um it's like from dragon

72
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,800
scale emerald dragon out of humboldt

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,759
county

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
it's a yeti og uh live resin it's really

75
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,280
good

76
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,399
killer

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,719
and so

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,120
do you find that you would you would

79
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,639
smoke flour exclusively if you could or

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,599
you very much like concentrates as well

81
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,559
if

82
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,919
if i'm if i have a chance to smoke flour

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,239
it would

84
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,238
most likely have to be hours um

85
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,280
i am i'm really picky when it comes to

86
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,280
dry flour

87
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,039
i don't know it just has to be right i

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,200
don't like harshness oh i don't like my

89
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,359
throat throat to burn

90
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,518
i hate to cough i don't want to choke

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
from what i'm smoking so

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,120
in my personal experience dry flowers my

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,120
best

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,799
best bet is going with whatever we've

95
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,039
grown personally

96
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,040
but concentrates if we don't like i said

97
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,079
if we're out and we don't have access to

98
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,280
something

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,959
any one of

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,878
our good friends usually have some

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,598
really killer concentrates that i can

102
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,840
get or like i said i got like a couple

103
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,560
of buds that were gifted to

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,319
to me by uh smell boat seeds which is

105
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,759
nice

106
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,479
for sure okay

107
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,759
and so now let's go all the way back

108
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,119
what was your first experience with

109
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,120
cannabis

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,918
oh my gosh

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,478
um honestly i don't even know if i can

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,719
specifically remember my very first

113
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,519
experience with cannabis

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
as far as cannabis itself i'm smoking

115
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,039
wise

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,040
i was young um

117
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,080
i almost hate saying some of this stuff

118
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,720
out loud

119
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,198
because i was i was really young um

120
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,160
sixth grade probably

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,800
i couldn't tell you what it was because

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,600
back when nobody really named anything

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,478
and they all had real generic names

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
everybody called it green bud chronic

125
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,599
it was kind of

126
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,519
it's not like it is now

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,960
once prop 215 in california um went into

128
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,758
motion here

129
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,439
and

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,439
there was um

131
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,120
obviously a market for it that's when it

132
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,959
seemed like strain names became

133
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000
something that was real prevalent until

134
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,198
then though

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,199
it was pretty much called um

136
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
green bud skunk

137
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
nothing really had a recognizable name

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,879
like it does today

139
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,879
so when you were growing up it sounds

140
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,719
like cannabis was rather prevalent did

141
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,959
you grow up in the emerald triangle

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,720
no we're

143
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,719
everybody always asks us like where are

144
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,960
you from what you know where do you live

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
specifically and i could tell you

146
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,279
specifically but nobody ever really

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,680
knows where we're from it's a very small

148
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,038
town i've been in california my whole

149
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,280
life

150
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,680
as we're with matt he traveled a bit as

151
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,758
a kid but i have i've been pretty much

152
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,680
in like the central valley area my

153
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,639
entire life

154
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,720
um but yeah cannabis has been uh for as

155
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,439
long as i could remember

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,160
i was really young i can even remember

157
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,719
um as matt has stories about his

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,240
his parents when they were kids

159
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,440
i think my

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,439
my dad hid it a little bit better um

161
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,918
they didn't really smoke a whole lot in

162
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,918
front of us when we were really small

163
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,439
but i do remember a couple of times

164
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,839
seeing some plants growing in our

165
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,199
backyard when i was a real small child

166
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,758
okay and so

167
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,919
at what age were you when you first

168
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,439
heard of like the first breeders and who

169
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,719
was the first breeder you'd ever heard

170
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,759
of

171
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,759
oh my gosh

172
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,478
you know i don't know because i would

173
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,038
say for me personally like as far as

174
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,318
breeders and the whole community i've

175
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,120
never been seriously fascinated

176
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,840
um

177
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,519
like the way matt is he

178
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,079
he has an insane brain for it he

179
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,120
remembers anything and everything he's

180
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,439
ever read or heard or any research he's

181
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,598
ever done he i mean he has just an

182
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,839
amazing brain for it um

183
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:03,279
but me i've never actually had a

184
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,638
specific um

185
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,959
interest or draw or any of that to like

186
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,519
hunt as far as who who all is in our

187
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,959
community i feel kind of like a jerk

188
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,079
because i was saying we were we just

189
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,519
went to

190
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,359
um the endo ex expo in san francisco and

191
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,560
i feel like a jerk because i really

192
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,598
don't know anybody i don't spend much

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,319
time online i'm pretty much a homebody

194
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:31,038
and i spend most of my time with either

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,319
my family or my plants so it's like i

196
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:36,639
don't i've never really uh i don't spend

197
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,520
all my time doing research on who's in

198
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,598
the community and who does what i focus

199
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,159
mainly on what we do here

200
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,478
um and on our own projects and in our

201
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,879
own house like i don't even remember

202
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,038
when i was a kid and like pot was on the

203
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,680
scene i don't even remember

204
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,639
uh talk about pot breeders it was really

205
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,079
something that i learned a lot about

206
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,160
um once mad started taking like a

207
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,639
massive interest in really learning

208
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,599
about cannabis that's when i started to

209
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,840
really

210
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,680
just learn anything like any real true

211
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,799
knowledge there was to learn i learned

212
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,959
from him

213
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,759
before that i would say was all probably

214
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,239
just

215
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,240
wives tales and probably junk really

216
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,639
yeah i think we've all been fed one of

217
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
two of those wives tales before

218
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,720
oh yeah there's there's

219
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,199
there are there's so many of them and

220
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,039
with cannabis like the entire almost the

221
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,278
entire industry seems to be kind of

222
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,158
built on that in some way shape or form

223
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,639
so

224
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,519
yeah like my knowledge anything

225
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,559
um

226
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,479
anything that i have it i'm lucky i was

227
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,119
blessed to learn directly from him and

228
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,920
he just has an amazing mind so i never

229
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,360
really got involved in the like i know a

230
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,278
lot of people do they spend a lot of

231
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,720
time online and they spend a lot of time

232
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,000
researching

233
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,160
strains and breeders and all of that i i

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,159
don't i don't have the time for it and i

235
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,879
never really had a massive interest in

236
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,120
it

237
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,759
nor have i had a massive interest in

238
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,600
searching um the information on lots of

239
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,439
different strains only what i'm

240
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,399
currently interested in at the time i

241
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,480
just don't have the space for it

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,879
so if we were to say

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,120
take a step back what was the first

244
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,200
strain that you and mad were maybe

245
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
growing together that kind of really got

246
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
you in wrapped in the whole saga of it

247
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,879
all

248
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,800
oh my gosh um

249
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,439
we actually have some pretty funny like

250
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,399
really interesting stories um

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,040
the very first few plants that i can

252
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,519
remember like specifically remember him

253
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,278
growing they were actually outdoors and

254
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,320
i don't even think they had names to be

255
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,480
honest

256
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,519
i i can't even remember how we went

257
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,639
about

258
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,720
getting them um we we pretty much

259
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,319
you know now that we've been growing for

260
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,278
i don't know 20 some odd years longer

261
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,040
i'm not sure but around there um you you

262
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,958
get to where you have to keep notebooks

263
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,120
uh so i would have to like go dig and

264
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,599
try to figure out when and what but back

265
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,278
then i think those three plants he had

266
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,839
i don't even think they had names but he

267
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,480
was growing those outdoors at the time

268
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
but as far as like when he really took

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,200
um

270
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
like i knew we would be growing for the

271
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,600
rest of our lives when he first locked

272
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,000
down that lavender plant

273
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,000
um it was pretty crazy he i remember the

274
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,919
day he brought him home

275
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,679
um it was a weird day because i at the

276
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,759
time i had a full-time job i was working

277
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,319
a full-time job and that day when i was

278
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,639
at work i got a phone call

279
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,760
and they tell me that my identity had

280
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:38,559
been stolen somebody was using my social

281
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,240
security number and my full name

282
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,759
and they were basically using my

283
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,079
information to obtain employment so

284
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,679
um this particular day when i got home

285
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,359
from work i did what most people would

286
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,479
do in the situation i had to call the

287
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,959
police department and file a report and

288
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
we had a police officer standing in our

289
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,159
living room taking this police report

290
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,799
from me and he comes walking in the door

291
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,879
with um his lavender cuts

292
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,278
they were in a brown paper bag he had

293
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,360
gotten from like um our you know our our

294
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,639
small circle of friends that we had back

295
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,560
back when

296
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,838
and yeah he walks in the door with those

297
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,239
and it was um it was actually

298
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,920
valentine's day

299
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,839
and he walks in the door with them it

300
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,599
was kind of awkward but of course the

301
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,839
police officer in our house he has no

302
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,360
idea what what he has because they're in

303
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,120
a brown paper bag but it's just one of

304
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,120
those things that you remember forever

305
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,240
because that really was the strain um

306
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,320
that started his major interest and his

307
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,759
complete love and passion for cannabis

308
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,879
and learning about

309
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,679
um the benefits that it's given to not

310
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:47,519
just him and me but a lot of people that

311
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,679
we know as far as like a medicinal use

312
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,519
yeah of course and so

313
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,958
how did the urkel then get in your

314
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,839
possession

315
00:11:52,958 --> 00:12:00,078
oh that came super short after um

316
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,160
see this is one of those things um like

317
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,359
as far as like the a lot of research

318
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,078
being done

319
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,519
um like i said he took matt took such an

320
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,958
interest in really learning about just

321
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,600
cannabis and

322
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,359
proper ways to grow it and the you know

323
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,759
the ways to go about getting like the

324
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,560
best flavors most resins and just all

325
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,439
the stuff that he had such a fascination

326
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,119
for

327
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,399
and um

328
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,919
he was reading a lot about

329
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,440
i don't know you can call him rumors

330
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,199
whatever the stories that were going

331
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,200
around at the time about urkel and

332
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,839
lavender and how

333
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,120
they were um said at the time to be the

334
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,720
same

335
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,278
and he was dead set and proving that

336
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,399
they weren't uh and again we had this

337
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,720
small circle of friends and

338
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,639
um our friend at the time was super

339
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,959
interested in scoring the lavender that

340
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,120
we had and of course matt wanted the

341
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:57,119
urkel that he had

342
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,440
so we um tight circle keeping keeping

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,200
things amongst ourselves

344
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,600
uh we had agreed we were we were

345
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,278
actually gonna give him a cut of our

346
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
lavender which never turned out to

347
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,480
happen

348
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:13,039
um but we got the urkel and we've had

349
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,440
her ever since and i want to say that

350
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,078
was just like maybe a couple months

351
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,800
possibly after we scored that lavender

352
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:24,078
but we've had them ever since

353
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,679
and he was just dead set on proving they

354
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,519
were different and

355
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,159
that they were not only different but

356
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,879
different enough and worth hanging on to

357
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,399
both of them as different cuts for

358
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,919
you know for as long as we've had him

359
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,480
and how come the other guy didn't get

360
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
the lavender

361
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,000
oh yeah he shortly after went to prison

362
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,759
it just

363
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,759
yeah so he's we

364
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,838
yeah he's gone we haven't seen him or

365
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,360
heard from him in years i believe he's

366
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,279
still in prison but

367
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,600
yeah just one of those unfortunate

368
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,519
events you know how things go

369
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,759
in this business especially if you're

370
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,440
someone who may not necessarily be

371
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,720
careful um yeah he was a good friend of

372
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
mads and

373
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,440
known them for a long time and

374
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,519
they made that little deal and

375
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,440
um we hadn't it was one of those things

376
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,320
we hadn't taken cuts yet and he had his

377
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,560
so we got the urkel and we hadn't taken

378
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
the lavender cuts yet and

379
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,719
before we had gotten to take it he had

380
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,319
gone gone to prison so he

381
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,399
yeah that's how it turned out and lucky

382
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
for us we had we preserved both of them

383
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,799
because

384
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,079
matt and i were just talking about this

385
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,519
the other day

386
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,879
if it were

387
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,639
if it would have turned out any other

388
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,759
way this person that were you know this

389
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,440
person that we're talking about who

390
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,679
ended up in prison he likely wouldn't

391
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,040
have even hung on to

392
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,319
um the oracle cut because he was much

393
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,120
his interest

394
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,879
kind of funny was much like people today

395
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,959
you know they move on to the next strain

396
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,919
and no one really hangs on to anything

397
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,239
it's really funny and we did we we hung

398
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,399
on to him this whole time

399
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,360
so i guess the question i'd love to know

400
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,600
then is what project or what strain was

401
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,600
it that really got you involved in it

402
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,920
because it sounds like mad kind of had

403
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
the the reigns of the

404
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,838
the chariot up until this point like at

405
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
what point did you really kind of become

406
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,600
like a 50 50 in the partnership which we

407
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,319
know now

408
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,839
oh my gosh oh that's a crazy story

409
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,639
actually um

410
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,160
well

411
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,320
because i don't i don't have a full-time

412
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,799
job anymore but at the time i was

413
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,040
working a full-time job one that was

414
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,399
extremely stressful oh i don't even know

415
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:37,278
how i did it

416
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:41,039
um but i was a manager in retail and um

417
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:43,600
i was on a just a short vacation just i

418
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,879
took a couple of day vacation i want to

419
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,278
say maybe

420
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,600
two days backed with uh two more days to

421
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,799
get like a total of a week long

422
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,440
and uh we had gone out to dinner

423
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,240
and come home and mad was out back with

424
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,639
our dog playing with him

425
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,198
and just one of those things he pulled

426
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,000
something we think not sure but you know

427
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,879
he has a long uh history with health

428
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,198
problems with his lupus and whatnot

429
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,519
and he started to not feel good

430
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,319
instantly after this

431
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,720
and i knew he was sick but i wasn't

432
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,639
exactly sure what was going on long

433
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,120
story short short he ended up having to

434
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,959
go to the emergency room he was in

435
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,839
really bad shape

436
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,518
and they admitted him pretty quickly

437
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,360
they had a lot of specialists come in

438
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,839
and they ended up having to do like an

439
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,399
emergency surgery on him

440
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,040
they opened him up and had to figure out

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,799
what was going on with him and they even

442
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,319
at the time had told us that he was

443
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,799
likely to die

444
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,839
they had had us call in all of the

445
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,799
family and do that whole bit

446
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,959
and he was in extremely bad shape

447
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,639
and we had um an entire set of plants

448
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,919
full-blown flower

449
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,720
needing care

450
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,479
and i didn't have a choice but to do it

451
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,480
and it wasn't really my thing like i

452
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,838
said i was stressed i worked a full-time

453
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,160
job and we have a daughter of course and

454
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,599
i i would help him you know on anything

455
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,798
that he needed

456
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,318
but at this particular time um i just

457
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,240
didn't have a choice he was in the

458
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,078
hospital and he couldn't do anything

459
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,078
about it and he ended up being in there

460
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,359
for like almost a month

461
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:28,798
so i had no choice but to care for

462
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,759
everything we had um running at the time

463
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,679
and

464
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,839
i kind of uh with my personality just

465
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,679
adopted um

466
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,439
i don't know i i kind of like to have

467
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,000
control so

468
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,120
once he got home i had a hard time

469
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,839
giving back giving him back his space i

470
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,359
just i wanted to be in there i i felt

471
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,798
like i needed to have input on

472
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,519
everything which i'm sure just annoyed

473
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:56,240
him to no end because he's thinking

474
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,918
you're telling me what to do and this is

475
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,720
my space you've

476
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,799
cared for for a month but yeah it's like

477
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,240
i just really enjoyed it i found that i

478
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,639
liked it more than i thought and

479
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,279
eventually like work started to stress

480
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,600
me out to the point where um i just

481
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,279
between that and with mad's health it

482
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,678
was so bad

483
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,678
it was just easier if i were home to

484
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,400
help him with what he needed help with

485
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,798
and

486
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,360
i it made me just a better all-around

487
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:28,160
mom to be home instead of giving my time

488
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,798
to a full-time position that i wasn't

489
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,720
able to really keep up and

490
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,798
so helping him with the plants that's

491
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,038
how i ended up getting thrown into it is

492
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,200
how it happened i got thrown into it and

493
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,359
didn't have a choice and

494
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,319
lucky for me he's um

495
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,719
he's a wicked record keeper and he has

496
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,439
stacks and stacks of books with dates

497
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,679
and

498
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,000
every day he does something he writes

499
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,320
notes and he gives a solid explanation

500
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,798
for why he does what he does and that's

501
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,879
how i learned and um

502
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,359
once he got out of the hospital he

503
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,240
obviously needed my help for

504
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,879
a while afterwards just his recovery

505
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,359
alone was like a solid year

506
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,679
um but yeah he

507
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,599
just over the time taught me and i've

508
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,480
taken over small things here and there

509
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,959
like

510
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,798
i am insisting i do all of our cuts i

511
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,200
just have a

512
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,200
preference and i am i'm a con i'm a

513
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
control freak so

514
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,480
i like

515
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,519
to have control of things

516
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,200
that's how i ended up doing what i do

517
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,720
yeah no i can i can see where you're

518
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,400
coming from so what was the first strain

519
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,919
that you were involved in the creation

520
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,440
of because i guess i'm kind of wondering

521
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,360
was this all happening before the

522
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,960
creation of say the tripoli wicked or

523
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,399
was it after that just as a general

524
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,440
timeline

525
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,200
uh you know i've always had some kind of

526
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,480
some type of influence um

527
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,880
uh what i you know when we when we when

528
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,360
we decided like when we started breeding

529
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,280
um initially it wasn't even about like

530
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,279
breeding for anybody we were doing it

531
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,158
really for ourselves and

532
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,798
like i said mad had like this interest

533
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,159
in the comparison of

534
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,400
you know what are the true differences

535
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,520
between urkel and lavender can you see

536
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,640
it in their offspring and so yeah like

537
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,879
this was his

538
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,559
project that he took on and

539
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,880
that's where it started but you have to

540
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,639
remember like i was his

541
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,280
the person that gets to sit there while

542
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,240
he bounces all these crazy ideas off of

543
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,558
so i'm always present listening to you

544
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,400
know what he thinks we should do

545
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:35,759
and then of course he always asks my

546
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,038
input

547
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,879
um

548
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,839
i had i i think that the tdub and the pj

549
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,880
lines particularly are his babies but

550
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,918
for me

551
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,240
my one of my most hands-on i would say

552
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,840
is probably our clementine selection the

553
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,400
clementine male

554
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,720
that one for me was definitely my baby

555
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,640
because originally he had no interest in

556
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,960
it and he wanted to kill it

557
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,360
and i just insisted no that he was

558
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
definitely a keeper and i just

559
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,199
there was just something about him he

560
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,759
was amazing and he ended up becoming a

561
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,240
really solid project

562
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,440
and so that's one that i would say is

563
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,640
pretty much

564
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,480
more mine i'd say than his

565
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,400
that's a really good point for us to

566
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
jump off on because

567
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
one of the questions we had submitted by

568
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
our patreon fans was

569
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,880
why is

570
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,798
uh the urkel cross clementine called mrs

571
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,640
mads bubba is it like for example

572
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,639
because you think it it's like a good

573
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,280
representation of barbara in seed form

574
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,640
or is it like what's the back story

575
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,918
well

576
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,720
i okay so first off never was really a

577
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,480
fan of naming strains just to kind of

578
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,038
put that out there

579
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,759
never thought i'd do it honestly swore i

580
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,679
never would but the time came and we had

581
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,558
to obviously start naming things so we

582
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,280
did

583
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,839
that's actually not as easy as you think

584
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:04,558
um i i don't i don't really particularly

585
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:07,359
like it but with that strain um

586
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,839
like i was saying california

587
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:13,839
for us particularly we started with the

588
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:16,240
prop 215 and when back when we had a

589
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,480
bunch of dispensaries you know open up

590
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,079
and down the coastline

591
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,079
um and

592
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,038
one of a really one of the common cuts

593
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,199
that was always floating around was

594
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,440
the bubba kush and

595
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,840
when we started searching through when

596
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,600
we were doing our own um searching and

597
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,000
testing of the

598
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,558
these particular beans we had noticed

599
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,558
that in this particular

600
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,399
this particular strain the

601
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,558
urkel by clementine

602
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
it was showing

603
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,319
tendencies and a

604
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,720
physical appearance that did it looked a

605
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,319
lot like the bubba kush and i honestly

606
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
thought that it was even had a little

607
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,079
bit more of a better flavor

608
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,080
um

609
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,359
i would say probably because of our

610
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,199
urkel

611
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,839
um but that's actually where it came

612
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,798
from plus the need obviously

613
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,279
to name strains but that's just how it

614
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,038
does it comes about in that way we

615
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,519
when you're when you're growing them

616
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,839
you're looking at all of um the traits

617
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,839
that they express and that that

618
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,439
particular strain

619
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:24,158
showed a lot of um just it looked like a

620
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,320
bubba kush and um

621
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,720
i don't know i kind of thought it it was

622
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,439
a bit better myself but you know i'm

623
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,960
good that's a biased opinion of course

624
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,960
and so how do you feel about the

625
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,038
original bubba are you just not like the

626
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,720
biggest fan or

627
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:43,200
no no i liked it um

628
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,038
you know we obviously don't don't have

629
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,200
it but um no i i obviously i did i liked

630
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,079
it or i wouldn't have

631
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,558
looked to try and make something that

632
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,119
you know resembled in some way shape or

633
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,240
form or was like my spin-off version of

634
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,558
that

635
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,480
that's like basically you know what

636
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,720
we're we're always trying to do we're

637
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,240
always trying to

638
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,440
put something out we're always looking

639
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,440
to do something better hopefully

640
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,200
yeah of course and so

641
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,519
do you like to approach a project with

642
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,960
a very kind of pre-conceptualized idea

643
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:21,440
of what you're trying to do or are you

644
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,360
more so happy to just kind of you know

645
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
trial things out and if something hits a

646
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,798
winner you're like great let's pursue

647
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,640
that

648
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,319
well i i don't know i think there's a

649
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,960
kind of a fair amount of both really um

650
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:37,439
we could sit and talk you know plans all

651
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,159
night long um

652
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,000
and we actually do we will sit i tell

653
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,240
them this is another reason why we're

654
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,400
like the house of notebooks because we

655
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,278
will sit and try to write things down

656
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,440
and you jot your ideas down because as

657
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,119
fast as they come you also lose them if

658
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,480
you don't you know write them down

659
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,798
somewhere but

660
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,558
we do we talk about what we think would

661
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,558
match up well

662
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,038
we think about what we would like to

663
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,678
maybe hunt for say male

664
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,278
and in the future or maybe like what

665
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,200
what we're looking for both male and

666
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,798
female and what do we want to like hunt

667
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,360
and we're always hunting we're always um

668
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,119
testing something uh that we're not

669
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,359
growing something without you know we're

670
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:23,439
always looking through something but

671
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:25,359
yeah we're always keeping in mind um

672
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,798
we're always looking to make

673
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,359
you know what what's the next strain

674
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,839
that we can possibly make what would be

675
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,918
good pairing up and always looking to

676
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:37,678
make something better there's no point

677
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,559
in doing it if you're not otherwise

678
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,559
so

679
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,000
a question i love to ask people you

680
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,480
mentioned you know you're always looking

681
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,880
to pop new things find new things what's

682
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,480
the next thing you're most excited or

683
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,480
going to pop to look through

684
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,639
well

685
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,640
um

686
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,720
gosh she i don't i'm not really sure um

687
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,240
i know

688
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,919
i don't see i'm not i don't know how

689
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,120
much i can say i got to be kind of

690
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,200
careful here because i don't like to

691
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,918
give away too much um

692
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,440
i know we're gonna start looking through

693
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,038
our t-dub

694
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,840
uh we're gonna start

695
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,519
narrowing down some selection there

696
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,119
as i said i think i saw from maybe it

697
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,879
was you or maybe it was mad that yeah

698
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:23,839
there's gonna be like a filial release

699
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,400
of pure t-dope

700
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,079
he's got something he's got something in

701
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,320
mind um

702
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,439
like i said he bounces ideas off me all

703
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,678
the time but yeah his he he's talking

704
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,400
about his next angle he wants to really

705
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,000
dig deep in the tdub so

706
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,159
um that's where he's going um

707
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,038
i don't know like i said we talk we talk

708
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,278
ideas all the time and we do have a new

709
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,879
female well we have two

710
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,400
two relatively new females in our

711
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,799
collection

712
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,640
the hogs breath which we were gifted by

713
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,158
the hogs breath family they are amazing

714
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,679
people by the way

715
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,000
um they gifted us that female and

716
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,000
we are for sure going to take it to our

717
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,640
clementine mail i think that will make

718
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,599
for something amazing for sure

719
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,440
um so we have that project at some point

720
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,278
in the works there's that's nothing too

721
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,640
secret everybody pretty much knows about

722
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,960
that one

723
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,360
um and then we did we scored a new

724
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,960
female

725
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:28,639
uh the sr-71 i can't wait to see you

726
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,519
know what she has to offer but again yes

727
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,919
another known kind of purple strain so

728
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,200
that's purple kush isn't it uh-huh yes

729
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,640
it is

730
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,519
uh matt and i were talking about this

731
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,278
just last night um you know how there's

732
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,038
some things that him and i have grown

733
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,720
before and we've really held on to

734
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:48,158
things for a long time

735
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,960
there was um i want to say we we had a

736
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,440
celine for the longest time we had her

737
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,200
for like six years and

738
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,759
we just eventually

739
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,399
uh cut her loose but she was really nice

740
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,960
it's just it takes a lot to

741
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,719
to say you're a solid keeper and can

742
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,399
stay in our garden for that long you

743
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,360
know

744
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:12,398
so outside of lavender and urkel what

745
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,278
has stayed in the garden for that long

746
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:15,359
hmm

747
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,359
well we've got

748
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,079
scdc would be like a close second or

749
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,119
third and then we've got our clementine

750
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,199
um

751
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,038
and that's another thing too we will be

752
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,038
digging through our clementine lines

753
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,720
because we have f

754
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:33,119
we've got a knight we have f2 f3 and f4

755
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,278
stock of our clementines just sitting

756
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,879
the the threes we've dug through a bit

757
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,720
but the f4s are the ones that i'm the

758
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,960
most interested in so those are ones i'd

759
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,480
like to make a project of

760
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,720
soon but that's another one that's been

761
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,640
in our garden for a while um our

762
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,000
clementine

763
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,399
um but clementine sedc i don't really

764
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
know um

765
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,239
how long like the i'm not really even

766
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,319
sure how long the oracle and lavender

767
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,919
have been in our garden exactly i just

768
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,240
know

769
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,038
they've been in our garden since pretty

770
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,120
much since madd got real serious about

771
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,278
growing and

772
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,798
um he you know he knew he wasn't gonna

773
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,679
let him go

774
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,119
but the sedc was the one i want to say

775
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,679
he acquired

776
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,519
around that same same same time shortly

777
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,000
after and then the clementine also we've

778
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,599
had for quite some time

779
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,599
oh northern lights too i don't know why

780
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,359
i forget her we've had her for a long

781
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,839
time i want to say maybe

782
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,918
six or seven years possibly

783
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,240
somewhere around that

784
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,120
and do you know where she comes from at

785
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,679
all

786
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,519
like your one

787
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,880
um

788
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,960
i don't

789
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,520
yeah he was gifted the northern lights

790
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,600
was gifted to us by

791
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:51,599
a friend um of mads and i don't know

792
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,359
like what of that

793
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,158
i don't know what of that he has said i

794
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,839
guess i should have asked him that um

795
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,039
um he could tell you more on that

796
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,759
because that was something that he

797
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,960
actually had to direct

798
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,798
it was a cut that was gifted to us from

799
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
a gentleman he met

800
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:12,079
um on one of the

801
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,519
boards way back

802
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,240
um but like i said we've had it for

803
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,240
about six or seven years but

804
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,679
i i honestly can't even remember his

805
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,558
name

806
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,120
i would have to ask matt on that one

807
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,918
and so what are some tips or tricks you

808
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,918
might have to just kind of keep plants

809
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,360
healthy over the long term in the way

810
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,600
you guys have with these cuts we're

811
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:37,759
talking about

812
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:39,599
um cleanliness is probably the

813
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,278
the biggest thing that in your space

814
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:42,558
cleanliness is the biggest thing that

815
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,880
you could do

816
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:48,240
no matter what cleanliness is the

817
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,640
most important for healthy plants um

818
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,440
air flow is also

819
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,759
just

820
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,600
small things um common sense with the

821
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,000
garden seriously

822
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,199
you'd be surprised apply common sense to

823
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,200
everything you do with the plant and

824
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,960
you'll keep it alive it doesn't really

825
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,798
take that much

826
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,399
um

827
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:11,679
but yeah we try to keep um we try to

828
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:14,558
keep it as organic as possible

829
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,919
mad mixes it up quite a bit when he's um

830
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,918
in flower

831
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,960
he's like a little scientist in there

832
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,080
but as far as me when i'm anything in

833
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,679
veg

834
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,558
and our mothers

835
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,880
or

836
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,319
our fathers i should say

837
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,799
um

838
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,038
just i do i like to keep them as healthy

839
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,038
as possible

840
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,558
um

841
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:44,480
just

842
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:45,759
control any obviously a a clean area and

843
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,440
keeping your

844
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:51,759
bugs gone or out under control um

845
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,679
cleanliness controls all of that believe

846
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,599
it or not um

847
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,480
but it doesn't take much and like i said

848
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:01,918
we use really basic products two of

849
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,200
my staples would be like dirt md and um

850
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,159
sea crop use those religiously micro md

851
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,640
love those products

852
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:15,480
and so i think you just hinted do you

853
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,480
tend to more look after the fathers

854
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,839
um

855
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,798
well

856
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,959
i

857
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,599
look after pretty much anything that's

858
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,000
in anything that's in veg i

859
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:30,398
keep those going 24 7. um

860
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,679
but yeah i do i look after our fathers

861
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:33,439
too

862
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,600
do you what are like some tips for

863
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,759
maintaining dads because that that's a

864
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:40,558
that's a good question

865
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,240
yeah i know some people tend to i know

866
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,599
some people have issues trying to

867
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,200
maintain males i i don't i just um i

868
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,000
find if i keep them you can keep them

869
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,558
cut back more which is nice um

870
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,359
i tend to keep them cut back and smaller

871
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,038
than i would females you can control

872
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,000
them more that way

873
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,359
and

874
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,159
one of the things that's really nice

875
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,798
for

876
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,039
like i was telling mad when if we're

877
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,960
gonna be running um

878
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,359
like a pollination

879
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,720
one of the things that i like to do is i

880
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,439
will

881
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,440
keep my like if i have a couple i always

882
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,840
they're always in the same space but i

883
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,080
always have at least three males at the

884
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:25,278
same time um

885
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,359
in any given space but what i like to do

886
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,398
is i won't cut on them if i know we're

887
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,079
going to be pollinating and the reason i

888
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,839
won't cut on them is because they will

889
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,678
actually compete with each other and

890
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,678
they'll force each other to like throw

891
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,278
pollen faster and more pollen too which

892
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,798
is really nice

893
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,640
so if we're getting ready to do

894
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,240
something like that like we're gonna run

895
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,600
a pollination run i'll leave them in

896
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,278
there and i won't cut on them at all

897
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,038
during that time frame because then when

898
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,200
i do throw them in there

899
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:52,558
to throw pollen they seem to be a lot

900
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,159
they look like they're competitive

901
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,480
basically and they'll throw a lot more

902
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,240
pollen um and they'll produce faster

903
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,558
which is nice

904
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,480
and have you ever noticed any changes

905
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,359
over the long term to the males just

906
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,360
because

907
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,719
people sometimes say i mean so maybe

908
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,559
this is a bad question because i'm going

909
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,559
to completely contradict myself here but

910
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,559
people say when you um

911
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,320
maintain mothers in poor conditions you

912
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,639
know over time they deteriorate i'm

913
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,000
wondering if a certain similarity would

914
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,599
happen with males and how it would

915
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,119
manifest but i guess because you know

916
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,119
you maintain things nicely you probably

917
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,879
wouldn't see that anyway

918
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,240
yeah but you know what something like

919
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:27,838
you're saying you you wouldn't think

920
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,398
that but

921
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,159
i do i actually will i will put plans to

922
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,358
the paces i will stress them out like

923
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,519
you do

924
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:39,279
you would not believe i mean where they

925
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:41,358
look ugly and sad and completely unhappy

926
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,200
with me but i have to do that

927
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,319
it's something you have to do you've got

928
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,638
to know

929
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,879
you know what are their limitations what

930
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,440
do they like what are they tolerant to

931
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,118
how do they react when you do this um

932
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,079
it's something that i do i do i stress

933
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,160
them out i make them ugly but one of the

934
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,079
things too plants do they will i have

935
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,639
seen they will deteriorate especially if

936
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,560
they're not in like optimal conditions

937
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,639
but i've also found too that even though

938
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,039
they will do that i can turn that around

939
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,879
also so

940
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,719
you kind of have to stress them

941
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,160
you have to stress them to see

942
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,000
you know what they do when they're

943
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,239
stressed how they handle a stressful

944
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,519
situation so you have to do that you

945
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,039
have to introduce that kind of

946
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,440
environment to them

947
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,960
um but yeah the males do they

948
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,720
i don't know they

949
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,920
they have obviously differences because

950
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,199
it's a male plant versus female but

951
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,440
i don't know it's kind of common sense

952
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,879
you you can kind of just watch them and

953
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,920
you can learn from them as you watch

954
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,680
them grow

955
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,960
it's a pretty common sense basic thing

956
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,118
yeah

957
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,760
so i remember last time i spoke to mad

958
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,320
he said that you guys were running hydro

959
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,000
and organic and then like does that mean

960
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,640
you've got two different setups or like

961
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,519
you do like a hybrid type of thing

962
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,358
no from my understanding on that um yeah

963
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,800
i was wondering i was wondering about

964
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:02,960
that and my recollection of that was

965
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,720
he was referring to

966
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,639
um

967
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,078
because we're always in soil but he my

968
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,440
understanding was he was actually

969
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,599
referring to organics and synthetics

970
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,639
because he does he he does use some

971
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,160
synthetic nutrient lines um and i

972
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,199
believe that's what he was actually

973
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,319
referring to yes no weird synthetics not

974
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,199
hydrating

975
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,480
yeah

976
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:29,358
no yeah he does um

977
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,519
he does he does try um

978
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,480
he does try to keep it as organic as

979
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,719
possible and now um from when we first

980
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,519
really started heavily growing

981
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:43,358
it wasn't as easy organics weren't

982
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:45,440
as big of a thing there was a lot less

983
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,440
nutrients and there were a lot less

984
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,920
lines on the market back then

985
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,519
but now he has a lot more options

986
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,800
available and

987
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,639
we both we're always willing to try you

988
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,480
know something new you always have

989
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,519
somebody approaching you asking you if

990
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,480
you're interested in trying a product um

991
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,159
i'm always willing to try something new

992
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,838
i just don't like to

993
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,078
personally take taking a bunch of stuff

994
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:12,239
i know i won't be able to use or

995
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,880
i'm not going to have time to get to

996
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,239
but i am i i am always interested in

997
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,559
something new

998
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,519
i in our veg space

999
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,559
i always try to keep it um

1000
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,519
organic

1001
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,838
for me

1002
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,559
i find as long as i'm doing my

1003
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:31,199
transplanting like i should

1004
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,920
um i i rarely have to give them much of

1005
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:37,679
anything and like i said my staples are

1006
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,320
like pretty much uh dirt md micromd

1007
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,319
and um c crop and if i'm transplanting

1008
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,200
my plants appropriately and i'm

1009
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,280
maintaining everything the way i should

1010
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:49,118
that's pretty much all i have to do and

1011
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,119
then i throw it over and it's it's in

1012
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,119
mad's hands at that point

1013
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,680
i give him big healthy plants and then

1014
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,640
he gets to go from there

1015
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,078
nice and so do you ever like to do

1016
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,759
flower runs of your own or you're just

1017
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,960
happy with the end product you get

1018
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,680
already

1019
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,679
everything that we do we do as a team

1020
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:14,239
i'm super lucky i would say he is too

1021
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:16,879
um but everything we do we do as a team

1022
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:19,679
we do always have something going

1023
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,640
always there's never a time

1024
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:26,559
when there aren't plants growing in our

1025
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:28,000
space and um it's kind of funny because

1026
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,599
our daughter was

1027
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,559
in here the other day and she's like you

1028
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,280
know

1029
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,480
most people grow up on house plants

1030
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,920
me

1031
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,320
pot plants

1032
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,240
it's just kind of funny yeah

1033
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,760
you know she's she's been around them

1034
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,639
her whole life since the day she was

1035
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,079
born she's known the pot plant

1036
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,239
so it's kind of funny because like we

1037
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,920
too we grew up with house plants not pot

1038
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,279
plants but she's grown up with pot

1039
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,159
plants so

1040
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,160
i've had that that proper upbringing

1041
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,239
yeah proper upbringing but hey must be

1042
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,480
right because she's like uh she walks

1043
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,078
around carrying a 4.5 grade point

1044
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,960
average

1045
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,079
must be

1046
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,920
must be doing something pretty alright

1047
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,200
so something i was meant to ask you

1048
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,400
earlier but we'll just loop back on

1049
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,399
quickly

1050
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,000
i wanted to know so you you mentioned

1051
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,400
which stock you guys were interested to

1052
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,480
pop from yourself but this one could be

1053
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,639
real could be hypothetical

1054
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,480
if you had to or maybe you already are

1055
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,440
planning on it popping stock from

1056
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,760
another breeder who would it be

1057
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,679
oh my gosh dude that's a hard question

1058
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,160
and two i don't want to offend anybody

1059
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,239
but that is like such a massive list to

1060
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,559
choose from

1061
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,879
off the top of my head because this

1062
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,799
isn't off the top of my head sort of

1063
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,880
question here no one's going to hold you

1064
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,960
accountable don't worry no i know i'm

1065
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,320
i'm sure they'll all hate me in silence

1066
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,119
um no

1067
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,800
just

1068
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,760
with you asking that question in the

1069
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,839
moment i have a serious interest

1070
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,240
in obviously playing around with some of

1071
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:59,440
duke diamond's gear

1072
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:01,199
i just do can't help it but i do um

1073
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,440
uh one of our friends like i was saying

1074
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,679
earlier bang mingo he's one of my he's

1075
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,480
my go-to concentrates guy right now when

1076
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,559
i'm desperate he always hooks me up

1077
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,159
he's been growing some of duke diamond's

1078
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,440
gear and he's actually growing our gear

1079
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:16,239
in there too

1080
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,599
and his plants i mean everything coming

1081
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,159
out of uh

1082
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,960
duke stable is gorgeous so

1083
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,039
off the top of my head that's what comes

1084
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,800
to mind but um

1085
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,519
like i said i've been listening to a lot

1086
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,920
of your podcasts too and uh

1087
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,559
mr bob hemphill too he's

1088
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,559
got some very beautiful plants that he's

1089
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,279
working with there so i imagine he would

1090
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,559
have something of interest to

1091
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,160
um

1092
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,639
got to remember though we're always

1093
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,000
going to be limited to space

1094
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:47,279
um

1095
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,159
so

1096
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,960
anything that we pop it has to be worth

1097
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,639
our time you know it just has to be

1098
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,838
yeah well i mean those are two solid

1099
00:40:54,639 --> 00:41:00,239
choices i'm sure they but i also

1100
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,318
i also have some of yours i have some of

1101
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,358
your genetics too so

1102
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:05,199
i have a

1103
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,440
i want to know what

1104
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,358
out of everything you have if you could

1105
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,599
if you could out of everything you have

1106
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,880
if you could share one of your strains

1107
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,440
with everybody which strain would it be

1108
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,559
probably the licorice mama i think i

1109
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,200
sent you that one as well

1110
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,559
nice yeah i think and why this one in

1111
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,639
particular

1112
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,559
well it's like it's two strains i made

1113
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,480
so i'm super down with that um like

1114
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,318
crossed together to make that one so i

1115
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,159
can definitely get behind that one is

1116
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:36,880
like my own work more so than a lot of

1117
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,960
other ones but more importantly i was

1118
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,039
like super super disappointed with like

1119
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,880
the colorado durban and people because i

1120
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,480
love licorice and people always said

1121
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,119
that was like the licorice thing you

1122
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,039
know like the anisee type of thing and

1123
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,599
it just it just wasn't it was like it

1124
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,000
was just the most generic sweet smell

1125
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,720
i've ever had like i've literally

1126
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,159
bought um like shitty feminized seeds

1127
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,439
back when i was a noob and i didn't know

1128
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,639
what i was doing like not because i was

1129
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,079
buying feminized seeds but i was

1130
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,239
literally just on like you know the very

1131
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,240
beginning of my whole grow journey and

1132
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,159
you were learning yeah and some of those

1133
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,479
shitty feminized seeds i had had the

1134
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,960
exact same smell as the durban just this

1135
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,119
generic sweet smell and i just don't get

1136
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,519
how people can get licorice from that

1137
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,559
but i've created something that i feel

1138
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,480
is you know very liquoricy admittedly um

1139
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,920
you know it's it's got some gojiog in it

1140
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,199
which is australian that's also known to

1141
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,720
have a bit of licorice in there so i

1142
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,039
think it's obviously probably tapping

1143
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,799
back into that to a certain extent but

1144
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,480
yeah it's it's very much a licorice

1145
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,400
whereas the derby and i was like man

1146
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,400
anyone who says this is licorice has

1147
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,079
got quite an imagination

1148
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,280
are we talking like a black licorice

1149
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,800
though because i mean that's very

1150
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,800
difficult yeah black licorice yeah and

1151
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,160
that's what i wanted and that's and so

1152
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,160
that was why i was a bit let down with

1153
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,000
the durbin

1154
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,960
ah so that one would i would be

1155
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,400
interested to definitely look in that

1156
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,559
yeah i think it would be a good one to

1157
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,000
check out but um any of the raspberry

1158
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,759
mama ones are good and all the tests

1159
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,920
have come back like it seems to be quite

1160
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,760
dominant so you get a lot of raspberry

1161
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,760
in most things so

1162
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,240
in that regard i'd say look at the mum

1163
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,520
you like and go from there

1164
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,719
nice nice now i am curious about this

1165
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,119
because

1166
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:15,358
i know i've heard this question it when

1167
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,358
you're selecting for like a male your

1168
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,880
male selection is there something that

1169
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:23,119
you specifically look for

1170
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,599
yeah like traits well i'm like you i

1171
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,480
stress the hell out of it so it needs to

1172
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,599
survive the gauntlet for one but um i

1173
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,679
can't stand like auto flowering males um

1174
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,599
because i for a while i thought that was

1175
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:39,118
like the norm and then i realized i was

1176
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,119
just stressing everything too hard

1177
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,760
and so then i took a step back and i was

1178
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,920
like oh okay um

1179
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,839
but yeah there's a few little inside

1180
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,760
tricks like duke's sharing okay i'll

1181
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,159
share one here um which dude share with

1182
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,760
me i hope he doesn't mind when you when

1183
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,920
you get real serious you can start to do

1184
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,640
some crazy stuff you know you can

1185
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,639
get your mail you take clones of it so

1186
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,960
you've got you know backups and whatnot

1187
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,400
and you grow all your mails out to a

1188
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,720
certain size and then you um like you

1189
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,880
know get all tease the soil or whatever

1190
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,639
the medium is out and you can actually

1191
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,160
make judgments on it based on the size

1192
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,679
of the root ball and stuff like that

1193
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,879
which is not immediately apparent

1194
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:18,399
otherwise

1195
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,800
and that can be you know pretty

1196
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,318
indicative because on females like a lot

1197
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,920
of people think that yield is

1198
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:25,440
proportional to the number of nodes on

1199
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,440
the plant and that's not true at all

1200
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,480
it's totally proportional to the root

1201
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,039
mass

1202
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,199
in most cases and so

1203
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,880
yeah like having having a really solid

1204
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,799
root system is something i value on a

1205
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,160
male which i think people don't look at

1206
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,680
at all

1207
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,039
right

1208
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,399
yes that too

1209
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,239
that could be with

1210
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,160
i think too something people don't look

1211
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,479
at either is um

1212
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:52,399
you you know starting with or using just

1213
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,480
a more mature plant in general

1214
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,318
is in like the males more mature

1215
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,960
well female or male um just maturing it

1216
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,199
you know letting it grow letting it

1217
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,440
fill in its container just letting it

1218
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,078
really grow and express

1219
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,119
a lot of times people with females too

1220
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,680
they'll

1221
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,760
uh sex them and just straight throw them

1222
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,759
into flower we actually do we like to

1223
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,040
mature and we like our plants mature

1224
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,800
before we

1225
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:19,759
you know flower anything

1226
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,318
yeah

1227
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,839
you just get a better result much better

1228
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,519
yeah like when they're they're naturally

1229
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,480
kind of already transitioning to flower

1230
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,480
because they're that mature

1231
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,480
yeah it's just like um like him and matt

1232
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:33,679
and i were talking about this the other

1233
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,960
day

1234
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:38,000
who do you think is going to make a

1235
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,119
better mother a 15 year old girl

1236
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,318
or a 30 year old woman

1237
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,640
wait

1238
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:47,440
yeah i mean it's it's interesting to see

1239
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,039
i i cause a lot of people talk about

1240
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,200
like bob hempel will loop back to that

1241
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,880
for a second he talks about the the

1242
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,598
four-way and it kind of brings this

1243
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,400
point in mind like does a mother that's

1244
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,480
really old make worse offspring than the

1245
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,119
same cut when it was younger like does

1246
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,800
it affect the seeds

1247
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,800
you know i honestly i i don't know see i

1248
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,280
there's so many um

1249
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,720
there are so many aspects to which you

1250
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,680
have to consider

1251
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:14,399
you know

1252
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:16,480
from

1253
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,000
with each plant you know the growing

1254
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,960
conditions

1255
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,039
um was it stress did you use you know

1256
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,599
new things with it like there's so many

1257
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,519
different factors that can play into a

1258
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,160
plant doing different things it's so

1259
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:33,039
hard to pinpoint like you know to a

1260
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:34,960
scientific level what caused what so

1261
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,880
that's like tricky that's a really

1262
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,519
tricky question i don't

1263
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,000
i don't know but i do find that

1264
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,920
with us here we have lavender and urkel

1265
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,159
they're very old plants they're

1266
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,559
extremely old we've had them

1267
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,358
like i said i want to say around 2000 or

1268
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,000
so

1269
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,039
maybe longer maybe less i don't know

1270
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,119
like i said

1271
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,279
back then you didn't really keep

1272
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,599
dates on stuff you just kind of hung on

1273
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,160
to something but when those plants are

1274
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,400
really healthy they produce beautiful

1275
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,159
seeds so maybe it's just the factor of

1276
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,160
whether or not you're you have a healthy

1277
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,838
plant versus the age of the plant i

1278
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,440
don't

1279
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:13,519
know i think the the far better way to

1280
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,679
uh to phrase that question would be like

1281
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,000
deteriorate cuts because if if a cut has

1282
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,440
known to deteriorated and like it the

1283
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,440
bud you get it off at now is just

1284
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,440
nowhere near what it used to be when you

1285
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,440
make seeds with it at the offspring

1286
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,880
going to be similar to like you know

1287
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,039
they're going to have flavor profiles

1288
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,358
similar to the deteriorated version now

1289
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,440
or to when it was fresh and much more

1290
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,519
fuller and you know like its original

1291
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,039
self

1292
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,838
yeah i think that's a really good

1293
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,880
question and i wonder about that too i i

1294
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,679
don't i don't know for sure like i said

1295
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,519
there's so many factors

1296
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:48,719
that go into

1297
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:50,079
um

1298
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,639
well

1299
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,160
when you're making seeds for example

1300
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:55,920
there's so many things you'd have to

1301
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,239
look at um

1302
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,760
you know with that particular grow

1303
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:01,838
that is a really good question have you

1304
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,200
noticed anything in particular with your

1305
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:06,558
testing

1306
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:09,439
no i mean i the uh the i lost the oldest

1307
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:12,079
cut i had not too long ago sadly but um

1308
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,159
oh it's i mean but even then it was only

1309
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,440
like three and a half almost four years

1310
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,078
i think no i think it was about three

1311
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,280
and a half but um so i don't know if

1312
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,559
that's really

1313
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,240
old enough for stuff to really

1314
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,640
deteriorate maybe it just means i've

1315
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,318
taken care of it well so to speak but

1316
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,719
yeah not not in that period of time

1317
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:31,519
unfortunately i haven't noticed anything

1318
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:34,480
yeah i mean there are times where um i

1319
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,318
even mad and i have talked uh

1320
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,639
well we're we'll complete a grow and

1321
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:41,119
we'll be like we'll we'll ask each other

1322
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,118
do you think maybe this is showing signs

1323
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,640
like it has degraded at all

1324
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,480
as far as like the flower the finished

1325
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,039
product and there are times where we

1326
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,199
will think yep it is it's just old and

1327
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,358
then you'll have your next run and

1328
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,118
you'll be like nope she's every bit as

1329
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,440
impressive so

1330
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,480
sometimes i i wonder if it's a per

1331
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,880
strain thing it could be um based off of

1332
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,760
that particular run you had

1333
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,559
like i said there's so many factors um

1334
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,920
but i haven't us here have we haven't

1335
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,559
had any

1336
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,119
particular experience where i would say

1337
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,880
you know we've ran we've we've created

1338
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,640
seeds with like our older cuts which we

1339
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,039
have both the oracle and lavender even

1340
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:23,519
the scdc she's older now too

1341
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,318
most of our stuff is older at this point

1342
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:25,440
um

1343
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:26,800
but

1344
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,519
as far as like

1345
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,519
how the seeds are created um are certain

1346
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,679
things that i have picked up on that are

1347
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,159
different from plant to plant

1348
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:39,118
but i haven't actually noticed anything

1349
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:41,358
as far as like a degradation handed down

1350
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,519
in like the offspring to the seeds

1351
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:46,159
nothing like that

1352
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:48,079
but i did notice uh as far as breeding

1353
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,519
goes with our our clementine the

1354
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,400
clementine line

1355
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:55,599
um whenever we make seeds the clementine

1356
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,920
seeds they come out every time almost

1357
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,920
without any stripes they're just almost

1358
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,519
like little blondies is what i would

1359
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,760
call them little blondie seeds and

1360
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,920
they're even kind of have a good shape

1361
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,640
to them but they're

1362
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,559
always super viable they pop instantly

1363
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,199
they're fast and they're just really

1364
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,200
strange looking seeds but they

1365
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,118
uh you never worry about them because

1366
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,919
they always pop and they're really fast

1367
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,039
to pop but they just look so different

1368
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:26,800
so different than the rest

1369
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,920
so what are your tips for picking a mail

1370
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,119
oh

1371
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,760
um i it depends on um

1372
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,680
it depends on the the strain to start

1373
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,240
with um

1374
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:40,000
for me i like to see a good

1375
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,039
i like to see consistently what the

1376
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,039
females look like um so we'll start

1377
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:46,400
there first um i want to know what the

1378
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,159
females

1379
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,838
of that line come out looking like

1380
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,719
before i would even consider whether i

1381
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:55,759
want to even look at a male

1382
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,358
um if matt and i are um going through

1383
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,480
say a particular strain and we're

1384
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:03,440
testing and we find um really worthy

1385
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,800
keepers uh within those beans then we

1386
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,559
would consider

1387
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,839
maybe a male and that would be worth

1388
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:12,720
looking for um so at that point maybe we

1389
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:15,039
would and um structurally like with our

1390
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,318
clementine male when i chose that male i

1391
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:17,759
chose him

1392
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,679
because he

1393
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,880
came out and he actually looked like

1394
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,799
what you would

1395
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,318
attribute to a female plant his

1396
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,640
structure was just super squatty

1397
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:32,000
he didn't have hardly any node spacing

1398
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:35,199
and i just loved him he was pretty and

1399
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,440
he had just such a deep dark green to

1400
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:40,399
his leaves he's just a beautiful

1401
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:43,358
plant and i just really liked him

1402
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,400
so for him i liked his structure

1403
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:47,358
um

1404
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,720
but with our pj mail he's a little bit

1405
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:53,519
different he also has um he resembles

1406
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:56,239
the appearance of a female plant

1407
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,239
but of like the pj female so

1408
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:00,318
um there's more a lot more node spacing

1409
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:02,879
than say with the clementine male way

1410
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,920
more nodes spacing on the pj mail

1411
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,680
um but really with this one he's got a

1412
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,200
instant smell

1413
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,639
develop

1414
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:14,639
developing resins to them already

1415
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,799
just unique colors running all up and

1416
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:17,679
down the stems and the pedials of the

1417
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,079
plant

1418
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:23,919
so him it was just about that he had a

1419
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:26,240
smell and structurally he he resembled

1420
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,720
pretty identically a female that was a

1421
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,879
keeper for us so that was kind of why we

1422
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,358
chose him

1423
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,400
and those seeds themselves were they

1424
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,920
quite old when you pop them

1425
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,838
oh my gosh

1426
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,240
um if so

1427
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:46,799
what are germination tips you have

1428
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:49,759
oh my gosh um well on the the clementine

1429
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,519
male that one was hunted a while ago

1430
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,880
and i'm not really sure how old those

1431
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,880
beans were

1432
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,640
i'd i would i would have to ask mad but

1433
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,519
on the pj beans i'd say they were

1434
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,159
probably about eight years old i want to

1435
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,159
say maybe older that's getting on

1436
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,000
eight but um

1437
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:07,838
yeah they were a pain in the ass they

1438
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,838
didn't the pj beans didn't even want to

1439
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:11,920
pop for us we had a real hard time with

1440
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:13,920
them and i'm not a fan i honestly i

1441
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,159
struggle with the beans if they don't

1442
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,240
want to pop they just irritate me

1443
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,159
usually mad deals with the beans i do

1444
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,558
cuts

1445
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:25,358
they tend to agree with me more

1446
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,040
um but on the beans there's a couple of

1447
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,920
different things you know some people

1448
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:32,239
like to just so like soak them in a dark

1449
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,800
space in a cup see if they

1450
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:36,799
a tap root will show um

1451
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,920
some people like the whole paper towel

1452
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,079
method

1453
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,240
you know moisture and paper towel

1454
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,760
um we usually will use uh if we think

1455
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,479
they're gonna be a tough crack we'll

1456
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,440
usually soak them um it depends what

1457
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,440
your issue is um

1458
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,920
you can scuff them sometimes that helps

1459
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,119
them pop there's so many different

1460
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,960
things that you can try um

1461
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,039
there's the the

1462
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:05,440
brelic acid i haven't used it yet but um

1463
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,440
that's only because i haven't dealt with

1464
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,800
a bean yet that we couldn't eventually

1465
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,039
get open

1466
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,680
but i do have some

1467
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,358
um yeah usually you can

1468
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,078
usually you can help them along in some

1469
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:19,598
way shape or form so we haven't really

1470
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,400
encountered a problem to where we

1471
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,720
couldn't get at least um some beans from

1472
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,720
a strain to pop but

1473
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,199
the pjs were a little bit trickier but

1474
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:32,799
we obviously were still able to select

1475
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,519
from those which was good

1476
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,800
so

1477
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:36,639
i just wanted to loop back to one of

1478
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,480
your previous breeding projects i was

1479
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:40,480
interested in whatever happened to the

1480
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,760
space queen male you guys were using in

1481
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,760
the evil queen project

1482
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,200
um we killed him

1483
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,359
he just didn't make that oh he just

1484
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:54,960
didn't

1485
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,960
no we didn't um

1486
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:00,239
everybody really did people still ask us

1487
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,239
about that to this day we still even

1488
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,399
have some of the beans like if people

1489
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,558
ask i'll totally give them

1490
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,559
um we do have some and there is some

1491
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,680
really interesting things to be seen in

1492
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,040
there but

1493
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:15,759
mad mad and i both we hate anything that

1494
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,639
has any tendency to show instability we

1495
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,119
just

1496
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:21,118
it's you know nobody you just that's

1497
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,880
like the most dreaded thing when you're

1498
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,318
hunting through seeds and you're you

1499
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,240
know you have that feeling or you're

1500
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:27,679
concerned about finding something that's

1501
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,239
not stable

1502
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:32,480
so when it came to those it just we

1503
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:35,598
didn't trust them and it just left us

1504
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,559
uneasy and for that reason we knew we

1505
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,880
could find a much better male so we

1506
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,680
killed him

1507
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,960
yeah okay good answer

1508
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:48,639
and so

1509
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,679
i feel bad saying it but it's true yeah

1510
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,000
well i mean

1511
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,078
do you think it came from maybe more of

1512
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,838
the the chem side of the genetics or was

1513
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,839
it more the space queen side of things

1514
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:06,480
i i would say space queen side it had a

1515
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:08,960
oh it was a that was a stinky plant um

1516
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,880
and it also too it had that that that

1517
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,039
pineapple expression that was really

1518
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,798
like known to be on the space space

1519
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,798
queen side of things

1520
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:20,159
but like i said that one wasn't even one

1521
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:22,480
that really interested me uh that was

1522
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:24,318
that was one that was really more of

1523
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,000
mad's thing um

1524
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,599
back then

1525
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
when he had acquired the urkel and the

1526
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,599
lavender the reason why he even got into

1527
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,480
the whole space queen side of things is

1528
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,880
because

1529
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,559
he was really interested in proving that

1530
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,160
there is a difference between the urkel

1531
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,599
and lavender and he thought that that

1532
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,358
space queen

1533
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,200
uh male might be the way to go about

1534
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:46,159
doing that by showing the different

1535
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,358
expressions in the um

1536
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,679
you know in the

1537
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:51,119
in the seeds that we created from both

1538
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,358
parents

1539
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,200
uh so that was his main reason for that

1540
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:57,598
and then once he pretty much

1541
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,199
got the answer he was looking for

1542
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,119
and he was pretty much done with that

1543
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:02,960
mail we just decided to move on to

1544
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,119
something else and

1545
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,720
that's when we stepped into the tdub and

1546
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:10,720
the um the pj project originally

1547
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,399
so yeah we had just decided to move on

1548
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:14,159
to something so we wanted something

1549
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,318
obviously more stable is what we were

1550
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:17,598
looking for

1551
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,639
so

1552
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,039
in the past madd has hinted that he

1553
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:25,679
thinks tdub might have somehow found its

1554
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,440
way into the creation of tangi i've

1555
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,598
spoken to a few other people about these

1556
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,519
quite credible sources and they say

1557
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:34,160
they're not so sure that's the case what

1558
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,280
do you think on that one

1559
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,399
well

1560
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,559
um of course i have an opinion um i

1561
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,680
don't think i'll share

1562
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,519
um

1563
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:45,759
yeah i look i

1564
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,920
i gotta be honest um

1565
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,280
on this particular topic i kind of hate

1566
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,000
this topic

1567
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,119
um this was a topic that was actually

1568
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,119
brought to i'll say matt it was his

1569
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:00,880
brought to his attention by

1570
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,720
a few different people um very credible

1571
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,720
sources some breeders too in the

1572
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:07,439
industry um

1573
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,879
this wasn't something that was a thought

1574
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,280
of his this was something that was

1575
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,039
brought to him uh by outside sources

1576
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,040
originally so that's where this whole

1577
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,960
entire thing started up

1578
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:20,960
um up with to begin with um

1579
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:25,119
i think basically

1580
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:27,119
uh i like i have my opinion he has his

1581
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,318
other people have theirs

1582
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,440
basically

1583
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,079
him and i

1584
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,000
all that we ever ask of anybody is if

1585
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,160
anybody uses ours or anybody else's

1586
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,199
genetics for that matter or their

1587
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,199
strains

1588
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,838
i just ask that people are honest and

1589
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:44,399
say they say what they use and we try to

1590
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:45,838
live by that the best that we can too

1591
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,599
which is another reason why we don't

1592
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:49,679
work any we try not to really work

1593
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,720
anything outside because if you're only

1594
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:52,239
working

1595
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:54,639
what you have then you know you can

1596
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:56,959
trust it and you're not being dishonest

1597
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:59,118
about what you have um

1598
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,039
but as far as him

1599
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,640
you know kind of creating that topic

1600
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,279
that didn't come from him that was

1601
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:07,679
brought to him by other people

1602
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,079
um as far as his opinion on that i would

1603
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,519
i would i would much prefer you ask him

1604
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,000
about that

1605
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,000
um but we just don't like to start we're

1606
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,440
not looking to start any trouble in the

1607
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,199
industry for sure and um

1608
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,000
just basically i just think everybody

1609
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:25,838
could benefit from honesty and uh it

1610
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,159
would it would it's in the best interest

1611
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:30,558
too of the genetics too

1612
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,480
and everybody just being honest about

1613
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,000
what they're working and

1614
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,960
you know saying

1615
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,719
what it is is actually what it is

1616
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,960
that's all i really have to say on that

1617
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:44,318
okay and so just on a topic you

1618
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,119
mentioned then about like not really

1619
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:51,039
bringing in new stuff do you ever feel

1620
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,039
like it's self-limiting

1621
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,199
limiting maybe if um

1622
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,960
i guess if if our entire game plan was

1623
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,679
based off of just looking to pump out as

1624
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:08,240
many strains as we possibly could

1625
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,919
um if we were on the whole you know

1626
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:11,759
strain of the month

1627
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,720
what's everybody interested in in the

1628
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,040
moment

1629
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,959
yeah then i would say maybe so maybe we

1630
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:20,400
were limiting ourselves but i'd like to

1631
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:22,000
see more that we just have um

1632
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,680
some guidelines that we've set for

1633
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,119
ourselves it's kind of like a set of

1634
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:28,558
standards

1635
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,559
it kind of keeps us

1636
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,200
i don't know it keeps us kind of working

1637
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,798
staying away from what everybody else is

1638
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:35,919
doing

1639
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,599
um

1640
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,440
and you know at least we're working

1641
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,920
things that we have true confidence in

1642
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,880
is how we both look at it and we're not

1643
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,838
opposed to bringing

1644
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,039
bringing things in um it just has to be

1645
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:53,920
really worth bringing in to even

1646
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:55,920
bother i guess i would say so

1647
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,920
again like you you have to give up all

1648
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,200
your time and energy to keep these

1649
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,599
plants alive so it's really got to be

1650
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:06,000
worth giving your time and energy to to

1651
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,760
keep it alive in your stable so

1652
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,760
you know i would say we don't limit

1653
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,680
ourselves we just have really high

1654
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,599
standards

1655
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:15,519
and so like with that being said about

1656
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,359
the willingness to bring in something if

1657
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:19,039
it was worthy is there anything that's

1658
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,679
caught your eye and you're like oh that

1659
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:25,759
might be one of the things

1660
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:29,118
well i can't say a particular strain um

1661
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:31,040
like not not as a particular strain but

1662
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,599
i have told mad one of the things that i

1663
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:36,400
would like to really start looking for

1664
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,559
is a really good cbd strain

1665
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,240
um because for me

1666
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,280
i've actually been getting into some

1667
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:45,919
really awesome cbd concentrates lately

1668
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,160
and they work really good um i have

1669
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,119
fibromyalgia and it just really does it

1670
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,519
helps

1671
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,880
with all my aches and pains and just

1672
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,559
that overall

1673
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,000
shitty feeling that you can have

1674
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,400
throughout the day and it just works

1675
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,760
really good so as far as bringing in

1676
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,400
something new

1677
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,599
that's my personal interest i'm i want

1678
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,639
to find some like a really good cbd

1679
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,400
strain that i like

1680
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,000
so again if it's something that we're

1681
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,000
going to bring in it's got to be

1682
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,679
something that either he has an interest

1683
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,480
in or i have an interest in or it's

1684
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:20,078
going to benefit him and i in some way

1685
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,318
because that's like everything we work

1686
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,079
is based off of that to start with you

1687
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,480
know everything else is just like a a

1688
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:28,400
bonus i guess

1689
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,480
and so what would be one of the current

1690
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,519
males you'd love to cross to a cbd

1691
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,039
strain because that was one of the

1692
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,038
questions i had like what would be the

1693
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,720
first cbd offering you guys would want

1694
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,920
to do

1695
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:42,159
oh gosh um

1696
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,559
well i think for i think if you were to

1697
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:45,920
ask i'm just saying based off of my own

1698
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,280
personal experience but i think if you

1699
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,838
were to ask mad

1700
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,079
i think if him and i were to to have a

1701
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:53,759
discussion on we were to throw a mail in

1702
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,839
there that we have a lot of both have a

1703
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,119
lot of confidence in i would say we both

1704
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,719
have a lot of confidence in our

1705
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,960
clementine mail

1706
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:02,959
so i would say definitely can't go wrong

1707
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,440
there

1708
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,760
plus he's he seems to be doing pretty

1709
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,358
all right in um

1710
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,480
in all the other projects that we've

1711
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:12,480
used him in so far

1712
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:17,038
and so how do you like to test your new

1713
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,599
lines do you just like to you know pop

1714
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,119
10 seeds pop how many seeds you give

1715
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:24,000
some to your friends like what's your

1716
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,280
general kind of way of doing that

1717
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,039
well

1718
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:29,200
well we of course we like to grow

1719
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,119
everything we like to always test our

1720
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,439
own stuff

1721
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,000
it's really hard to try to form an

1722
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,519
opinion about a strain based off of just

1723
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,039
what you're seeing coming from other

1724
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:40,480
people

1725
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,960
we also though

1726
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,119
keep in mind we love to see

1727
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,880
other growers growing our genetics too

1728
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,200
because that gives you

1729
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,280
um some solid insight as to what the

1730
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:53,199
everyday person who grows your beans are

1731
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,359
going to get it you know what i mean it

1732
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:58,719
gives and it also gives that kind of

1733
01:03:55,358 --> 01:04:01,358
perspective to the to the public to see

1734
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:03,279
what you know a random person who buys

1735
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:04,798
your beans gets and this is what they

1736
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,119
were able to get when they popped your

1737
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,159
beans and they grow them so we also like

1738
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,240
that so

1739
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:11,038
we do put our beans out there

1740
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,959
um

1741
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,880
oh there's a lot of people who grow our

1742
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,000
genetics and we don't really know them

1743
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,200
um

1744
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,798
there's uh a lot of people who actually

1745
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,199
appear to rep us

1746
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,798
quite aggressively online and i do like

1747
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,798
to put out there like believe it or not

1748
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:28,239
we met them online we that's the only

1749
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:29,920
way we know them is because they've

1750
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,118
acquired our genetics which is really

1751
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,200
cool

1752
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:35,200
because all the representation of us is

1753
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:36,798
basically just what they have come

1754
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:38,480
across on their own

1755
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:40,400
so we do

1756
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,920
we both have tried to spend a little bit

1757
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,720
of time

1758
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,240
uh we asked that our growers you know

1759
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:48,000
tag us in

1760
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,959
like our own genetics that they've grown

1761
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,719
so we can repost them and show people

1762
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,480
like this is what the general public is

1763
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:56,639
also getting with our genetics so we

1764
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,760
find that to be helpful but

1765
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,239
we um

1766
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:04,160
we have uh some personal friends too we

1767
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:06,399
share with but we like to test all of

1768
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,798
our own stuff first first and foremost

1769
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,440
that's how we do it

1770
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,358
so just referencing social media i've

1771
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,920
noticed that since we first chatted to

1772
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:18,400
matt over a year ago your guys social

1773
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,000
media presence definitely ramped up was

1774
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,920
that intentional and do you think it's

1775
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,039
possible to survive without a strong

1776
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,519
social media presence as a breeder

1777
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:30,000
you know i do um i do think it's

1778
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:32,079
possible to survive without social media

1779
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,159
it's harder because a lot of people like

1780
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,599
to have that contact with you

1781
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:37,598
i think that's one of the things that

1782
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,838
matt offers that a lot of people don't

1783
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:42,318
um it's really cool he's will he'll

1784
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:46,159
he'll talk to anybody he and he tries to

1785
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:48,239
answer everybody uh in fact i personally

1786
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:51,440
i feel like people get more time from

1787
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:54,000
him than i do believe it or not

1788
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,079
he does i mean i honestly i have such

1789
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,639
respect for it because

1790
01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:00,400
a lot of um a lot of growers something

1791
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:01,920
that you know if you ever ask them

1792
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,480
they'll tell you

1793
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,559
they will message breeders over and over

1794
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,039
and over again and nobody will get back

1795
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:11,519
to him most of time they get blocked

1796
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,319
so i do i love the fact that mad will he

1797
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:14,239
will

1798
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,639
sit down and he will

1799
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:19,358
give lengthy responses he will answer

1800
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,598
anybody's questions um

1801
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:23,358
so i do i think that's awesome that he

1802
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,838
does that and i think that's one of the

1803
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,329
things that he does very different from

1804
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:29,519
a lot of other breeders out there um

1805
01:06:28,329 --> 01:06:32,078
[Music]

1806
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:34,798
just the fact that he allows access to

1807
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,798
himself i think is big

1808
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,880
but i do think you can survive without

1809
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:42,000
social media but it would be a whole lot

1810
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,000
harder i really do

1811
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:45,920
how do you feel about the way female

1812
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:49,519
growers and breeders are perceived

1813
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,519
within the industry in general

1814
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:54,239
um you know you don't actually see a lot

1815
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,639
of representation of women in the

1816
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:58,558
industry uh

1817
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,639
i think there's probably a whole lot

1818
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:03,599
more women growing

1819
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:05,118
women growers and breeding than than we

1820
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,240
know about

1821
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,519
and i

1822
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:09,038
don't wanna i don't wanna say something

1823
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:10,960
that's gonna be offensive but i think it

1824
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,960
has something to do with

1825
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,920
i think that there's a lot of obviously

1826
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,798
it's like a male dominated industry

1827
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,440
um

1828
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:21,199
but there's there's something uh about

1829
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,200
the way it's changed a little bit

1830
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,960
because of social media

1831
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:26,719
you have um

1832
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,039
i don't know it

1833
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:31,838
kind of like ordinary people feel more

1834
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:34,079
like um kind of like somebody famous i'd

1835
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:35,199
say and i think they really enjoy that

1836
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,440
attention

1837
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:39,279
and i think that um with the female

1838
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,280
growers you're not really going to see

1839
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,440
that as much i think they just kind of

1840
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,039
do their thing and

1841
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,318
i don't know i i i i you just don't see

1842
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,640
them out

1843
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:52,558
like that but when you do the only women

1844
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,159
you really see heavily in the industry

1845
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,880
are usually

1846
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,960
dressed up and you know

1847
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,039
meant to be handing out dabs in a tight

1848
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,480
tank top so

1849
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,720
and i don't think that's like a fair

1850
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,039
representation of women in the industry

1851
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:09,279
but that's basically what i've seen from

1852
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,599
my perspective

1853
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,680
one of the criticisms put forward that

1854
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,680
i've heard at least is that there's

1855
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:18,880
seemingly like a dichotomy within the

1856
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:21,358
mind of the average male smoker within

1857
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,640
the cannabis community in that

1858
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,920
uh you know

1859
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,159
a lot of guys

1860
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,158
within this criticism will supposedly be

1861
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,599
like yeah we want more female breeders

1862
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,278
that would be awesome you know i'd love

1863
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,400
female britain whatever like that whole

1864
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,960
type of thing

1865
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:37,039
but um but then as soon as a girl puts

1866
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,960
herself forward as maybe something like

1867
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:40,079
that the immediate assumption is oh

1868
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,000
you're just [ __ ] around in your

1869
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:43,920
boyfriend's grow

1870
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,119
yes yes yes

1871
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,119
do you feel like that's quite an

1872
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,198
accurate representation of the way women

1873
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:52,479
are met in the industry

1874
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:54,798
yeah i think um there's a lot of i think

1875
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:56,798
there's probably a lot of

1876
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,158
men in the industry that probably have

1877
01:08:56,798 --> 01:08:59,920
that perspective that they don't want to

1878
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:01,278
share this does that make sense i don't

1879
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,798
want to share this i don't want to share

1880
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,880
this with

1881
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:05,679
when i'm with women i don't know what it

1882
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,440
is

1883
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,838
men and women

1884
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,358
we think very different um it's not a

1885
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:13,359
knock i think that

1886
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,440
we work the way we work because this is

1887
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,440
how it this is the balance of things i

1888
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:18,960
really think that um

1889
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,798
but i think too

1890
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,560
when you've got something that they've

1891
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:24,640
started out with and they were used to

1892
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,679
it like being theirs i don't know that

1893
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:30,640
they're so confident or comfortable

1894
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:33,279
sharing that per se and let's face it

1895
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,079
you do not have to be a dude to grow

1896
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:38,239
good weed you just don't any think of it

1897
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:39,759
like this when like i was when i was a

1898
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,759
kid

1899
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,520
um all the men in my family were all

1900
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,000
either in the military or something most

1901
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,719
of them were away most of the time

1902
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,798
women they ran [ __ ] they ran the entire

1903
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,359
house they cooked dinners men went to

1904
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,920
work they came home at the end of the

1905
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:58,159
day they had dinner they went to bed and

1906
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,319
they did the work process all over the

1907
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:02,000
only time you saw them was on the

1908
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:03,679
weekends when they were doing a couple

1909
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,479
of things around the house but let's

1910
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:09,279
face it women ran stuff they cooked

1911
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:10,959
dinners my grandma she had two vegetable

1912
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:12,880
gardens in the backyard and my grandpa

1913
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,640
did tend to him on the weekend but my

1914
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,640
grandma ran stuff

1915
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:19,920
all the time you know it's like that's

1916
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,560
kind of i think we forget how much um

1917
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,119
hands-on women really do have just in

1918
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,280
everyday stuff all the time

1919
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:29,519
so i think they forget that

1920
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:31,519
yeah without a doubt and so

1921
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,360
this is maybe like a harder one to

1922
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,360
answer because it's just so blunt to the

1923
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:37,920
point but do you feel it's harder for

1924
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:40,559
women to gain recognition or respect

1925
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:43,199
within the general industry as it is

1926
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,960
yes i can tell you for a fact i know it

1927
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:47,119
is um

1928
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,960
uh prove a point

1929
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:51,920
um

1930
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,079
if you just to prove a point open up my

1931
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,679
instagram page and then open up mad's

1932
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:59,359
instagram page and look at our followers

1933
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,520
i'm just saying if something happened to

1934
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:03,039
mad all you guys would be [ __ ] because

1935
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,560
if you don't have contact with me how

1936
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:07,359
are you going to get our beans you know

1937
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,840
what i mean like seriously if something

1938
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:11,519
happens to him you guys need to be able

1939
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,079
to talk to me

1940
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,640
so yeah i i do see that i noticed that

1941
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,800
some some people have no problems but

1942
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:22,159
there's a lot there's like a a vast

1943
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:24,400
difference between um

1944
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:27,039
the people that view me and him as

1945
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:29,679
equals despite how many people he tells

1946
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:32,399
he's like i'm right by his side i

1947
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:34,880
every bit i need him as much as he needs

1948
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,960
me this is how we work together we're

1949
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,960
100 a team

1950
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:43,039
but you can see it like clearly um just

1951
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,960
in the respect that we're given not by

1952
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:46,640
everybody i'm not singling out everybody

1953
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,319
but you can clearly see it there is a

1954
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,280
difference

1955
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,039
yeah

1956
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:52,479
and so

1957
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,719
what i was just going to say was one of

1958
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,879
the the counter acting views that i had

1959
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,880
seen to this discussion was that

1960
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,880
as we mentioned earlier it could

1961
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,440
fundamentally also just be a little bit

1962
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,199
of a under representation problem

1963
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:07,359
um and what i think is meant by that is

1964
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:08,799
the fact like if you were to say for

1965
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:10,719
example look at

1966
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,880
how many male breeders there are and of

1967
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:15,039
those male breeders how many have gone

1968
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,400
on to become super successful not just

1969
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:18,399
in the fact that maybe they're known but

1970
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:19,920
they've actually got something which is

1971
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:22,158
really well regarded and it kind of

1972
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,560
stands the test of time or whatever

1973
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:26,479
right if you set the bar that high it's

1974
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,400
only actually you know like a you know

1975
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:29,519
maybe 20 30 people who really meet that

1976
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:31,198
criteria

1977
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,800
and so you kind of get what i mean when

1978
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:34,158
i say there's an under representation

1979
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,000
like maybe

1980
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,158
we just need more females contributing

1981
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
stuff and then we would easily see stuff

1982
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:41,759
rise to the top because it is the cream

1983
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,760
of the crop type of thing

1984
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,280
yeah i do think um

1985
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,000
i think that is

1986
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,759
that's actually probably um again that's

1987
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,679
one of those factors like i was just

1988
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,600
saying there's lots of factors that

1989
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,640
contribute to why things are the way

1990
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,400
they are and

1991
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,719
again you have to remember too the seed

1992
01:12:56,399 --> 01:12:59,759
industry the way it kind of started up

1993
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,679
was

1994
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,760
mainly because you had legalization

1995
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,960
popping up in the states you know here

1996
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,520
and there and you had people who were

1997
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,079
ordering seeds overseas and whatnot but

1998
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,880
that's kind of what started the market

1999
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:12,079
and

2000
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,719
um

2001
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:16,640
you don't it was guys it was it was the

2002
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,719
men in the industry that were doing it

2003
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:21,199
and a lot of it was again social media

2004
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:22,960
has really kind of uh kicked that into

2005
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:26,319
like a much higher gear

2006
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:28,239
and it was men that um it's the guys

2007
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:30,479
that were doing a lot of these little

2008
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,198
internet deals and trading and sharing

2009
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:33,678
and

2010
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,678
swapping genetics and that is what built

2011
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,520
this industry so at the same time i can

2012
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,920
understand that and that is why you

2013
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,239
probably don't see

2014
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,199
a lot of female faces

2015
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:47,279
you know behind genetics and breeding

2016
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:48,559
but i do think you will see more yeah

2017
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,559
like what i was just going to say with

2018
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,239
that being said you just recently

2019
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,000
partook in your first breeding panel

2020
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:55,678
over the weekend i believe

2021
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,600
yeah that was interesting that was

2022
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,319
really interesting so how did that go

2023
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,760
for you what was the experience like

2024
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,039
cold

2025
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,600
it was actually

2026
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:07,198
it was actually cold that day no it was

2027
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,360
nice um

2028
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:13,599
i got to meet two other ladies in the

2029
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:16,559
industry both very nice and smart ladies

2030
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,360
elena she's with the green fire genetics

2031
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,039
she's

2032
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:21,599
she's young

2033
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:24,000
um but she's really sweet she's really

2034
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,199
nice and she's coming up in the industry

2035
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,119
i

2036
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:29,519
i spent a little bit of time hanging out

2037
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,279
with her she's a really cool chick um

2038
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,440
people should check her out

2039
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:34,479
and then the other lady on the panel her

2040
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:37,198
name is

2041
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:40,079
gingerdewer now that lady right there is

2042
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:42,960
an amazing example for

2043
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:44,800
just growers honestly

2044
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,960
um

2045
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,560
have you have you looked into her at all

2046
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,079
did you happen to see anything i was

2047
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,440
about to say you sent me the name just

2048
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,238
earlier and i was gonna look into it but

2049
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,119
i haven't got a chance to just yet

2050
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:57,678
yeah

2051
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:59,760
um both of them

2052
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,119
um elena is

2053
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,960
more familiar with

2054
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:04,960
her yeah she's more into like our side

2055
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,920
of things you know like the

2056
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,000
you know

2057
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,719
breeding and whatnot and

2058
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,079
um ginger is has like this massive

2059
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,239
commercial

2060
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,399
background and she just has some of the

2061
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:18,799
coolest stories and

2062
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:19,839
seriously the knowledge in that girl's

2063
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,360
mind

2064
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,039
puts most of the people to shame um

2065
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:27,359
she's just

2066
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:28,960
she's an amazing example

2067
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,880
of a grower

2068
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:33,520
on so many levels like if you can track

2069
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:36,159
down an interview with a female

2070
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,920
she would be i'm mind blowing i i think

2071
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:40,399
it would be a killer interview to listen

2072
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:42,640
to and she has so much knowledge

2073
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:45,439
it honestly like i have a little bit of

2074
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,760
a crush on her i gotta be honest she's

2075
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:50,000
so just she's amazing she's a mother of

2076
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,079
five for starters

2077
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,760
um she's also like into painting and

2078
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:55,439
stuff i've done a little bit of like

2079
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,440
research on both of the ladies i thought

2080
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:58,158
they were both very nice and interesting

2081
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:01,198
but

2082
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:03,759
she's um got an agricultural background

2083
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:06,960
and she's been into like growing pot

2084
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:08,159
since a youngster so her story is really

2085
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,760
cool

2086
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:13,359
and she just the knowledge in her mind

2087
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,360
is just

2088
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:17,359
it's insane i think if you could track

2089
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:19,759
down an interview with somebody

2090
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:22,479
she would be a cool one to get

2091
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,520
i'll uh send her information

2092
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:25,919
yeah

2093
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,040
so i'm gonna stretch your mind back now

2094
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,719
to the emerald cup i asked madden smelly

2095
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:32,880
this question but i wasn't able to ask

2096
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,399
you in the interview did anyone bring

2097
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,279
you anything at the cup that you were

2098
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:37,279
really surprised by

2099
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,760
yeah actually um i do remember this

2100
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,760
question um

2101
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:48,479
i i got i'm gonna be honest here so

2102
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:51,279
first i'm going to say

2103
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,519
to have that much cannabis in that small

2104
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:57,279
of a space i would have honestly thought

2105
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:59,679
i would see a much higher grade and

2106
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,759
a wider range of really killer weed i

2107
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:03,119
really am surprised that i didn't

2108
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,119
however

2109
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:08,079
there were people that brought us some

2110
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,359
really killer examples um there were a

2111
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:10,479
lot of people who

2112
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,759
i don't want to sound i don't want to

2113
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:15,359
sound like that but i'm going to just

2114
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:16,960
say it a lot of people brought us um

2115
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:20,000
samples of

2116
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,000
our genetics so basically they had got

2117
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,399
our beans popped them grew them and

2118
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,719
brought us finished product and that was

2119
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:28,479
some of the most impressive that we did

2120
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:31,039
see um

2121
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:33,678
one other really kick-ass example of

2122
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:35,840
some solid smoke i not only saw but i

2123
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,480
was lucky enough to smoke um was from

2124
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,840
duke diamond and it was his um his

2125
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:43,119
lavender

2126
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:45,199
that was on point just saying that was

2127
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,319
really killer weed but there was there

2128
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:48,799
was um

2129
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:50,960
there was a a good five or six people

2130
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,880
that brought me in mad personal samples

2131
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,439
of their own grows and

2132
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,840
there was some really well-grown

2133
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:00,399
cannabis in there some outdoor indoor i

2134
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,279
mean just really nicely grown

2135
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:04,399
nice

2136
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:06,880
well done product but i was a little bit

2137
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:08,000
underwhelmed at how much cannabis was

2138
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,920
there

2139
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,359
considering there i i would have thought

2140
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,640
there would have been a much wider

2141
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:17,439
selection

2142
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,560
and a higher basically a better grade of

2143
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:20,639
cannabis

2144
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,360
just to be honest

2145
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,159
and so i i know that you're quite uh

2146
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:27,759
selective with what you smoke however if

2147
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:29,359
someone like you know whether it's

2148
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,679
they've grown it or whatever if you've

2149
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:34,079
got some stuff not grown by you but it's

2150
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,760
some stuff from your

2151
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:38,158
stable so to speak you know it's one of

2152
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,239
your guys creations does that kind of

2153
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:41,439
make you more open to trying it or it's

2154
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:43,359
still just like it just has to be

2155
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:45,839
growing well

2156
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:47,920
um no i'll if look if we're in a

2157
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:51,039
situation and somebody passes me a joint

2158
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,560
and it's lit i'm gonna smoke it

2159
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:55,119
i will hit it

2160
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,440
i'm gonna hit it dude i'm i'm a stoner

2161
01:18:55,119 --> 01:19:00,000
i'm just i'm being honest i'm gonna at

2162
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:01,678
least give it a shot you know um if it

2163
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,520
makes my throat burn and it makes me

2164
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,279
choke i'm less likely to take it back

2165
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,600
and hit it again so

2166
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:09,840
yeah i'm that diva like i will i'll i

2167
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,600
will bypass it but i'm always gonna at

2168
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,560
least give it a try

2169
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,560
um i mean unless i'm sick of course if

2170
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,679
i'm sick i'd probably just altogether

2171
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,840
pass but

2172
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:22,000
no i'm not like that i'm gonna if

2173
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,400
somebody tells me it's good i'm always

2174
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,319
going to give it a shot people

2175
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:28,079
people send us stuff and give us stuff

2176
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:30,079
all the time

2177
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,800
when we first really got into this one

2178
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:35,760
of the reasons why we ended up breeding

2179
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:38,000
cannabis seeds in the first place was

2180
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,079
i can't tell you we had what we felt

2181
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,439
like we had a few really solid keepers

2182
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,238
you know at the time i think we had

2183
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:45,839
urkel lavender and scdc were our main

2184
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,000
keepers and

2185
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,159
um every time somebody would come to us

2186
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,119
and tell us oh i got the best strain you

2187
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:55,279
got to try it it's so good so we would

2188
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:57,519
start there they'd give us some samples

2189
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:00,000
of some dry product and we'd smoke it

2190
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:02,560
always disappointed so then we're like

2191
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,158
maybe it's just needs to be grown proper

2192
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,560
so then we would go about it that way

2193
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:09,599
you acquire a cut or whatever seeds

2194
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:12,560
however grow it out finish it no it just

2195
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,639
wasn't uh no just wasn't wasn't good

2196
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,480
enough to be considered a keeper like in

2197
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:19,279
our stable and that is

2198
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:22,000
another reason as to why

2199
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:23,759
we do keep um i mean we have we have a

2200
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,238
lot of plants don't get me wrong but

2201
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,480
that's why you do see us work with a

2202
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:31,439
very limited selection because we have

2203
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:33,919
like a set standard that we go by

2204
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:35,519
and if it can't stay i mean if we can't

2205
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,359
hang on to it

2206
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,440
if it doesn't stay in there for at least

2207
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:41,679
four years we're probably not even gonna

2208
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:43,678
bother with it

2209
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,199
yeah okay

2210
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,880
you know

2211
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:48,559
and so

2212
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,359
what do you

2213
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,840
think is kind of your favorite aspect of

2214
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:53,839
breeding

2215
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:58,399
um

2216
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:00,479
i honestly enjoy just the selection

2217
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:02,960
process uh

2218
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:04,718
cannabis it's it's crazy because you

2219
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,079
never real you'd ever really know what

2220
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,319
you're gonna get you kind of just have

2221
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:11,039
to pop the beans and start looking

2222
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:12,880
and that's what's really cool um you put

2223
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:15,279
these two parents together and you might

2224
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:17,039
find like less variety

2225
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,479
amongst these beans while you put these

2226
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:20,880
other two parents together and you might

2227
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,238
have a lot of variety but the only way

2228
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,159
to know what you're going to get is to

2229
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:27,678
just grow them out and look and that's

2230
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:30,079
like one of my favorite parts is

2231
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:31,920
pop in the beans and then

2232
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:34,079
they're really not that fun until they

2233
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,920
get to a certain size for me but once

2234
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,079
they hit a certain age and then they

2235
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,679
start to mature and sexy and whatnot

2236
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:41,198
that's when they really become fun

2237
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:43,119
because they start to at least show you

2238
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:45,678
something

2239
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:48,559
i personally too

2240
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,760
as far as like selection and keepers and

2241
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,840
deciding

2242
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,520
i don't like to decide on necessarily a

2243
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,119
seedling i would prefer to make my

2244
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,679
decision on

2245
01:21:55,119 --> 01:22:01,359
a taken cut that we've grown multiple

2246
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:03,520
times to give it a fair representation

2247
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:05,679
because they always grow different as a

2248
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,679
cut always grows different

2249
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:09,199
than a seedling

2250
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,880
so that's kind of one of those things i

2251
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:12,158
like to do too

2252
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,840
it's interesting you mentioned that

2253
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:16,079
because i remember

2254
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,480
again looping back to the bob hempfield

2255
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:19,519
chat he he referenced that because we

2256
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:21,759
were talking about how you know like

2257
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,600
over long periods of time cuts degrades

2258
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,920
and he was saying yeah like how many

2259
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,360
times have you seen like a plant perform

2260
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,920
well on the first time and then it's

2261
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,759
just [ __ ] after and i actually thought

2262
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,960
about it over you know the period

2263
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,719
afterwards and i was like yeah actually

2264
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,439
i have seen that once or twice like you

2265
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:37,198
know

2266
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:38,479
and i i guess i i didn't really

2267
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,000
understand why it was happening at the

2268
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:41,198
time but i just figured like maybe i

2269
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,760
grew up well the first time and then

2270
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:45,119
just whatever afterwards but

2271
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,880
it's also interesting how there's the

2272
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:49,519
opposite to be said as well you know

2273
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:51,199
like how there's i've got more examples

2274
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,280
that come to mind of stuff that gets

2275
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:55,119
better you know like the older the clone

2276
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:57,599
is like i think it's a pretty widely

2277
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:59,679
held consensus that um the flowering

2278
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,239
time drops a bit you know once the clone

2279
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:04,079
gets like you know maybe a year or so

2280
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:05,678
old like it you know over the course of

2281
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,439
that time it drops a little bit like do

2282
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:08,880
you feel that's the case

2283
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:11,678
yeah i do

2284
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:14,639
yeah i mean it does it change it change

2285
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:16,880
by taking the cut and flowering out cuts

2286
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,719
you do have a more true example of what

2287
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,800
you're gonna get especially you have to

2288
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:22,319
look at it from the perspective of

2289
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,440
if you're flowering out your seedling

2290
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:25,279
and you're trying to make all your

2291
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:26,638
decisions based on what that seedling

2292
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:29,039
does you're not going to have a very

2293
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:31,440
good representation because the cut

2294
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:32,960
always it always behaves different it's

2295
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,960
more true to what you're going to get if

2296
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,239
you continue to continue to grow that

2297
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,920
cut you see what i'm saying because

2298
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:39,359
you're going to grow a cut so

2299
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,760
i just think you get a better

2300
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,759
representation by flowering your cuts

2301
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,679
than you do making a judgment call based

2302
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,719
off of your seedling

2303
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,480
and the cuts do i do find that they what

2304
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,399
they call it a little bit of a loss in

2305
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:53,919
hybrid vigor is what they that they

2306
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:57,119
would attribute it to

2307
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:59,840
um not all of them are that way but i do

2308
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:03,359
find um the cuts grow much more

2309
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:05,199
consistently so as far as structure i i

2310
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:07,519
much more prefer

2311
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:10,079
a cut because seedlings tend to grow

2312
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,840
kind of crazy in my opinion

2313
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,679
but i do think there's a bit of weight i

2314
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:16,639
do think you do suffer a bit of weight

2315
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:19,600
loss but you can make that up like i was

2316
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:21,119
saying earlier by just um like i said i

2317
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,520
like to have a more mature plant i

2318
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:25,679
prefer to flower a more mature plant an

2319
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,840
older plant one that's been

2320
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,679
kind of shaped and

2321
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,840
you know one that's basically been

2322
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:33,119
influenced by me for a set amount of

2323
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,400
time

2324
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:35,198
yeah totally

2325
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:37,359
so

2326
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,678
how does the growing trend within the

2327
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:41,439
california seed to the sorry the

2328
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:44,639
californian scene

2329
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:46,879
to grow from seed affect your breeding

2330
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,159
does that make you guys want to try to

2331
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,600
you know get something that's really

2332
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:51,759
vigorous out the gate or do you still

2333
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,079
think it's it's rather a small

2334
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,199
trend so to speak at the moment

2335
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:56,719
you know

2336
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,839
i i don't i don't know i don't want to

2337
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:01,840
sound like an [ __ ] but we don't

2338
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,400
we don't we're not aiming and everything

2339
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:07,279
that we do we're not we're not basing it

2340
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:10,079
on what you would say the market is

2341
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:12,800
asking for or what the general public is

2342
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,719
asking for and we're not we don't do

2343
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,320
that because there's plenty of people

2344
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,279
out there doing that

2345
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:20,238
um

2346
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:22,880
what we're trying to do was more um

2347
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:24,799
we got started for ourselves really just

2348
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,279
looking to make a real solid different

2349
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:30,400
forms of medications that can target

2350
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:32,158
different things about your illnesses

2351
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:34,000
some that are better for daytime some

2352
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:36,479
that are better for nighttime but

2353
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,880
something that you always have to go to

2354
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:41,279
that's always going to work so i i mean

2355
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,119
the basis behind why we do it is very

2356
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:44,158
different from why most people are

2357
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:46,960
breeding

2358
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:48,879
um cannabis seeds in the first place so

2359
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:51,760
yeah we're not really looking to just

2360
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,679
please like the marketplace um

2361
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,440
so i think that's different our

2362
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,000
priorities i guess are a little bit

2363
01:25:55,439 --> 01:26:00,238
different so maybe that's what it is

2364
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,359
but our main goal is always just

2365
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,879
basically

2366
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:07,279
really good solid medicine

2367
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:10,000
something that you can go back to

2368
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:11,039
hopefully year after year but will still

2369
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,520
offer you

2370
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:16,719
that solid medicinal value you hope it

2371
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,800
has but also stability because you can

2372
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,719
breed all the flavor you want but you

2373
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,079
got to have some kind of stability and

2374
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,679
that's what we're hoping for we're

2375
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:25,920
hoping to kind of just have an

2376
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:28,800
across-the-board

2377
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,560
awesome strains for people to have

2378
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,560
access to and hopefully not too

2379
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,480
expensive because you want everyone to

2380
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,560
have access to them too

2381
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:38,959
so we're aiming for stability

2382
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,440
good solid meds and something that you

2383
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,560
can turn to year after year so

2384
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:43,839
you know

2385
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,679
that's our goal

2386
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,920
so that brings up a good question

2387
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:49,119
submitted by another one of our patreon

2388
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,039
fans

2389
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:52,719
they say i'd love to know

2390
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:55,439
what uh

2391
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:57,600
what strains these breeders consider to

2392
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:59,359
be the most medicinal like what is a

2393
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,000
medicinal quality to you because

2394
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:04,960
obviously it's very subjective so yeah

2395
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,880
what to you is medicinal well i think it

2396
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,560
really depends on what your

2397
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,359
obviously would be symptoms that you're

2398
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,480
trying to target um

2399
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,319
for me

2400
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:16,638
i would say like if i'm gonna if i'm

2401
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:21,519
gonna grab any strain that we have in

2402
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:24,319
our in our arsenal to basically smoke

2403
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,520
to just overall take care of any issue i

2404
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:27,759
may have

2405
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,800
for what we have i would aim i would go

2406
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:33,840
for the lavender every single time

2407
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:36,719
um and the reason i say that is because

2408
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,319
that particular strain just gives you uh

2409
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,960
just an overall calming effect

2410
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:42,799
throughout your entire body head to toe

2411
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,639
and it just does something to like your

2412
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,960
stomach it just soothes it makes

2413
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:48,800
everything calm it has the ability to

2414
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,079
target migraine headaches so it's just

2415
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,920
overall

2416
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:55,519
a solid strain for your entire body so

2417
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,440
if you're not really like sure what

2418
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,440
you're aiming for if you're just trying

2419
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:01,678
to touch on different

2420
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:04,479
um symptoms that you may have for a

2421
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:06,000
range of ailments i would say lavender

2422
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:07,519
but you know your reasons might be

2423
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,840
different you might want something just

2424
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,520
to help um like you might want to take a

2425
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,360
couple hits and lay down and be able to

2426
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,440
go to sleep easy

2427
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:17,439
um i would you know every and everyone

2428
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:21,119
is different too so it's like a

2429
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:21,919
tolerance thing um our clementine

2430
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:23,039
it

2431
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,039
um

2432
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:27,039
if i haven't been smoking a whole lot

2433
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:29,039
and i smoked that that one can actually

2434
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:32,399
make me quite paranoid

2435
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:35,840
i mean like i'm not like really paranoid

2436
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:38,879
uh and makes me stupid just really

2437
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:41,279
i can't think i can't focus it's just

2438
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:43,119
makes me a mess so that's not a good one

2439
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:44,319
for me if i'm like feeling a little

2440
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:46,639
paranoid

2441
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,880
but everybody's different um i'd like to

2442
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:50,719
say that every strain we have offers

2443
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:54,000
some kind of medicinal value to it

2444
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,800
otherwise we wouldn't even have it

2445
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,520
so

2446
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,960
it kind of brings me to i mean not not

2447
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,960
the best segue but i'm just gonna run

2448
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,079
with it anyway in terms of your guys

2449
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:05,039
offerings

2450
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:07,679
are you gonna have a really wild sativa

2451
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,679
offering ever

2452
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,280
hopefully

2453
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,760
where would you even start like what

2454
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:17,039
type of genetics would you think about

2455
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,199
like you know do you have anything in

2456
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:20,479
the in the you know the treasure chest

2457
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:22,158
which might be able to fill that

2458
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:23,198
category or you'd have to find that

2459
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:26,079
first

2460
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:29,519
oh my god no we actually we do we have

2461
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:31,279
so many beans it's ridiculous like we

2462
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,360
have so much stuff

2463
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:36,559
it'll probably sit there forever and

2464
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:38,719
never get touched would be my guess um

2465
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,400
we have a lot of things we have a lot of

2466
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,679
stuff that we've even created that have

2467
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:44,319
never even

2468
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:46,158
seen the light of day um

2469
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:48,719
we've got stuff like that but we also

2470
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:50,799
have a lot um a pretty wide collection

2471
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:52,719
of beans that you know we back in the

2472
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,880
day we're collecting

2473
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,800
um you know kind of to touch on

2474
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,719
something that you brought up about

2475
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:02,079
limiting yourself or bringing things in

2476
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:05,600
from the outside um that kind of

2477
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:08,399
actually plays a role in why we do stay

2478
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:11,039
within a lot of our own lines because

2479
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:13,439
we did there was a point in time early

2480
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:16,000
on where we were we were searching beans

2481
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:18,559
all the time and that was the worst

2482
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
feeling ever is when you're going in

2483
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,639
there to check your plants that you need

2484
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,039
to be able to rely on and they are you

2485
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:26,079
know if they're freaking out because you

2486
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:28,800
popped

2487
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:31,198
genes that are just not stable and

2488
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,800
um that's what that's kind of where we

2489
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:35,119
came to the conclusion we were going to

2490
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:37,679
start creating our own

2491
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,279
genetics because it was becoming costly

2492
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,279
you're popping beans

2493
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:43,519
you're thinking you're getting one thing

2494
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:45,599
and you end up getting something i don't

2495
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,760
even know and usually it

2496
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,360
just the risk of pollinating other stuff

2497
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,880
in your room because you have a herme or

2498
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:54,719
a freak

2499
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:56,400
it just totally was off-putting and we

2500
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,079
decided that's when we would just start

2501
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:00,238
playing within our own lines and we've

2502
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:03,359
slowly expanded on top of that and like

2503
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:04,959
i said we do we bring things in and

2504
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:07,599
there's things that we do we don't

2505
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,039
openly talk about uh we learn that the

2506
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,079
hard way

2507
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:11,920
um

2508
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:14,800
but now we've got stuff to play with

2509
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:17,119
like i said we even our clementine

2510
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:20,880
that one in particular we have we've got

2511
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:24,479
f2s f3s and f4s just sitting

2512
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:26,079
um we've dug through the f2s and f3s a

2513
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,879
little bit but the f4s have been

2514
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:30,880
completely untouched so we have some of

2515
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:33,600
those to play around with if we wanted

2516
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,319
to but we also have some some blueberry

2517
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,039
lines um there's other things we just

2518
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:41,039
it's just all a matter of time and what

2519
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:42,719
project you actually want to work on at

2520
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:44,880
the time and what you have the time and

2521
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:47,679
space for

2522
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:50,319
yeah so i mean if we just touch back on

2523
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:52,158
that evil queen i mentioned before it

2524
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:54,158
had some chem genetics in it kim's

2525
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:55,920
obviously a pretty focal point of this

2526
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:58,559
show pops up a lot

2527
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:00,560
would you guys ever want to try to get

2528
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,080
it and use it like have you tried what

2529
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,480
you think was real chem and did you find

2530
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:05,679
it medicinal for example

2531
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:08,238
um

2532
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:10,079
well you know we actually

2533
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:12,879
that that the one that you're talking

2534
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:14,158
about it was uh i want to say it was the

2535
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,319
canton

2536
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:21,039
kim by kim by cindy 99 i want to say and

2537
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:23,920
we actually had that particular

2538
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:26,238
that female that keeper female we had we

2539
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,158
kept it for i want to say five or six

2540
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:30,879
years at the time

2541
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:33,599
um and don't get me wrong it visually

2542
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,199
speaking it was a keeper in so many

2543
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,639
people's gardens

2544
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:40,399
um and it like it was really uh it was

2545
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,960
really good for taking pictures of is

2546
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:45,198
beautiful and it had so many resins but

2547
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,119
the one thing that we both felt like it

2548
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:49,839
just kind of lacked for us was the

2549
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:53,279
flavor side of things um

2550
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:55,360
and we also too we just couldn't we we

2551
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:57,119
found we weren't able to incorporate it

2552
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:59,759
with anything that would

2553
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:01,760
um bring out that flavor but also offer

2554
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,440
that stability that we were looking for

2555
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,880
which is why we discontinued that

2556
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:07,039
particular

2557
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,800
um that keeper female that we were

2558
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:09,760
working with at the time

2559
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,560
but

2560
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:15,199
from that particular line

2561
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,679
we were gifted

2562
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:20,000
beans so we still have beans from that

2563
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:22,480
particular strain the

2564
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,960
the kim dog by cindy 99 so if we ever

2565
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:26,879
wanted to revisit we have we do have

2566
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,520
some things to work through

2567
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,440
um but like i said it's just really if

2568
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,040
it's not something i want to work or if

2569
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,879
it's not something mad wants to work

2570
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:37,840
it's just gonna sit there for a while

2571
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,639
and it's not going to get touched

2572
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,520
so

2573
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:43,760
the deep crippler is you know a line i

2574
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:46,000
don't think many people have heard about

2575
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,360
how come you guys haven't you know put

2576
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,800
it out there as much as the other stuff

2577
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:50,399
and do you plan to work it further

2578
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,320
forward

2579
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:54,479
you know um we actually have talked

2580
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:56,559
about that um

2581
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:58,238
everybody does everybody who has had

2582
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,920
contact with that particular strain

2583
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:02,000
really did like it

2584
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,880
um it never

2585
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,399
i don't know i didn't i didn't really

2586
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,719
have um

2587
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:09,920
a particular love for it

2588
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:13,840
um

2589
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:15,760
it just wasn't one that i don't know

2590
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,679
people love the scdc which would be the

2591
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,079
mother that we used at the time to

2592
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:22,639
create those seeds but um

2593
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:25,519
other than being super like beautiful in

2594
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:29,679
pictures and like uh just a mass resin

2595
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:32,719
producer like i don't i don't love her

2596
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:35,279
we keep her because mad loves her so

2597
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:38,158
she's not really my particular passion

2598
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:40,639
you know do you know who i felt one

2599
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:42,000
uh the scdc yeah

2600
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:44,319
oh

2601
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,920
um i'll leave that one you can ask matt

2602
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:48,158
about that one

2603
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:51,199
that's like a debatable

2604
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:53,920
the scdc is a debatable i do believe we

2605
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:56,399
are the only ones that hold it

2606
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,639
yeah okay like a wink wink

2607
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:00,479
no i i'm not i'm pretty sure seriously

2608
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:03,679
like i have you seen anybody else that

2609
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:05,519
has it no i i i initially thought that

2610
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:08,000
you guys made it

2611
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,800
well i'll let mad discuss that one with

2612
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,319
you

2613
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,119
that plant isn't

2614
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:16,079
i just don't love her

2615
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:17,118
that's one of his babies not mine

2616
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:18,000
yeah

2617
01:35:17,118 --> 01:35:19,759
so

2618
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,719
who are some breeders out there who you

2619
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:24,639
would love to collaborate with

2620
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:27,359
um

2621
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:29,600
oh god why would you ask me that

2622
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,519
i don't know i guess the question okay

2623
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,199
the question that i would ask you is

2624
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,600
what breeders would love to collaborate

2625
01:35:33,198 --> 01:35:35,599
with us

2626
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,440
well i guess firstly you'd wanna the

2627
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,880
devil's in the details right so we're

2628
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:42,399
gonna assume that they're gonna bring

2629
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:44,480
one parent to the table and you'll bring

2630
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:46,319
the other

2631
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:50,158
i have a feeling i know what parent they

2632
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:52,880
would like us to bring to the table so

2633
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:55,759
yeah i will i if i were you i would i

2634
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:58,880
would push to bring the mail

2635
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:02,320
jazz it up there you go

2636
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:04,239
so who are you suggesting for us

2637
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:06,000
well i mean it depends what if you just

2638
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:09,039
it's all about what you want really like

2639
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,319
i mean if i had to think like

2640
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:11,920
i want you guys to do something

2641
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:13,359
different so i'd just pick someone

2642
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,719
really different just so that no matter

2643
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:16,559
what they picked it would result in

2644
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:18,880
something really different

2645
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:21,280
yeah completely different

2646
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,920
yeah or like something that's really

2647
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,519
well regarded and super sativa and just

2648
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,520
see how it goes like you know something

2649
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,080
like that

2650
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,520
so i'm a sucker for sativas you know

2651
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:33,439
yeah

2652
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,960
um

2653
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:36,638
i don't know i don't really know how to

2654
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,158
answer that one

2655
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:39,440
well i guess the other way i would think

2656
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:40,399
about it is

2657
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:42,559
who is

2658
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:43,920
is there a strain out there where you

2659
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,880
look at it and you're like man i just

2660
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,639
love to cross the t-dub to that and you

2661
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,960
know if it's yes then you know who was

2662
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,159
the breeder of it

2663
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,920
you know

2664
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:56,079
gosh i wish that was one you would have

2665
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,760
maybe sent me in advance because i know

2666
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:00,158
there are some out there

2667
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:03,199
off the top of my head though that's a

2668
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:05,039
little tricky um

2669
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:06,799
i know there's a couple of strains out

2670
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:08,880
there because i've specifically talked

2671
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,719
about them but i just can't think off

2672
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,000
the top of my head

2673
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:14,399
like i said

2674
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,039
if we were to work with somebody

2675
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:18,559
um the first and foremost important

2676
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:20,800
thing we would want to work with

2677
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,239
somebody obviously that has a good

2678
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,800
reputation

2679
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:27,759
um and we're always looking

2680
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:30,000
for honesty um again i think that's

2681
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:33,039
something that

2682
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,600
it's a bit of a problem i think

2683
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:37,920
i don't know i i think we have uh

2684
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,480
there's a problem in the industry of not

2685
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,639
calling things what they actually are

2686
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:45,359
and i wish people would just call things

2687
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:46,639
what they actually are

2688
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,880
um

2689
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,880
so

2690
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,390
just like just serve a hot one up for us

2691
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:57,759
oh yeah right

2692
01:37:55,390 --> 01:38:00,320
[Laughter]

2693
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,560
like i just do i think that i think

2694
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:05,118
there's probably a lot less strains out

2695
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:07,360
there in existence than we think there's

2696
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:10,158
just a lot of names there's like you've

2697
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:12,559
got one strain and it actually has like

2698
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:14,158
seven names you know everybody thinks

2699
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,719
it's seven different strains but in

2700
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:18,799
reality it's not it's really just one i

2701
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,719
wish there was a lot less of that

2702
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,400
basically totally

2703
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:24,480
um so yeah as far as working with

2704
01:38:22,399 --> 01:38:27,920
anybody collaborating i don't know

2705
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:30,319
specifically not anybody in particular

2706
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:32,639
i think we're just so busy doing our own

2707
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:35,118
thing um

2708
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:37,440
plants really believe it or not are not

2709
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:40,719
our first priority our first priority

2710
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:41,599
always is our our child so

2711
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:44,880
um

2712
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,880
she's 17 now so hopefully soon she'll be

2713
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,480
going off to college if that's the case

2714
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,679
we'll have a lot more time for other

2715
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:51,678
things but

2716
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,279
as of right now plants kind of come

2717
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:56,158
secondary

2718
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:57,279
yeah it's a good good life decision

2719
01:38:56,158 --> 01:38:59,519
and so

2720
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:01,359
a question submitted by another one of

2721
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,840
our fans is

2722
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:07,279
what to you is the difference between a

2723
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,279
breeder and a pollen chucker

2724
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:12,599
that's a great question huh

2725
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:16,639
yeah

2726
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:17,678
i probably the definition would be my

2727
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,880
guess

2728
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,480
um

2729
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,400
i guess it depends who you actually to

2730
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:24,399
no seriously i guess it really depends

2731
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:26,879
on who you talk to

2732
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:29,198
if i'm giving like my opinion based on

2733
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,039
what i think the like the industry

2734
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:34,399
standard would be

2735
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:35,840
i would say a breeder is somebody who um

2736
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:38,319
has a more

2737
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:40,480
solid knowledgeable understanding for

2738
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:43,118
the strains that they're working

2739
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:44,718
um and have some of maybe their own

2740
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:47,839
stuff

2741
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:50,639
um aren't just crossing other people's

2742
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,719
works and you know this

2743
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:55,118
going and getting this female from this

2744
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:56,639
breeder and this male from this breeder

2745
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:59,679
and throwing them together i would think

2746
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,359
that's more of a pollen chucker

2747
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:03,039
i don't know i think it depends who you

2748
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:05,279
talk to

2749
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:07,760
no matter what breeding's breeding it's

2750
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:10,399
pollinating a plant and creating seeds

2751
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,159
anyone technically can do it it's common

2752
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:15,279
sense it's pretty

2753
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:17,279
it's a pretty basic thing anyone can do

2754
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:18,079
it but doesn't mean anyone can do it

2755
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:19,118
well

2756
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:22,639
um

2757
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:24,479
but i do i think it's just um

2758
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:27,118
i think it's more of a

2759
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:29,519
probably the

2760
01:40:27,118 --> 01:40:31,519
the the standards behind the person

2761
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,080
doing the work because i think that an

2762
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,080
actual a true breeder

2763
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:38,319
i think they probably really do care

2764
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,238
more about what they're doing and have a

2765
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:41,920
a solid love for what they're doing is

2766
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:44,238
where a pawn chucker in my opinion is

2767
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:46,000
probably doing it for the cash and just

2768
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:47,039
to pump out strains to make money that

2769
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,118
would be

2770
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:50,960
how i would view the difference

2771
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:52,639
does that make sense

2772
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,399
yeah of course

2773
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:56,480
and so

2774
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:57,920
what do you think of the various land

2775
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:00,158
races because i mean obviously

2776
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,679
clementine comes from afghani origin so

2777
01:41:00,158 --> 01:41:04,559
maybe that's something that's got a soft

2778
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:06,480
spot for you but if you you know had to

2779
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:08,480
pick a land race that you know you were

2780
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:11,198
more fond of which would be the more

2781
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:11,198
favorites for you

2782
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,319
oh you know

2783
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:16,560
i

2784
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:19,679
i don't know i would say obviously i

2785
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:23,199
love our i love our clementine it's

2786
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:26,880
just an awesome afghani plant i love it

2787
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:30,000
the high from her is just amazing um

2788
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,880
again for me

2789
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,880
i

2790
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,880
put it in front of me i'll smoke it i'm

2791
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,480
either i either love it or i don't you

2792
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,840
know um

2793
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:40,238
i think

2794
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:42,239
for me to actually say that i like a

2795
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,559
particular strain or i have like a

2796
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:47,359
really solid love for something i do i i

2797
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:49,920
would have to sample it and i'd have to

2798
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:52,000
i'd have to be able to um at least try

2799
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,158
it i that's the only way i can really

2800
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,639
give an opinion but um

2801
01:41:54,158 --> 01:41:58,479
as far as ours i just love

2802
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:01,359
that the clementine that we have that's

2803
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:02,559
why we you know we continue to work it

2804
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:05,118
and

2805
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,199
like i said why we even talk about maybe

2806
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:08,880
digging even deeper into those f-4s that

2807
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:11,039
we have might be something interesting

2808
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,600
to look at

2809
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:15,600
yeah well i mean would you ever consider

2810
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:18,480
trying it maybe not necessarily a pure

2811
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:22,079
clementine line but just trying to maybe

2812
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:23,759
create a more indica type of tangy thing

2813
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:26,399
because that's the thing which i found

2814
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:30,560
unique is that a lot of the more orangey

2815
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:32,158
strains are not afghani by nature and so

2816
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:33,920
um i think it would be really

2817
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:35,279
interesting to have like you know like

2818
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:37,679
an offering that's basically like you

2819
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:39,599
know a very indica very medicinal you

2820
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:40,880
know trying to gun to be a very orangey

2821
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,320
type of thing is that something that

2822
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,560
interests you or you think the fad's

2823
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:45,439
over

2824
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,159
you know

2825
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:50,799
i honestly think that pot strains as far

2826
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:52,319
as like the fads of flavors and coming

2827
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,520
and going i think it's going to be just

2828
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:55,519
like

2829
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:57,360
probably just like music and clothing

2830
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,280
you know from the 80s to the 90s we're

2831
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:00,960
gonna recycle through all the ugly [ __ ]

2832
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:02,559
all over again

2833
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,480
that's my guess

2834
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,080
you know like we'll like something now

2835
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,238
and then give it about 10 years and

2836
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:10,960
we'll bring it back and everybody walk

2837
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:12,718
like it's new again um that's just the

2838
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,920
nature of it i think that's what will

2839
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,719
happen

2840
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,600
um i don't know like i do don't get me

2841
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:22,239
wrong i like good flavors in my cannabis

2842
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:24,159
but there has to be a balance to it

2843
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,399
you know it can't just be good flavor

2844
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:28,238
it's got to it's got to do more than

2845
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:30,238
that it's got to do more than offer a

2846
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:33,279
good flavor it's got a gotta get i'm

2847
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:33,279
sorry it's got to get me high

2848
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,560
so

2849
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,079
this one's a little left of field but i

2850
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:40,480
really want to know the answer to this

2851
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:42,719
would you guys ever consider doing urcle

2852
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:44,000
or lavender s ones

2853
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,079
no

2854
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,679
everybody asks that and everybody says

2855
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:50,319
why not

2856
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:52,000
the question is is why

2857
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:54,319
well he i to i want to really play

2858
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,639
devil's advocate here if someone else

2859
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,799
came out and they started doing it and

2860
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,159
their cuts were real so you knew it was

2861
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,760
happening would that affect your

2862
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,719
decision at all

2863
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:07,840
nope um actually doesn't i believe csi

2864
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:10,960
doesn't he as in he asked one is urkel

2865
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:13,440
rats no you're one step ahead of me

2866
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,118
oh i'm sorry that's all good

2867
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:16,559
yeah no okay he definitely yeah he

2868
01:44:15,118 --> 01:44:18,079
definitely does do that and the mendo

2869
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,360
perps as well which is cool because i

2870
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:21,359
mean i think there's some people out

2871
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:23,679
there who are looking for that but to me

2872
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:25,359
it raises the next question is

2873
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:27,039
do you think it's possible to find

2874
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:29,679
something as good or better than the

2875
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:32,000
mother in an s1 and if so is that an

2876
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:33,440
influencing factor in your decision not

2877
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,158
to do it

2878
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:37,839
well um first i would say there's a

2879
01:44:36,158 --> 01:44:39,839
reason why we don't we don't do the

2880
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:42,239
whole s1 thing we don't believe in it

2881
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:44,800
you know it's your

2882
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:47,599
i know on some levels you say part of

2883
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:50,880
like the advancement in society is

2884
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:53,520
technology and whatnot and we're always

2885
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:55,679
manipulating things you know so people

2886
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:58,639
die later on in life and all this stuff

2887
01:44:55,679 --> 01:45:01,520
but as far as messing with genetics um

2888
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:04,639
matt and i aren't fans of it um

2889
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:07,360
just not um and i would say as far as s

2890
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:09,679
wanting the lavender or the urkel if it

2891
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:12,399
was that simple as just s won it you'll

2892
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:14,239
find something so much better than why

2893
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:16,479
hasn't it been done and why isn't it

2894
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:19,118
talked about all the time

2895
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:22,559
and if it were that simple why do

2896
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:24,319
breeders that have also supposedly the

2897
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:27,280
oracle cut

2898
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:29,519
ask mad for it regularly i so those are

2899
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,960
the kinds of questions that i ask myself

2900
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,520
um

2901
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:36,480
so no s ones won't i don't ever see them

2902
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:38,639
happening not with us um

2903
01:45:36,479 --> 01:45:40,399
and i don't think it's as simple as just

2904
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,079
s1 and you'll find something better

2905
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:43,679
because if that were the case it would

2906
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:45,840
have been done already

2907
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:48,960
yeah so i'm actually of the opposite

2908
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:52,880
mindset of it i i've yet to see a single

2909
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,880
s1 which is as good as the parent

2910
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:56,799
yeah see and i but you know some people

2911
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:59,039
ask too um

2912
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,119
do you do you ever find where uh the

2913
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:03,118
strains that you created come out better

2914
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:05,519
than like the keeper mother and i'm like

2915
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:07,359
yes otherwise we wouldn't bother uh

2916
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:09,040
create you know otherwise we wouldn't

2917
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:11,198
bother

2918
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:13,039
you know it's a different obviously it's

2919
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:15,519
better but it's a different better it's

2920
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:18,238
different than the mother um but i do

2921
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:20,480
think there's if it did come out if it

2922
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:22,158
was something as good or better then

2923
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:23,599
people would do it all the time and they

2924
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:25,599
would do it with everything and then

2925
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,880
there would be no need for regular seeds

2926
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:29,760
i would think

2927
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:31,760
so yeah i gotta i gotta say no to the s1

2928
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,239
thing if it were that simple to find

2929
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:36,079
something so much better and it were

2930
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:38,079
that that much easier i would think it

2931
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:40,158
would have already been done by now

2932
01:46:38,079 --> 01:46:41,840
and does that extend to just feminize in

2933
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:43,599
general like would you do femme crosses

2934
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:47,199
or just now

2935
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:49,039
no we we we um you know like i said i've

2936
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:51,919
learned from mad so

2937
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:54,158
based off of his um

2938
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:55,840
like i said he's he's got a really he's

2939
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:58,238
got a mad brain

2940
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:00,000
he um the amount of knowledge he has

2941
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:01,519
taken in when it comes to cannabis is

2942
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,439
insane

2943
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:06,639
it's just like nothing i've ever seen

2944
01:47:03,439 --> 01:47:09,759
before and um he has a solid belief on

2945
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:12,560
why he doesn't believe in it why he does

2946
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,560
like regular seeds and

2947
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:16,800
he's made his argument with me and i can

2948
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,719
i can i can agree with that and i you

2949
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,279
know i i can look at it too even with

2950
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:24,639
like people and genetics i mean i really

2951
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:27,118
wouldn't want to do that with my kids so

2952
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,560
you know kind of the same thing

2953
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:29,599
yeah

2954
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,440
so

2955
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,199
i wanted to ask you a question that i

2956
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:34,399
asked matt in the initial interview i

2957
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:36,399
did with him

2958
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:38,079
how do you feel about granddaddy purple

2959
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:40,799
seeing as it's kind of like the watered

2960
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:42,238
down urcle

2961
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,520
um

2962
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:45,039
you know i

2963
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:47,840
i guess i don't really have much of an

2964
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:50,319
opinion either way um i was actually

2965
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,960
smoking some some concentrates of the

2966
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:56,238
granddaddy purple um

2967
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:58,639
we went to that endo x bow and mad

2968
01:47:56,238 --> 01:47:59,519
packed my vape pen but he didn't pack

2969
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,279
the

2970
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,679
the top of it so i only had the bottom

2971
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:05,679
half the battery portion oh no cartridge

2972
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,520
yeah so i'm like how am i supposed to

2973
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:10,239
smoke when you only packed half of my

2974
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:12,800
[ __ ] but when we got there the one of

2975
01:48:10,238 --> 01:48:14,638
the seeds here now guys um ben was nice

2976
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,400
enough to gift me

2977
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:18,079
one of the little concentrate tips and

2978
01:48:16,399 --> 01:48:20,319
it was granddaddy purple so i got to

2979
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:22,479
smoke that it was pretty all right so i

2980
01:48:20,319 --> 01:48:22,479
mean

2981
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,239
no to me wasn't as wasn't nothing like

2982
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:27,840
urkel

2983
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:30,000
do you see any similarity or you're

2984
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:33,039
skeptical on the link

2985
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,319
it's like a like a very watered-down

2986
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:36,479
mild

2987
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:38,559
version maybe but it's definitely not

2988
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:39,599
it's not the same as urkel it's uh

2989
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,400
actually has

2990
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:43,960
to me it had more of um

2991
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:48,238
i don't know maybe more of like a

2992
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:49,920
perfumey type kind of spin to it

2993
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:52,238
that made it more different than the

2994
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:54,319
than the urkel was for me but it

2995
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,319
definitely it didn't the one thing i can

2996
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:58,719
say is for being concentrates it didn't

2997
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:01,679
even get me high

2998
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:02,639
it just gave me like a really like mild

2999
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:04,639
buzz

3000
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:07,039
so that was kind of a disappointment but

3001
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:09,279
it was just nice to have

3002
01:49:07,039 --> 01:49:11,198
is that a concern you have in general

3003
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:13,359
because what i've heard is is that

3004
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:16,079
there's just like an exponential growth

3005
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:17,759
in both the demand and the supply of

3006
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:19,519
these cartridge types of products and

3007
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,360
i've heard that that's where a lot of

3008
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:23,280
the shady back

3009
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:25,279
back counter stuff can happen in terms

3010
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:27,118
of like material getting processed that

3011
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:28,479
like probably wouldn't pass or stuff

3012
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:30,319
like are you concerned about that or do

3013
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:32,158
you think it's all a bit of like rumor

3014
01:49:30,319 --> 01:49:34,319
wife's tale type stuff

3015
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,238
well i think any time that you have

3016
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:37,920
rumors you gotta take into consideration

3017
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:40,000
things come from somewhere so there's

3018
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:42,319
likely some truth to it

3019
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,760
um but i think anytime you're doing

3020
01:49:42,319 --> 01:49:45,198
business with people you just need to do

3021
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,960
your research

3022
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:48,559
um

3023
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:51,359
you know you should know what you're

3024
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:53,520
getting into at least if

3025
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:55,039
as far as that goes

3026
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:58,560
um

3027
01:49:55,039 --> 01:50:00,639
like you mean as far as uh

3028
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:04,560
concentrates like as far as testing and

3029
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:06,880
being clean like for your bugs and yeah

3030
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:07,840
what i've heard is that like

3031
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,520
there's

3032
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:11,199
a lot of bud which you know maybe does

3033
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:13,199
have an issue but it just gets turned

3034
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:14,719
into concentrates and then by the time

3035
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:16,399
it gets down to like the type of thing

3036
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:18,719
which would end up in a cartridge it's

3037
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:20,399
so highly processed that you just have

3038
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:22,399
no idea

3039
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,399
like that it's been like there's like

3040
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:26,960
pesticides and all that yeah yeah like

3041
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:28,960
peter and stuff yeah no yeah no i'm sure

3042
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,000
there's definite truth to that because

3043
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,920
it had

3044
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,479
that has to have come from somewhere i

3045
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,319
would assume there's truth to it but um

3046
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:39,118
like like i was saying i would just

3047
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:41,840
assume you know um whoever you do

3048
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:43,519
business with if you have somebody

3049
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:45,760
you know creating those for you or

3050
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:47,920
making putting your

3051
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:49,520
uh making it into concentrates you

3052
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,679
should you should probably know where

3053
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,840
you're getting your your medicine from

3054
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:55,840
at least have an idea

3055
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,639
uh once which is also one of the reasons

3056
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:00,400
why mad and i like to um

3057
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:02,159
smoke our own

3058
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:04,158
you don't have to worry about it

3059
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:06,158
do you think there's a certain negative

3060
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:08,158
element in the way that there's this

3061
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:10,158
separation from the plant in that you

3062
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:12,319
can just get this cartridge and it's so

3063
01:51:10,158 --> 01:51:14,158
removed from the flower

3064
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:16,000
that it leads to the situation where you

3065
01:51:14,158 --> 01:51:18,000
get these crazy you know possibly

3066
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,679
adulterants in there whereas if everyone

3067
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,840
was just still sticking with flour

3068
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:24,239
arguably it's more medicinal and you're

3069
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,159
more likely to spot any you know visual

3070
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:28,399
issues things like that

3071
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:30,399
yeah and i actually do i have even

3072
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:31,839
noticed um

3073
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:33,759
you know concentrates they say

3074
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,760
concentrates are stronger but i've even

3075
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,960
noticed sometimes

3076
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:39,520
um

3077
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:41,118
a difference from say

3078
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,159
if you were to take this

3079
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:44,319
urkel

3080
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:46,079
flower smoke it and then compare it to

3081
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:48,000
the same concentrates made from it i

3082
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:50,079
noticed there is like a difference in

3083
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,158
the way my body like

3084
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:53,439
reacts to that even if it's the same

3085
01:51:52,158 --> 01:51:54,319
strain

3086
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:58,319
um

3087
01:51:54,319 --> 01:52:00,799
i don't know i do feel like um

3088
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:04,079
i feel like i do have a more true

3089
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:07,440
feeling fro of a stone when i smoke a

3090
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:11,039
actual flower versus concentrate i get i

3091
01:52:07,439 --> 01:52:13,598
feel like it gives me a better um

3092
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:15,519
i don't know like i have a better feel

3093
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:18,480
of that particular strain if i smoke it

3094
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,679
in flour versus concentrates

3095
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:22,158
okay

3096
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:23,840
i definitely agree with that one myself

3097
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:26,559
and so

3098
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:29,039
i found a forum post many years ago i

3099
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:31,520
think it was 2011 or something and it

3100
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:33,198
said that like it reckons it had the

3101
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:35,199
genetics listed for the tripoli wicked

3102
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:37,919
and the purple jackie have you guys

3103
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:39,118
tried to keep that under wraps

3104
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:40,560
no no

3105
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:42,719
any any

3106
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:44,639
anything that you can find like any any

3107
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:46,719
records of when we are online it should

3108
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:49,118
be fully accessible to anybody that

3109
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:51,198
wants to see i um

3110
01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:53,920
we've always been honest about what we

3111
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:56,479
worked from when we originally first got

3112
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:59,679
um the mail that we worked in those

3113
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:01,919
lines um that was it was a male that was

3114
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:04,319
gifted to us i know mads told this story

3115
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:06,319
before um

3116
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:07,920
it was uh like all the names were always

3117
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:10,158
left out so it just made me wonder like

3118
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:12,800
do you intentionally not want to reveal

3119
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:14,799
the lineage of certain things or

3120
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:16,239
no like on on which one in particular

3121
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,960
which which form is this that we're

3122
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:21,678
speaking of is it was it who's post

3123
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:23,840
there's one on roll it up by a guy

3124
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:25,359
called elite nuggs um he says he's a

3125
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,800
friend of yours but you know oh yeah

3126
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:28,479
yeah i remember him okay i know who

3127
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,159
you're talking about yeah yeah and what

3128
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:32,000
it what is it that he listed

3129
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:34,719
specifically because i was never on roll

3130
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,198
it up he says purple jackie is mendo

3131
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:38,319
cross a purple local male

3132
01:53:37,198 --> 01:53:40,158
and

3133
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:42,960
uh tripoli wicket is lavender across a

3134
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:45,118
purple local mail

3135
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:47,359
okay now there is actually like a bit of

3136
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:49,679
a story to this it goes back a bit

3137
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:51,839
further and i i do prefer mad tell this

3138
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:54,319
story i think he's even actually covered

3139
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:58,159
this when when you and him did one of

3140
01:53:54,319 --> 01:53:59,840
your interviews before um okay oh my god

3141
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:02,079
it's like such an extensive story the

3142
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:04,239
gentleman that we got our mail cut from

3143
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:07,279
back then when we first worked it

3144
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:10,158
there's like he contacted us and he says

3145
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:11,439
i've got this cut the these are he has a

3146
01:54:10,158 --> 01:54:12,479
cut and

3147
01:54:11,439 --> 01:54:15,279
um

3148
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:18,238
these beans that he had and it was uh

3149
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:19,599
this the particular he got them they

3150
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:20,559
were

3151
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:23,840
what

3152
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:26,960
labeled as urkel purple oracle beans now

3153
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:29,279
this is many many years ago so

3154
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:30,800
madden him formed a relationship and

3155
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:32,559
there's like a whole story from there

3156
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:34,800
and i believe he's told it but as far as

3157
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:36,320
like dates and all that stuff that's

3158
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,920
something that you'd have to touch on

3159
01:54:36,319 --> 01:54:40,000
with him because like i said this goes

3160
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:41,760
back to like the beginning

3161
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
when i really didn't have so much

3162
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:46,719
involvement um and this was a deal

3163
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,800
between him and this particular guy

3164
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:51,198
but the reason it's listed that way is

3165
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:53,840
because uh

3166
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:56,238
they believed it was from the urkel the

3167
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:58,880
lineage was from the purple urkel the

3168
01:54:56,238 --> 01:55:00,479
male that that we were gifted back when

3169
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,480
we used it which we did we ended up

3170
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:05,359
killing that male which was the one that

3171
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:07,279
was used um to make the original purple

3172
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:08,559
jackie beans and the original t-dub

3173
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:10,319
beans

3174
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:13,320
yeah okay

3175
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:15,000
so if you dig back a bit further maybe

3176
01:55:13,319 --> 01:55:18,479
2003

3177
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,399
2006 or so somewhere around that area

3178
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:21,678
um it's another forum that we were

3179
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:23,759
actually on

3180
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:28,399
there's a particular story in there and

3181
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:30,560
it'll explain all of that it explains um

3182
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:31,519
just in in full detail

3183
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:34,560
um

3184
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:37,760
where the cut itself came from that this

3185
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:40,400
mail we we used in the project

3186
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,880
the truth is is it's just basically we

3187
01:55:40,399 --> 01:55:46,479
had to label it as we were told it was

3188
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:48,560
and all we know is what

3189
01:55:46,479 --> 01:55:51,039
people believe they were labeled as at

3190
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:53,920
the time and it was supposed to be from

3191
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:54,880
the same lineage as purple urkel itself

3192
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,520
so

3193
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:59,279
there's no secret behind the lineage

3194
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:01,599
it's just nobody really knew what to

3195
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:03,118
call it and at the time it was actually

3196
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:07,119
labeled

3197
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:07,920
the triple e male like as in e

3198
01:56:07,118 --> 01:56:09,118
e

3199
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:11,199
and e

3200
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:12,880
because back then too i don't know if

3201
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:14,399
you know or how familiar you are but

3202
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,719
there were times when they were spelling

3203
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:18,559
erkel with an e does that

3204
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:21,039
ring a bell to you yeah yeah i remember

3205
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,320
that photo right okay so

3206
01:56:21,039 --> 01:56:24,960
uh and

3207
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:28,319
um some of the research done back on

3208
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:30,239
this this cup that we also were gifted

3209
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:31,279
back when this project was originally

3210
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:33,598
created

3211
01:56:31,279 --> 01:56:35,759
that's how they were labeled was as

3212
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:37,599
urkel so that's where the e came from

3213
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:39,280
because the original spelling on those

3214
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:41,279
were spelled with an e

3215
01:56:39,279 --> 01:56:43,279
so if you look back further you can find

3216
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:45,359
some more research it's all there to be

3217
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:47,679
seen but as far as like

3218
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:49,359
the full details and the story and the

3219
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:50,880
names that would all be best to come

3220
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:53,359
from mad because

3221
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:55,520
my brain just doesn't remember all of

3222
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:58,319
that stuff quite as well plus i like i

3223
01:56:55,520 --> 01:57:00,560
said i didn't jump in until i had to

3224
01:56:58,319 --> 01:57:02,559
and that was much much later when he got

3225
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:04,480
so sick and um

3226
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,639
he ended up in the hospital and he just

3227
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:08,319
couldn't do all this work by himself

3228
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:09,760
anymore so

3229
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:12,079
yeah um

3230
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,320
i believe he told you this story too

3231
01:57:12,079 --> 01:57:17,920
when you guys did your one of your

3232
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:20,000
interviews like i almost positive he had

3233
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:22,560
yeah yeah he did it was just um the

3234
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,880
those details about the the urkel and

3235
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:27,199
the lavender and where it all status the

3236
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,599
parents i think we didn't get those bits

3237
01:57:27,198 --> 01:57:32,479
yeah and see that's too where his why

3238
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:33,360
he's always had such a fascination too

3239
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:36,238
for

3240
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:37,759
understanding the urkel and the lavender

3241
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:40,718
lineage because

3242
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:44,159
he's and he he's he's positive like

3243
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:46,800
he's he's sure he knows what it what it

3244
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:49,279
was that created like he knows if you

3245
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,520
ask him he knows in his mind what

3246
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:53,198
created that lavender and what created

3247
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:56,880
that urkel and

3248
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:58,000
i just he he has an amazing mind for it

3249
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,199
and

3250
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,039
um

3251
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:02,799
back then that's what sparked his

3252
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:04,719
interest because everybody was so

3253
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:06,639
insistent that all the purple strains

3254
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:08,560
back then were identical and they just

3255
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:10,480
weren't and he knew it and that's

3256
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:12,639
that's where all of that that interest

3257
01:58:10,479 --> 01:58:14,718
came from was because of those projects

3258
01:58:12,639 --> 01:58:16,639
he had started up

3259
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:18,000
yeah and so

3260
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:20,639
the thing that i've noticed about the

3261
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,800
purple strains is to me they've got some

3262
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:24,639
of the most kind of most enjoyable

3263
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,560
terpene profiles you know you referenced

3264
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:27,920
earlier there's like a perfuminess to

3265
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,360
them almost

3266
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:32,000
how do you feel about that and what's

3267
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:33,039
your favorite terpene profile

3268
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,840
um

3269
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:37,840
well i don't know sometimes i feel like

3270
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,079
a brat um

3271
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:42,000
with the lavender side of things you

3272
01:58:40,079 --> 01:58:44,479
tend to have um

3273
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,679
i would say it is more floral

3274
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:47,839
sometimes

3275
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:49,679
my daughter will even say it has like a

3276
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,079
like it's reminds her of walking into

3277
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:54,719
starbucks the smell

3278
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:57,039
um so lavender has that smell which is

3279
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:59,039
really nice and it does um it does roll

3280
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:00,560
over into the flavor sometimes and then

3281
01:58:59,039 --> 01:59:03,039
as to where urkel

3282
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,639
urkel will tend to have more of like a

3283
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:06,238
grape soda

3284
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,480
every once in a while too you'll even

3285
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:10,000
pick up like a pink bubble gum flavor in

3286
01:59:08,479 --> 01:59:12,000
there

3287
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
um but that's like you those are the bit

3288
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:17,359
of a different uh flavor profiles in

3289
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:20,719
those purples and then in our uh wicked

3290
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:22,479
clementine and like some of the tita

3291
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:26,319
tubs that we've grown

3292
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:28,718
they are heavily citrus i mean it's so

3293
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:31,920
it's so it's so

3294
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:35,039
dominant and some people will say it's

3295
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:38,800
orange like some will say it's uh lemon

3296
01:59:35,039 --> 01:59:41,039
like pine uh like pink lemonade like

3297
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:44,000
some will say it's more like grapefruit

3298
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:46,000
um but those those types of terps

3299
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,960
actually start to bother me after a

3300
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,319
while

3301
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:52,158
i do lean more towards um

3302
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:54,719
that the flavor that the oracle and the

3303
01:59:52,158 --> 01:59:57,598
lavender tend tend to carry

3304
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:59,439
but i do also like um

3305
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:01,760
the more old school flavor that that

3306
01:59:59,439 --> 02:00:03,598
clementine kicks out because it's just

3307
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:05,920
it just reminds you of like a real old

3308
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:07,199
school bud um

3309
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,719
just kind of

3310
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:10,799
maybe like uh

3311
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:13,679
i don't know just really

3312
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:17,440
really soft easy on the lungs like a

3313
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:19,840
real mild maybe mild kind of like a hint

3314
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:22,479
of pine to it but almost sour at the

3315
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,840
same time it's really nice

3316
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:25,598
it sounds good

3317
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:29,520
mouthwatering it is good and it's

3318
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:32,000
actually super stoney that clementine um

3319
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:35,360
it does if you like if i haven't been

3320
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,560
smoking much of her it just [ __ ] me up

3321
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:38,559
like makes me stupid

3322
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:43,840
so final question that was submitted

3323
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:46,079
from one of our patreon fans

3324
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,360
they say i would love you to ask mrs

3325
02:00:46,079 --> 02:00:49,198
madd

3326
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:50,559
what does she look for in a keeper and

3327
02:00:49,198 --> 02:00:52,238
how does she approach a grow room in

3328
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:54,320
general and so i think what they mean by

3329
02:00:52,238 --> 02:00:56,079
that is is it just purely about like

3330
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:57,840
effect like you just smoke it and that's

3331
02:00:56,079 --> 02:01:00,000
all or is there other considerations

3332
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,440
like yield you know ease of growing all

3333
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,039
those types of things like how do you

3334
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:05,759
decide keepers

3335
02:01:03,039 --> 02:01:08,960
oh god everything everything i take

3336
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:11,039
everything into effect um

3337
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:12,480
like starting in veg there's a couple of

3338
02:01:11,039 --> 02:01:14,719
things that i'm going to pay attention

3339
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:16,638
to first off in there um

3340
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:18,480
one you got to take into account what

3341
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:21,840
your growth space is like you know if

3342
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:25,118
you have um height restrictions space

3343
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:27,360
restrictions of any type you need to

3344
02:01:25,118 --> 02:01:28,158
focus the strains that you grow around

3345
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:30,000
that

3346
02:01:28,158 --> 02:01:31,359
which is one of the things that i love i

3347
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,118
like to say you know our streams are

3348
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:35,439
really nice about that

3349
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:37,839
because we are limited with height and

3350
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:39,039
space and whatnot we do try to focus a

3351
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:40,560
plant that

3352
02:01:39,039 --> 02:01:42,960
can produce you

3353
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:45,440
something super stoney with the flavor

3354
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:47,760
but also in a manageable space and

3355
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:50,479
doesn't like top out at crazy heights so

3356
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:53,199
we do try to touch on that so i'm

3357
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:55,678
looking at stuff that grows similar to a

3358
02:01:53,198 --> 02:01:58,158
structure that i like and i do i like a

3359
02:01:55,679 --> 02:02:02,319
shorter squatty plant um

3360
02:01:58,158 --> 02:02:05,279
i like a growth structure that i can

3361
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:08,079
control rather easy

3362
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:10,079
um i don't like a super finicky plant so

3363
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:12,319
if if um

3364
02:02:10,079 --> 02:02:14,158
if she gets like if a female especially

3365
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:16,319
gets root bound and if it starts getting

3366
02:02:14,158 --> 02:02:18,799
temperamental with me i don't like that

3367
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:20,719
i don't want it to be rebound and start

3368
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:22,800
showing problems instantly i like them

3369
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:26,000
to be super tough

3370
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:27,599
i don't like them to be um

3371
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,800
i don't like when they're temperamental

3372
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:32,239
because then if you have to like be away

3373
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:33,760
or there's going to be any type of

3374
02:02:32,238 --> 02:02:35,678
stressor you know that they're going to

3375
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:38,560
be easily set off i don't like to

3376
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:40,880
necessarily keep plants like that

3377
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:43,599
um so structure's big

3378
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:45,760
pest resistance is nice i do not like

3379
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:48,319
strains that have like a tendency to

3380
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,920
have powdery mildew that's the worst

3381
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:51,759
especially if you're

3382
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,039
limited on the space that you're working

3383
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:55,280
you don't want to have to deal with

3384
02:02:53,039 --> 02:02:58,158
powdery mildew and stuff like that so we

3385
02:02:55,279 --> 02:03:00,079
stay away from strains that

3386
02:02:58,158 --> 02:03:02,638
have tendencies to pick up powdery

3387
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:05,920
mildew or draw in certain bugs but at

3388
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:07,920
the same time we also uh

3389
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:09,920
plants that are really expressive in

3390
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:12,480
their terps tend to draw

3391
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:14,719
bugs nuisance bugs so you know you kind

3392
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:16,000
of have to balance that out

3393
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:18,319
um

3394
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,198
now as far as in

3395
02:03:18,319 --> 02:03:22,880
flower like oh two stem rubs are always

3396
02:03:21,198 --> 02:03:24,960
nice i know people talk about that a lot

3397
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:26,560
but just any kind of smells that you can

3398
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:29,198
pick up from them

3399
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:31,119
might give you some um signs on what

3400
02:03:29,198 --> 02:03:32,158
what a plant will give you

3401
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:35,198
um

3402
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:37,920
just the colors that they express

3403
02:03:35,198 --> 02:03:40,879
how thick the stalks get i pay attention

3404
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:43,039
to everything um

3405
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:44,319
again like i said i stress them i make

3406
02:03:43,039 --> 02:03:46,000
them ugly

3407
02:03:44,319 --> 02:03:49,198
i like to see how

3408
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,078
how reactive they are can they crowd out

3409
02:03:49,198 --> 02:03:51,678
um

3410
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:54,000
are they strong enough to crowd out

3411
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:55,520
other plants when situations get tough

3412
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,279
you know when when things get really

3413
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:59,679
overgrown

3414
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:01,599
can they dominate as to where another

3415
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:03,520
plant may get pushed out so i look at

3416
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:05,440
stuff like that

3417
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,119
um

3418
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:08,479
just stuff like that

3419
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:11,439
uh

3420
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:13,519
but keepers again like we're always

3421
02:04:11,439 --> 02:04:15,839
looking for we do i like to stay within

3422
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,719
a certain type of structure it was

3423
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:21,840
really super hard for me to take in that

3424
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:24,560
um the the lemon larry that we took in

3425
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:27,440
because i hate its growth patterns

3426
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:28,880
they're really like crazy and it's not

3427
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:31,759
really within the

3428
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:34,239
what i'm used to but um

3429
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,159
so yeah that's something out of what i

3430
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:37,598
typically would like but i'm working

3431
02:04:36,158 --> 02:04:40,238
with it

3432
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:41,360
that's still very comprehensive answer

3433
02:04:40,238 --> 02:04:43,359
so

3434
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:45,759
something i would love to quickly ask

3435
02:04:43,359 --> 02:04:47,920
where do terpenes and aesthetics rate

3436
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:49,760
for you so for example if you bread

3437
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:52,239
something again it's absolutely amazing

3438
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:54,079
smoke but there's no terpenes is that

3439
02:04:52,238 --> 02:04:56,000
like a no-go for you like where do all

3440
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:57,920
these things sit

3441
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,198
all right that's actually really an easy

3442
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:00,800
that's really one of the easier

3443
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:03,519
questions um

3444
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:05,679
seriously looking for balance all we're

3445
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:08,159
always looking for balance

3446
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:10,560
it's got to offer you up some you know

3447
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:12,319
very specific things um

3448
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:14,960
like i said one

3449
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:18,479
you want stability first and foremost

3450
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:20,239
stability is important two if i can't

3451
02:05:18,479 --> 02:05:21,759
stand the taste of it that's going to be

3452
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:23,678
a bit of a problem

3453
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:26,239
if i don't like it if it's going to make

3454
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:28,078
my throat hurt if it burns my lungs

3455
02:05:26,238 --> 02:05:30,399
those are all problems

3456
02:05:28,078 --> 02:05:32,158
so i know like if it's

3457
02:05:30,399 --> 02:05:34,158
i know if it's doing that on a

3458
02:05:32,158 --> 02:05:36,479
consistent basis i can tell you without

3459
02:05:34,158 --> 02:05:37,439
a doubt it's not what my husband is

3460
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:40,479
doing

3461
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:42,559
in flower because he babies his plants

3462
02:05:40,479 --> 02:05:44,959
and they always come out with the best

3463
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,320
available flavors so if it's something

3464
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:47,198
that's not

3465
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:49,439
just

3466
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:51,678
giving it up in the flavor department it

3467
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:52,879
likely won't even be touched by us but

3468
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:54,639
it could have all the flavor in the

3469
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:56,719
world if it doesn't

3470
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:58,800
uh doesn't give you the desired effect

3471
02:05:56,719 --> 02:06:00,880
of you know getting you stoned taking

3472
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,719
care of your stomach issues um taking

3473
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:05,118
care of your aches and pains and your

3474
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:07,279
sore back or helping you sleep at night

3475
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:10,000
it there has to be balance but stability

3476
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:12,158
first and foremost um

3477
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:14,719
and like again it

3478
02:06:12,158 --> 02:06:16,879
it should be giving you something

3479
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:19,039
every bit as good as

3480
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,960
those keeper mamas and if it's not

3481
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:23,118
giving you every bit as good as those

3482
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:24,800
keeper mamas or better then it's just

3483
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:26,639
not worth your time

3484
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,520
so

3485
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:30,319
so

3486
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:32,480
on the tail end of it all now

3487
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:35,198
this is a question i love to ask people

3488
02:06:32,479 --> 02:06:36,479
um but i think in my head it always

3489
02:06:35,198 --> 02:06:37,598
seems like it'll be a harder question

3490
02:06:36,479 --> 02:06:40,158
than what it is

3491
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:42,639
if you could only do one for the rest of

3492
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:46,319
your life indoor or outdoor which one

3493
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:48,400
would it be okay yeah see this is funny

3494
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:50,799
mad would tell you all day long he would

3495
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:53,039
say outdoor i would not i would say

3496
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:55,920
indoor i

3497
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:57,519
maybe because i'm i'm i'm not big on

3498
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,920
change um

3499
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:02,159
i don't like change whenever i make

3500
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:04,800
changes nine times out of ten i find

3501
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:06,638
myself very disappointed

3502
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:09,679
i'm talking across the board in life so

3503
02:07:06,639 --> 02:07:11,039
maybe that's why i say that um no i'm

3504
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:13,118
just being honest

3505
02:07:11,039 --> 02:07:14,560
every time i make a change

3506
02:07:13,118 --> 02:07:16,719
it rarely

3507
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:18,480
turns out better so i'm not a fan of

3508
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:20,000
change because of this i'm i'm the kind

3509
02:07:18,479 --> 02:07:21,759
of person that if i find something and

3510
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,078
it works for me

3511
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:26,560
i'm not i will i will make a change if

3512
02:07:24,078 --> 02:07:28,319
you can give me evidence that shows me

3513
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:30,800
if you do it like this and you can give

3514
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:32,399
me an example of how there will be solid

3515
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:33,520
evidence to prove it will be better i

3516
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:35,359
will

3517
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,440
but you have to be able to present me

3518
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:39,759
with solid evidence because i'm not

3519
02:07:37,439 --> 02:07:42,078
about to abandon everything i know and

3520
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:45,039
everything i do great at

3521
02:07:42,078 --> 02:07:47,359
unless there's a good reason to do that

3522
02:07:45,039 --> 02:07:49,599
that's just that's me

3523
02:07:47,359 --> 02:07:54,118
soon regards to indoor what is your

3524
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:54,119
preferred type of light

3525
02:07:54,319 --> 02:07:58,719
oh my gosh see now this is where there

3526
02:07:56,399 --> 02:08:00,559
is no there's no uh there's no real

3527
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:02,800
compromise here

3528
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:05,520
this is all mad

3529
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:09,119
no compromise what mad says goes

3530
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:12,560
um no for my veg i we've got just basic

3531
02:08:09,118 --> 02:08:14,719
t5s um mad's pretty basic he's old

3532
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:17,360
school he likes old school all the way

3533
02:08:14,719 --> 02:08:19,760
but no he's um pretty dead set on the

3534
02:08:17,359 --> 02:08:21,598
certain things that he uses but no

3535
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:24,560
um when it comes to stuff like that i

3536
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:27,599
don't i i don't um i don't pretend to

3537
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:30,159
have input there

3538
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:33,279
like i said are you guys running flower

3539
02:08:30,158 --> 02:08:35,039
um he's actually he's old school dude

3540
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:37,118
he's got um

3541
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:40,238
the uh what it

3542
02:08:37,118 --> 02:08:42,158
is so hard for her yes he has high

3543
02:08:40,238 --> 02:08:44,399
pressure sodiums but he's got just we

3544
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:47,198
have our old-school ballasts in there

3545
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:50,638
but they have never done us wrong

3546
02:08:47,198 --> 02:08:53,039
um hydrofarm all the way uh never had a

3547
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:55,279
problem not once and i think the ones

3548
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:58,319
that we even have have like

3549
02:08:55,279 --> 02:09:01,359
just the best warranties on them so

3550
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:04,639
yeah he like i said he even is to a

3551
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:07,439
certain extent like me you know you

3552
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:10,719
um in anything that we do he's very much

3553
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:12,238
a perfectionist like i am um

3554
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:14,319
i don't mess with anything if it's

3555
02:09:12,238 --> 02:09:16,638
working well for me unless i find a

3556
02:09:14,319 --> 02:09:19,519
reason that i need to change it

3557
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:21,199
in that case i will um he's the same way

3558
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:22,719
but actually it's funny that you bring

3559
02:09:21,198 --> 02:09:24,078
that up because he was just telling me

3560
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:25,359
the other day

3561
02:09:24,078 --> 02:09:27,679
um

3562
02:09:25,359 --> 02:09:29,279
because we're gonna be

3563
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:31,840
needing to put some

3564
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:33,359
plants into flowers soon but he is

3565
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:35,599
talking about wanting to go through a

3566
02:09:33,359 --> 02:09:38,399
bunch of changes on um lights and

3567
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:40,159
whatnot and i'm thinking oh i'm so glad

3568
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:41,359
that's not my

3569
02:09:40,158 --> 02:09:43,598
that's not

3570
02:09:41,359 --> 02:09:45,279
not in this within the realm of the

3571
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:47,119
things that i do because i don't want to

3572
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:49,198
deal with it

3573
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:50,960
i really don't but that's one of the

3574
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:52,479
things really nice about what him and i

3575
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:56,000
do together because

3576
02:09:52,479 --> 02:09:58,238
it's such a shared uh responsibility he

3577
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,960
really does do the things that i hate or

3578
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:02,718
i don't i don't like to do and trust me

3579
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,399
there are some of those and then there's

3580
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:05,840
some things that i just

3581
02:10:04,399 --> 02:10:08,158
i'll be honest that's another thing i

3582
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:10,239
love about this industry you will never

3583
02:10:08,158 --> 02:10:12,078
know everything there is to know there's

3584
02:10:10,238 --> 02:10:13,919
always something to learn

3585
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:16,078
cannabis is one of the coolest things

3586
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:17,679
because you will never have all the

3587
02:10:16,078 --> 02:10:19,840
knowledge there is to have you can

3588
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:21,520
always learn something new and i really

3589
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:22,800
do enjoy that

3590
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:25,520
um

3591
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:27,520
but yeah uh we get to share in

3592
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:30,560
everything that we do and

3593
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:33,920
he has such an extensive knowledge um

3594
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:36,320
and he's been studying for so long that

3595
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:38,639
he's he does make a good majority of our

3596
02:10:36,319 --> 02:10:42,000
decisions unless like i said it's one of

3597
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:43,760
those things that falls within my um

3598
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,238
you know things that i like to control

3599
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:48,719
because i am i am a control freak he

3600
02:10:46,238 --> 02:10:50,319
will tell you i'm almost borderline

3601
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:52,319
psycho when it comes to the things i

3602
02:10:50,319 --> 02:10:53,039
like to control

3603
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:55,359
so

3604
02:10:53,039 --> 02:10:57,279
what's a general grow tip you've got for

3605
02:10:55,359 --> 02:10:59,118
the viewers just to you know get things

3606
02:10:57,279 --> 02:11:00,639
you know just perky a little better that

3607
02:10:59,118 --> 02:11:02,319
type of thing

3608
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:04,480
you know i think one of the things

3609
02:11:02,319 --> 02:11:08,639
people don't realize i i think they

3610
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:11,118
forget it is basically a weed

3611
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:14,159
um just keep in mind uh they they're

3612
02:11:11,118 --> 02:11:17,198
real basic they grow it's pretty simple

3613
02:11:14,158 --> 02:11:19,359
um they don't require a whole lot um

3614
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:20,879
just really

3615
02:11:19,359 --> 02:11:22,719
love and care

3616
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:24,400
you can really just watch them and

3617
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:25,679
they'll tell you everything that they

3618
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:28,399
need

3619
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:30,158
reading is always good

3620
02:11:28,399 --> 02:11:31,759
one of the things that i actually

3621
02:11:30,158 --> 02:11:33,839
personally feel like i have learned

3622
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:35,360
myself that has been extremely helpful

3623
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:38,319
for me

3624
02:11:35,359 --> 02:11:40,078
is if i ever have a problem

3625
02:11:38,319 --> 02:11:41,840
the one thing i don't do i know

3626
02:11:40,078 --> 02:11:42,639
everybody runs to the computer first

3627
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:45,039
thing

3628
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:46,639
i do not go on

3629
02:11:45,039 --> 02:11:49,599
pot forums

3630
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:52,239
i refuse to find information there

3631
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:53,760
because most of it a lot of it is crazy

3632
02:11:52,238 --> 02:11:56,000
for starters but

3633
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:58,000
a lot of it will send you to doing

3634
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,039
things to your plants that's crazy

3635
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,560
dangerous bad for them um sometimes will

3636
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:05,279
kill them

3637
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:08,159
um but also will straight up make you

3638
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:10,158
panic um so i what i try to do is i try

3639
02:12:08,158 --> 02:12:12,479
to do a lot of my research

3640
02:12:10,158 --> 02:12:14,399
just basically apply common sense

3641
02:12:12,479 --> 02:12:17,118
knowledge to it and then i do a lot of

3642
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:19,359
agricultural site research and we're

3643
02:12:17,118 --> 02:12:21,198
lucky to have some friends in like

3644
02:12:19,359 --> 02:12:23,039
agricultural business so you can ask

3645
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:25,439
them questions and they can kind of give

3646
02:12:23,039 --> 02:12:28,158
you some guidance on which way to go

3647
02:12:25,439 --> 02:12:30,078
with certain products and or you know

3648
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:32,479
pest questions

3649
02:12:30,078 --> 02:12:34,559
so yeah i would say don't get all your

3650
02:12:32,479 --> 02:12:37,198
information from pot forums that could

3651
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:39,520
be really dangerous and really bad for

3652
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:40,638
your plants

3653
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:43,360
and just

3654
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:45,920
don't overdo it keep it basic and then

3655
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:47,598
read books don't just run and ask

3656
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:49,039
somebody that you think can answer the

3657
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:51,440
question for you

3658
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:53,279
go get the knowledge yourself read as

3659
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:55,359
many books as you can there are some

3660
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:57,118
really good ones out there i think matt

3661
02:12:55,359 --> 02:12:58,319
has probably about 20 of them in his

3662
02:12:57,118 --> 02:13:01,839
possession

3663
02:12:58,319 --> 02:13:04,158
over the years he's been collecting

3664
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:07,199
but yeah i think a lot of people too

3665
02:13:04,158 --> 02:13:08,479
with um pot plants they just overdo it

3666
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:10,719
they

3667
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:12,799
they think more is better and it's not

3668
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:15,039
it's just a basic plant and it grows

3669
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:17,360
pretty easy it really does

3670
02:13:15,039 --> 02:13:18,560
yeah killing it with kindness

3671
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:20,639
yes

3672
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:23,440
all righty so this brings us to our last

3673
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:25,118
little quickfire questions first one

3674
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:26,559
what is your favorite strain you only

3675
02:13:25,118 --> 02:13:28,960
pick one

3676
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:31,760
oh that's a hard

3677
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:33,679
i don't know like today my favorite

3678
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:35,039
strain would be lavender

3679
02:13:33,679 --> 02:13:37,599
for sure

3680
02:13:35,039 --> 02:13:39,599
um i don't know we've been we've had it

3681
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:42,319
in our collect in our collection for so

3682
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:44,800
long it's like i said it's one no matter

3683
02:13:42,319 --> 02:13:46,880
how crappy i feel i know that i can i

3684
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:49,679
can go to lavender and get some type of

3685
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:51,440
relief so i've got to say her lavender

3686
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:54,078
all the way

3687
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:56,719
and so what is the strain that's just

3688
02:13:54,078 --> 02:14:00,238
least left an impact on you slash just

3689
02:13:56,719 --> 02:14:00,239
didn't impress you at all personally

3690
02:14:00,479 --> 02:14:04,718
oh

3691
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:06,319
my gosh oh this feels like an awful

3692
02:14:04,719 --> 02:14:09,679
question to answer

3693
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:09,679
there's so many of them

3694
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:13,439
oh

3695
02:14:11,198 --> 02:14:15,198
yeah

3696
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:17,198
i i i don't know i don't want to say

3697
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:18,879
like left awful impressions i'd say that

3698
02:14:17,198 --> 02:14:20,879
there's a lot of strains out there with

3699
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:23,039
a lot of hype to them just based off of

3700
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:24,239
names which kind of drives me crazy well

3701
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:26,639
that's and i think that's actually the

3702
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:28,559
next question like so we'll just combine

3703
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:32,800
them together what's the worst strain to

3704
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:32,800
ever gain traction with the masses

3705
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:39,119
i i

3706
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:41,679
i think depending on what strain is

3707
02:14:39,118 --> 02:14:44,078
the current cut of the month club would

3708
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:45,118
be the one that falls in that category

3709
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:47,920
for me

3710
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:49,198
so probably as of lately i'd say some

3711
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:50,960
dumb ass

3712
02:14:49,198 --> 02:14:52,638
cookies or

3713
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:54,800
something like that

3714
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:56,400
i just hate that i don't know why but i

3715
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:58,400
really do

3716
02:14:56,399 --> 02:15:00,078
again like you were asking earlier do

3717
02:14:58,399 --> 02:15:02,319
you feel like this is why i don't feel

3718
02:15:00,078 --> 02:15:03,920
like i'm limiting myself i feel like i'm

3719
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:05,840
setting standards

3720
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:07,760
by doing that because then we're not

3721
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:09,440
running out doing the exact same thing

3722
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:11,679
that everybody else is doing and let's

3723
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:14,238
face it everybody else is doing that

3724
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:16,239
same exact thing

3725
02:15:14,238 --> 02:15:18,238
so yeah nope

3726
02:15:16,238 --> 02:15:21,039
cookies all of those what else is there

3727
02:15:18,238 --> 02:15:23,039
you've got what was you had that nine

3728
02:15:21,039 --> 02:15:25,840
nine pound hammer for a while there

3729
02:15:23,039 --> 02:15:28,158
which that's been a lot a ways away

3730
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:30,480
thank god there was um

3731
02:15:28,158 --> 02:15:32,638
you have like of course like the og kb

3732
02:15:30,479 --> 02:15:34,799
like all of these little ones that pop

3733
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:37,039
up with all these crazy

3734
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:39,039
followings but i do i'm not saying that

3735
02:15:37,039 --> 02:15:40,880
the strain itself sucks because i'm not

3736
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:42,800
saying that i'm just like i think the

3737
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:45,599
hype behind it is

3738
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,199
overplayed and overblown is more how i

3739
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:48,319
would look at it

3740
02:15:47,198 --> 02:15:51,759
totally

3741
02:15:48,319 --> 02:15:53,759
so if you could only smoke one land race

3742
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:55,199
variety for the rest of your life what's

3743
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:56,000
it gonna be

3744
02:15:55,198 --> 02:15:58,799
oh

3745
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,800
my gosh

3746
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:04,158
um

3747
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:07,920
i don't know

3748
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:07,920
that i don't know what would you pick

3749
02:16:08,319 --> 02:16:10,909
whatever that land race thai boat he

3750
02:16:10,158 --> 02:16:13,039
gave me was

3751
02:16:10,909 --> 02:16:14,719
[Laughter]

3752
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:16,560
you don't know what it was

3753
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:18,480
yeah it was like pearl tie i think he

3754
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:21,440
said it was lowland thai

3755
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:24,479
and why why was this your pick

3756
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:26,719

3773
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:05,358
it's it's made by an unknown grower from

3774
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:07,519
oregon and it's a cross of blueberry and

3775
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:09,599
williams one to f2

3776
02:17:07,519 --> 02:17:11,679
um so pretty solid genetics in it and

3777
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:13,679
it's kind of like it's kind of perfumey

3778
02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:15,920
in the same way that like urkel is but

3779
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:18,000
more of like a blueberry and roses type

3780
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:20,960
of thing as opposed to like

3781
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:23,040
a real you know like musky perfume in

3782
02:17:20,959 --> 02:17:25,839
the way that hercules i think

3783
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:29,280
yeah that the blueberry flavors can get

3784
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:30,558
kind of overwhelming at times though

3785
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:33,439
is it

3786
02:17:30,558 --> 02:17:35,679
you like it we actually yeah we played

3787
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:38,000
with some blueberry i i think we may

3788
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:40,478
that might be something we might revisit

3789
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,079
at some point but when we did we played

3790
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:43,920
around with the blueberry and the urkel

3791
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:46,318
we even have some blueberry the northern

3792
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:47,760
lights by blueberry somewhere um but

3793
02:17:46,318 --> 02:17:49,519
when we played with that urkel by

3794
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:51,359
blueberry everything it just smelled

3795
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:53,439
like a giant blueberry muffin and

3796
02:17:51,359 --> 02:17:55,439
everywhere it was like blueberry muffins

3797
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:56,479
all day long and i just got really tired

3798
02:17:55,439 --> 02:18:00,398
of that

3799
02:17:56,478 --> 02:18:00,398
there's a significant demand for that

3800
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:04,639
maybe we should maybe we should

3801
02:18:02,959 --> 02:18:06,318
definitely consider looking back into

3802
02:18:04,638 --> 02:18:08,478
that because i could see maybe the

3803
02:18:06,318 --> 02:18:10,398
northern lights by blueberry being fun

3804
02:18:08,478 --> 02:18:13,119
to play around with you know that might

3805
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:15,039
be something worth looking into

3806
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,960
i think it's it's a cross that's been

3807
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:18,160
done by so many different breeders it's

3808
02:18:16,959 --> 02:18:19,598
going to be hard like you know i think a

3809
02:18:18,159 --> 02:18:21,599
lot of people probably like for example

3810
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:23,359
me when i hear northern lights blueberry

3811
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:25,760
i'm like oh yeah like one of the million

3812
02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:28,000
northern lights blueberries um and

3813
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:30,318
that's just obviously like a knee-jerk

3814
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,718
reaction due to how many just rip-off

3815
02:18:30,318 --> 02:18:34,318
companies that are offering that um

3816
02:18:32,718 --> 02:18:36,558
whereas i think the urkel blueberry

3817
02:18:34,318 --> 02:18:38,959
would be really really unique and as far

3818
02:18:36,558 --> 02:18:42,318
as i know no one offers that

3819
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:44,879
yeah we have those too we do we've uh we

3820
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:47,199
we grew actually a bunch of them out and

3821
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:48,000
it was just like we were both so sick of

3822
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:50,079
it

3823
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,519
when we were done it was like

3824
02:18:50,079 --> 02:18:53,200
that smell

3825
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:55,920
everything was just like a blueberry

3826
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:58,159
muffin it was so overwhelming you just

3827
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:59,519
really got sick of it but i think we

3828
02:18:58,159 --> 02:19:01,439
were sick of it but i don't think

3829
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:04,159
anybody else was it was just one of

3830
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:05,920
those things and the teeth the the tdub

3831
02:19:04,159 --> 02:19:08,478
lines are actually like that too because

3832
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:10,239
they're very that citrus the citrus

3833
02:19:08,478 --> 02:19:13,358
scents and tones that they pick up are

3834
02:19:10,239 --> 02:19:16,478
so heavy and dominant it's like it's so

3835
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:19,519
overwhelming for your palette at times

3836
02:19:16,478 --> 02:19:22,000
yeah okay so lucky last question

3837
02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:24,398
if you could go back in time to any

3838
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:26,459
place collect any seeds which ones would

3839
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:28,638
you get

3840
02:19:26,459 --> 02:19:30,719
[Laughter]

3841
02:19:28,638 --> 02:19:31,598
i don't know

3842
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:34,478
hmm

3843
02:19:31,599 --> 02:19:37,280
that's actually a really good question

3844
02:19:34,478 --> 02:19:38,398
would you go and grab the bundle of uh

3845
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:40,319
you know because who knows how many

3846
02:19:38,398 --> 02:19:41,760
seats there were in the original urkel

3847
02:19:40,318 --> 02:19:44,959
lavender batch but like you know go

3848
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:47,599
sweep them up or what are you thinking

3849
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:50,079
no i don't think i would

3850
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:52,478
i don't think i would i think i'd go

3851
02:19:50,079 --> 02:19:54,000
i don't i don't know i just

3852
02:19:52,478 --> 02:19:56,318
i

3853
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,719
i i think i'm ready to look look at

3854
02:19:56,318 --> 02:20:00,799
something a little bit different too

3855
02:19:58,719 --> 02:20:02,559
um i don't know it would

3856
02:20:00,799 --> 02:20:03,840
i'm not really sure

3857
02:20:02,559 --> 02:20:05,920
i think there's

3858
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:08,159
so much put behind

3859
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:10,799
everybody wanting certain strains and

3860
02:20:08,159 --> 02:20:12,239
whatnot i don't think i'm as obsessed as

3861
02:20:10,799 --> 02:20:14,000
others are

3862
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:15,680
so these kinds of questions i think

3863
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,000
other people think about them quite

3864
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:20,318
regularly and these aren't things that

3865
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:22,799
really have ever crossed my mind and

3866
02:20:20,318 --> 02:20:25,279
i think it's just because i've never

3867
02:20:22,799 --> 02:20:27,279
really been into that whole

3868
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:30,399
the strain craze

3869
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:32,640
uh like the research and who had what

3870
02:20:30,398 --> 02:20:34,799
and what stories this i've just never

3871
02:20:32,639 --> 02:20:37,358
really been that into it

3872
02:20:34,799 --> 02:20:39,840
um i don't know and it would be hard for

3873
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:41,760
me to say if i haven't actually smoked

3874
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,318
this particular strain i can't see

3875
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:46,478
myself really wanting

3876
02:20:44,318 --> 02:20:48,318
i don't know i i guess i'd have to have

3877
02:20:46,478 --> 02:20:50,239
some sort of interest in it to say i

3878
02:20:48,318 --> 02:20:52,478
would want those beans to play around

3879
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:54,559
with and off the top of my head

3880
02:20:52,478 --> 02:20:56,000
nothing that i could particularly think

3881
02:20:54,559 --> 02:20:57,920
of i think

3882
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,600
everything that we currently have that

3883
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:01,040
i'd want to play around with we have

3884
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:03,359
access to

3885
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:06,160
but like i did say though i definitely

3886
02:21:03,359 --> 02:21:09,200
want to get some awesome cbd strain in

3887
02:21:06,159 --> 02:21:11,039
our in our collection to work through

3888
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:13,040
but i don't know as far as that question

3889
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:15,359
that one's tricky

3890
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:18,160
yeah let's make that cbd thing happen

3891
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:20,800
but i mean i know i really i really do

3892
02:21:18,159 --> 02:21:22,239
yeah so i think that just might bring us

3893
02:21:20,799 --> 02:21:23,679
about to the end of it did you have any

3894
02:21:22,239 --> 02:21:26,159
comments or shout outs you'd like to

3895
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:28,960
make

3896
02:21:26,159 --> 02:21:30,639
yeah actually um i'm curious too though

3897
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:32,799
what is it that you're currently working

3898
02:21:30,639 --> 02:21:35,039
with

3899
02:21:32,799 --> 02:21:36,719
like my current project i'm doing

3900
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:38,960
yeah what what strains are you currently

3901
02:21:36,719 --> 02:21:40,959
working with i'm doing i'm finishing off

3902
02:21:38,959 --> 02:21:42,879
the cube of the phantom crackers so i'm

3903
02:21:40,959 --> 02:21:45,039
pretty sure i sent you the bx ones so

3904
02:21:42,879 --> 02:21:47,438
i'm currently finishing the bx2s and

3905
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:49,920
then i'll probably do the bx3s as well

3906
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:51,680
depending on how the bx2s turn out like

3907
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:54,159
if they if they're good enough i'll just

3908
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:55,840
leave it at that but you know i i like

3909
02:21:54,159 --> 02:21:57,520
the idea of finishing the project off

3910
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:59,359
where it should be so

3911
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:01,439
um it's just you know in the sense that

3912
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:03,200
you know statistic i like how you know

3913
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:04,479
at a certain point you can statistically

3914
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:06,720
calculate it should have a certain

3915
02:22:04,478 --> 02:22:08,639
amount of the parent within it and so

3916
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:10,959
yeah the cube seems like the the good

3917
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:12,799
end point but who knows but then i got

3918
02:22:10,959 --> 02:22:14,478
some other stuff off in the the back

3919
02:22:12,799 --> 02:22:16,559
that i'm toying with but

3920
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:18,079
not 100 sure yet i'm gonna maybe see

3921
02:22:16,559 --> 02:22:19,840
where it goes

3922
02:22:18,079 --> 02:22:21,520
there's so many possibilities when you

3923
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:22,960
start putting strains together you never

3924
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:25,200
really know when you're going to be done

3925
02:22:22,959 --> 02:22:27,919
looking through them there's just so

3926
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:30,240
many possibilities it's fun

3927
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:32,079
yeah for sure and i mean i need to take

3928
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:33,119
a page out of your book in regards to

3929
02:22:32,079 --> 02:22:35,520
the um

3930
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:36,960
the organization and the notes because i

3931
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:39,200
got a lot of good seats but some of

3932
02:22:36,959 --> 02:22:41,919
those little baggies the uh the the

3933
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:44,960
riding on them starting to fade

3934
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:48,000
oh yeah no i actually i i sit down about

3935
02:22:44,959 --> 02:22:49,438
once a year i pull our stock of seeds

3936
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,000
like that that all have different types

3937
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:53,920
of packaging and whatnot and i sit down

3938
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,840
and i will re-label and make sure

3939
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:58,159
because you notice after handling and

3940
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:59,760
whatnot some of them will rub off or

3941
02:22:58,159 --> 02:23:02,000
yeah you know you just don't want to

3942
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:04,800
lose what your seeds are but two like

3943
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:06,239
like i was saying we are uh you know i

3944
02:23:04,799 --> 02:23:08,719
hear these interviews and people can

3945
02:23:06,239 --> 02:23:10,559
quote you know months and years and i

3946
02:23:08,719 --> 02:23:12,559
can't i would have to tell you right now

3947
02:23:10,559 --> 02:23:14,318
if you wanted to know these things i

3948
02:23:12,559 --> 02:23:17,359
would have to go into the other room and

3949
02:23:14,318 --> 02:23:19,920
dig out we have stacks and notebooks

3950
02:23:17,359 --> 02:23:21,200
i actually i started out buying mad

3951
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:23,040
calendars

3952
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:25,040
with the big you know the desk calendar

3953
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:26,720
so you have the big squares and he

3954
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:28,720
started out using those but then he

3955
02:23:26,719 --> 02:23:30,879
would fill up the entire note section

3956
02:23:28,719 --> 02:23:33,840
and he needed more space so i started

3957
02:23:30,879 --> 02:23:36,478
buying notebooks and what we do is each

3958
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:38,960
day that you do something you write in

3959
02:23:36,478 --> 02:23:41,119
the you write your month your day and

3960
02:23:38,959 --> 02:23:43,599
the year and you even write the day like

3961
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:45,359
if it's saturday you write down saturday

3962
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:47,439
so you know bet you know you can go back

3963
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:50,079
in reference each time

3964
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:51,760
and we list uh like if you're if you're

3965
02:23:50,079 --> 02:23:53,840
feeding or you're giving them something

3966
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:55,280
you write down what you're giving them

3967
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:57,439
how much

3968
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:59,359
we get real specific if you're doing any

3969
02:23:57,439 --> 02:24:01,120
type of treatments of any kind you write

3970
02:23:59,359 --> 02:24:03,840
it down we write everything down and

3971
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:06,399
then we keep these stacks and stacks and

3972
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:08,398
notebooks and it gives you

3973
02:24:06,398 --> 02:24:10,478
believe it or not you don't use the

3974
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:12,719
majority of it but it's really neat to

3975
02:24:10,478 --> 02:24:14,639
look back through because you can find

3976
02:24:12,719 --> 02:24:17,279
that you have a lot of knowledge there

3977
02:24:14,639 --> 02:24:19,119
you you completely forgot you had

3978
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:20,960
and it tells you a lot about the strange

3979
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:22,880
you're growing so we do we're note

3980
