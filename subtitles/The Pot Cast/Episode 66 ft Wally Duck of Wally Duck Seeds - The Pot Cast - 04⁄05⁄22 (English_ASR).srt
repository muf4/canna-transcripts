yeah thanks for having me on

75
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,099
no worries my friend uh question we

76
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,420
normally ask people to start off is what

77
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:23,419
have you been smoking on recently

78
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,599
um nothing I I gave up about two years

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,780
ago and

80
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,399
um I share a lot of weed still but and I

81
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,620
enjoy seeing people's reactions to it

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,439
but yeah I don't I don't hope at all

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,759
myself anymore uh 40 Years of bonging

84
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,318
took its toll

85
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,939
oh God I love it that's that's some

86
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:46,318
serious passion there and I it's

87
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,519
interesting you bring that up because I

88
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,259
think there's some people in the

89
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,980
community who would probably really

90
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,598
struggle to um to sort of identify with

91
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,000
how that must feel like as you said you

92
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,979
know to 40 years to be so involved and

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,598
to sort of give it up did you find that

94
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,979
like really real like you know is that

95
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:03,658
like the hardest thing you've ever had

96
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,859
to do or is just one of those things

97
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:06,000
that you know you sort of got on with

98
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,819
and did

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,519
oh no it was really hard after so long

100
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:14,818
of doing something you know I go I was I

101
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,759
was awaken bike guy too I was up at 5 30

102
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:20,478
every morning having a few bombs cutting

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,478
my head off and

104
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,620
oh yeah well you got me curious now you

105
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,120
know what what was the uh the rocket

106
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,860
fuel for the day I'm hoping it was

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,879
something sativa if it was early in the

108
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:36,419
morning oh almost always almost always

109
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:38,399
yeah that's that's my go-to for sure

110
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:40,198
uh I love it was there was there

111
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,758
anything specific that was like the

112
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,620
go-to morning smoke or it just sort of

113
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,139
varied with what was on offer in terms

114
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,819
of harvest yeah exactly with the Harvest

115
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,100
but I tell you what I really like I had

116
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,579
some Lao uh that I grew for a while

117
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,120
before I stopped and um that was by far

118
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,918
my favorite uh it did it didn't it

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,019
wasn't like zero to a hundred and three

120
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,839
seconds it gently took you there you

121
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,779
know uh and it let you down gently there

122
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,839
was no lag afterwards it was uh

123
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,939
you still got us high but um you know it

124
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,399
was easy on you and uh definitely the

125
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:17,160
way to start the morning

126
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,560
wow you've uh you've caught me out I'm

127

not familiar with loud I've just quickly

128
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,160
tapped away on Google is it is it the

129
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:26,339
one from loud seeds

130
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,460

from the forums uh he Loops out in uh

132

food on Tani in Thailand beside Lao and

133
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,960
uh he wrote it as some of the best

134
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,620
sativa he'd had so

135
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,959
yeah he sent me some seeds I grew it and

136
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,660
um I grew a fair bit of it I I kept a

137
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,459
cutting and uh we just kept pumping it

138
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,160
out for a while

139
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,019
uh amazing and and now I have to own up

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,539
for being a real Goose I thought you

141
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,399
said loud with like a d on the end if

142
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:59,279
you meant Lao like yeah yeah the the

143
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,079
Southeast Asian variety go duh sorry of

144
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,059
course

145
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,159
that's that's cool to hear okay and uh

146
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,259
and and what was the variety like was it

147
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,300
like more like what people might think

148
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,979
of like a typical Southeast Asian like a

149
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,600
Thai Cambodian sort of thing or how

150
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:13,978
would you describe it in like flavor and

151
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,199
effect

152
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,719
oh yeah it reminded me a lot of Ty it

153
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,759
just didn't seem as potent off the bat

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,880
you know what I mean it did instant

155
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,500
smash you uh but um like I said it was a

156
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,538
bit gentle on you and that's what I

157
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,120
enjoyed about it I was getting older I

158
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:32,899
didn't need that you know zero to 103

159
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,600
second kind of gear uh

160
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:39,359
yeah for sure look you know no one needs

161
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,939
to be smoking like A5 or C5 first thing

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,620
in the morning I bet that's cool that's

163
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:46,079
cool and something I've always been

164
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,079
interested in is I've always heard

165
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,180
speculations around the true lineage of

166
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:54,300
Cali Miss and I've heard people even

167
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,000
throw like Lao and Cambodian sort of

168
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,400
names in the mix have you ever had any

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,439
experience with the the infamous Cali

170
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,060
mist and any sort of ideas around what

171
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,038
the genetics might be

172
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,439
oh yeah we tried it we grew some here

173
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,478
and um I really liked it it was strong

174
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:14,339
good good weed

175
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:16,560
um the the lineage I no idea but um it

176
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:18,179
was familiar to me that's for sure it

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,519
quite quite likely did have some

178
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,740
Southeast Asian in there

179
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,198
nice okay well I mean before I forget

180
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,939
out of all the sort of Southeast Asian

181
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,580
varieties you've tried what are what are

182
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:32,819
some of the most memorable ones to you

183
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:35,279
oh I'd have to be Thai yeah

184
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,979
I grew up on that I that was the first

185
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,519
weed I ever smoked and we smoked a fair

186
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:44,399
bit of it and um there was uh just Thai

187
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,500
sticks when I started and um they

188
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,159
actually made me sick the first time I

189
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,918
smoked bombs I was throwing up but I

190
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,780
went back for more

191
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,459
I love it so it's funny you mentioned

192
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,659
that because before you even said it I

193
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:00,000
was sort of thinking to myself you know

194
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,039
you hear these stories of people getting

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,019
sick off the Thai sticks and some have

196
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,939
even gone so far as to throw the idea

197
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,680
out there that like maybe they had some

198
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,719
sort of opium on them or you know

199
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,400
whether it's wives tale or not have you

200
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,979
ever heard or thought anything about

201
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,959
those rumors yeah yeah we've had big

202
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:20,459
debates about that I I don't I don't

203
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:22,680
think so uh I I think for uh you know

204
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,620
inexperienced people that are not used

205
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,840
to that that sort of weed it was really

206
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:32,219
strong and um

207
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:34,379
yeah I threw up a fair bit but uh no I

208
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:38,459
went back again

209
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:40,559
I love that I love that real men go back

210
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,139
okay that's cool that's cool and I mean

211
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,059
before I forget I just wanted to ask you

212
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,980
I heard from someone I can't remember

213
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,958
who it was so apologies whoever told me

214
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,580
this but they said that when you're

215
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,679
dealing with people who have lots of

216
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,720
pain a lot of people think oh you know

217
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,338
give them an Indica that's pain killing

218
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,899
but then they were like that's actually

219
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,580
not true you're probably actually better

220
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,919
to give them like something really

221
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,100
sativa because the way it like is

222
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,219
stimulating and creative it's actually

223
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,200
better to be distracted from the pain

224
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,019
than to sort of have something that's

225
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,459
like an analgesic for the pain have you

226
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,320
ever thought anything along those lines

227
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,759
have you ever thought like maybe sativas

228
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,740
are actually better for pain killing

229
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,639
properties than people sort of let on or

230
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,639
what's your thoughts

231
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:31,740
my mum she had um pretty severe um

232
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,440
lung problems and um I used to give a

233
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,419
harsh a lot to make Cups of Tea with and

234
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,740
coffee and she ended up biting it too

235
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:39,659
but

236
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,959
um it was mostly sativa because that's

237
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,159
that's what I like and uh yeah she said

238
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,079
just the way it makes you feel the

239
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,579
happiness the Euphoria you know what I

240
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
mean that that's what was getting her

241
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,778
along she said oh there was nothing else

242
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,420
to live for apart from do you know I

243
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:55,620
don't know being a bit happy uh I don't

244
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:57,120
think Indica would have done that for

245
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,120
him might have helped her with the pain

246
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,440
but um as far as uh you know your

247
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,299
well-being you

248
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,360
your sense of happiness that sort of

249
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:08,219
thing I I totally agree so type is

250
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,560
great for that iron

251
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,480
yeah yeah that's cool to hear and you

252
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,939
know uh thanks for sharing that sort of

253
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,200
personal story just to loop back a

254
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,300
question you mentioned you know the

255
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,160
first thing you smoke was Ty the other

256
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,559
question we normally ask people first is

257
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,179
tell me about your first experience with

258
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,119
cannabis you know like paint me a

259
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:27,979
picture how did it go down

260
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,139
um

261
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,139
joints with my brother-in-law I was

262
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,639
about 14 and um I was just sitting here

263
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,740
I

264
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,319
my sister said I wasn't allowed to smoke

265
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,899
any weed till I was 16. but uh my

266
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,540
brother-in-law obviously had other ideas

267
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,379
and uh he passed me the joint I smoked

268
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,740
the whole thing I didn't even do

269
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,759
anything to me and um I smoked too and I

270
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,879
was still

271
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:56,458
sober you know and uh he said he wasn't

272
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,379
going to give me any more

273
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,759
he said I better get up and go and do

274
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,240
something you know to activate myself

275
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,919
then get get it going you know and

276
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,440
um I stepped into the kitchen which was

277
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,819
a step down and it hit me then and it

278
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,060
was just I was in a different place

279
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,940
altogether it was uh fantastic actually

280
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:16,189
I I had the most delicious lamb roast

281
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,220
I'd ever eaten that night

282
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,899
[Laughter]

283
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,879
oh my God please for all of our

284
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,799
International listeners I've been told

285
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,320
on good authority not many people eat

286
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,838
lamb outside of Australia eat some lamb

287
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,480
it's so bloody good oh you can't go

288
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,100
wrong can you it's my favorite meat you

289
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,839
know my my partner will kill me because

290
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,159
she swears up and down pork's better but

291
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,360
I'm like no lamb for life

292
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,179
okay and so

293
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,980
um at that time was there still like a

294
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,078
commercial Thai stick input being

295
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,139
brought in yes

296
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,939
I think it did it kind of uh it stopped

297
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,639
not long after that but um we had

298
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,779
another like up to about I think it was

299
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,240
like 84 or early 85 we had some um stuff

300
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:06,360
they call Golden Buddha it was golden

301
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,200
Thai and uh

302
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,300
oh that was beautiful lovely but I

303
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,640
remember clearly uh

304
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,799
super strong I'd say it was strong in

305
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,500
the Thai sticks yeah

306
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,958
wow that yeah that's that's seriously

307
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,019
strong and I mean there's been ongoing

308
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:27,000
discussion for forever but I'm you know

309
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,159
you've grown a lot of these sort of

310
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,659
Southeast Asian varieties yourself do

311
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,059
you feel like you were ever able to

312
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:35,100
replicate the flavor and effect you got

313
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,919
from the input or like the terroir just

314
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,360
really can't be replicated in that sense

315
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:41,519
uh not not that I lived in Melbourne

316
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,800
back then so we didn't have much chance

317
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,899
of trying to replicate you know a

318
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,240
tropical variety outdoors and we were

319
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,360
growing Outdoors so

320
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,860
um up here though

321
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,778
up in Queensland North Queensland there

322
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,620
was stuff that was very similar to those

323
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:01,078
Thai sticks uh I had some a few years

324
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,620
after I'd first tried weed

325
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:06,239
um that my mum sent me actually and um I

326
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,459
remember riding my push bike and I think

327
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,080
it was the fastest I'd ever gotten from

328
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:13,939
A to B you know

329
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,440
[Laughter]

330
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,740
Little Wally duck just fanging it down

331
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,740
the road

332
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:24,599
that's awesome okay cool cool cool well

333
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,579
yeah I mean up north in like far North

334
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,740
Queensland do you feel like the

335
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:30,778
conditions are similar enough that you

336
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,419
can essentially replicate sort of you

337
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:35,458
know those Thai varieties

338
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:37,379
oh where I live is exactly the same

339
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:39,299
latitude as where they grow a lot of

340
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:42,958
that Thai stick it's like 17 degrees

341
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,278
which is the same as udontani which is

342
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,559
where a lot of that stuff around those

343
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,480
provinces came from so

344
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,219
yeah you can definitely replicate it

345
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,700
down the road there's a climate that's

346
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:57,480
exactly the same as Thailand it's dry a

347
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:00,000
little bit arid uh hot uh I think the

348
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,519
average temperature is like about 29 All

349
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,740
Year lovely

350
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,240
yeah it's not like that where I live I

351
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,879
get a bit too much Coastal sort of

352
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,459
influence where I am sometimes it's good

353
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,458
you know sometimes we have a nice end to

354
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:17,578
the monsoon season but others keep

355
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:19,559
drizzling on and on and uh yeah the

356
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:22,679
weight doesn't like it

357
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,838
interesting and I mean before we go too

358
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,159
much into the Australian medicinal scene

359
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,720
out of curiosity are there any

360
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,360
operations up there that you're aware of

361
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,720
taking advantage of these conditions

362
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,519
no there was a bit of hemp being grown

363
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,339
but it was pretty haphazard the way they

364
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,899
were doing it so I don't know whether

365
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,720
much was well it might have been just

366
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,399
trial crops I don't know I know they

367
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,699
tried some hemp up here I think it was

368
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,879
just for fiber it did very well but um

369
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:53,219
otherwise now I I'm not aware of any any

370
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,958
weed being grown up here for any legal

371
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,680
stuff anyway

372
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,899
yeah it's interesting because uh I think

373
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,399
it yeah like as much as it might be sort

374
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,759
of left of field and maybe not

375
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,759
marketably viable at the moment there is

376
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,338
a huge demand internationally for uh

377
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,860
these Southeast Asian varieties grown in

378
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,899
that actual sort of latitude as near as

379
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,360
close to the actual origin as you can

380
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,839
get and I was thinking maybe that's the

381
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,800
answer I mean unless unless Thailand

382
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,440
steamrolls ahead with all their sort of

383
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,958
plans and actually starts exporting

384
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,740
yeah they probably will they like a few

385
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:34,078
dollars those guys yeah yeah I mean I I

386
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,820
think you'd mentioned to me in a in a

387
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,799
prior conversation that you you were

388
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,720
keeping an eye on the Thai scene do you

389
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,179
have any predictions or hopes for how

390
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,399
that turns out

391
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:45,599
I'd love to see it return to what it was

392
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,519
but I think it's going to take a bit of

393
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,920
searching for them to get that original

394
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,419
stuff back again it's it's been over 40

395
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,059
years so

396
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:55,740
I I don't hold out hope that they can

397
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,879
find exactly the same stuff initially

398
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,698
they're going to have to do a bit of

399
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,100
selection

400
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:04,439
yeah wow I mean it's such a you just

401
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,540
made me realize that like of course the

402
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,519
Thai government doesn't have really sick

403
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:10,679
Thai seeds in a seed bank somewhere like

404
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,120
yeah you're right they're just gonna go

405
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,338
there and assume that what they've got

406
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,019
is probably the real deal

407
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,699
um it makes me wonder you know do you

408
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,159
think that those varieties were lost

409
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:21,719
just like over the years and just

410
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,240
non-selective breeding or do you think

411
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,100
it was more like the sort of Strain

412
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,899
Hunters going in and giving out

413
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,579
feminized seeds sort of thing that

414
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,339
caused it to be lost

415
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,259
nah I think it was just time I don't I

416
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,019
don't think that that I've seen people

417
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:39,000
on like Facebook Thai people they they

418
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,039
grow all sorts of different weed but I

419
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,600
think they know to keep do you know what

420
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,039
I mean keep them separated a bit I I

421
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,320
know they probably crossed them in that

422
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,879
but they're not silly you know they know

423
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,879
that they've got something special in

424
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:53,519
that stuff so I think they do keep it

425
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,559
separate uh but there's lots of

426
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,778
different word there but the bulk of it

427
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,239
seems to be um

428
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:02,458
the uh the stuff available on the street

429
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,400
for instance is is I think Lao everyone

430
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:08,220
seems to agree uh it's it's compressed

431
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,259
brick sort of stuff and

432
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,779
um everyone seems to agree that it's

433
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,160
likely from Lao it's it's quite some of

434
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,399
it's quite good

435
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,419
foreign

436
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,980
it's interesting because when you talk

437
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,480
to a lot of Australians I guess you know

438
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,338
the ones I'm talking to aren't

439
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,860
necessarily super plugged into the

440
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:27,298
Cannabis scene but they smoke weed at

441
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,798
least every now and again and my friends

442
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,960
who have been over there would sort of

443
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,058
say like oh you know like you can score

444
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,519
it at a pub or whatever but it's not

445
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:37,798
it's nothing good I'm guessing that's

446
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,740
not the stuff you're talking about

447
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,538
I think I think it varies with quality

448
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,519
do you know what I mean some some that's

449
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:47,038
good so we had some that was so sticky

450
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,859
that it when you poured it into the bowl

451
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,660
or where it still moved around by it by

452
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:54,240
itself you've seen stuff do that before

453
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,880
yeah well like static or something yeah

454
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,019
that's cool they call it dancing Thai

455
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,840
they call them and um yeah it was pretty

456
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:05,759
potent stuff I I don't think it compared

457
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,619
with the tie stick but uh it was still

458
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,200
quite good weed

459
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:12,779
yeah well okay and I mean just as a

460
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,880
purely hypothetical if if you had been

461
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:16,678
contracted by the Thai government to go

462
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,140
over there and to just get it all sorted

463
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,880
for them would you be like thinking I

464
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,860
need to go around to different farms and

465
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,539
collect some different stock or instead

466
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,459
would you be like you know what probably

467
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:29,038
gonna have better chance just asking

468
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:32,038
some like old Forum heads for like their

469
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:35,220
Thai seed stock instead

470
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:37,798
uh uh probably some of the aisle to say

471
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,620
but it it's probably probably growing in

472
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,779
Lao as well uh it's it's only next door

473
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:44,699
the seed would have absolutely ended up

474
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:46,619
there too and they still grow plenty of

475
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,538
weed there so

476
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,759
I think you can run your backyard like

477
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:52,379
always have been able to and Lao there's

478
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:55,339
been no restriction you know you can

479
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,200
grow a few plants no one cares so yeah

480
00:18:55,339 --> 00:19:00,119
that's cool and I mean I'd heard some

481
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,160
people say that like some of the parts

482
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,599
of like that whole Golden Triangle in

483
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,519
that area

484
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,279
um because they like over the years were

485
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,918
so heavily populated by like militia and

486
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,079
stuff that they probably were less

487
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,160
polluted the genetics so to speak that

488
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,899
were there because you know they were

489
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,058
probably focusing on on like you know

490
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,080
opium and stuff but I'd always got told

491
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:21,058
that they were still [ __ ] with

492
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,678
cannabis around those areas as well do

493
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:25,500
you know anything about that or not

494
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,140
specifically no not really I know that

495
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,140
where I go I I visited on Tani quite a

496
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,880
bit whenever I can and um the people I

497
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,880
hang out with they don't like cannabis

498
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,579
a lot of tires they they really frown

499
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:44,460
upon it uh it's just like the the farmer

500
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:46,918
types the you know that that get into a

501
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,480
bit of weed the the hard-working guy do

502
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,059
you know what I mean he finishes his day

503
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,360
he goes home he relaxes with a few bongs

504
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:56,579
and um yeah that's so interesting to

505
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,619
hear yeah because I I mean not like it's

506
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:00,720
a revolutionary statement but yeah like

507
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:02,399
a lot of a lot of Asian cultures in

508
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,140
general sort of view weed as like you

509
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,780
know it makes you lazy it's not good we

510
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,038
don't like it

511
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:10,200
I think they'd think it's a bit

512
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,058
low-class to do that you know what I

513
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,840
mean that's you're just a low-class

514
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:17,519
farmer you sort of worker guy and

515
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,619
ah okay yeah that that makes sense

516
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,940
doesn't it

517
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:23,879
that that's interesting impression I get

518
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,259
from the ties I I hang out with I talk

519
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,600
to them about and they said no you're

520
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:30,740
not coming here and doing that not not

521
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,740
around us

522
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:35,220
wow would you say that in general

523
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:37,319
they're sort of more into stimulants or

524
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,079
just like alcohol or like nothing

525
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,779
no nothing they're pretty straight yeah

526
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,099
yeah okay well there you go I mean I

527
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,839
guess it must be an interesting

528
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,519
experience for you to go over there now

529
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,899
when you're not smoking or consuming

530
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,099
compared to back in the day like you're

531
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,840
probably seeing and doing different

532
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,819
things

533
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,699
yeah absolutely

534
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:59,519
um I I go there for the food you've

535
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,980
eaten Thai food yeah yeah I can only

536
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,079
imagine how good the food you've had is

537
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,298
yeah and the lifestyle it's really nice

538
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,678
I enjoy it there it's a great place even

539
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,319
without weed

540
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,960
yeah yeah that's awesome to hear okay

541
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,460
cool well let's get back on track

542
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,860
because we had a nice little little

543
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,140
detour there tell me a little bit about

544
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,178
your first grow do you remember the

545
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,100
strain you were growing or do you

546
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,500
remember like what sort of Technology

547
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:26,939
you were using was it outdoor tell me a

548
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,400
little bit about it

549
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,740
yeah it was outdoor and it was just bag

550
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,460
seed that my my older brother-in-law had

551
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:38,640
collected and um it was light harvesting

552
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,400
so I guess it was probably more sativa a

553
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,600
bit of purple stuff amongst it a bit of

554
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,580
hermaphrodite

555
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,219
and um

556
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:50,279
really tall they grew up huge there was

557
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,019
a what about uh Ash Wednesday fires in

558
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,960
in around Melbourne there it was just

559
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:57,019
after that so

560
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,400
1984 I guess uh

561
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:02,339
and um

562
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,100
it was long time harvesting I took it

563
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:08,038
took forever yeah so I I it wasn't

564
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:10,199
really the correct stuff and um it's not

565
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,599
like we we could pick and choose back

566
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,740
then like we can now you know

567
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:19,459
yeah yeah wow like the the OG trim jail

568
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,460
took forever

569
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,740
and we mustn't Trend much of it to like

570
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,480
we do now that's for sure we must have

571
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,538
been a bit lazy with it because I don't

572
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,519
remember lots and lots of trimming then

573
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:34,019
you know what I feel like maybe I'm

574
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,058
maybe I was meant for back then because

575
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,980
I feel like as time goes by I trim less

576
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:41,720
like I'm just like I'm smoking it

577
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:45,000
whatever I'll do it at the time like

578
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,100
there you go okay and then so what was

579
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,740
the progression then from like you know

580
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,298
sort of first grow to like being really

581
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,960
in the thick of it and being like yeah

582
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:57,179
like I really like doing this

583
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,819
uh I I just did hobby growing because I

584
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:01,019
liked smoking so it wasn't until

585
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,399
probably

586
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:06,240
um

587
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,519
oh the late 90s early 2000s that I got

588
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,679
fairly serious about it and started to

589
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:13,319
grow a fair bit of weed

590
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,179
yeah at night and were you still down in

591
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,000
Victoria or had you moved up north by

592
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,159
then I was up north by then yeah

593
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,720
and I was always worried about the laws

594
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,220
here the laws have always been so strict

595
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,220
you know but um

596
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,779
tell me a bit about it because uh I'm

597
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,579
sure there's a lot of people who aren't

598
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,879
aware like what was the legal climate

599
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:38,000
like say in the mid to late 90s for a

600
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,380
cannabis grower

601
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,659
I think it had improved at that point

602
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,360
but earlier on I guess probably in the

603
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:47,039
80s when Joe Bugatti Peterson was the

604
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,099
premier they were they were giving you

605
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:53,339
life in jail for uh production of

606
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:57,119
cannabis it was really serious you know

607
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:58,619
I don't know why they did that but uh

608
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,479
so you didn't want to get caught even

609
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:01,979
with just a few ounces of weed you'd go

610
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,298
to jail for a fair while

611
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:08,940
and um yeah it did change and I think at

612
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:11,339
some point I know I got caught so a

613
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,740
number of times in fact so I think

614
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:16,079
eventually it actually lessened then you

615
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,058
know it was less than down south and I

616
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,579
don't know why but uh

617
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:23,639
the party a political party of the day

618
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:27,538
the laws changed whatever but um

619
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:31,940
it's not so bad these days uh I think a

620
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:34,919
fair bit of weed and um I'm still here

621
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,580
that's that's good if if you can make it

622
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:42,659
through we're all gonna make it

623
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:43,980
okay so at the time let's say like let's

624
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,900
let's start at like you know the late

625
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,240
80s early 90s when it was like you know

626
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,460
quite illegal I'm guessing you weren't

627
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,839
looking online for a friend you were

628
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,360
like I'm just keeping to myself and

629
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,819
staying out of jail or what was it like

630
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,538
I never even came online until

631
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:59,339
um

632
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:04,140
oh it must have been

633
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:06,720
early 2000 2001 2000 2001 something like

634
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,659
that and um

635
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,759
I found this uh actually a lady in

636
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,740
Africa and

637
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,538
um she was selling weed online which I

638
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,038
never thought had happened you know I

639
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:19,259
didn't think we could buy it you know

640
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,500
but she said look it's so cheap why not

641
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:23,940
give it a go and you might get it I'll

642
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,778
see all right I'll give it a go and it

643
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,820
arrived and um so I I did a little bit

644
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:34,798
of business with her I traded Sage with

645
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:38,220
her and uh she sent me hash and weed and

646
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,200
and it all got here yeah

647
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,759
oh yeah it was it was good stuff because

648
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I mean you know outside of Durban you

649
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,640
don't really hear about a lot of South

650
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,319
African weed

651
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,600
I I can't remember I think she was in

652
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,418
Cape Town maybe but um

653
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:54,000
and she had a variety of weight the way

654
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,340
yeah it was a bit average but the stuff

655
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,759
I Grew From it was pretty nice I grew

656
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:03,480
some decentness and swazi uh it was

657
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:06,298
beautiful such a really nice high on it

658
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,419
uh euphoric and you know that feel good

659
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:11,700
stuff which is actually my go-to I love

660
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:14,759
that sort of stuff you know

661
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,519
yeah wow pure swazi back in the day what

662
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:20,640
a treat damn jealous okay

663
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,440
um so before but let's let's wind back

664
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,659
to just before you got online you know

665
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,519
let's say it's year 2000. did you know

666
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,440
anyone else who was growing or you were

667
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,778
really sort of like on your own doing

668
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,600
your own thing

669
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:35,159
oh it was just locals uh there's there's

670
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,719
always been a growing scene up here

671
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,260
where I live

672
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,659
um

673
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:42,778
it's been pretty popular for a long time

674
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,539
uh so Local's just sharing knowledge and

675
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:47,460
sharing seeds and um

676
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:49,980
it was just bag scene too mostly

677
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,380
whatever we could get you know it was a

678
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,339
bit of a hit and miss thing

679
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,200
yeah okay and I mean out of curiosity

680
00:26:55,339 --> 00:27:00,778
was there ever a sort of a definitive

681
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,640
point where you feel like indicas were

682
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:05,099
introduced because you know you hear the

683
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,179
Californian guys talk about like they

684
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,879
were like you know it was all Mexican

685
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:11,519
and sativa and then the hippies brought

686
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,840
the afghanis in in like the late 70s or

687
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,599
something like that do you ever remember

688
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,879
that happening for Far North Queensland

689
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,519
now I would have been down south but

690
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,840
when I was a young fella I um I would

691
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,298
have been I don't know about 15 or

692
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,278
whatever I remember um we we grew that

693
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:30,058
Chicago like I said and I hadn't seen

694
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:31,980
any short fast flowering sorts of stuff

695
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:33,960
at that time but um

696
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,120
there was a news report

697
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,720
from Mildura where they found a whole

698
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:42,778
bunch of uh weed and the plants were

699
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:46,140
three or four foot tall and just one

700
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:47,278
huge bud no branching uh I'd say that

701
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,580
was indica

702
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,778
that I guess yeah yeah yeah well and I I

703
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:54,480
guess you probably hadn't really seen

704
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:56,880
anything like that no I was really

705
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,819
surprised actually but then we we grew

706
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,559
like after that you know bits and pieces

707
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:05,099
and uh there was definitely hybrids

708
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:07,619
amongst it uh it wasn't all sativa I

709
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:10,500
started growing indoors and we were

710
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,000
successful and some with it was taller

711
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,220
stuff they were shorter stuff you know

712
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,900
there was a variety of and I'm certain

713
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,298
that quite a bit of it would have been

714
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,640
hybrid stuff hybrids of those indicas

715
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:22,440
and the survivors we had so

716
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,200
uh but there I don't remember any

717
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,120
specific point where that happened I I

718
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,759
was probably too young

719
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,219
yeah sure so sounds like you're sorted

720
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,839
with that generation that bridged you

721
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,339
know like the old and the new world sort

722
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,139
of stuff which is really cool to get

723
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,778
your perspective on

724
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,820
um out of curiosity were you aware of

725
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:43,259
any of the international seed banks you

726
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:46,200
know I'm sure like

727
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:47,759
the the seed bank and Scentsy seeds and

728
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,038
stuff in the mid 90s were doing their

729
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,359
thing did you know about them or you

730
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:52,798
were like just like now we just work

731
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,979
with what we got

732
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,940
oh yeah we we got scum when I guess it

733
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,319
was

734
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:03,419
would have been the 90s early 90s and um

735
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:05,939
people started growing indoors they've

736
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:08,940
been a a real drought between the uh

737
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,440
imported stuff and you know

738
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,740
um Australia having to look after their

739
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,159
own sales with the with weed and um the

740
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,899
price of weed went to like 750 an ounce

741
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,940
at one point

742
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:23,339
it was ridiculous and that was like

743
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,980
probably for about a year before

744
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:27,959
you know everyone got lights I guess and

745
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,440
decided [ __ ] we gotta get our gear

746
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,440
together here

747
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,759
yeah

748
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,679
you know so

749
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,619
um and yeah that not long after that

750
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,559
that's when we saw our first skunks and

751
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:45,359
uh and Northern Lights I I bought a fair

752
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,759
bit of it because uh

753
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,918
I might have some Colombian pride of

754
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,778
that some Colombian gold and to be

755
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,240
honest the the look of the skunk

756
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:57,419
reminded me of that the high didn't the

757
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,460
the look of it it was golden looking you

758
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,480
know it was really nice looking stuff it

759
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,399
stunk

760
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,440
was it that you know because there's

761
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:07,319
obviously that never-ending debate about

762
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,480
roadkill skunk and I guess I'm wondering

763
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:12,178
do you remember there being like a

764
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,339
particularly acrid skunkiness to it or

765
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,480
was it more the sweet stuff that you

766
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:18,898
hear about

767
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,079
well I've never smelled a skunk but um

768
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:23,639
that first stuff we got it it it

769
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:25,199
permeated it's it really you couldn't

770
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,580
keep it in your pocket in the car you

771
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,399
couldn't take it anywhere it was strong

772
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:31,740
smelling and um I don't know whether it

773
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:33,538
came from seeds from Neville I I'm

774
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,359
actually certain the first stuff we've

775
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:38,819
tried called uh it was called kalska in

776
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:40,678
California then and that didn't come

777
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:42,960
from any seed bank I'm pretty sure they

778
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,820
had friends in California that they got

779
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,100
the and that was a little bit different

780
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:49,918
to be honest but um

781
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:52,678
yeah the smell and like I don't I don't

782
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,620
know about roadkill skunk I I'd have to

783
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,140
smell it to know that you know so uh

784
00:30:55,619 --> 00:31:01,379
yeah yeah look I when I was in the

785
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:04,380
states a few years ago I uh I managed to

786
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:07,679
to drive past the Dead one and pull over

787
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:11,340
and smell it and it's large it's largely

788
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:15,899
like just a really acrid rotten garlic

789
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:18,298
smell like like ammonia and garlic like

790
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:20,398
makes your nostrils flare and that you

791
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:22,500
know like sometimes how you'd smoke a

792
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,298
strain you'd exhale and it really coats

793
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,619
your mouth and your nostrils flare and

794
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:27,240
you get like a bit almost like you've

795
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:29,639
got like something sour in your mouth

796
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,919
yeah like that's sort of what the skunk

797
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,940
thing does but that's interesting to

798
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,278
hear you know it sounds like you had

799
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,600
some pretty OG stuff

800
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,339
um especially if you could really see

801
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,839
that Colombian in it which is which is

802
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:41,519
neat right

803
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,439
um what was your thoughts on the NL you

804
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,898
know we've had such a Resurgence of NL

805
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,399
over the past 15 20 years do you look

806
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:48,959
back fondly on it or do you just think

807
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,459
oh you know it's just another one of the

808
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,159
strains at the time

809
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,778
yeah I I didn't write it that I really

810
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,179
like the scarf to be honest I didn't

811
00:31:54,778 --> 00:32:00,538
think the Northern Lights was just nice

812
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:03,000
so I bought a fair bit of it but um

813
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:04,158
no I didn't uh I prefer the skunk to be

814
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,419
honest yeah

815
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,220
there was a novel for us just to have

816
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:10,200
those sorts of things after what we had

817
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,200
had you know

818
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,960
for sure for sure so continuing on right

819
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,759
you've you've just come online what was

820
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,159
the first thing that happened online was

821
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,480
it discovering one of the big forums and

822
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,880
you're like oh wow like there's this

823
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,099
whole Community or or was it more like

824
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,320
you discovered some local people via

825
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:29,519
some other means how did it all go down

826
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,298
online

827
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,980
I think I met a guy on

828
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:36,538
um I think there's a forum called Sweet

829
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,278
Leaf or something like that that's where

830
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:41,819
I'm at that

831
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:44,159
um African lady and um and I had I had

832
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,000
Oxford Shades and I wanted to know more

833
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,220
about

834
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,440
uh where they come from because I'd

835
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,940
never seen cannabis like that before and

836
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,860
that that's the reason I went on the

837
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,538
forums and

838
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:56,898
um then when a few of them saw they said

839
00:32:54,538 --> 00:33:01,558
they'd never seen it either obviously so

840
00:32:56,898 --> 00:33:03,658
uh one thing led to another and um

841
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,599
I was on overgrowth

842
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:08,340
that's what I learned yeah let me pull

843
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,259
you back before we jump into overgrow

844
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,079
because everyone's so fond about it we

845
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:15,298
we had a lot of viewers ask about your

846
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:17,699
Ducks foot and I guess you know you

847
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:19,379
could boil it down to one or two sort of

848
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,600
questions everyone's asking in different

849
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,640
forms but it was sort of like you know

850
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,859
first off how did you get access to the

851
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,100
Ducks footer originally

852
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:30,599
oh a friend showed it to me he described

853
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:33,658
it a couple of times to me not very well

854
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:36,240
uh he just said it was a a strain with

855
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,278
three fingered leaves on it which I I've

856
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,919
seen that before so it really didn't

857
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:43,859
Peak my attention very much but then

858
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,120
when I saw it I thought whoa it doesn't

859
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:48,298
it didn't even look like cannabis

860
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,398
particularly the first stuff we grew and

861
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:53,639
um it took him a fair bit to get it off

862
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:56,339
the guy that had it and uh I think the

863
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,980
guy ran into trouble had to give away a

864
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:02,038
box of seedlings and that's how we ended

865
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,259
up with some and um from that we only

866
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:07,019
had a few seeds

867
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:10,500
and what we grew we only ended up one

868
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:13,199
ducks for a plan and um

869
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,960
I think though the the other ones the

870
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,579
the non-dux foot ones the the they'd

871
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,898
already had some they'd been crossed

872
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,819
with that already I'm pretty sure

873
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:22,799
because we just crossed by the miles

874
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,639
with the Ducks foot and we ended up with

875
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,339
more Ducks foot and normal normal leaf

876
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,878
cannabis and um

877
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:34,918
that's where it stem from initially and

878
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,940
um I just thought it was so novel that

879
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,279
uh

880
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,800
and I I didn't want to lose it I I just

881
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,119
saw it us you know Silly Aussie

882
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,639
backyarder guys we're going to probably

883
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,858
lose it if we're not careful so I'm best

884
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,079
to try and spread it around so that that

885
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:51,960
doesn't happen you know

886
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:55,199
yeah wow man for the people I love it I

887
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,179
love it and I guess sort of uh as a

888
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,519
follow-up to that what percentage of

889
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,858
those Offspring were coming out with the

890
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,500
Ducks foot phenotype

891
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:06,420
oh it's probably about 50 percent close

892
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,699
enough too it took a few generations to

893
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,260
get it you know completely old Ducks

894
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:13,319
foot and

895
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,300
um I neglected the other trade so I was

896
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,480
no you know I didn't know much about

897
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,940
breeding cannabis at the time and I I

898
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,920
still regard myself as just a hobby

899
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,260
breeder I I just do it for a bit of fun

900
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,220
and to make ourselves some seeds do you

901
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,440
know that

902
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:31,078
there's no no interest in

903
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,179
selling seeds to be honest

904
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,420
um just share a bit of cannabis might

905
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:39,059
make ourselves some seeds and um so you

906
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,559
took a few Generations by the time I

907
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:42,659
made something that ended up on the

908
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,880
market I was a bit embarrassed to be

909
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:47,578
honest how that I'd lost some of the

910
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,980
important parts of it you know by that

911
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,240
do you mean like the like the flavor or

912
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,599
the effect

913
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:57,299
exactly that the flyra the buds look

914
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,920
better to me some people did say they

915
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,920
got some stuff that was more similar to

916
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,139
what we had started with but we saved a

917
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,079
bunch of the seed or I I got my friend

918
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:09,719
to and I thought that was safe I'd asked

919
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,539
him you know make sure you keep that and

920
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:15,899
uh he had a stash in his freezer

921
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:18,659
and um he ended up giving it away which

922
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,400
I just I couldn't believe it I when I I

923
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:22,259
thought oh look I've probably messed

924
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,079
this up a bit I'll go back and get the

925
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,260
originals and we'll try again no they're

926
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,260
gone

927
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,839
heartbreaking yeah yeah I was pretty

928
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,619
disappointed he gave them to his

929
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:41,699
ex-wife's boyfriend and who does that

930
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:44,838
the guy banging your wife your ex-wife

931
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:49,500
I know that a bit

932
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:52,440
oh god oh wow what a turn of events who

933
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,960
would have thought okay well

934
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,460
um interesting stuff so in terms of the

935
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,800
original

936
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,539
um what what sort of flavor and effect

937
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,260
did it have

938
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:05,820
oh it was it varied a little bit this

939
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,280
kind of coffee sometimes a little bit

940
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:11,099
hashy

941
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,040
it's really strong aroma and that's

942
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:17,039
super strong uh I would have rated it up

943
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:19,380
there with um skunk permeation you know

944
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,119
what I mean it's really really you can

945
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,960
smell the plant from a long long way

946
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,579
away

947
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,220
yeah

948
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:29,160
and we I got some other web stuff from

949
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:32,338
uh from Hawaii

950
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:35,639
nah Hawaiian webbed Indica as well I

951
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:38,279
made a trade with a Hawaiian guy because

952
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,980
um it seemed like his stuff

953
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,500
uh was lacking the traits that mine had

954
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,019
and a big vice versa you know so we

955
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,119
thought we'd trade and and see what we

956
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:49,980
come up with and um

957
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,858
he didn't say his stuff was Indica but

958
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,980
it was uh it grew completely different

959
00:37:52,858 --> 00:38:00,119
than mine there was no branching small

960
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:03,179
fat stemmed uh pungent little plant and

961
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:05,220
um super potent and I made a cross with

962
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:07,259
that in Ducks but and that smelled even

963
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:09,299
stronger that that stuff was

964
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,640
now you couldn't hide it there was no

965
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,039
chance I've heard I heard of people

966
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:18,779
getting busted with little tiny buds in

967
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:21,779
their car because it just stuck yeah

968
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,780
wow that's that sounds really cool and I

969
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,640
mean you sort of like I mean you gave me

970
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,500
the perfect segue into the next question

971
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,019
which was that one of our listeners had

972
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,119
asked do you know anything about whether

973
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:35,099
the Ducks foot originally comes from

974
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,858
Hawaii because a lot of people have sort

975
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,720
of said that over the years do you think

976
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:42,480
that it comes from one spot or maybe

977
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:44,219
different places simultaneously and it's

978
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,139
just a common mutation

979
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:49,078
well I think it's just a common mutation

980
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:51,779
and they're not necessarily related yeah

981
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,940
I wasn't sure for a while but I asked

982
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,540
Sam about it too and he said he found

983
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,940
some 20 years before I was doing uh when

984
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:02,880
he started initially reversing cannabis

985
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,740
they found some webbed Leaf stuff but uh

986
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,920
he said he didn't really see a use for

987
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:09,598
it so they never kept it but um I I

988
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,380
think it's just a trade in cannabis that

989
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,480
can appear sometimes

990
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,940
sure and I mean I think that sometimes

991
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,358
the duck's foot can get grouped into

992
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,619
this category as because I'm not sure if

993
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,358
you've been following closely but

994
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:26,160
there's sort of two other well-known

995
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:28,559
plants now that have like you know sort

996
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:31,139
of these very altered phenotypical

997
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:32,400
appearances being the Australian bastard

998
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:33,960
cannabis which you're probably very

999
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,240
familiar with

1000
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,519
um as well as the super freak which is a

1001
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,559
more sort of New Creation

1002
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:42,239
um it's got like a very hyper serrated

1003
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:46,199
Leaf which makes it look essentially

1004
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:48,719
like a fern and uh I guess I'm sort of

1005
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:50,460
interested because those two strands I

1006
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,919
just mentioned ABC and super freak

1007
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,740
they're not regarded as necessarily the

1008
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,079
be-alls in terms of smoke quality and

1009
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:00,838
effect it's more of like a tool to help

1010
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,820
like try to hide the crop but what I've

1011
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:04,799
heard from you sounds like the Ducks

1012
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,380
foot really did sort of stand on its own

1013
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,180
in terms of the effect and the flavor is

1014
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,280
that sort of your impression

1015
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:13,858
oh yeah particularly that hybrid we made

1016
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,920
that was amazing stuff the smell was so

1017
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:18,900
strong that pruning it would make you

1018
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,059
nauseous after a while you couldn't

1019
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,639
really trim a lot of it it made you feel

1020
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:26,338
sick it was like fumes coming off the

1021
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,858
stuff yeah I'd still rate it as some of

1022
00:40:26,338 --> 00:40:32,159
the strongest weed I've ever had it was

1023
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:34,259
really really potent stuff yeah wow did

1024
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,819
that one ever make it out into the

1025
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,960
masses at all

1026
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:42,240
no I just I've lost it through getting

1027
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,119
busted and I I did try and back some up

1028
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:47,899
but that was lost as well too just some

1029
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,460
things are just not meant to be I think

1030
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:53,519
oh no well there you go there you go

1031
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:55,740
okay well the uh Australian bastard

1032
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,539
cannabis recently and and that freak

1033
00:40:55,739 --> 00:40:58,259
stuff and

1034
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:00,358
um

1035
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,700
I don't know I didn't smoke any of the

1036
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,838
the bars and stuff but my friends smoked

1037
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:05,939
the freak and they said it was quite

1038
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:10,440
good but uh it was just a little bit low

1039
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:13,559
yielding but um amazing looking plan

1040
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,000
yeah well hey I'd be curious to know did

1041
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:17,039
you ever smoke it back in the day

1042
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,900
because people always used to say that

1043
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,820
back in the day it was like it gave it

1044
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,920
was like the worst high gave you like a

1045
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:26,519
headache and did you ever experience

1046
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,159
that the Boston cannabis remain yeah no

1047
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:31,920
I never smoked any of it they seem to

1048
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:34,199
think it was hammer and uh by what

1049
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,200
people report it sounds like

1050
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:39,719
um yeah I I remember just reading the

1051
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,699
word Bindi or something like that and

1052
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,219
they would call it Bindi and it was like

1053
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,899
I guess it was like the old equivalent

1054
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:47,699
of like you know the Beast is like you

1055
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,099
know like the shitty rayquaid or

1056
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:52,739
whatever but um yeah there you go I

1057
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:54,720
guess I'm I'm glad you haven't uh you

1058
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:56,578
know had to smoke that in the words of

1059
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,439
skunk yeah I've only got so many breaths

1060
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,940
in this life to fill my lungs with and

1061
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,480
I'm not going to waste it on something

1062
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,480
[ __ ]

1063
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,760
uh okay so sort of jumping back to the

1064
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,980
timeline what was the first strain you

1065
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,240
ever bred and was it intentional or was

1066
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,338
it an accident

1067
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,379
we used to make seeds for ourselves out

1068
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:18,659
of the bank seed we got if any of it was

1069
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,539
any good we because we needed more seed

1070
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:23,639
every year so we'd you'd just like

1071
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,259
filial breed at most times like just pop

1072
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:26,940
the bag seed and breed the brothers to

1073
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,619
the sisters or you sort of out Crossing

1074
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,960
it to different stuff

1075
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:34,920
with whatever we had at the time yeah

1076
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,980
and um just a bit of pardon the pun but

1077
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,780
just potluck what we came up with yeah

1078
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,760
you know what this would be perfect

1079
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,440
because I was talking to a friend the

1080
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,420
other day and because he had just

1081
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,858
recently started taking clones of like

1082
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,659
everything and I was like this is the

1083
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:50,819
way to do it man like it's it's annoying

1084
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:52,799
and it takes space but trust me it's

1085
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,660
good to have the clone of it and I was

1086
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,579
sort of saying to him you know think of

1087
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:58,799
all these legendary clones throughout

1088
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,420
history you know whatever you know chem

1089
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,060
dog OG Kush whatever you want to think

1090
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:06,059
of and uh and I'd always say think about

1091
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:08,099
how many chem dogs have existed

1092
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:10,078
throughout history but we're just never

1093
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:12,660
cloned or we're just you know

1094
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,460
haphazardly made through sort of you

1095
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:16,399
know breeding one thing to another and

1096
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,380
like I guess what I'm sort of getting is

1097
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,880
are there any plants you remember from

1098
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,280
your like you know from the history

1099
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,740
where you're like man I I remember this

1100
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,359
one plant we grew it was so special and

1101
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:29,578
like you know we didn't keep a clone but

1102
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:32,279
like it if if I had it it would stand up

1103
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:33,780
to Modern Elites like oh yeah there was

1104
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,119
a few of them I had some pretty cool

1105
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:40,079
African stuff from that see that girl

1106
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:42,780
sent me someone somewhere one was that

1107
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,720
it smelled so disgusting uh that I

1108
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,040
actually I killed it

1109
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:48,899
I couldn't even give it away it was that

1110
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,059
disco it's not like the stink bug you

1111
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,619
know stink bugs yeah yeah

1112
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:54,838
I couldn't even give it away so I

1113
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:56,099
thought I'd uh I just chucked it in a

1114
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:57,719
box and threw it on top of the cupboard

1115
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:00,780
and I thought one day when we're out of

1116
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,578
weed we might want to smoke there and uh

1117
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,019
months down the track we got it out and

1118
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,420
it was actually quite good the smell had

1119
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:09,239
dissipated and

1120
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,380
I gave some to the guy that I'd offered

1121
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:12,559
it to him for nothing and he wouldn't

1122
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,539
take it and he

1123
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,099
came back later and anyway he said it

1124
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:19,858
was some of the best way to he'd have he

1125
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:21,000
said to me and uh he uh I said so you

1126
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:24,139
could have had the whole lot for nothing

1127
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,139
but you wouldn't take it

1128
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:30,899
no I'm Gonna Keep it I love it oh that's

1129
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:32,879
that's brilliant that's that's cool to

1130
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,619
hear yeah I like that I remember because

1131
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,140
a lot of people might hear that and

1132
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:39,119
think how could you like consider giving

1133
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:41,039
it away it's still weed or whatever but

1134
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,079
it's like I remember one time I was at

1135
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,858
Bodie's house and he's like oh smell

1136
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,660
this it's called ass I'm like really and

1137
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:50,519
he's like yeah he's like American skunk

1138
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:52,920
selection but like smell it and it

1139
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,838
proper smelled like an [ __ ] and I had

1140
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,720
some in this bong and I'm going to smoke

1141
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,759
it and like I'm like hesitantly bringing

1142
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,919
and I'm like am I about to like vomit

1143
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,859
like because if this tastes like it

1144
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,260
smells I'm going to vomit and thank [ __ ]

1145
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:08,098
it didn't translate the first smell at

1146
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,140
all

1147
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:11,160
but I can only imagine what you went

1148
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:13,500
through it would have been fun

1149
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:15,539
definitely not licking your lips type of

1150
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:19,500
stuff eh

1151
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:22,440
that's it that's it right okay well

1152
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,179
um I guess sort of at the point when the

1153
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,858
duck's foot that you said you know you

1154
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,318
felt like you'd lost some traits but it

1155
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:30,239
was sort of going out to Market I think

1156
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:32,940
a lot of people still really viewed that

1157
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:35,879
as like a really worthwhile tool people

1158
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,980
still looking for that seed stock did

1159
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,140
you have any idea at the time that it

1160
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,300
was going to go on to become this sort

1161
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:46,379
of legendary stock that like people are

1162
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:49,800
hunting for like you know wild right now

1163
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:53,460
no but um so I see a few people still

1164
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,140
sell it uh I've I've seen it around I

1165
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,900
see it on um some

1166
00:45:55,139 --> 00:46:01,139
um some Facebook pages and that sort of

1167
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,240
thing so it's definitely still out there

1168
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:04,500
yeah I mean that's what that's what I

1169
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:06,838
think is really interesting is like

1170
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,280
people are really looking for it like

1171
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:09,779
it's sort of funny because it'll it'll

1172
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,819
tie into when we talk about some of your

1173
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,980
strains later on with like the MBS and

1174
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:16,019
stuff but I feel like there's a

1175
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,240
similarity between your ducks for and a

1176
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:20,880
lot of Tom Hills lines it's like it's

1177
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,739
these old lines that people are really

1178
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,260
hunting for now because they're like

1179
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:27,179
they recognize the value some of these

1180
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,160
older lines how just inherently within

1181
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:31,559
them but I guess you're sort of saying

1182
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:33,179
at the time you weren't really aware it

1183
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:34,380
was going to have this ripple effect it

1184
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:36,358
did

1185
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,579
no like I said I was just trying to save

1186
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:41,460
the stuff because I just thought there

1187
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:43,980
was some importance with that leaf and

1188
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,780
um it might be useful to people you know

1189
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,000
trying to hide their their plants and

1190
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,780
stuff like that so

1191
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
um

1192
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,380
and I'm sure it probably helped a few a

1193
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,599
few people probably grew stuff where

1194
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:58,858
they weren't able to before

1195
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:02,160
stench yeah yeah yeah yeah right the

1196
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:04,078
camouflage aspect's undeniable yeah take

1197
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,059
me a little bit forward now I mean maybe

1198
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,400
it was happening at the time how did you

1199
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:10,619
first meet Moon Unit and what sort of

1200
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,139
got you first thinking about the idea of

1201
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:16,500
you know the Wizards of Oz

1202
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:20,519
I was just on the forums on um I see mag

1203
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:23,219
and he posted some stuff uh Zoid field

1204
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,079
I'm pretty sure it was his his side feel

1205
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:28,559
you hear you've heard of Sword feel oh

1206
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:30,720
yeah yeah so I'll contact him and um

1207
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,119
with him being an Aussie you know I want

1208
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,379
to know more about it looked awesome and

1209
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,720
um

1210
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,119
so I I got some seed out off of him and

1211
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,980
I I grew some it was amazing stuff I

1212
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,559
can't believe that uh

1213
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,480
just an average Aussie guy could make

1214
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:48,299
something so good out of a few land

1215
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:51,000
roses that was an excellent effort yeah

1216
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,740
not many of the people that breed

1217
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
cannabis actually do that you know what

1218
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:57,179
I mean they always start with someone

1219
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,980
else's stuff whereas he made it himself

1220
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:04,799
so yeah and with uh non-european or

1221
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:08,460
American genetics yeah it's just like

1222
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,720
Aussie bushweed PNG gold and some of

1223
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:14,220
that uh Chinese Indica stuff so

1224
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:16,559
incredible stuff okay and so I guess you

1225
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:21,899
guys just sort of hit it off from there

1226
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:23,460
yeah and so well we we decided we'd try

1227
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,800
and make a few things that people might

1228
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:28,199
like and uh he did it all and it wasn't

1229
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,700
me I just sent him some seeds and spoke

1230
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,838
with him on the phone and that sort of

1231
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:34,259
thing so

1232
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:36,659
it was more his work than mine you know

1233
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,940
oh look I feel like you know you

1234
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:41,818
contributed pretty well so that's that's

1235
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,559
great to hear and um and and how do you

1236
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,239
how did you feel about it all you know

1237
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:46,199
when you're releasing the seeds do you

1238
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:47,639
were you sort of thinking like it's

1239
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:49,379
going pretty well maybe we should keep

1240
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:51,239
doing this or like yeah what was your

1241
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,099
thoughts at the time

1242
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,858
oh we were pretty excited we had a few

1243
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:57,480
dramas though that the MBS that had

1244
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:59,460
Hermes in it and we weren't able to

1245
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,240
shake them and

1246
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:04,679
um was lovely stuff so we we gave it

1247
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:06,779
some additional patients back then

1248
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:08,578
because even though medicinal cannabis

1249
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,700
wasn't a big thing then it was starting

1250
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:15,000
to take off and um

1251
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:17,219
it gave you the munchies severely so uh

1252
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,679
this this guy he was he was dying of

1253
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:21,679
AIDS apparently and uh he'd lost the

1254
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,179
will to live he wasn't eating anymore

1255
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:27,059
you know he was down to like 90 pounds

1256
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:29,159
or something like that and um one of the

1257
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:32,400
guys that we gave the stuff to he uh he

1258
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:36,239
gave him some MBS and he he reported he

1259
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,180
put on like 30 pounds in two weeks and

1260
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:41,519
um and like eight ten years later he was

1261
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:43,858
still alive he was he reckons it saved

1262
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:47,519
his life that that week

1263
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:50,639
hey I I believe you that's incredible

1264
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,318
that and I mean you know without excuse

1265
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,480
me um you know without trying to get too

1266
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,858
sentimental like gosh that must make you

1267
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,858
feel like it's all sort of worth it

1268
00:49:55,858 --> 00:50:00,779
right oh absolutely yeah well I said

1269
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:03,239
maybe this one the word was new I I just

1270
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,680
thought that was a bit fanciful

1271
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:07,139
um additional weight it was just a way

1272
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:09,539
for our stoners to generate to

1273
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:12,118
legitimize what we were doing

1274
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:14,219
hahaha yeah I get what you mean yeah and

1275
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:18,358
and that's the thing what you sort of

1276
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:20,818
just touched on is a concept that I

1277
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:22,380
actually uh first heard from uh our

1278
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,179
buddy Todd

1279
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,500
um and he I don't know if he coined the

1280
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:27,358
term but I sort of looked into it

1281
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,900
afterwards and he he said this term

1282
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:32,519
hippie guilt and it's like what you just

1283
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,440
touched on like this guilt we feel

1284
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:37,380
around the fact that like we just like

1285
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,818
this plant and we you know as you said

1286
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,559
you know like we give it the name

1287
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:41,940
medicinal to sort of try to legitimize

1288
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,259
what we're doing and it's like the

1289
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,940
reason why we do that is because we

1290
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,440
inherently feel a bit guilty because

1291
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,260
we're made to feel that what we're doing

1292
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,000
is bad and uh so if we can say it's

1293
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,160
medicinal well now it's actually good

1294
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,079
it's interesting did you ever feel like

1295
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:57,000
that did you ever feel like because I

1296
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,280
certainly feel that way at times like as

1297
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,838
in like on the one hand I know that

1298
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,240
clearly what I'm doing is fine it's a

1299
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,558
plan the laws are wrong but they don't

1300
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:06,358
determine what's right or wrong

1301
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,579
ethically and I know that growing a

1302
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,019
plant is not inherently wrong but at the

1303
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:12,900
same time you do feel a bit bad because

1304
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:15,000
there is like this stigma in society and

1305
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,338
culturally it's not as accepted as we

1306
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,318
might like how have you wrestled that

1307
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:21,420
sort of dynamic of you know being

1308
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:22,920
essentially a real famous guy in a scene

1309
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,780
that you can't tell any of your friends

1310
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,358
about for the most part

1311
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,619
oh no I've felt the same thing but I I

1312
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,318
tell you what I read something recently

1313
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:33,780
or heard someone say that um all

1314
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:35,219
cannabis usually is medicinal and when I

1315
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,619
thought about that I thought well yeah

1316
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:39,118
it is even if we just you know lifting

1317
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:41,880
your spirits do you know what I mean

1318
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,000
like like I said my mother was doing you

1319
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:49,200
know that that's medicinal and so we're

1320
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,420
all using it for a medicinal reason uh

1321
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,598
and like I said when I stopped smoking

1322
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:56,519
the and the realization that I I have

1323
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:58,260
been using it medicinally for a whole

1324
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:01,500
bunch of things that I I didn't even

1325
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:03,599
know I had uh so

1326
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,000
yeah absolutely all cannabis use is

1327
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,940
medicinal in my opinion too

1328
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,480
yeah yeah look I tend to agree you know

1329
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:16,380
like um I think it's somewhat Vogue for

1330
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,780
people to have reasons for why they're

1331
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,400
using cannabis and like yourself at a

1332
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,680
certain point I just tried to move away

1333
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,318
from that and it's like I'm not going to

1334
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,239
say I'm using it for X condition or why

1335
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:28,858
condition I'm just going to say I'm

1336
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:30,479
using it it's just improving my quality

1337
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:34,558
of life and that's all that needs to be

1338
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:37,858
said really yeah I I agree 100 100 yeah

1339
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,180
yeah Okay cool so just to jump back on

1340
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:40,858
to the topic you know you're talking

1341
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:42,838
about some of the work you did with Moon

1342
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:46,199
Unit and the MBS and stuff

1343
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:48,000
how how did those strains get received

1344
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:49,858
domestically did you feel like you were

1345
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,900
getting any traction within the Aussie

1346
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:53,759
community at all or it was mostly going

1347
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,500
to overseas people

1348
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,540
oh there was never really an official

1349
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:01,139
release of The Siege we generally just

1350
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:03,058
shared them to be honest so um

1351
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:05,338
and I do recall

1352
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:07,619
uh some some American people came down

1353
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:09,539
to the Mardi grass and someone shared it

1354
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:12,599
with them there and that that reported

1355
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:15,440
it to be pretty well they liked it so it

1356
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,440
was well received

1357
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:22,740
um we smoked a lot of it

1358
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:26,338
that's that's always a good Testament so

1359
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:28,019
I mean was there like a a somewhat

1360
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:29,519
active Australian scene or did you

1361
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:31,559
really feel like it was just the two of

1362
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,358
you out on an island doing your own

1363
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:35,400
thing like no one else was really on the

1364
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:39,000
same level so to speak

1365
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:41,639
no we even I went to a Sydney Cannabis

1366
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,800
Cup at one point uh there was I think it

1367
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:45,318
was two years in a row

1368
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,200
um so I went to one of them this

1369
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:51,960
red-headed guy he was crazy guy and um

1370
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:54,899
when I went first visit him was uh on

1371
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,338
our way to the Mardi Gras and

1372
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,858
um

1373
00:53:56,338 --> 00:54:00,420
so the goal was to to visit him and

1374
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:03,179
we're all going to hook up and then then

1375
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,980
we'd go to the Mardi Gras from there and

1376
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:08,279
he wanted to enter a whole bunch of his

1377
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:11,400
stuff he grew in this Factory and

1378
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,019
um I I'd no long been busted and so I

1379
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,720
was a little bit cautious I didn't know

1380
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:17,579
that I was heading there to go and spend

1381
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:20,539
two nights in a

1382
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:20,539
cannabis Factory

1383
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:27,659
yeah and um

1384
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:30,780
he didn't end up going we went to the me

1385
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:34,019
and his friend uh Rodwell went to the uh

1386
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:36,980
the Mardi Gras on our own and um we

1387
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:42,900
entered these staff I entered some hash

1388
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:43,740
uh there wasn't a a section for hash and

1389
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,019
um

1390
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:48,239
I'm not sure they said it spoiled it

1391
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:49,679
poor on some of the people because they

1392
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,319
smoked the hash and then the rest of the

1393
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,940
weed didn't do anything for them

1394
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,800
[Laughter]

1395
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,179
I didn't care if we won or not that

1396
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,980
wasn't the you know it was just about

1397
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:00,659
entering you know what I mean that

1398
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,300
that's what that might be about it's

1399
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:05,460
it's a celebration of cannabis and it's

1400
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,079
not to be taken seriously the Lord we

1401
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,338
won you know that that's not what it's

1402
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:09,839
about yeah

1403
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:13,139
it was actually it was a really great

1404
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:16,078
weekend it was we had a great time

1405
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:18,118
cool and like did you did you bump into

1406
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,220
any other Growers while you're in nimbin

1407
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:22,260
for example

1408
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:24,679
oh I'm sure I did it was it's a bit of a

1409
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,680
blur though

1410
00:55:25,338 --> 00:55:31,019
okay okay so I guess sort of the picture

1411
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,300
I'm getting is that like it wasn't like

1412
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:35,219
you bumped into another Wally duck

1413
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,660
equivalent where you're like oh hey you

1414
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:39,539
you're like sort of doing your own thing

1415
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:42,539
in the way that we are no I did meet on

1416
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:45,358
the second time um I told um

1417
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:47,159
a couple of American guys about it and

1418
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,558
one of them met me there he was like I

1419
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:53,699
end up being the um

1420
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:56,880
uh one of the IC uh Tech guys uh you

1421
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:58,439
know he did the forums and um

1422
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,180
but I thought it was great they ended up

1423
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,980
and coming and staying in Australia for

1424
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:03,598
at least six months

1425
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,280
because it was a bit of an eye-opener

1426
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,079
for them they thought we had a great

1427
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,839
kind of Lifestyle a good outlook on life

1428
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:13,200
and and that sort of so

1429
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:15,358
yeah yeah definitely any of our uh

1430
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,338
American listeners who are wondering if

1431
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:20,000
life in Australia would be good the

1432
00:56:17,338 --> 00:56:20,000
answer is yes

1433
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:27,539
I've invited heaps of people and they've

1434
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:29,880
all really enjoyed it and

1435
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:32,279
um some of them are particularly a

1436
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,858
Finnish guy said it spoiled them forever

1437
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,940
they want to come back and they're not

1438
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:40,739
satisfied living in Finland anymore

1439
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:42,599
yeah look I can't comment on Finland but

1440
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:44,519
I can definitely say as much as I enjoy

1441
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,619
spending time in the states

1442
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,539
um I'm always very happy when I touch

1443
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:50,880
back down on Australian soil I feel like

1444
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:52,558
when I see the Australian native plants

1445
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,700
I'm like yeah all right I'm home I feel

1446
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,000
good

1447
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:59,639
um so moving the story along you know

1448
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,219
was there a definitive moment where sort

1449
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:03,659
of you and Moon Unit sort of split ways

1450
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:05,338
or was it just sort of like a slow

1451
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:07,259
fizzle and you both just sort of went

1452
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,460
your different Pathways in life how did

1453
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,099
that progress

1454
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,659
are we kept in touch but he got busted

1455
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:15,000
and

1456
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:17,460
um I haven't spoken I think might have

1457
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,800
spoken to him after that that I can't I

1458
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,019
don't know what happened and I've got a

1459
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,059
phone number for him somewhere I keep

1460
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:27,539
meaning to try it to see what he's doing

1461
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:30,180
whether it works or not I don't know but

1462
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:32,880
um he's in New South Wales so I gather

1463
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:35,098
the being busted there wasn't very good

1464
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,240
for him I don't know whether he went to

1465
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:39,000
jail or

1466
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:41,879
or what happened but um

1467
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,500
and uh so yeah that was basically the

1468
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,019
end of that I'd like to get in touch

1469
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,599
with him again he's a good guy

1470
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:50,579
yeah I mean not that I've looked

1471
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,440
particularly hard but I I guess it's

1472
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:55,140
probably safe to assume he dropped off

1473
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:58,980
after that for just obvious legal

1474
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:59,940
reasons yeah him him and and Ken Kang

1475
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,659
achiever

1476
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:05,099
uh I I think sometimes

1477
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:06,719
um you lose interest after you get in

1478
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:09,960
that much trouble you know what I mean

1479
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,358
and you you figure you better put your

1480
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,338
energy in another Direction and I think

1481
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:16,558
that's possibly what both those guys

1482
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:18,779
have done I still speak to Kanga a

1483
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,099
little bit and um I think he's lost

1484
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,619
interest in

1485
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:26,099
way after being in jail for a couple of

1486
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:28,500
years it really tainted it for him yeah

1487
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:30,660
yeah I can I can imagine I mean while

1488
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,519
we're on the topic of Kanga like I'm

1489
00:58:30,659 --> 00:58:34,618
guessing you were around when he was

1490
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:36,239
pretty active and during the time when

1491
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:37,920
he was bastard

1492
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,500
yes yeah we were going to do a

1493
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,818
collaboration together but um

1494
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,460
yeah that

1495
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:46,500
quickly ended

1496
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:48,119
yeah wow and I mean

1497
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,739
um did you have any thoughts because you

1498
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,900
know there's a lot of rumors around the

1499
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:55,078
Kanga bust and people link it to Gypsy

1500
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:56,700
Nirvana and various other people did you

1501
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:58,440
have any thoughts on how that went down

1502
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:00,779
or you just think it was probably just

1503
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,298
you know like a loose lips sort of thing

1504
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,740
oh I think someone found their plans I

1505
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:06,539
think that's what happened I don't know

1506
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:08,338
how but uh

1507
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:10,079
that's what I seem to recall I don't

1508
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:11,639
think he thinks anyone got him in either

1509
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,359
I think it was just

1510
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:18,598
luck of the draw yeah bad luck

1511
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:20,400
yeah sure sure I mean while we're on the

1512
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:22,380
topic of candy you know the strain that

1513
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,200
always gets referenced is the the Mullen

1514
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:27,780
Bibby Madness I I feel like it's one of

1515
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:30,000
those strains where it's just got you

1516
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:33,119
know so much mythology attributed to it

1517
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,519
and it's just so hard to find verifiable

1518
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,318
information about it what are your

1519
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:38,940
thoughts on mother Madness did you ever

1520
00:59:37,318 --> 00:59:41,400
try it do you think it is as good as

1521
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,019
people sometimes make it out to be where

1522
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,059
do you stand

1523
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:48,619
I I heard about that stuff when I was

1524
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:50,819
like 15 and uh a guy was a

1525
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:53,519
brother-in-law's friend was heading up

1526
00:59:50,818 --> 00:59:54,960
north from where we were in Melbourne to

1527
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:56,639
get some I gave him a hundred dollars so

1528
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,380
yeah get me some and a hundred dollars

1529
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,139
for me when I was 15 was a fair bit of

1530
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:03,680
money

1531
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:03,679
he didn't come back

1532
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:08,838
it must have been pretty good weed but

1533
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:12,420
uh

1534
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:14,639
everyone seems to think that everything

1535
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,680
from Mal and bimby ended up being called

1536
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,539
or nimb in the area

1537
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:21,598
ended up being called that do you know

1538
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:24,539
what I mean and uh would the plea would

1539
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:27,119
the real uh Marlin madness please stand

1540
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:29,279
up sort of scenario yeah

1541
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,019
I I had heard that as well and the story

1542
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,119
made sense right like as soon as the

1543
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:34,500
name came out every dealer in Muslims

1544
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,660
calling their weed Mull and bimby

1545
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,818
Madness I guess

1546
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:40,980
um from what you saw of what Kanga was

1547
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:43,259
doing you must have sort of thought oh

1548
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,780
well I guess given how much he's messing

1549
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:49,680
with it like it must be pretty alright

1550
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:52,079
yeah and he sent some to Neville and

1551
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:55,199
Neville said to him that it was as good

1552
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,960
as the highs he had had so I gather it

1553
01:00:55,199 --> 01:01:02,098
was pretty good gear I didn't I didn't

1554
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,358
smoke any of Kangas pot but um

1555
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:04,980
it seemed to have a pretty good

1556
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:07,739
reputation

1557
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:10,380
yeah look I'm sure it was just you know

1558
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:11,519
killer outdoor sativa like largely like

1559
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,960
what you were probably growing for the

1560
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:14,159
most part was probably and that's the

1561
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,599
other thing I try to remind myself is

1562
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:19,078
like you hear all these stories but back

1563
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:21,000
in the day like good weed was hard to

1564
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:23,400
find so people probably remember things

1565
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,900
like you know really well is like yo

1566
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:28,019
that was the best way to had him forever

1567
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,858
like sort of thing yeah yeah I'd agree

1568
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:31,380
with

1569
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:33,179
um that Nostalgia thing people say that

1570
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,680
a lot of a lot of the weed we were

1571
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:37,139
getting was [ __ ] and then suddenly we'd

1572
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:38,818
have something good and it would waste

1573
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:40,980
us you know I mean because our tolerance

1574
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:42,779
was down we hadn't had anything good for

1575
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,338
a while and

1576
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,680
um I think there's a lot of Truth to

1577
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:48,659
that

1578
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:51,239
yeah certainly well I mean while we're

1579
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:52,920
on the topic of melon Madness I've

1580
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:54,838
always wondered myself and maybe you can

1581
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,358
chime in to some degree maybe not all

1582
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:59,099
good if you can't do you think mum baby

1583
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:01,440
Madness is different to Old Mother

1584
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:03,119
sativa because I feel like as much as

1585
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,280
people maybe try to talk about them as

1586
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,880
different different they they maybe are

1587
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,880
just the same

1588
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:12,298
I I don't know to comment on that really

1589
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,059
I've seen both of them and they're

1590
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:17,818
obviously both the titles but uh

1591
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:19,700
relationship I don't know there seems to

1592
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:23,338
be uh

1593
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:26,279
rumors that Mullen bimby was tied across

1594
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:28,679
with Colombian but um I'd heard that

1595
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:31,980
yeah I don't know

1596
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:34,558
yeah interesting okay

1597
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,780
um yeah I I definitely heard that and I

1598
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,660
thought because that's also one of the

1599
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:42,900
rumored genetic combinations of uh

1600
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:44,159
uh Cali mist and so I was like well that

1601
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,900
would make sense because that was meant

1602
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,578
to be a really good sativa so like it

1603
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,798
would make sense a similar genetic

1604
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:52,680
combination could make a good good

1605
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:53,818
sativa but uh interesting interesting

1606
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:55,858
stuff

1607
01:02:53,818 --> 01:02:57,119
um and I I don't know if you know the

1608
01:02:55,858 --> 01:03:00,119
answer to this but when we were talking

1609
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,640
about the Zoid Fuel and um the Aussie

1610
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:05,039
bushweed was that like old mother sativa

1611
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:08,338
or like a different Aussie bushweed

1612
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:11,039
oh it was just sativa as far as I know

1613
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:13,440
there was a fair bit of that around Moon

1614
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:15,480
seemed to think that it was uh

1615
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,980
a bit it was must have been strong

1616
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,980
because he said it was a bit paranoid in

1617
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:21,358
inducing you know a bit scary and he

1618
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:24,599
said that's that's what he liked about

1619
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,739
uh the China is indicatively added to it

1620
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:28,798
because he said that was like

1621
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:30,739
anti-anxiety sort of stuff and uh it

1622
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:34,858
leveled it leveled the high out a lot

1623
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:38,159
and I I tend to agree that uh Zoid view

1624
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:40,558
was real uh you know feel good weed and

1625
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,379
uh you know gave you that nice uh

1626
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,880
buzzing in the head actually I would

1627
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,700
write it similar to

1628
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,680
um MDMA actually it was similar to that

1629
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:52,679
yeah yeah like it was a really

1630
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,759
psychoactive and

1631
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:56,818
um

1632
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:00,420
I don't know just a buzz in the head and

1633
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:02,519
a Euphoria you know uh I'd say it was

1634
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:05,519
quite similar to that sort of stuff

1635
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:08,400
wow that's a testament to the power of

1636
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:10,798
the old world strains right absolutely

1637
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,960
that was strong you know people say and

1638
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:15,179
unless you unless you were smoking with

1639
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:19,220
stuff that was scary and paranoid it

1640
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:19,219
wasn't that strong I I disagree

1641
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:26,338
fun you know and happy and uplifting and

1642
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:29,159
be very very strong you know yeah

1643
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:33,838
certainly certainly okay

1644
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:37,679
um and in terms of like the z99 across

1645
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:39,000
you guys made with um your c99 can you

1646
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,558
tell us a little bit about that did you

1647
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,358
just send the seeds over the Moon Unit

1648
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,980
how'd that one go down

1649
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:49,920
yeah I sent uh some I was F5 c99 I think

1650
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:52,260
something like that and um and then he

1651
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,240
just uh he sent me back samples of

1652
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:56,760
different females that he'd used

1653
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:58,558
and um we must had a similar taste in

1654
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:02,760
weed because we both selected the same

1655
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:05,040
one without talking to one another yeah

1656
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,960
it actually uh it was similar to the

1657
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,420
Zoid fuel it must have taken trades from

1658
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,699
that because it had that nice little

1659
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:15,420
buzzing sort of in your head

1660
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:18,239
type of High and um we we still grow it

1661
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:19,680
I've still got z99 uh we still grow that

1662
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,719
stuff

1663
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,460
you read my mind because the next

1664
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:26,159
question was a question from one of the

1665
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,260
listeners who said uh please pass on my

1666
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,779
thanks to Wally huge fan of his work he

1667
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,220
sent me some z99 to test out years ago

1668
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:34,140
and I got to be honest I did a pretty

1669
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:36,000
pitiful job of doing it Outdoors at the

1670
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,500
time but I'm really curious to know if

1671
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,298
he has any more maybe I can do a better

1672
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,298
job this time around

1673
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:43,619
sure yeah I win I have a bunch of say 99

1674
01:05:42,298 --> 01:05:47,280
cents

1675
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:49,318
and um I still make seeds because

1676
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,460
there's still a people are still growing

1677
01:05:49,318 --> 01:05:52,460
cannabis out there so

1678
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:57,058
well we gotta we've got to use this

1679
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:58,679
opportunity now if anyone was interested

1680
01:05:57,059 --> 01:06:00,359
in getting some of your seeds what's

1681
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:01,679
what's the best Avenue for them to make

1682
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:03,659
contact

1683
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,639
well I haven't really solved any on on

1684
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:08,639
that guy that has trouble receiving

1685
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:11,940
funds and that was my always my problem

1686
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:13,318
you know I don't know how but um and I

1687
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,380
did was going to do a collaboration with

1688
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:19,500
another Aussie guy recently uh Mr dots

1689
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:21,260
and um he had the same trouble how was

1690
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:24,119
he going to receive the funds without

1691
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:26,819
disclosing his address or do you know

1692
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:27,740
what I mean that sort of thing so

1693
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:29,699
um

1694
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:33,058
interesting stuff interesting stuff

1695
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:35,519
maybe I'll put you in touch with uh some

1696
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:36,780
friends of mine who who run a seed bank

1697
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:38,719
in Australia they might be able to help

1698
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:41,220
you out there you go

1699
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,318
there you go this chat just became

1700
01:06:41,219 --> 01:06:46,858
worthwhile

1701
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:50,460
uh okay cool cool cool so um in terms of

1702
01:06:46,858 --> 01:06:52,199
your seeds would you largely say that

1703
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,460
you know knowingly or unknowingly

1704
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:55,019
they're sort of bred for Aussie

1705
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:58,079
conditions because I know that like you

1706
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:59,639
know being Queensland native myself a

1707
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,900
lot of strains really struggle with the

1708
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:02,879
heat you know do you think these might

1709
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:06,059
be good candidates for people in those

1710
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:08,400
environments where like heat is a factor

1711
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:10,440
yeah sure we're definitely testing that

1712
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,900
out by just growing them here ourselves

1713
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,179
that's largely why we make them for our

1714
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,220
local friends to grow

1715
01:07:15,179 --> 01:07:20,338
um because you know there's never enough

1716
01:07:17,219 --> 01:07:23,159
good weed around us there so and we've

1717
01:07:20,338 --> 01:07:25,500
got a great climate and when I didn't

1718
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:26,940
have any weed I'd I'd want I'd want to

1719
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:30,119
go and find some and it was always just

1720
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:31,740
[ __ ] so uh I thought well if I could

1721
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:34,920
make enough seed to share with the

1722
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:36,479
locals uh then when I run out of weed

1723
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,639
there's going to be something decent

1724
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,099
just like you know around right with any

1725
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,318
luck anyway so um

1726
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:45,420
that's what I've been doing and it's

1727
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:50,159
I get a lot of paper resume these days

1728
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:52,338
for that very thing and um we you know I

1729
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:54,538
do benefit from it

1730
01:07:52,338 --> 01:07:55,858
that's great to hear that's great to

1731
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:57,660
hear you know what it's so funny you

1732
01:07:55,858 --> 01:08:00,440
mentioned that because I always said

1733
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:03,420
that was uh that was my initial

1734
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:05,519
motivation for making seeds as well was

1735
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:08,280
I just thought if there ever came a time

1736
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,358
where I wasn't able to grow for myself I

1737
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,420
just want to be able to know that I

1738
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:14,578
could buy some decent quality of someone

1739
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,199
and uh I think I think it does sort of

1740
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:18,239
help you get there you know

1741
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:20,639
absolutely it's it's definitely a foot

1742
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,019
in the door if you had shared some seeds

1743
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,359
with someone and they've grown some good

1744
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,920
stuff the chances of you being able to

1745
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:28,380
acquire some often it's pretty good

1746
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,100
isn't it yeah that's it it's like a

1747
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:34,920
business proposition I love it

1748
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:37,679
okay and out of curiosity uh you know

1749
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,480
because I I think that Instagram and the

1750
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,520
internet in general has done a lot for

1751
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:43,198
the Cannabis Community undoubtedly and

1752
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,679
it feels like in Australia there's a

1753
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:49,439
newly emerging sort of scene that's a

1754
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:51,539
bit more how shall you say online not

1755
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:53,219
just in like the internet sense but as

1756
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:55,140
in like we're coming online we're all

1757
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:56,579
linking up like we're all nodes in a

1758
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:59,039
network and we're linking with each

1759
01:08:56,579 --> 01:09:03,778
other and I feel like there is slowly

1760
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:06,060
beginning to emerge a clone sharing

1761
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:08,279
scene and I don't think it's really

1762
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,960
there just yet but I think in the next

1763
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:12,779
few years we'll really see it come to

1764
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:14,819
fruition where you know because often

1765
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:16,859
people come on the show and they say oh

1766
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:18,900
you know what like what's you know UK

1767
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:21,359
has cheese what does Australia have and

1768
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:23,879
I'm like oh there isn't really a one

1769
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,739
thing that Australia has that gets

1770
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,298
passed around per se

1771
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:29,818
but I feel like in time that might

1772
01:09:27,298 --> 01:09:32,219
happen as clones get traded have you

1773
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:34,140
noticed the development of like a sort

1774
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:36,980
of cannabis scene or a clone sharing

1775
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,980
scene per se

1776
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,338
um I hope that's beginning I've got to

1777
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:43,500
say we're probably like the last cab off

1778
01:09:41,338 --> 01:09:45,659
the rank using the internet for these

1779
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,298
sorts of things a lot of Aussies are

1780
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:50,519
very paranoid people and and they're shy

1781
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:52,798
away from technology you know I've Got

1782
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,239
Friends that don't even have phones and

1783
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:57,060
half of them don't know how to use them

1784
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:59,718
and they've never dared to go on a

1785
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:02,280
cannabis site you know

1786
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:04,079
it's a bit funny even you know people

1787
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:06,300
like you and I and you know we're out

1788
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:08,819
there on there and nothing much happens

1789
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,579
to us and in fact it increases our

1790
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:13,198
knowledge and our Network basing and

1791
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:15,238
friends and you know I don't know it's

1792
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,779
been beneficial and these guys are

1793
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:22,019
missing out on that you know yeah yeah

1794
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:23,519
yeah hugely hugely I've the amount of

1795
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:25,140
messages I've had over the years from

1796
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,820
people who are like oh you know I want

1797
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:29,159
to grow but I don't want to get busted

1798
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:30,960
but I was sort of thinking if they were

1799
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:33,719
going to be busting someone like they'd

1800
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,520
probably go for like a big fish uh

1801
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:37,198
what's your secrets to not being busted

1802
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,600
and I was just like oh just like don't

1803
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:41,219
sell hard drugs or like associate with

1804
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,860
people who do hard drugs that's sort of

1805
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:45,300
My Only Rule it's like if you do or sell

1806
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:47,519
hard drugs I probably won't really want

1807
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:49,079
to hang out with you and that's always

1808
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,159
kept me really safe you know because I

1809
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,179
pretty much just hang around with other

1810
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,119
Growers

1811
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:56,340
now that's a good rule

1812
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:58,439
yeah right while we're on the topic

1813
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:00,420
what's your thoughts on the Australian

1814
01:10:58,439 --> 01:11:01,879
legal climate you know obviously in the

1815
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,859
past few years we've seen the ACT

1816
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:07,679
legalize two plants per person per

1817
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:09,479
household uh with an upper limit of six

1818
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,000
plants per household so you know three

1819
01:11:09,479 --> 01:11:13,439
people pulling their plants together do

1820
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,140
you feel like that's a step in the right

1821
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:18,479
direction or are you uh sort of thinking

1822
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,920
like it's you know it's a Band-Aid for a

1823
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:21,059
bullet wound what can you do with two

1824
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,039
plants

1825
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,420
yeah it might be a star you know they

1826
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:26,460
they're not allowed to possess seeds

1827
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,140
though seeds are still illegal for them

1828
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:30,179
they can have two plans but where are

1829
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,039
they going to get the seeds

1830
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:33,840
that's a very good question

1831
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:36,479
crazy isn't it

1832
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,239
yeah well you know so I got an uncle who

1833
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:41,339
lives in Canberra and uh and it was when

1834
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:43,319
I was talking to him he sort of painted

1835
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,539
how logistically challenging it is

1836
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:48,359
because I was like oh you know I'll send

1837
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:50,760
you down this sick clone I've got he's

1838
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:52,139
like oh nah and I'm like why it's like

1839
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,719
it's definitely better than whatever you

1840
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,340
got and he's like oh yeah but like then

1841
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,899
I can't keep a clone of the current one

1842
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,819
I'm running like I can flower one out

1843
01:11:57,899 --> 01:12:02,279
and keep one clone and that's that's all

1844
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:04,139
I can do and so I realized very quickly

1845
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:06,359
I was like you can't like you can't grow

1846
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:08,760
anything new because if you even pop one

1847
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:10,319
new seed you can't keep a clone of the

1848
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,260
other thing you're running and then so

1849
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:15,359
that's gone and like it it really does

1850
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:17,940
paint you in a corner doesn't it

1851
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:21,059
yeah if you're law abiding like that guy

1852
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:23,399
I've never really been like that so

1853
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,039
oh look I I only ever abide the law

1854
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:26,279
myself

1855
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:28,560
[Laughter]

1856
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:31,319
no I think I think uh I think that I'm

1857
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:34,100
maybe a couple of plants over the count

1858
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:34,099
at the moment

1859
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:41,698
um so I guess the question then needs to

1860
01:12:39,238 --> 01:12:43,738
be asked what to you would be an

1861
01:12:41,698 --> 01:12:45,419
acceptable medical system I know that in

1862
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:46,979
an Ideal World you know we can grow as

1863
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,319
many plants as we want and we can go

1864
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:50,639
nuts and have fun what do you think

1865
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:54,539
would be like

1866
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,400
a realistic proposition that you would

1867
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:57,960
be able to get on board with while also

1868
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,658
recognizing like you know like they're

1869
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:03,719
not going to give us infinite plans like

1870
01:13:00,658 --> 01:13:06,658
what's a happy medium in your opinion

1871
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:08,340
oh just what they did in Thailand

1872
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:10,319
recently is a bit of an example of what

1873
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,480
they you know six plants you can grow at

1874
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:15,179
home treat yourself you know I think

1875
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,500
Australia is crazy where

1876
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:17,940
um only the doctor's allowed to give you

1877
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,039
medicine because you have no idea

1878
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:21,779
because you're an idiot you know you

1879
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:23,219
have an idea it's your body you should

1880
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:24,779
be able to whack in it what you it's not

1881
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:28,319
as it's not harming you you know what I

1882
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:30,300
mean and um bit of home remedy sort of

1883
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,380
stuff why not what's wrong with that you

1884
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,360
shouldn't you don't have to pay anyone

1885
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:35,579
to do that why should we have to go to a

1886
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:37,019
doctor and get a bloody script to get

1887
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:39,059
stuff do you know what I mean when we

1888
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:40,800
know we've studied it we know what's

1889
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:43,620
wrong we know how to treat it we know

1890
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,840
where to get the staff why can't we

1891
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:47,158
I that's what I'd like to be able to see

1892
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,260
people doing you know what I mean

1893
01:13:47,158 --> 01:13:51,059
they're not idiots they're they know

1894
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,960
what's good for them a lot of people you

1895
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,940
know

1896
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,219
that's the sort of thing I'd like to say

1897
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:58,319
I'm worried that

1898
01:13:56,219 --> 01:14:00,600
um to be honest with legality here that

1899
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:03,658
we could end up in a situation where

1900
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:05,520
growing a few plants is worse than it is

1901
01:14:03,658 --> 01:14:09,420
now you know because that could happen

1902
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,860
it's a real real issue where you know

1903
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,719
the government's mates are all making

1904
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:14,219
money selling pot but you can't even

1905
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,640
grow a few of yourself because you're in

1906
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:19,859
bloody big trouble you know

1907
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:22,440
yeah I remembered when they legalized

1908
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:24,000
those two plants in act I I said to my

1909
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:26,279
buddies I said you watch they're going

1910
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,520
to come out now and say now that we've

1911
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:31,800
legalized it anyone who's genuinely

1912
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,719
needing cannabis will do that and anyone

1913
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,800
who grows more than that is a dirty

1914
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:38,279
Criminal

1915
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:41,219
exactly exactly you know you can't grow

1916
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:43,439
tobacco obviously because that's really

1917
01:14:41,219 --> 01:14:45,060
frowned upon and

1918
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,799
um possession of large amounts of

1919
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:49,080
tobacco that that's a federal offense

1920
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,219
you're in big trouble you're in worse

1921
01:14:49,079 --> 01:14:52,738
trouble than if they found you with a

1922
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:54,600
pound of weed you know yeah and that's

1923
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,879
what I'm worried about what might happen

1924
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,739
with weed in the future if you let's say

1925
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,359
you want to grow for everybody else but

1926
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:02,939
you don't have a license and you get

1927
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:04,799
caught doing it then you're indeed [ __ ]

1928
01:15:02,939 --> 01:15:06,899
you know

1929
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,940
yeah it look it would be it would be

1930
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:10,619
super concerning if that happened didn't

1931
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:13,019
it especially because yeah Australia's

1932
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:15,840
got such a hard on for like tightly

1933
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:17,460
regulated pharmaceutical dispensing like

1934
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,739
I mean on the one hand it's good I think

1935
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:21,960
that Australia has that grip on the

1936
01:15:19,738 --> 01:15:23,519
pharmaceutical dispensing because it

1937
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,198
stops pharmaceutical industries from

1938
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,480
like bribing doctors and stuff like that

1939
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,738
but on the other hand it's it rate gives

1940
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:30,359
that point you said where it's like

1941
01:15:28,738 --> 01:15:32,339
there's so many checks and hurdles that

1942
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:35,579
you like you have to go to a doctor to

1943
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:38,219
grow a plant that you know is safe yeah

1944
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:39,658
we're so tight with some things so I

1945
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:42,119
understand that they want to do things

1946
01:15:39,658 --> 01:15:45,238
properly but when the rest of the

1947
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:46,738
world's done 350 studies and they've

1948
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:48,658
come up with something and then we've

1949
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:50,218
got a you know we've got to do exactly

1950
01:15:48,658 --> 01:15:52,920
the same study and we come up with the

1951
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:55,800
same thing it's a bit ridiculous isn't

1952
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:58,440
it yeah yeah gosh I wish we could go

1953
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,600
back to like back in California when

1954
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:03,299
they had the 215 days like I think that

1955
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:05,280
model is the dream but I'm sadly I'm not

1956
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,199
convinced it'll ever happen in Australia

1957
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,698
but like yeah where people can just like

1958
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:10,500
grow at their house and go to a

1959
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:12,779
dispensary and sell their product to a

1960
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,640
dispensary and then like like what

1961
01:16:12,779 --> 01:16:16,198
medical was for the longest time in sort

1962
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,380
of California that would be the dream

1963
01:16:16,198 --> 01:16:22,439
but um but yeah who knows whether it'll

1964
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:25,199
actually happen and um I mean on on the

1965
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:27,539
tail end of the legalities side Yeah you

1966
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:29,279
mentioned earlier you you got busted is

1967
01:16:27,539 --> 01:16:31,859
is there any chance you'd be willing to

1968
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:34,800
tell us a little bit about what happened

1969
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:37,198
or what sort of punishment you faced

1970
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,360
I I broke that rule that you mentioned

1971
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:41,639
earlier

1972
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,960
with people that were doing some I

1973
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,719
didn't know that's what they were doing

1974
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:50,039
but um that's that led to me getting

1975
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:51,899
busted and um twice quite a lot quite a

1976
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:56,719
large amounts both times

1977
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:56,719
and um yeah I'm I'm still in trouble

1978
01:16:57,859 --> 01:17:04,380
so even as far as like um

1979
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:05,698
legal growing and that went I I probably

1980
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,859
wouldn't be able to do that for quite a

1981
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:09,779
while yeah I think they shut us down for

1982
01:17:07,859 --> 01:17:13,259
quite a while at least five years maybe

1983
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:15,059
I might be 10 years I don't know but uh

1984
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:17,280
I mentioned that to someone the other

1985
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:20,280
day who's got some legal stuff going on

1986
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,840
down south and said that uh I probably

1987
01:17:20,279 --> 01:17:23,519
wouldn't be even allowed into one of

1988
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,900
those facilities and he said well

1989
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,640
they're not guard they're not carding

1990
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:28,019
you on the way through the door there's

1991
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,840
no one checking your idea or anything

1992
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:33,140
absolutely you can go in you'll have a

1993
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,140
look around

1994
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:38,579
but yeah I don't think I'll be a

1995
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,719
candidate to grow legally for quite some

1996
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:42,359
time

1997
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:44,640
yeah look I was thinking about it myself

1998
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:47,399
when you mentioned that to me and I

1999
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,780
thought maybe in the future it'll become

2000
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:50,698
more possible I know I've I've

2001
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:51,960
interacted with a few of the legal grows

2002
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:53,939
in Australia and I know that the

2003
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,340
majority of them are being operated by

2004
01:17:53,939 --> 01:17:58,019
people with virtually zero cannabis

2005
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:01,440
experience but just have been able to

2006
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:04,920
get the financial backing and so

2007
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:07,259
and and a lot of those companies are

2008
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:09,060
producing very lackluster results that

2009
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:12,000
even they themselves are acknowledging

2010
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:13,739
is like not good and so I think maybe in

2011
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,020
a few years once they've lost enough

2012
01:18:13,738 --> 01:18:17,459
money they'll be like maybe we should

2013
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,760
get someone in here who can actually

2014
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:22,380
grow weed yeah you want you you'd think

2015
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,960
they would eventually come to that

2016
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:28,260
conclusion you know it's frustrating

2017
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:30,719
isn't it yeah look and I'm talking about

2018
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,640
this for you you know like I'm hoping

2019
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:34,439
that you get a call because

2020
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,900
um it would be a shame for your talents

2021
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:39,359
to go to waste like in that respect

2022
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:43,139
yeah I definitely do it but there'd want

2023
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:44,939
to be some reasonable money in it though

2024
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:48,060
well they make pretty good money you've

2025
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:49,919
seen the price of medicinal weed hey oh

2026
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:51,960
God I remember when it first came out

2027
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,880
and it was like 900 an ounce from the

2028
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:56,579
pharmacy I think now you can get

2029
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:58,260
reasonably good quality for about 500 an

2030
01:18:56,579 --> 01:19:00,840
ounce from the pharmacy but you're sort

2031
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:03,920
of like for a legal system I was hoping

2032
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,920
the price point might have

2033
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,840
especially since you can go down the

2034
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:11,219
road and get something better cheaper

2035
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:13,380
and black market yeah that's it okay so

2036
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:15,539
the next question I had for you and this

2037
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:17,340
was something I was really interested to

2038
01:19:15,539 --> 01:19:19,800
ask you was

2039
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:22,739
I'm always asking myself more than

2040
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:25,079
anything I would like to be regarded as

2041
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:27,000
someone who helped progress the

2042
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:29,100
Australian scene in some form or another

2043
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,439
and so I thought I should ask you that

2044
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:34,199
exact question what to you do you think

2045
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:35,879
is the most impactful thing the average

2046
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:38,158
person can do

2047
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,140
to help progress the scene do you think

2048
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,179
that maybe for example it's like getting

2049
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:43,920
online and networking and just like just

2050
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:45,600
trying to like you know like build that

2051
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,279
Network or do you think like for example

2052
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,440
for a long time I've always told people

2053
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,939
just keep Fino hunting trust me like

2054
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:53,399
when you finish hunt you find new

2055
01:19:50,939 --> 01:19:55,439
special plants and it makes the scene

2056
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:57,779
interesting like what do you think is

2057
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,939
the best thing someone can do

2058
01:19:57,779 --> 01:20:02,579
God that that's not easy everyone's got

2059
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:04,439
different skills don't they so they've

2060
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:06,059
got different stuff to give some people

2061
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:07,738
are way better at talking than others

2062
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:09,179
some people are just gardeners and they

2063
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:12,559
want to be left alone

2064
01:20:09,179 --> 01:20:12,560
whatever they're good at I guess

2065
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,940
that's that's a good answer that's

2066
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:20,340
that's actually a lot more uh you know

2067
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:22,439
wide spectrum than I expected and that's

2068
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:23,960
really good so I guess maybe I can make

2069
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:27,119
it a bit more specific

2070
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:31,020
for you what do you think is the most

2071
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:33,859
impactful thing you did for the scene

2072
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:36,780
oh just become involved I think

2073
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:39,299
mainly yeah I've I've shared a lot of

2074
01:20:36,779 --> 01:20:42,479
seeds and um

2075
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:45,119
uh connected people together that sort

2076
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:47,459
of thing all that helps

2077
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,559
you know definitely definitely

2078
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:51,960
definitely definitely and I mean as a

2079
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,760
curiosity what's your thoughts on Fino

2080
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,859
hunting are you the sort of person who's

2081
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,360
like always Keen to crack some new seeds

2082
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:59,819
or are you pretty content just running

2083
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:01,799
from clone where do you sit

2084
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:03,979
oh I think it's exciting cracking new

2085
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:07,699
stuff all the time don't you yeah yeah

2086
01:21:03,979 --> 01:21:07,698
this is twice alive

2087
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:12,839
yeah like and it's an interesting one

2088
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:15,179
because it then goes next into this

2089
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,219
conversation of like some people don't

2090
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:19,739
like the fact I say this but in

2091
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:22,560
Australia at least I always say that I

2092
01:21:19,738 --> 01:21:24,419
recommend people have a day job and

2093
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,260
don't grow for a living because I feel

2094
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:27,480
like

2095
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:29,219
whenever I meet someone who's like oh

2096
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:31,979
you know I would really love to grow

2097
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:34,980
something new but I've got this strain I

2098
01:21:31,979 --> 01:21:37,079
grow and I have to yield 4p in order to

2099
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:40,019
pay the bills and

2100
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:42,000
you know etc etc and I'm like oh you've

2101
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:44,340
sort of backed yourself into a corner

2102
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,198
with your hobby because it's no longer

2103
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:48,360
your hobby it's now paying your bills

2104
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:51,000
and thus you don't have that freedom to

2105
01:21:48,359 --> 01:21:52,979
maybe pop some Zoid fuel or something

2106
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,779
new that maybe doesn't quite yield as

2107
01:21:52,979 --> 01:21:56,879
much but in the long term could be like

2108
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:58,800
really cool and

2109
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,600
um I've always felt like that's been a

2110
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,579
good bit of advice because the people I

2111
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,039
know who do really good Fino hunting and

2112
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:06,359
really have fun with cannabis it's it

2113
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:07,859
doesn't pay their bills for the most

2114
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:09,960
part like maybe it gives them a bit of

2115
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:12,119
pocket money but like it's not the

2116
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,859
primary income Source what's your

2117
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:16,140
thoughts on that sentiment feel free to

2118
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:18,779
totally shoot it down if you don't agree

2119
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:21,539
no maybe we need some guy that just does

2120
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:23,460
that you know and he gets some some

2121
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:26,279
money out of it everyone pays him for

2122
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:28,679
his uh you know his success his

2123
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:30,300
additions to to everything because he's

2124
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:31,800
doing a job too so he's looking for

2125
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:34,920
something for all these guys that are

2126
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:37,440
doing you know the big jobs and

2127
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:40,500
um he should be included as well maybe

2128
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:43,439
that's another job you know like being a

2129
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:46,020
uh paying breeders to find us better

2130
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:49,139
stuff stuff like that so there's the the

2131
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:50,460
Fino Hunter guy and uh he should do well

2132
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:52,860
too

2133
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:55,500
yeah yeah I actually I say that to

2134
01:22:52,859 --> 01:22:58,259
people all the time I say look just for

2135
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:00,719
simple numbers if you grow a crop and

2136
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:02,460
you make ten thousand dollars off it and

2137
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:04,260
I pop new seeds and because I'm like

2138
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:05,939
Fino hunting and some of the Finos are

2139
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:07,500
[ __ ] and don't yield much like maybe I

2140
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:10,198
only get like five thousand dollars

2141
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:13,260
worth of crop but I get a few new plants

2142
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:15,178
that are special like could you not make

2143
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:16,860
the argument that whatever plants I

2144
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:18,719
found are sort of worth five thousand

2145
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:20,599
like that was the opportunity cost for

2146
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,279
me to find those plants was like

2147
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:25,500
foregoing that crop and a lot of people

2148
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:27,000
get really uptight when they hear that

2149
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,158
because they're like oh you're implying

2150
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,420
that a clone's worth five grand and I

2151
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:31,799
don't know if I'm saying a clone's worth

2152
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:34,199
five grand per se but I'm definitely

2153
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,659
saying in that theoretical situation

2154
01:23:34,198 --> 01:23:38,519
someone foregoed a bunch of yield to

2155
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:41,158
find that new plant which maybe wasn't

2156
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,679
optimized in the setup

2157
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:46,019
um yeah what's your thoughts about that

2158
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:48,060
can't he get a percentage of what the

2159
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:50,340
guys that are growing it are making you

2160
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:52,199
know five percent or something

2161
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,920
they could you know cut him in on the

2162
01:23:52,198 --> 01:23:55,738
deal

2163
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:58,199
yeah it seems like a reasonable sort of

2164
01:23:55,738 --> 01:24:00,419
like middle ground right well I do that

2165
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:01,439
with the guys with seed we have an

2166
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:03,600
arrangement

2167
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:05,579
you know some like to pay

2168
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,320
straight up front some like to give a

2169
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:09,719
percentage of what they get or whatever

2170
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:12,359
and uh it works as long as we're all

2171
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:15,119
getting something and we're all happy

2172
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:18,238
that guy should be cut in as well

2173
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:20,279
yeah that's actually a really sort of uh

2174
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:21,539
even killed Middle Ground I like that I

2175
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:23,158
like that I hadn't hadn't thought about

2176
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:24,840
that too much but yeah that would be

2177
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:27,960
good and I guess it inherently sort of

2178
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:30,420
promotes like unity and uh like

2179
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:32,579
collaboration just by virtue of how

2180
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:34,800
you're doing the transaction exactly

2181
01:24:32,579 --> 01:24:36,420
we're all working together toward you

2182
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,699
know the guy at the end who's

2183
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:40,619
smoking his stuff saying wow I'm glad

2184
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:44,279
they chose this one but then that goes

2185
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:46,260
back to your final Hunter mate isn't it

2186
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,658
yeah definitely and and you know what

2187
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,340
you've said is really true you know I've

2188
01:24:48,658 --> 01:24:52,379
been thinking about this a lot recently

2189
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:54,719
and I've I've decided to give out some

2190
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,640
of my closer guarded clones because I

2191
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,380
thought it's all well and good for me to

2192
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:00,119
think this is the best [ __ ] on Earth but

2193
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:02,520
if I'm only cropping a couple of ounces

2194
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:05,099
of it every few months like who's ever

2195
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:07,980
going to get to taste it yeah exactly

2196
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:10,140
yeah I'm all about that too I I we've

2197
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:12,000
got some cuttings years ago from

2198
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:14,880
overseas which we never thought was

2199
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,819
possible and um

2200
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,340
at first I thought we should Garden

2201
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:22,380
tightly do you know what I mean but uh

2202
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:24,900
eventually I thought well I I'm going to

2203
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:27,239
lose them like like I thought with the

2204
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:31,198
the Ducks but I'm going to lose this if

2205
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:33,718
I do do that if I share and let other

2206
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:34,979
people reap the rewards the benefits or

2207
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:37,859
whatever then

2208
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:40,678
when when I lose mine which I will I can

2209
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:43,619
get it back of somebody and that's

2210
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:45,840
exactly what happened and

2211
01:25:43,619 --> 01:25:48,000
um that way we met I managed to keep one

2212
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,460
oh I think it must have been at least

2213
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,880
six years ago that we got those cuttings

2214
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:54,960
and uh the one I got I I it's still

2215
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,000
running

2216
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,579
and everyone's really happy and I can

2217
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,840
get it anytime do you know what I mean

2218
01:25:58,579 --> 01:26:02,399
it'd be pretty selfish just to keep it

2219
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:05,579
to yourself no no I've got it and you

2220
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:07,500
can't have them uh you know cannabis is

2221
01:26:05,579 --> 01:26:09,840
supposed to be about sharing as far as I

2222
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:10,500
remember when I first started

2223
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,679
um

2224
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:16,020
yeah definitely definitely I I'm I feel

2225
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:18,119
like I'm I'm slowly treading the same

2226
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:21,080
path you did years ago so that's that's

2227
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:23,579
cool to hear I'd be interested to hear

2228
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:25,439
what's your thoughts on the Australian

2229
01:26:23,579 --> 01:26:27,420
cannabis scene in general I'm not sure

2230
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:29,479
if you're on Instagram much but I guess

2231
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:32,158
from sort of what you see on the forums

2232
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:34,379
I would largely describe the Australian

2233
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:36,000
cannabis seen as quite similar to the

2234
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:38,039
American in terms of like the trends you

2235
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,539
know like OG and cookies and all that

2236
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:41,880
it's you know sort of popular over here

2237
01:26:39,539 --> 01:26:43,560
nowadays with the younger Growers what's

2238
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,699
your thoughts on the scene from what you

2239
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:47,159
see

2240
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:49,259
yeah I've seen that too I I not long got

2241
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:51,500
on Instagram it took me a minute to work

2242
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:54,000
out how to use the darn thing though

2243
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:56,399
it wasn't like Facebook where you join a

2244
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,238
group and there it all is you know but

2245
01:26:56,399 --> 01:26:58,799
um

2246
01:26:57,238 --> 01:27:01,079
yeah they like a bunch of kids with new

2247
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,579
toys aren't they I I've noted at the

2248
01:27:01,079 --> 01:27:04,920
moment they're all trying those new

2249
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:08,819
things and you know I've got Bruce

2250
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:11,699
Banner or I've got cookies or and um I

2251
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:13,198
think it's it's cool to see but um I'd

2252
01:27:11,698 --> 01:27:15,259
like to see more of them growing some

2253
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,819
stuff from like ice seeds for instance

2254
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:19,980
uh those survivors of those guys bring

2255
01:27:17,819 --> 01:27:21,238
out oh they're awesome I love that sort

2256
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:23,698
of stuff I'm so glad there's someone

2257
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:26,218
doing that that there's a market that

2258
01:27:23,698 --> 01:27:29,519
they can you know make some money out of

2259
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:31,800
and and produce stuff like that

2260
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,620
hell yeah I remember when I spoke to him

2261
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:37,980
he he sold me a Lewis uh he sold me on

2262
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:38,939
the Cali China I was like oh send me

2263
01:27:37,979 --> 01:27:41,819
some now

2264
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:44,158
[Laughter]

2265
01:27:41,819 --> 01:27:46,920
yeah with a few of those I did grow some

2266
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:49,519
crosses a guy made with some of their

2267
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:52,739
stuff and uh that was awesome I loved it

2268
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:54,780
it's great to see that on and that

2269
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:58,138
there's enough people around you know

2270
01:27:54,779 --> 01:28:00,539
growing that sort of stuff that uh

2271
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:02,279
it's it's becoming more popular at even

2272
01:28:00,539 --> 01:28:05,100
things

2273
01:28:02,279 --> 01:28:06,599
yeah hugely I feel like Hayes you know

2274
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,579
someone said it the other day and it

2275
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,199
made sense like they said whether it's

2276
01:28:08,579 --> 01:28:12,420
related or not seems like since

2277
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:16,019
Neville's passing the the demand for

2278
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:18,119
Hayes is definitely feels more apparent

2279
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,560
yeah yeah there's been a re-emergence

2280
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:22,800
lately hasn't there

2281
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:25,139
I I think there's a lot of discussion on

2282
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:28,460
the forums where I go about it so it's a

2283
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:28,460
little bit heated mind you but

2284
01:28:28,939 --> 01:28:35,039
I love it

2285
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:36,119
so when you talk to Australians about or

2286
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:37,819
you know what I'm gonna actually

2287
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:40,679
rephrase this when you talk to

2288
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:42,599
Internationals about Australian weed a

2289
01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:45,840
lot of them talk about you know uh

2290
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,940
nimbin the Emerald Triangle do you think

2291
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,800
of fun do you think of far Northern

2292
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:52,079
Rivers New South Wales as the Emerald

2293
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,219
Triangle of Australia or do you feel

2294
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:55,139
like there's actually a lot of other

2295
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:57,000
areas that produce a lot and just don't

2296
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:59,819
really have the namesake and I guess I

2297
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,079
will add the caveat that you know I

2298
01:28:59,819 --> 01:29:02,939
haven't been to nimbin in a number of

2299
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:04,679
years but whenever I do go there I'm

2300
01:29:02,939 --> 01:29:06,899
largely unimpressed

2301
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,219
um slash disappointed you know where

2302
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:10,799
where do you stand on it and do you

2303
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:14,939
think nimbin gets hyped

2304
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:16,980
yeah I do I I agree with you I I was

2305
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:20,279
pretty disappointed with the stuff they

2306
01:29:16,979 --> 01:29:22,859
had they need some more input more more

2307
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:25,439
seed you know better stuff they've got a

2308
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:27,479
not bad climate there uh and I'm I'm

2309
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:29,099
sure they've got a name for a reason

2310
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:31,559
initially but

2311
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:35,600
yeah I think those days are gone and

2312
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:39,300
they really need to step up a bit and

2313
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:42,300
when I was a kid uh up here where I live

2314
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:45,179
was pretty famous for the best weed in

2315
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:48,119
Australia North Queensland heads

2316
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:49,500
everyone loved them it's you if you had

2317
01:29:48,119 --> 01:29:52,139
a bag of that you'd sell out in minutes

2318
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:54,539
sort of thing you know it was pretty

2319
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:56,100
popular stuff and um

2320
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:59,460
strong

2321
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:01,620
you know but I I think because of the uh

2322
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:04,980
lack of imports you know when the import

2323
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:07,380
market died and no one could make any

2324
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:10,019
decent seed they couldn't inbreed it

2325
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:12,179
well or whatever happened they um the

2326
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:14,100
market kind of collapsed a bit

2327
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:15,539
and they end up with a whole bunch of

2328
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,000
Hamp it seems like and maybe that's

2329
01:30:15,539 --> 01:30:21,060
what's going on down nimbin too they

2330
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,819
need new input you know

2331
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:25,620
yeah well that's interesting and uh I

2332
01:30:23,819 --> 01:30:29,158
definitely agree they need some new seed

2333
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:31,079
they're uh it's pretty stagnant yeah

2334
01:30:29,158 --> 01:30:33,238
yeah we used to have some friends around

2335
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:35,698
here locally that um they grew some

2336
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:38,158
stuff from India and uh it was kind of

2337
01:30:35,698 --> 01:30:42,059
like brown buds it wasn't Brown from

2338
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:44,638
being ruined it was just Brown and um

2339
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:46,440
around there and they smoked out of a

2340
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,659
big Chillum it was bloody awesome

2341
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:49,859
actually but he put a lot of weed in

2342
01:30:48,658 --> 01:30:52,579
there chill I must have been like seven

2343
01:30:49,859 --> 01:30:55,198
grams or something in there wow

2344
01:30:52,579 --> 01:30:57,420
oh fire came out of the top of that

2345
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:59,339
thing when you popped on it was huge and

2346
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:01,079
uh I was sitting on a chair I had to go

2347
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:02,219
and sit on against the wall because I

2348
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:04,819
felt like I was going to fall off my

2349
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:09,060
chair I was at smashed you know

2350
01:31:04,819 --> 01:31:10,920
and I asked them about uh seed and they

2351
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:13,500
said they had to go back to India every

2352
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,420
year uh because they tried making their

2353
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:17,219
own and they failed every time they said

2354
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:21,300
they couldn't do it and it was just

2355
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:23,460
better to go back to the source and uh I

2356
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:25,560
guess uh inbreeding some of those things

2357
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:28,079
just unless you're knowledgeable or

2358
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:31,020
whatever or you've got enough

2359
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:32,399
plants or it just doesn't seem to work

2360
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:34,080
very well

2361
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:35,099
a lot of it's not a lot of people I

2362
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:37,198
guess

2363
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:40,199
yeah certainly

2364
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:42,238
I think uh we might move on to some of

2365
01:31:40,198 --> 01:31:45,599
the fan submitted questions at this

2366
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:49,319
point so uh from a fellow Aussie bin

2367
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:51,179
chicken he asks uh for the z99 would you

2368
01:31:49,319 --> 01:31:54,840
consider giving it a modern twist in

2369
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:56,880
like a sort of a hybrid reformed or

2370
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:59,039
would you just want to bring it back as

2371
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:03,719
you have it now

2372
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:06,539
I did I did recreate it and I also gave

2373
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:10,460
it a modern twist and crossed it with uh

2374
01:32:06,539 --> 01:32:13,319
East Coast Sour Diesel so sours at 99

2375
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:15,300
and that was pretty well received by the

2376
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:17,939
guys that have grown up

2377
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:20,219
yeah killer that's like you're ahead of

2378
01:32:17,939 --> 01:32:23,460
the game on that one oh yeah I knew you

2379
01:32:20,219 --> 01:32:25,198
haven't I knew that question was coming

2380
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:28,039
oh that's like that's the perfect cross

2381
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:30,779
as well like sour to the z99 is perfect

2382
01:32:28,039 --> 01:32:33,300
yeah I did use that shower a little bit

2383
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:38,158
I I had some xaml too you've heard of

2384
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:41,579
Miles yeah the mythical LSD effect it's

2385
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:42,679
a pretty good pot I really liked it and

2386
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:45,420
um

2387
01:32:42,679 --> 01:32:48,480
it had a really weird smell it was kind

2388
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:51,899
of like tea tree oil Clarity tea tree

2389
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:54,599
oil strong wow pretty robust sort of

2390
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:56,879
Aroma and I did the same I posted with

2391
01:32:54,600 --> 01:33:00,060
sour diesel because why not use that

2392
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:03,480
thing when you've cut it out and um

2393
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:05,880
it was super potent uh it was it was a

2394
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:08,638
great price I I crossed it again so I've

2395
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:10,679
got like a double showers ammo and um

2396
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:13,800
I've had some guys send me pictures of

2397
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:15,840
these huge big colas they've grown with

2398
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,940
it and so they're reasonably happy too

2399
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,100
it seems

2400
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:22,319
hell yeah that's that's a good answer to

2401
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:25,320
that question

2402
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:27,000
um so the next question we got was from

2403
01:33:25,319 --> 01:33:28,979
my buddy goody garden and he wanted to

2404
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,899
know as far as you know is there any

2405
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:33,178
difference between Duck's foot and

2406
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:35,698
another strain that they call Monkey

2407
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:39,119
Madness

2408
01:33:35,698 --> 01:33:42,299
I Thought Monkey was ABC

2409
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:46,079
maybe I I think I might have heard that

2410
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:47,460
term used as well so maybe it is ABC I

2411
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:49,800
think it's one of the guys I think he

2412
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:52,560
said he originally was the guy that

2413
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:55,020
bounded off some old people I've seen a

2414
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,699
recall reading and he hey I think he did

2415
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:58,500
a bunch of crosses with it because I

2416
01:33:56,698 --> 01:34:01,138
think he said it was wasn't very potent

2417
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:03,539
but I I recall him saying he did up the

2418
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:05,819
potency whether that happened or not I

2419
01:34:03,539 --> 01:34:07,198
don't know uh I wrote to him once

2420
01:34:05,819 --> 01:34:10,198
because there seemed to be an interest

2421
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,819
in it and I wanted to get some to spread

2422
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:13,198
it around but I think he was concerned

2423
01:34:11,819 --> 01:34:15,238
with people making money out of

2424
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:18,000
something that he hadn't made anything

2425
01:34:15,238 --> 01:34:19,619
out of or something I I wouldn't have

2426
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,279
done that you know I would have just

2427
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:26,219
given it away but I can understand where

2428
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:27,599
he was at but uh why couldn't he just do

2429
01:34:26,219 --> 01:34:29,158
it and make some money out of it do you

2430
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,760
know what I mean

2431
01:34:29,158 --> 01:34:35,339
yeah yeah exactly right like I remember

2432
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:37,260
mean Jane you know a famous breeder

2433
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:39,480
who's been on the show said you know

2434
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:40,980
just like just get one or two steps of a

2435
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:43,319
project under your belt and then you can

2436
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:45,599
let it go and then if like your fear of

2437
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:47,819
someone trying to rush to mark it

2438
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:51,120
happens you're already one or two steps

2439
01:34:47,819 --> 01:34:53,759
ahead of him you know like so or do a

2440
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:55,019
deal with them over it talk to them and

2441
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,900
say look you want to give us a little

2442
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:59,940
bit of something or another

2443
01:34:56,899 --> 01:35:03,259
yeah that's it collab's the way to go

2444
01:34:59,939 --> 01:35:03,259
for sure okay

2445
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:08,158
table salt that's what and I don't

2446
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:10,559
you know I don't have a foot in there

2447
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:12,299
door at all I don't care I actually gave

2448
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,940
that stuff away I never even made any

2449
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:17,039
money out of it but uh and I see people

2450
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:18,960
spelling and making money good on them

2451
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:20,639
you know they're sharing something and

2452
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:23,100
they they need something for the work

2453
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:25,920
they're doing it puts you know food on

2454
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:28,679
their table whatever I'm okay with that

2455
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,920
yeah yeah definitely but they can send

2456
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:34,319
me some money if they wanted to

2457
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,940
of course I love that so the next

2458
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:37,619
question we got was from a patreon

2459
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:39,539
listener Felix he says it would be great

2460
01:35:37,619 --> 01:35:42,899
to hear Wally talk a little bit about

2461
01:35:39,539 --> 01:35:45,719
the Grail Hayes yeah let's start there

2462
01:35:42,899 --> 01:35:47,399
what's your thoughts on the Grail Haze

2463
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:49,800
what was that was that something that

2464
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:55,079
Neville was doing with kangaroo or yeah

2465
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:57,179
exactly okay yeah I I don't know

2466
01:35:55,079 --> 01:36:00,719
I don't know what steps he ended up with

2467
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:03,000
I I think someone sells some of that

2468
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:06,000
that seed still

2469
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,439
um but and I'm sure it must be good I I

2470
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,819
tried some

2471
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:14,638
um across with uh was it mullum

2472
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:17,099
cross with tie and there's a dispute

2473
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:20,400
over what tie it was so I won't get into

2474
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:22,739
that but uh it was pretty good it did

2475
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:24,899
remind me a lot of time

2476
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:27,539
that golden tie that I mentioned earlier

2477
01:36:24,899 --> 01:36:29,339
uh it reminded me of that it was really

2478
01:36:27,539 --> 01:36:32,158
nice I liked it

2479
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:34,440
yeah okay that's interesting I I I've

2480
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:36,119
seen that post you're referring to I

2481
01:36:34,439 --> 01:36:38,879
think yeah it's its own kettle of fish

2482
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:40,679
isn't it with that tie but um that's

2483
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,260
interesting okay so the follow-up part

2484
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:45,960
Felix asked was what are your thoughts

2485
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:47,940
around why we're seeing the Resurgence

2486
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:49,800
of interest in the long flowering

2487
01:36:47,939 --> 01:36:51,658
sativas and you know the real trippy

2488
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:53,699
sort of weed

2489
01:36:51,658 --> 01:36:56,119
people are finally coming to their

2490
01:36:53,698 --> 01:36:56,119
senses

2491
01:36:57,139 --> 01:37:03,779
it was just so hard to grow for everyone

2492
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:06,238
before maybe I've seen some Led grows

2493
01:37:03,779 --> 01:37:07,619
recently with survivors and I think

2494
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:10,079
they're getting a lot better they're

2495
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:12,238
really starting to you know look a bit

2496
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:15,899
more like like you'd see them in their

2497
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:18,899
in their home setting and um it's pretty

2498
01:37:15,899 --> 01:37:21,539
promising I think maybe it's not far

2499
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:23,399
down the track and they'll be able to

2500
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:25,460
get the second thing indoors that you

2501
01:37:23,399 --> 01:37:29,698
can if you grow them in a tropical Place

2502
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:33,658
one one could only hope hey

2503
01:37:29,698 --> 01:37:35,399
yeah so so and I I agree uh as someone

2504
01:37:33,658 --> 01:37:37,019
who's growing some sativas under some

2505
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:38,939
LEDs at the moment they're they're

2506
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,860
actually doing a really good job I uh

2507
01:37:38,939 --> 01:37:43,439
we're gonna have to talk later about

2508
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:45,658
that I wanna maybe we can we can do our

2509
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:46,799
own little collab I got these these

2510
01:37:45,658 --> 01:37:49,799
strains I'm running at the moment

2511
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:51,539
they're called Azazel and uh there's a

2512
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:54,420
lot of different genetics in there it's

2513
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:56,880
made by a a cool breeder could always be

2514
01:37:54,420 --> 01:38:00,060
flowering but it basically one half of

2515
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:02,819
it is a seeds genetics Purple Haze so

2516
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:04,679
it's Thai across to the Purple Haze I

2517
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:07,039
think that's the mother and then the

2518
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:10,079
father is like uh

2519
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:11,760
granddaddy purps chem dog so it's like

2520
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:15,238
new school meets old school but they're

2521
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:17,159
very sativa leaning and um I'll get you

2522
01:38:15,238 --> 01:38:18,899
some photos but I'll also maybe we can

2523
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:20,698
talk about some seed stuff later but um

2524
01:38:18,899 --> 01:38:22,920
we'll put that on the back burner for

2525
01:38:20,698 --> 01:38:24,299
the moment the next question we got was

2526
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:26,940
someone who was wondering it's a great

2527
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:29,340
question do you still hold any of what

2528
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:30,899
you would consider your original c99

2529
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:32,940
because they were sort of saying you

2530
01:38:30,899 --> 01:38:35,460
know like there's so many different c99s

2531
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:37,799
on the market now be it Brothers Grim

2532
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:40,439
c99 the new brothers Grim c99 there's

2533
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:42,600
like a a fast buds you know like you

2534
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:44,279
know there's like a million c99s do you

2535
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:47,659
still have the one that you think is the

2536
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:51,599
original and what to you is the best one

2537
01:38:47,658 --> 01:38:54,359
no that's that's long gone that was so

2538
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:57,659
many years ago that um I did get offered

2539
01:38:54,359 --> 01:38:59,639
some recently by a guy and I think it

2540
01:38:57,658 --> 01:39:01,138
was original Brothers Grim stuff maybe

2541
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:04,079
you know down the track a few

2542
01:39:01,139 --> 01:39:05,520
Generations but um I would I I told him

2543
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,698
I'd take it because

2544
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:11,280
even though I thought that that stuffed

2545
01:39:08,698 --> 01:39:14,219
uh that stuff the you built tolerance to

2546
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:17,158
it really quickly you know

2547
01:39:14,219 --> 01:39:19,560
um we're still delicious

2548
01:39:17,158 --> 01:39:21,839
part it was pretty nice

2549
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:25,679
especially that point like we spoke

2550
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:30,000
about earlier and um but no I don't I

2551
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:30,000
don't have any c99 z99

2552
01:39:30,979 --> 01:39:36,119
I'll I'm gonna have to send you some of

2553
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:37,800
the new c99 f2s because I've got a bunch

2554
01:39:36,119 --> 01:39:40,859
of them just my friend made them for me

2555
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:43,679
I was interested to know what day would

2556
01:39:40,859 --> 01:39:45,059
you harvest c99 because what I found to

2557
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,520
be the most interesting thing about the

2558
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:49,199
whole c99 story was when I went to I

2559
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,000
actually spent some time in Colorado and

2560
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:52,979
went to the brothers Grim facility and

2561
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,960
they were kind enough to let me come

2562
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:57,479
there for a bit and

2563
01:39:54,960 --> 01:40:00,779
the most interesting part about it all

2564
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:04,799
was Rick Mr Soul said oh you know like

2565
01:40:00,779 --> 01:40:06,899
we used to say you know day 49 day 49

2566
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,940
um and you could Harvest it on day 49

2567
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:11,519
but you know now that we understand how

2568
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:15,559
to grow weed a bit better it's probably

2569
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:18,360
like 58 to 62. when did you harvest c99

2570
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:21,060
no I was just thinking that as you were

2571
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:24,299
asking the question yeah I I think 60

2572
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:27,719
days but we used to harvest some at 49

2573
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:29,480
days because it was ready enough do you

2574
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:32,399
know so yeah

2575
01:40:29,479 --> 01:40:34,678
all that the high was better if you

2576
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:35,819
waited a little bit longer yeah yeah and

2577
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:37,500
you know what it's funny you say that

2578
01:40:35,819 --> 01:40:39,599
because that's exactly what Mr Soul said

2579
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:42,420
he said you know like the smell and the

2580
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:46,320
flavor and the effect was there at 49

2581
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:47,880
but at 60 it was like stronger it lasted

2582
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:49,738
longer

2583
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,600
um so yeah more enjoyable it wasn't that

2584
01:40:49,738 --> 01:40:53,039
you got a flavor at day 60 that wasn't

2585
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,800
there at 49 and I think that's why

2586
01:40:53,039 --> 01:40:57,658
people thought it was 49 but yeah just

2587
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,300
the effect the legs on it it's just way

2588
01:40:57,658 --> 01:41:03,299
better yeah no I agree I think a lot of

2589
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:04,980
people pull stuff early there's

2590
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:07,020
down in Adelaide they're growing a lot

2591
01:41:04,979 --> 01:41:09,299
of stuff and they pull it at eight weeks

2592
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:11,520
and one guy said they uh they made a

2593
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:12,719
mistake once and I went 10 weeks it was

2594
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,179
so much better

2595
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:17,219
you know but they can't afford to wait

2596
01:41:15,179 --> 01:41:19,319
10 weeks so they are still always

2597
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:21,899
pulling it out I think it was Jack Herer

2598
01:41:19,319 --> 01:41:22,920
it might have been Jack era yeah but

2599
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:25,559
nice

2600
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:28,679
yeah but they they still didn't learn

2601
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:30,900
and then do 10 because two weeks are so

2602
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:33,719
valuable they think I I I'd make room

2603
01:41:30,899 --> 01:41:36,379
for that extra two weeks be a bit more

2604
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:39,658
concerned about your consumers I reckon

2605
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:40,859
yeah right right I I and I I think I

2606
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:43,439
said this to someone the other night on

2607
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:45,599
Instagram I said I can't really think of

2608
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:48,000
one plant I absolutely love that

2609
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,880
finishes quicker than nine weeks

2610
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,380
no some guy one of the guys on the net

2611
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,150
said he wouldn't even smoke anything

2612
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:56,460
that plowed under 10 weeks

2613
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:59,698
[Laughter]

2614
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:03,118
I love it Puritan

2615
01:41:59,698 --> 01:42:06,118
that's awesome that's awesome okay

2616
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:07,799
um so the next question we got was

2617
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:10,618
um I would love to know about some of

2618
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:12,300
Wally's favorite pure sativas or just

2619
01:42:10,618 --> 01:42:14,639
narrow Leaf drug types in general

2620
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:18,300
particularly within the Southeast Asian

2621
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:19,560
you know any specific ties or

2622
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,600
um I'll just sort of let you answer that

2623
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,280
so far so yeah like pure sativa is what

2624
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,739
what's up there for you in terms of what

2625
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:28,500
you rate as high quality

2626
01:42:25,738 --> 01:42:30,479
oh I like most of them to be honest I

2627
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:32,639
don't know if I've grown well I have

2628
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:34,859
grown some pure Colombian and it was

2629
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:35,880
pretty nice sort of a bit different to

2630
01:42:34,859 --> 01:42:38,639
the tie

2631
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:41,039
even in its growth it's got wider than

2632
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:43,920
it did tall you know tires get

2633
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:46,859
quite tall but uh

2634
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:49,560
I think what you grow up with tends to

2635
01:42:46,859 --> 01:42:52,380
be what you favor is and that's that's

2636
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:56,039
what I found so the tie was typically

2637
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:58,020
that it might go to but um I'd happily

2638
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:00,238
try all the rest of them

2639
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:02,100
no problem at all I did like some of

2640
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:03,238
that Indian like I said that was pretty

2641
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:05,820
good

2642
01:43:03,238 --> 01:43:07,979
I don't know what what sort of Indian it

2643
01:43:05,819 --> 01:43:10,859
was but I I think they were going to the

2644
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:12,359
southern part of India so it could have

2645
01:43:10,859 --> 01:43:13,319
been similar to that Corella it was a

2646
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:15,899
Corolla

2647
01:43:13,319 --> 01:43:16,559
sure yeah it could have been similar to

2648
01:43:15,899 --> 01:43:19,379
that

2649
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:21,119
I I don't know though there's probably a

2650
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:23,460
fair bit of weed in India

2651
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:25,198
yeah wow that's really interesting to

2652
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:26,939
hear that that sort of makes sense

2653
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:28,618
definitely and you've stimulated this

2654
01:43:26,939 --> 01:43:30,359
thought in my mind everyone says that

2655
01:43:28,618 --> 01:43:33,420
the weed you grew up with is what's most

2656
01:43:30,359 --> 01:43:35,099
memorable to you but there's sadly a

2657
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:39,000
whole generation maybe even two

2658
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:42,060
generations of young Australians who all

2659
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:46,079
the weed they know literally is uh like

2660
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:47,340
pgr riddled beasters equivalent what's

2661
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:49,319
your thoughts on that you know a lot of

2662
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:53,279
people say oh you know it's Vietnamese

2663
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:56,158
gangs and you know he lines like that do

2664
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:57,960
you know what strains they're growing do

2665
01:43:56,158 --> 01:43:59,399
you do you feel like there's any way we

2666
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,899
can change this at all within the

2667
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:03,359
Australian landscape where it's just

2668
01:44:00,899 --> 01:44:05,879
like gonna be there

2669
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:07,799
I think legalization's the only way

2670
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:10,319
they're going to change that it's those

2671
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,880
Asian gangs you see all the time a

2672
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:13,679
bigger bigger and bigger bust of

2673
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:16,139
greenhouses you'll have seen on the news

2674
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:18,118
and I would like to put a stop to this

2675
01:44:16,139 --> 01:44:20,460
bustingham hasn't stopped them has it

2676
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:22,979
it's every every other week there's

2677
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:25,380
another one you know and and wouldn't

2678
01:44:22,979 --> 01:44:26,459
they rather see the money go into Aussie

2679
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:29,940
pockets

2680
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:31,679
uh but yeah with the pgr stuff yeah we

2681
01:44:29,939 --> 01:44:34,618
did get some we bought some weed from

2682
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:36,359
Adelaide for a while and um so it was

2683
01:44:34,618 --> 01:44:38,279
that Jack Herer which we really quite

2684
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:41,279
liked but then they grew this other

2685
01:44:38,279 --> 01:44:43,679
stuff they called uh Himalayan Himalayan

2686
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:46,618
indica and that was that you've probably

2687
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:49,440
heard of it it's large buds really big

2688
01:44:46,618 --> 01:44:51,599
orange hairs on it it was disgusting I

2689
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:53,879
hated it it didn't get you high it got

2690
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,400
you low you know other stuff

2691
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:59,639
yeah yeah just that strain they're using

2692
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:01,859
all the cash cropping facilities a lot

2693
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:04,100
of uh young people they they actually

2694
01:45:01,859 --> 01:45:06,899
like that stuff that's their

2695
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:10,139
interpretation of what weed is yeah that

2696
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:12,719
that's all they've ever had oh sad

2697
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:15,359
yeah and you know what it's like that

2698
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:17,698
that was what conv so the day I decided

2699
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:20,399
to start growing weed was the day I had

2700
01:45:17,698 --> 01:45:22,919
a weed sample that wasn't that bad

2701
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:25,198
because I some one of my buddies was

2702
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:30,000
like real technologically advanced and

2703
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:32,039
in 2010 he um he gave me this bud and he

2704
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,260
said oh that's Granddaddy Purple it's

2705
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:36,238
imported from California

2706
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:38,219
and I was like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

2707
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:40,500
I've smoked weed before you know like

2708
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:42,779
I've smoked Aussie weed and I tried it

2709
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:44,340
and it was just it just changed my life

2710
01:45:42,779 --> 01:45:46,439
you know like it opened my eyes I was

2711
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:49,860
like wow you can grow weed like this

2712
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:52,678
yeah right nice yeah the boys around

2713
01:45:49,859 --> 01:45:55,559
here my son I've got a son who's about

2714
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:57,480
30. and um

2715
01:45:55,560 --> 01:46:02,100
their memories of the week is the weed

2716
01:45:57,479 --> 01:46:06,059
we used to grow so I I uh oh that diesel

2717
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:08,699
remember that diesel what a lucky boy

2718
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:10,440
well he was a teenager stealing my weed

2719
01:46:08,698 --> 01:46:12,359
I couldn't believe the Ash and the weed

2720
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:13,919
he used to steal and thinking about

2721
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:14,759
other people who had nothing in this

2722
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:18,060
boys

2723
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:19,920
they're out there getting uh acid off uh

2724
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:22,560
bear you know bear from the Grateful

2725
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:24,899
Dead the manager they're getting hit by

2726
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:28,199
acid I've heard the name yeah and

2727
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:29,759
they're getting uh Wheaton hash off me I

2728
01:46:28,198 --> 01:46:32,238
think what an upbringing these guys are

2729
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,239
having eh

2730
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,480
God the stuff for Legends you know it's

2731
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,579
funny I was actually just talking to a

2732
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:41,158
mate the other day and I said I think

2733
01:46:38,579 --> 01:46:43,439
one of the purest acts of love you can

2734
01:46:41,158 --> 01:46:47,179
do as a cannabis grower is to be able to

2735
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:47,178
leave your children astrained

2736
01:46:48,198 --> 01:46:52,618
yeah why not well I always think about

2737
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:54,119
it like whenever I have a guest on the

2738
01:46:52,618 --> 01:46:56,399
show and they're like oh you know some

2739
01:46:54,118 --> 01:46:58,979
seeds I got off my dad I'm like I wish I

2740
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:01,259
had some seeds I got off my dad yeah

2741
01:46:58,979 --> 01:47:05,698
yeah my son would say well give us a bag

2742
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:08,159
now and I'll I'll start with that

2743
01:47:05,698 --> 01:47:10,079
that's good stuff that's good stuff so

2744
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:11,579
the next part of this person's question

2745
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:13,439
was you know they're asking about the

2746
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:15,779
like the favorite sativas and narrow

2747
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:16,678
Leaf drug types and they said I'm

2748
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:18,300
probably going to butcher the

2749
01:47:16,679 --> 01:47:19,618
pronunciation here so just bear with me

2750
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:23,340
but they basically say do you have any

2751
01:47:19,618 --> 01:47:25,679
details on the Hmong Hill tribe tie is

2752
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:26,880
it actually from Hmong or is it Hmong I

2753
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:28,800
don't know how you pronounce it I've

2754
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,900
heard it's just actually a fancy name

2755
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:34,139
and it actually came from a guy called

2756
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:35,819
Prof 77 who lives in Thailand do you

2757
01:47:34,139 --> 01:47:37,440
know is it actually a land race or is it

2758
01:47:35,819 --> 01:47:40,859
just from someone

2759
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:45,118
yeah it's absolutely from Prof 77. I

2760
01:47:40,859 --> 01:47:49,079
went and visited him uh twice in uh

2761
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:53,158
Central Thailand there and I

2762
01:47:49,079 --> 01:47:54,658
I asked his wife recently he died and I

2763
01:47:53,158 --> 01:47:59,479
asked his wife but she didn't go into

2764
01:47:54,658 --> 01:48:02,698
much detail she said that um

2765
01:47:59,479 --> 01:48:04,439
uh she got it off her father that tie

2766
01:48:02,698 --> 01:48:05,219
and

2767
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:07,799
um

2768
01:48:05,219 --> 01:48:10,679
the family grew away and that was

2769
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:12,659
basically what I got out of them so I I

2770
01:48:10,679 --> 01:48:15,420
don't even know where the Hmong part of

2771
01:48:12,658 --> 01:48:18,179
it came from I they never said that to

2772
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:20,100
me they may have said it to one of the

2773
01:48:18,179 --> 01:48:21,719
guys they gave it to which was kanga's

2774
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,380
friend and

2775
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:25,439
um

2776
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:28,380
but I never I never heard mom a mansion

2777
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:30,178
but that that seed is so I've shared

2778
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:32,460
that with someone I sent that to someone

2779
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:34,859
and they've done a remake of it and then

2780
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:36,300
shared with other people so that that's

2781
01:48:34,859 --> 01:48:38,399
where that seed come from I probably

2782
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:41,159
still got some of it somewhere

2783
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:44,879
but um and yeah it's originally from

2784
01:48:41,158 --> 01:48:47,399
prop 77. I I I'm glad to hear they're

2785
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:49,560
mentioning the prop 77 that's the

2786
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:51,479
important part that the guy that shared

2787
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:52,860
it gets a little bit of recognition do

2788
01:48:51,479 --> 01:48:55,079
you know what I mean

2789
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:57,839
yeah definitely definitely that that's

2790
01:48:55,079 --> 01:48:59,760
good to hear yeah kudos to our listeners

2791
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:04,279
you know they're my listeners are only

2792
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:04,280
Scholars and high quality intellectuals

2793
01:49:06,118 --> 01:49:10,019
um no but that's good to hear you know

2794
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:12,118
shout out to our fellow historians out

2795
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:13,500
you you've just made me wonder though

2796
01:49:12,118 --> 01:49:15,118
you know as when you mentioned you might

2797
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:16,979
have some seeds left I've got to ask

2798
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,960
because I love asking breeders this out

2799
01:49:16,979 --> 01:49:21,059
of all the seeds in your library what

2800
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,698
are the ones like you're most excited

2801
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:26,100
about or feel are like the most rare

2802
01:49:23,698 --> 01:49:27,960
seeds you have so to speak

2803
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:32,639
I've still got some of those flower

2804
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:35,880
seeds and um a hole I don't know I must

2805
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:37,020
have like about 10 different label Thai

2806
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:39,719
stuff

2807
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:41,820
and they're all just getting older I've

2808
01:49:39,719 --> 01:49:43,739
got this this you know several tins of

2809
01:49:41,819 --> 01:49:46,439
seed and I'm worried that one of them

2810
01:49:43,738 --> 01:49:49,500
you know I mean how many of them can be

2811
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:51,779
struck and am I just keeping them just

2812
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:53,359
for a Memento you know we should be

2813
01:49:51,779 --> 01:49:58,099
growing those things

2814
01:49:53,359 --> 01:49:58,099
uh it's sad to see that happening

2815
01:49:58,738 --> 01:50:03,118
yeah it doesn't take very long does it I

2816
01:50:00,899 --> 01:50:05,279
remember like some of the first seeds I

2817
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:07,859
ever made five six years ago are now

2818
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:09,719
starting to be like fully dead because I

2819
01:50:07,859 --> 01:50:12,899
sadly wasn't keeping them in the fridge

2820
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:15,359
and stuff like that and so uh yeah you

2821
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:17,658
get to a point where you're like I like

2822
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:21,179
I sat on them to the point where it was

2823
01:50:17,658 --> 01:50:23,039
deleterious yeah I see people with their

2824
01:50:21,179 --> 01:50:24,359
Collections and they're really proud of

2825
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:25,500
what they've got but I don't know if

2826
01:50:24,359 --> 01:50:27,658
they know whether they're going to ever

2827
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:31,079
grow the seeds that they've

2828
01:50:27,658 --> 01:50:33,359
so like from you know 1908 I've got this

2829
01:50:31,079 --> 01:50:34,819
stuff you know but is it is it ever

2830
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:37,019
gonna grow

2831
01:50:34,819 --> 01:50:39,658
that's it right it's like everyone's

2832
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:41,400
waiting for the uh fake embryonic seeds

2833
01:50:39,658 --> 01:50:42,658
to develop or whatever but you know

2834
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:46,259
we'll have to see whether that actually

2835
01:50:42,658 --> 01:50:49,019
happens so the next question we got was

2836
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:51,119
uh another land race I'm gonna butcher

2837
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:52,739
it but I'm I'm hoping you are going to

2838
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:55,920
understand the question better than I do

2839
01:50:52,738 --> 01:50:59,118
I get the vibe you will so they say uh

2840
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:02,940
can you ask is Wally familiar with

2841
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:04,339
campuccian land race honey

2842
01:51:02,939 --> 01:51:06,658
oh

2843
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:09,300
Cambodian campuccia

2844
01:51:06,658 --> 01:51:11,219
yeah I think it's that psychoactive

2845
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:14,940
honey right

2846
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:16,439
oh okay yeah I have heard of that yeah I

2847
01:51:14,939 --> 01:51:17,879
don't know maybe maybe I'm wrong maybe

2848
01:51:16,439 --> 01:51:20,579
if you feel like you know what they're

2849
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:23,659
talking about girlfriend hey Connie I

2850
01:51:20,579 --> 01:51:23,658
wish it was that stuff

2851
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:28,399
definitely try some I wonder what those

2852
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:31,020
bees are eating

2853
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:32,219
yeah it's it's one of the flowers I

2854
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:35,699
think there's

2855
01:51:32,219 --> 01:51:37,679
um there's like a an atropine type drug

2856
01:51:35,698 --> 01:51:41,059
in there so you essentially get what we

2857
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:45,840
would call an anti-cholinergic reaction

2858
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:48,000
which uh is I gotta admit you know um I

2859
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:50,840
remember I spoke to a very senior Ed

2860
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,760
doctor one day and he said the most

2861
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:56,340
insane hallucinations like I've ever

2862
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:58,260
seen a person having was

2863
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:00,239
um from that anti-cholinergic sort of

2864
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:02,280
effect not from like LSD he's like you

2865
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:04,379
know LSD makes you like trip a bit but

2866
01:52:02,279 --> 01:52:06,420
like an anticholinergic delirium like

2867
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:09,139
people will like jump out windows

2868
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:11,940
chasing dragons like like full-on like

2869
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:15,300
wow so I think that's what the honey is

2870
01:52:11,939 --> 01:52:17,698
is that flour get you high or is it the

2871
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:20,279
bees yeah yeah I believe in the same

2872
01:52:17,698 --> 01:52:23,099
sense that like you know Scopolamine

2873
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:25,559
from um datura and stuff like that I

2874
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:28,560
think it's that same sort of vibe yeah

2875
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:31,199
okay interesting have you tried daijira

2876
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:33,600
I haven't I got some seeds and I'm too

2877
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:34,979
scared to touch them yeah I've got a

2878
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:37,920
I've got a growing out the back here we

2879
01:52:34,979 --> 01:52:39,839
tried it when we were kids and uh it can

2880
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,940
be a little bit scary

2881
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:43,980
yeah well I just remembered the guy who

2882
01:52:41,939 --> 01:52:46,138
gave me the seeds Mr Bob Hemphill shout

2883
01:52:43,979 --> 01:52:47,519
out uh lovely guy he was just like oh

2884
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:48,659
just make sure you're wearing gloves

2885
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:50,580
when you touch them because like even

2886
01:52:48,658 --> 01:52:52,500
just touching the seeds like you can get

2887
01:52:50,579 --> 01:52:54,899
high off apparently like it just goes

2888
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:57,238
through your skin I was like oh yeah I'm

2889
01:52:54,899 --> 01:52:59,519
in PNG when we're younger they reckon

2890
01:52:57,238 --> 01:53:02,158
they're where the daichura grew around

2891
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:04,380
the houses there that um you should

2892
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:05,960
probably Rob those places because they

2893
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:09,900
sleep really deeply

2894
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:12,179
yeah okay that makes sense because I

2895
01:53:09,899 --> 01:53:14,579
guess over there in PNG they're using it

2896
01:53:12,179 --> 01:53:16,679
like I don't want to say medicinally but

2897
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:19,618
like they're purposefully ingesting it

2898
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:22,980
right yeah I would say so

2899
01:53:19,618 --> 01:53:26,219
I don't know I I was just a kid so yeah

2900
01:53:22,979 --> 01:53:28,618
sure well hey tell us tell us about your

2901
01:53:26,219 --> 01:53:31,560
PNG Adventures we forgot to touch on

2902
01:53:28,618 --> 01:53:33,179
that yeah we went there my father got a

2903
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:35,760
job over there I I can't remember what

2904
01:53:33,179 --> 01:53:38,460
it was he was a seaman so I was like

2905
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,800
search and rescue Harbor Master

2906
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:42,719
he sold lighthouses at one point which I

2907
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,420
don't know if you ever come across a

2908
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:48,239
lighthouse salesman

2909
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:49,859
it's a bit of a niche one

2910
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:52,759
um so yeah I spent a couple of years

2911
01:53:49,859 --> 01:53:56,339
there and um

2912
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:58,500
in the darkest parts of my life you know

2913
01:53:56,340 --> 01:54:00,360
when you're feeling really down that's

2914
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:03,000
that's things I look back on because it

2915
01:54:00,359 --> 01:54:04,859
was awesome it was just so good we used

2916
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,658
every day uh

2917
01:54:04,859 --> 01:54:08,819
after school the school was across the

2918
01:54:06,658 --> 01:54:10,738
road from the beach we'd wander off to

2919
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:13,439
the beach it was low tide and we'd just

2920
01:54:10,738 --> 01:54:15,359
spend hours walking amongst the coral

2921
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:18,079
looking for uh we're actually looking

2922
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:20,519
for sharks me and my friend

2923
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:23,698
I don't think we ever found any but uh

2924
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:26,400
plenty of octopuses and crabs and you

2925
01:54:23,698 --> 01:54:30,238
know all the different shapes and colors

2926
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:33,059
of coral and it was beautiful uh but

2927
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:35,339
it's really sad to know that that where

2928
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:36,780
we were it was at Port Moresby and it's

2929
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:38,100
just not like that anymore I've been

2930
01:54:36,779 --> 01:54:40,979
told it's horrible you wouldn't want to

2931
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:44,100
even swim in there they say you know so

2932
01:54:40,979 --> 01:54:46,259
that was like 1974 to now which is a

2933
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:48,840
fair while but uh

2934
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:51,260
it's totally ruined they reckon which is

2935
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:55,619
a bit sad

2936
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:57,900
yeah wow okay and I mean are you

2937
01:54:55,618 --> 01:54:59,579
familiar with the geopolitical landscape

2938
01:54:57,899 --> 01:55:01,079
there like I heard just I mean it sounds

2939
01:54:59,579 --> 01:55:03,000
like you were sort of talking about like

2940
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:05,579
the waters and the the general

2941
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,618
environment but I've heard it maybe it

2942
01:55:05,579 --> 01:55:09,420
isn't even necessarily particularly safe

2943
01:55:07,618 --> 01:55:10,859
at the moment do you do you keep tracks

2944
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:13,560
on that at all

2945
01:55:10,859 --> 01:55:16,859
yeah I'm not sure how safe it ever was I

2946
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:18,239
think it was always okay they used to

2947
01:55:16,859 --> 01:55:20,158
walk around with those big bush knives

2948
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:21,899
you know those big bush knives so oh

2949
01:55:20,158 --> 01:55:24,779
yeah like like a machete sort of thing

2950
01:55:21,899 --> 01:55:28,679
yeah and they would use them they're

2951
01:55:24,779 --> 01:55:30,359
pretty brutal you know I they're a lot

2952
01:55:28,679 --> 01:55:33,359
of children you know what I mean I I

2953
01:55:30,359 --> 01:55:35,339
think uh so happy and happy go lucky but

2954
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:37,679
you don't upset them because if they got

2955
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:41,039
angry you know that could be pretty

2956
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:42,658
dangerous people yeah yeah it's

2957
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:44,158
different the different like it's

2958
01:55:42,658 --> 01:55:46,500
amazing the different cultural

2959
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:50,099
differences like I remember

2960
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:53,039
um when I was uh doing some volunteering

2961
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:55,079
at a at a school helping tutor some

2962
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:56,819
Refugee students just to try to help

2963
01:55:55,079 --> 01:55:59,219
catch them up to sort of the same level

2964
01:55:56,819 --> 01:56:01,079
as you know like what someone in year

2965
01:55:59,219 --> 01:56:02,460
four in Australia you would sort of be

2966
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:04,439
expected to be at that level or whatever

2967
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:05,939
and I remember they were telling me

2968
01:56:04,439 --> 01:56:09,599
because there was a few of them that had

2969
01:56:05,939 --> 01:56:12,059
like um were from PNG and they had um

2970
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:13,260
like a lot of scars on their arms and I

2971
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:14,940
was like oh what's that from and they

2972
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:17,039
were like oh you know like in my culture

2973
01:56:14,939 --> 01:56:18,899
like we often settle like family

2974
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:21,319
disputes with just like small knife

2975
01:56:18,899 --> 01:56:21,319
fights

2976
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:27,119
you reckon it's true as well

2977
01:56:24,198 --> 01:56:28,439
oh they're pretty brutal sometimes and

2978
01:56:27,118 --> 01:56:31,920
and so

2979
01:56:28,439 --> 01:56:35,339
strong and I the injuries that I've seen

2980
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:37,739
them and get inflicted by or with uh

2981
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:39,119
and they'd barely even notice it you

2982
01:56:37,738 --> 01:56:41,698
know it's

2983
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:43,738
I'd be crying my eyes out or whatever

2984
01:56:41,698 --> 01:56:45,539
you know at that point but these guys a

2985
01:56:43,738 --> 01:56:48,678
big chunk of meat comes out of their leg

2986
01:56:45,539 --> 01:56:51,840
and they know it's okay I'm all right

2987
01:56:48,679 --> 01:56:54,719
Jesus wow yeah tough people

2988
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,400
yeah yeah strong culturally yeah that's

2989
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:57,899
interesting yeah the different cultural

2990
01:56:56,399 --> 01:56:59,519
perceptions of pain like in some

2991
01:56:57,899 --> 01:57:01,500
cultures like pain is like a good thing

2992
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,179
it's like religious experience almost

2993
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:05,460
but there you go okay cool well thanks

2994
01:57:03,179 --> 01:57:06,658
for the experience on the PNG and it

2995
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:08,939
ties in well because one of our

2996
01:57:06,658 --> 01:57:11,099
listeners wanted to know that uh they

2997
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:13,618
had read online a while ago many years

2998
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:16,260
ago that you were selling PNG and I

2999
01:57:13,618 --> 01:57:18,479
think PNG has had a bit of a Revival in

3000
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:20,340
terms of its popularity how would you

3001
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:22,019
describe that strain would you say like

3002
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:24,179
you know it's largely like the other

3003
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:26,820
sort of Southeast Asian varieties or

3004
01:57:24,179 --> 01:57:29,639
what what makes it unique for you

3005
01:57:26,819 --> 01:57:31,198
oh I don't think I ever sold any I got I

3006
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:33,179
got a mate that was over there to try

3007
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:35,279
and collect some seeds but they were uh

3008
01:57:33,179 --> 01:57:37,739
I've still got them I don't think I ever

3009
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,539
got any of the strike but uh a friend of

3010
01:57:37,738 --> 01:57:41,879
mine has grown some sense that he got

3011
01:57:39,539 --> 01:57:44,399
directly from PNG and they were they

3012
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:46,920
were all right but um

3013
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:48,179
no I don't but I I did grow some when I

3014
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:51,118
was younger

3015
01:57:48,179 --> 01:57:53,279
um I was one of my first indoor

3016
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:55,679
experiences and

3017
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:57,899
um it was pretty awesome actually it was

3018
01:57:55,679 --> 01:58:03,179
really fruity sticky

3019
01:57:57,899 --> 01:58:05,698
top top last week BNG gold it was and

3020
01:58:03,179 --> 01:58:07,199
um delicious I think that you know

3021
01:58:05,698 --> 01:58:09,539
things that stick in your memory are the

3022
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:11,939
ones that things that are good so I can

3023
01:58:09,539 --> 01:58:13,698
still almost remember the smell of that

3024
01:58:11,939 --> 01:58:16,618
stuff it was delicious

3025
01:58:13,698 --> 01:58:18,899
and um I'd absolutely cry that stuff

3026
01:58:16,618 --> 01:58:20,339
again but I don't know they don't have

3027
01:58:18,899 --> 01:58:22,439
uh

3028
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:24,420
seed banks or do you know I don't know

3029
01:58:22,439 --> 01:58:26,339
they don't have ways of keeping stuff to

3030
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:29,158
to be able to get that stuff again from

3031
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:32,699
when I was 25 it would be pretty

3032
01:58:29,158 --> 01:58:34,279
hard-pressed to get it I should think

3033
01:58:32,698 --> 01:58:37,079
yeah right

3034
01:58:34,279 --> 01:58:38,279
sometimes I you you've made me realize

3035
01:58:37,079 --> 01:58:40,139
that yeah I don't you don't think about

3036
01:58:38,279 --> 01:58:41,639
the logistics of like yeah they don't

3037
01:58:40,139 --> 01:58:43,618
have little baggies over there or

3038
01:58:41,639 --> 01:58:45,659
anything like that it all sort of plays

3039
01:58:43,618 --> 01:58:47,639
into the picture doesn't it yeah they're

3040
01:58:45,658 --> 01:58:50,939
just growing what they can and you know

3041
01:58:47,639 --> 01:58:52,440
remaking seeds and I did I did talk to a

3042
01:58:50,939 --> 01:58:55,500
guy that um

3043
01:58:52,439 --> 01:58:57,719
study PNG cannabis uh Ben Thomas I think

3044
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:59,760
his name was I spoke with him for a

3045
01:58:57,719 --> 01:59:01,380
while and he thought I was like a

3046
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:03,840
qualified scientist or something he

3047
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:06,060
wanted me to do a journey over there

3048
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:08,279
funded by the government to go and study

3049
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:10,619
cannabis which I said absolutely I'd

3050
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:13,500
love to do that but I'm not the guy you

3051
01:59:10,618 --> 01:59:15,618
think I'm just a bit of a Stoner guy you

3052
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,618
know

3053
01:59:16,939 --> 01:59:22,138
uh but yeah absolutely I would love to

3054
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:24,118
he he put out a paper at some point I I

3055
01:59:22,139 --> 01:59:28,440
put it online somewhere I'm pretty sure

3056
01:59:24,118 --> 01:59:30,539
so he thinks it was uh they um

3057
01:59:28,439 --> 01:59:33,359
did some tests and it was one of the

3058
01:59:30,539 --> 01:59:36,658
strongest survivors that came in at like

3059
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:39,118
16 THC which is for a land racer tiger

3060
01:59:36,658 --> 01:59:41,658
that is pretty high yeah

3061
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:44,339
wow that's special okay

3062
01:59:41,658 --> 01:59:45,899
so I'm gonna have to go look for that

3063
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:47,579
paper after this chat I'll have a read

3064
01:59:45,899 --> 01:59:49,319
of it but that's cool okay so the next

3065
01:59:47,579 --> 01:59:52,319
question we got was throughout your sort

3066
01:59:49,319 --> 01:59:54,899
of growing Journey did you ever struggle

3067
01:59:52,319 --> 01:59:56,698
with anxiety related to the law like

3068
01:59:54,899 --> 01:59:58,618
were you ever particularly concerned

3069
01:59:56,698 --> 02:00:00,059
about the law coming and busting you or

3070
01:59:58,618 --> 02:00:01,799
was it just something you were never

3071
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:03,539
particularly mindful of

3072
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:06,360
all the time

3073
02:00:03,539 --> 02:00:08,899
I was always worried about I suffer

3074
02:00:06,359 --> 02:00:11,339
anxiety so um

3075
02:00:08,899 --> 02:00:13,559
and like we talked about earlier

3076
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:15,840
sometimes cannabis can help relieve that

3077
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:19,739
but sometimes it is activated too

3078
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:22,739
so um yeah I was I used to have dreams

3079
02:00:19,738 --> 02:00:25,559
that uh I was getting chased uh all the

3080
02:00:22,738 --> 02:00:27,059
time by police and sometimes it was

3081
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,520
crocodiles but I still think it was

3082
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:31,679
police

3083
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:34,199
you know just that idea in your head oh

3084
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:36,300
wow hey I've had plenty of that I don't

3085
02:00:34,198 --> 02:00:39,178
seem to have it so much anymore I still

3086
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:41,820
dream a little bit about cannabis

3087
02:00:39,179 --> 02:00:43,340
um but not about getting caught or

3088
02:00:41,819 --> 02:00:47,279
chased or

3089
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:50,400
big fields of it anymore so

3090
02:00:47,279 --> 02:00:52,800
right there you go okay cool cool and

3091
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:55,859
the the final fan submitted question we

3092
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:58,920
got from our patreon fans was do you

3093
02:00:55,859 --> 02:01:00,779
like ABC in terms of the effect do you

3094
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:02,579
think that ABC could ever be a viable

3095
02:01:00,779 --> 02:01:05,960
commercial variety or do you think that

3096
02:01:02,579 --> 02:01:08,760
it's potentialized purely in the like

3097
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:09,899
discretionary slash camouflage sort of

3098
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:12,000
aspects

3099
02:01:09,899 --> 02:01:13,500
I don't see why they couldn't do what

3100
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:17,279
they've done with Frag Show I'm not even

3101
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:20,460
100 sure freak Show isn't related to ABC

3102
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:22,380
uh because we grow a few and some of

3103
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:24,239
them look very similar the sort of leaf

3104
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:26,819
that pattern that I had there's no

3105
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:29,879
reason why you can't cross that to a

3106
02:01:26,819 --> 02:01:32,759
really potent variety and make some f2s

3107
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:35,159
and then select some you know freaky

3108
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:37,020
looking left ones

3109
02:01:35,158 --> 02:01:38,939
um absolutely no reason why and then

3110
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:40,260
have your camouflage you know UK can eat

3111
02:01:38,939 --> 02:01:42,839
it too basically

3112
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:45,719
uh my friend wanted to make I think he's

3113
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:48,020
halfway through making some um freaky

3114
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:52,340
bastard ducks

3115
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:55,260
oh wow the the trifecta

3116
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:57,480
that'll be cool that'll be cool okay

3117
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:59,520
some first of all keep our eyes out for

3118
02:01:57,479 --> 02:02:03,059
so we're now moving on to what we call

3119
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:07,739
the final five questions so uh first

3120
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:10,679
question what is the best or single most

3121
02:02:07,738 --> 02:02:12,718
memorable experience relating to

3122
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:15,440
cannabis you've ever had

3123
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:15,439
oh

3124
02:02:17,219 --> 02:02:21,779
um that's that isn't an easy one is it

3125
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:24,420
there's been so many so I've done it for

3126
02:02:21,779 --> 02:02:27,539
so long that I couldn't really pinpoint

3127
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:30,060
one uh I just used to love getting

3128
02:02:27,539 --> 02:02:32,340
really high and

3129
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:35,520
um you know forgetting my worries

3130
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:36,659
uh load off load off your mind you know

3131
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:39,719
what I mean

3132
02:02:36,658 --> 02:02:42,719
uh I did have a bit of a when I went to

3133
02:02:39,719 --> 02:02:44,279
Thailand the first time I I actually

3134
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:45,960
might have been the second time I smoked

3135
02:02:44,279 --> 02:02:49,079
weed there but um

3136
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:51,658
had like a uh I got freaked out a bit I

3137
02:02:49,079 --> 02:02:54,840
think it was uh the combination of jet

3138
02:02:51,658 --> 02:02:57,259
lag and low tolerance that I I smoked

3139
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:59,940
this stuff and I'm seriously I was

3140
02:02:57,260 --> 02:03:02,159
spiraling down this dark tunnel see this

3141
02:02:59,939 --> 02:03:05,039
isn't a good experience it's actually a

3142
02:03:02,158 --> 02:03:06,658
bad one but um I had to be

3143
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:08,939
you know really mindful that it was

3144
02:03:06,658 --> 02:03:10,500
actually just cannabis and and it's all

3145
02:03:08,939 --> 02:03:12,539
right Wally you're going to come out of

3146
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:14,880
this okay it's only That's How Strong

3147
02:03:12,539 --> 02:03:16,979
some cannabis can be it's really

3148
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:18,239
mind-altering some of it I think that's

3149
02:03:16,979 --> 02:03:21,118
one of the things that's missing in

3150
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:23,939
modern campus actually that aspect you

3151
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:27,479
know it's more about I don't know more

3152
02:03:23,939 --> 02:03:31,799
body and that had that trippy sort of

3153
02:03:27,479 --> 02:03:34,618
you know hallucinationy sort of out of

3154
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:36,480
spiraling down dark tunnel stuff uh it's

3155
02:03:34,618 --> 02:03:39,319
supposed to be missing these days it can

3156
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:39,319
be a pretty wild ride

3157
02:03:39,719 --> 02:03:44,520
yeah yeah it's I thought in a minute I

3158
02:03:42,658 --> 02:03:46,799
really did I I thought I was losing the

3159
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:49,139
plot and I kept having to say to myself

3160
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:50,659
look it's it's only pot you're going to

3161
02:03:49,139 --> 02:03:52,800
be okay

3162
02:03:50,658 --> 02:03:55,618
I love it I love it when you've got to

3163
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:56,940
like back yourself off the ledge

3164
02:03:55,618 --> 02:04:00,319
okay

3165
02:03:56,939 --> 02:04:03,658
so um on the other end of the spectrum

3166
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:06,179
what's the least memorable or most

3167
02:04:03,658 --> 02:04:08,399
disappointing strain you ever tried that

3168
02:04:06,179 --> 02:04:10,618
maybe was hyped up you know like I mean

3169
02:04:08,399 --> 02:04:11,819
we hopefully it's not the answer but I

3170
02:04:10,618 --> 02:04:13,319
mean earlier on we spoke about the

3171
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:14,519
Northern Lights you know everyone Raves

3172
02:04:13,319 --> 02:04:16,618
but you were like oh it wasn't really

3173
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:18,060
our thing what's something that for you

3174
02:04:16,618 --> 02:04:19,920
was like didn't really live up to the

3175
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:21,060
hype or was just flat out really

3176
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:23,940
disappointing

3177
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:26,699
I did a Tesco once I think it was sensky

3178
02:04:23,939 --> 02:04:29,579
seeds I can't it was really in the early

3179
02:04:26,698 --> 02:04:32,339
days when I first come online and got to

3180
02:04:29,579 --> 02:04:34,019
know Gypsy and and he somehow I end up

3181
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:36,779
with this Tesco I'm pretty sure it was

3182
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:39,780
Scentsy seeds it was called gorillas

3183
02:04:36,779 --> 02:04:40,698
Gusto I think that's what it was it was

3184
02:04:39,779 --> 02:04:43,158
terrible

3185
02:04:40,698 --> 02:04:45,658
I couldn't

3186
02:04:43,158 --> 02:04:47,519
and I even had like about five of them

3187
02:04:45,658 --> 02:04:49,920
to choose from and I just thought it was

3188
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:51,659
just rubbish you know but I don't think

3189
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,399
it made a I don't think they released it

3190
02:04:51,658 --> 02:04:56,460
I'm sure other people must have found

3191
02:04:53,399 --> 02:04:59,219
what I found it's pretty disappointing

3192
02:04:56,460 --> 02:05:00,719
yeah I don't know how I think someone

3193
02:04:59,219 --> 02:05:02,158
had sent it to him and said oh this is

3194
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:02,939
the best stuff ever you should try that

3195
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:05,039
but

3196
02:05:02,939 --> 02:05:07,559
their version of best stuff ever versus

3197
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:11,099
mine just wasn't the same at all

3198
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:12,960
yeah God that that's interesting there

3199
02:05:11,099 --> 02:05:14,579
you go seeing the downfall of Scentsy in

3200
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,260
front of you

3201
02:05:14,579 --> 02:05:19,079
um

3202
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:21,420
let's do a desert island situation so

3203
02:05:19,079 --> 02:05:23,519
theoretically uh back when you were

3204
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:25,618
ingesting I'm gonna drop you off on a

3205
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:27,480
desert island with just three strains of

3206
02:05:25,618 --> 02:05:30,000
cannabis for the rest of your life what

3207
02:05:27,479 --> 02:05:31,738
three are you gonna take with you

3208
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,060
all right pretty sure I'd take that

3209
02:05:31,738 --> 02:05:34,319
allow stuff that I was talking about

3210
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:37,980
earlier

3211
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:40,859
and um I guess I gotta have a a hybrid

3212
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:43,919
of that and I I made some with mango

3213
02:05:40,859 --> 02:05:44,880
Hayes Lao cross with manga hose mango

3214
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:47,039
hoses

3215
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:49,980
one of my favorites actually and so

3216
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:50,819
probably take that with me too

3217
02:05:49,979 --> 02:05:52,500
um

3218
02:05:50,819 --> 02:05:54,719
and then I guess there's days where you

3219
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:56,520
want to dribble on your shirt and lay on

3220
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:57,960
the couch a bit so maybe take a bit of

3221
02:05:56,520 --> 02:06:00,420
indigo I don't know

3222
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:02,099
I haven't grown a lot of indicators I've

3223
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:04,560
recently grown a bit of sour bubble of

3224
02:06:02,099 --> 02:06:05,699
bogs though you know bog sour bubble

3225
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:07,920
yeah

3226
02:06:05,698 --> 02:06:09,719
very indicatory looking I I didn't smoke

3227
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:11,639
it because I'm not smoking anymore but

3228
02:06:09,719 --> 02:06:14,279
uh it's gonna have like some of the

3229
02:06:11,639 --> 02:06:18,060
largest Leaf I've ever seen it was like

3230
02:06:14,279 --> 02:06:19,738
a big palm leaf and um not very vigorous

3231
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:21,960
just grew small

3232
02:06:19,738 --> 02:06:23,939
uh when you floured it it didn't really

3233
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:25,739
stretch out or anything like that I

3234
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:27,359
don't know how ratio of vinegar it is

3235
02:06:25,738 --> 02:06:30,299
but it looked pretty bloody Indica to me

3236
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:33,539
versus yeah fibers I was growing you

3237
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:36,960
know and hybrids I think it's 100 Indica

3238
02:06:33,539 --> 02:06:39,899
okay there you go maybe something like

3239
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:40,698
that to dribble on your shirt oh wow and

3240
02:06:39,899 --> 02:06:43,799
relax

3241
02:06:40,698 --> 02:06:45,379
you can't hold on a big euphoric all the

3242
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:48,900
time I guess so

3243
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:52,739
that's cool that's cool okay so second

3244
02:06:48,899 --> 02:06:54,899
last one who is the one person from all

3245
02:06:52,738 --> 02:06:57,059
of history you'd love to sit down and

3246
02:06:54,899 --> 02:06:59,598
pick their brains about cannabis alive

3247
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:59,599
or dead

3248
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:06,060
oh I'd probably I I had met Sam already

3249
02:07:03,479 --> 02:07:09,419
in an embarrassing situation to be

3250
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:11,340
honest for me but um I think he'd be the

3251
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:13,500
guy I'd want to talk to more

3252
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:16,020
I think I'd tend to agree with you on

3253
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:18,238
that one I think our buddy Jingles has a

3254
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:19,679
lot of interesting info for us

3255
02:07:18,238 --> 02:07:22,859
absolutely

3256
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:24,719
so final question for our chat today if

3257
02:07:22,859 --> 02:07:27,238
you could go back in time to anywhere

3258
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:29,819
