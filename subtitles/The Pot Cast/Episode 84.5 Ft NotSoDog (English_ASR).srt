there you go look that's interesting

because you're giving me a nice little

89
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,719
segue when you mentioned the lemon tree

90
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,779
because I was going to say you know

91
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,719
Caleb at CSI has done some really cool

92
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,000
crosses using you know the not so dog

93
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,459
headband and some of the notable ones

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,680
that I've seen Garner a lot of fanfare

95
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,360
from the community the chemd cross

96
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,120
headband and the lemon tree cross

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,799
headband and I can sort of understand

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,540
why both of them have a lot of

99
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,099
popularity I'll be honest I've actually

100
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,680
got a pack of both of those and I've

101
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,919
stashed them away for myself my question

102
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,560
is did you expect some of these headband

103
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,079
hybrids to get the popular reception

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
that they have and are there any

105
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,620
particular crosses you're hoping to see

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
happen with some of the cuts you're

107
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,740
associated with

108
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:44,819
yeah I mean so that's like uh I gave

109
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,939
I've given various Cuts uh to CSI

110
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:49,978
um some of which like the headband he's

111
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,680
he's already used and released some of

112
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,719
which are still uh private or in the

113
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,319
works or whatever and it was mostly just

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,360
because I'm mostly a private breeder uh

115
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,860
and you know once you start chatting

116
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,479
about a bunch of this stuff and you have

117
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,100
interest out there and you want to you

118
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:06,659
you want to figure out a way to spread

119
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,180
it out to the community to some degree

120
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,699
right and since he's so prolific and

121
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,180
he's also popular and does a good job he

122
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:17,040
was a good vessel for that right

123
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,680
um and you know yeah there are some

124
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,199
things that I think that are unexpected

125
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,720
I didn't grow any of the La by Lemon

126
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,180
Tree but I did grow

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,100
um at a project I did an outdoor a few

128
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,939
years ago I did grow a ton of his work

129
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,699
outside and I did grow quite a few uh

130
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:38,038
lemon tree and other hybrids uh Calio

131
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,500
hybrids and stuff like that and much

132
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,620
like train wreck uh that terp that we

133
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,459
were talking about earlier

134
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:50,939
the the Citrus is a dominant terp in the

135
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,500
sense that it really pops up in a lot of

136
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,439
the progeny it's definitely something

137
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,180
that combines and gets passed on really

138
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,800
strongly

139
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,340
um so a lot of this a lot of the lemon

140
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,520
stuff uh would be uh you're gonna smell

141
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:09,779
a lot of lemon and my hope if if you

142
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:13,079
grew some La by Lemon Tree is that the

143
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:16,038
LA would lend some some gassiness and

144
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:19,800
some skunk and some potency

145
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:21,060
to the the lemon tree side of it that

146
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,259
would that would be the hope that I

147
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,259
would have is that it would give it

148
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:28,620
would give it some legs if you would

149
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,199
uh the chemd by La seems to be the most

150
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,000
popular one so far uh people have been

151
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,300
getting a lot of wild stuff out of that

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,519
which is cool because those two strains

153
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,079
are I don't know I'm not really big on

154
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,879
rating strains but they would definitely

155
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,839
go into like my all-time favorites

156
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,959
category

157
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,579
uh so it and I think they cross it seems

158
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,439
like they crossed really well and I

159
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,899
still have people sending me pics all

160
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,519
the time of those hybrids and people

161
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,258
really happy with what they're finding

162
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,899
in there so

163
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,120
um that's a positive yeah nice one

164
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,399
that's some great feedback and

165
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,519
um some people might be a bit curious

166
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,379
about what do you mean the LA maybe not

167
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,418
entirely sure on the back story on that

168
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:12,180
I'd love to get your version of events

169
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:15,000
the you know the headband cut the not so

170
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,000
headband cut also originally known as

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,500
the LA Kush how did that come to be how

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,959
did you get your hands on it did you

173
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,759
ever interact directly with uh

174
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,279
mandelbrot or was that just sort of

175
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,180
coincidental

176
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,579
oh no

177
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,098
um mandelbrot and I were friends right

178
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:36,478
and there's a buddy of mine who

179
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:38,279
introduced us uh my homie uh Josh and uh

180
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,579
he

181
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:43,978
um you know mandelbrot was more into

182
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,859
let's I don't know how to put it uh

183
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:50,159
let's put it this way mandelbrot was was

184
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,000
deep into the Grateful Dead hippie side

185
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,099
of things right and in the early 2000s

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,959
he was getting it more interested in

187
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,759
switching over and trying to mess around

188
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,579
with some weed right

189
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,340
and it so happened that my buddy and I

190
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:07,620
uh Stat or I called Staten Island on the

191
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,418
show before had been doing some projects

192
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,538
together and some breeding work over the

193
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:15,959
last number of years uh together and so

194
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:18,180
I had a whole big collection of

195
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,180
um you know seeds and hybrids and stuff

196
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,280
that I had made right and

197
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,259
he wanted to get started on a seed

198
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,459
company and he wanted to start messing

199
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,660
around with stuff but he didn't really

200
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,439
have very much stock so he ended up

201
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,120
um

202
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,879
he ended up getting a bunch of seed from

203
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,099
me uh mostly super dog hybrids super dog

204
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,399
Maui Super Dog by super dog various

205
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,560
things a handful of cuts

206
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,919
um I gave him a couple of my super dog

207
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:50,579
selections I gave them my Sour Diesel a

208
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:53,519
couple things like that and he had gone

209
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,139
down to LA and he had gotten this

210
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,080
headband that they were calling the LA

211
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,899
Kush right now you got to realize this

212
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,320
was in the very early 2000s so it was

213
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,799
before most people had heard of or the

214
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,019
really the cush wave of La had happened

215
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,599
because obviously as we're both well

216
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,700
aware what became known as Kush was very

217
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,159
different than this cut

218
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,620
right this was very much more of a

219
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,600
diesel cut very much more of a of a sort

220
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,120
of a sour looking type of thing

221
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,220
so he brings it back up and he's like

222
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,560
hey I want to give you this thing I have

223
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,040
this other Sour Diesel and I have this

224
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,899
headband that I want to give you and so

225
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,360
he drives he drives down from Humboldt

226
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,458
and he gives me two headbands and two

227
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,080
sours but they're unlabeled but he's

228
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,479
like just grow them save all the moms

229
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,220
and grow them side by side

230
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,680
so I grow these things up

231
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,120
and I'm showing it to friends and

232
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,399
everyone's like oh it's all the same

233
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,600
weed there's no difference like none of

234
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,620
these moms are different none of the

235
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,820
rooms are different none of the

236
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,620
greenhouse is different it's all the

237
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,180
same weed and they're like he gave he

238
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,339
must have given you his version of Sour

239
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,899
Diesel this looks like sour to me just

240
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,480
different it's different but it's

241
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,820
definitely sour so for four or five

242
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,560
months I thought he had messed up and

243
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,320
just given me Sour Diesel

244
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,879
and then he came down to my house one

245
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,500
day and he walks into a room that was

246
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,500
about 10 days away from being done he's

247
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,940
like oh this is all L.A I must have not

248
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,559
given I must have not given you the sour

249
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,580
this is the LA this is the headband for

250
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,319
sure

251
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,700
you know and actually and so I asked him

252
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,620
for his sour and he's like you know what

253
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,778
the one you gave me is way nicer than

254
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,000
the one that I had so there's not even

255
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:32,159
any point just keep this one

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,139
so I got that cut

257
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,819
I don't know I think he got it in O2 or

258
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,939
03 or something like that right in that

259
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:42,060
range a long time ago now and um I got

260
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,579
it as you know he got it as the LA Kush

261
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:47,338
um but it was called a headband

262
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:50,879
right and that's all I know about it to

263
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,680
be honest and he ended up uh starting

264
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,360
Emerald Mountain seed Emerald Mountain

265
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,979
Seed Company

266
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,019
um with a lot of stuff that I had given

267
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,539
him and some of the stuff that he had

268
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:03,440
and he Blended that La he made you

269
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:07,139
probably heard of it the 707 Headband

270
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,480
that is the that La cut cross to an

271
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:12,000
Afghani he had that he released as a

272
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,560
seed line and that still exists

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,139
um and he passed it out pretty freely

274
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,939
and I passed it out pretty freely and

275
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,699
somehow I'm not going to say I'm the

276
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,860
only person that uh that has it because

277
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,360
that would be presumptuous but it does

278
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,120
seem like

279
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,278
it's not one of the more reliable sours

280
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,078
uh in the sense that it's a little bit

281
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,879
more environmentally sensitive and

282
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:34,979
people didn't hold on to it

283
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,078
so somehow it seems like I ended up

284
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,060
being one of the only people

285
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,739
that had it and then when I started

286
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:43,259
chatting about it

287
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,440
it's got a terrible name dude

288
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,899
in the sense that like it's the least

289
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,519
circulated headband right so if you

290
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,500
start talking about headband people want

291
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,560
to know is it the one that Bob Hemphill

292
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,778
has that Matt Elite has is it the one is

293
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,939
it the Loompa is it this is it that it's

294
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:02,700
none of those right and then if you call

295
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,360
it the LA Kush obviously people think of

296
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:10,079
kush they think of TK or ghost or you

297
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,200
know or Larry or Irene or whatever right

298
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,299
so its name isn't very descriptive in

299
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,399
that regard and

300
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,559
um it was never called not so's anything

301
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,120
up until I started doing the podcast

302
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,099
with Matt

303
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,139
and then for lack of a better way of

304
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,700
describing it people started trying to

305
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,139
identify it as like oh it's this

306
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,700
headband well which one it is oh it's

307
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,059
the one not so has

308
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,700
yep right so it's kind of one of those

309
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:37,859
ways where like my name got organically

310
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,579
added to it

311
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:46,019
and you know fairly recently really but

312
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:48,539
um it is I got it as La Kush Headband

313
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,419
yeah okay look that makes a lot of sense

314
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,099
and look I I think that from what I've

315
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:54,899
heard that's actually a similar story

316
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,600
with Lumpy's headband right like

317
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,759
apparently he never called it lumper's

318
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,379
headband it was just people he traded it

319
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,659
on the forums and people were like oh

320
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,639
this is the headband I got from Lumpa I

321
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:08,219
think

322
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,440
and I go back and forth and stuff and

323
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,300
like he doesn't like me very much but

324
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,380
um I think he intentionally added his

325
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,559
name to it

326
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:18,179
uh and I also think that then he got

327
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,819
what's weird about it is when you start

328
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:23,819
adding names to things for people a lot

329
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,800
of times people get protective of their

330
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,519
association with things

331
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:33,599
right and it there's a weird Pride

332
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,100
element that comes in so I mean

333
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,980
I uh

334
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,659
you know and it's it's also weird for me

335
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,839
to talk about mandelbrot because he's

336
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:45,360
passed and so I typically like you know

337
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,700
uh and his you know his brother is has a

338
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,480
seed company now and stuff and Emerald

339
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,579
Mountain Legacy and um you know like his

340
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,019
life and how he was is you know it's a

341
00:13:53,578 --> 00:13:56,759
little dicey to talk about in some

342
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:59,060
regards but because it's a shame because

343
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,120
he passed away early yeah and

344
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:06,958
unexpectedly and suddenly right

345
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,639
uh and um you know they he

346
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,559
people want you know when I talk about

347
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,700
when I tell that story sometimes people

348
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,018
like oh you're trying to take credit

349
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,820
from them you're trying to take this

350
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,639
you're trying to take that and I don't

351
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,740
think people get how cannabis really was

352
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,419
back then you know how you were talking

353
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,919
about when it came to the land race

354
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,699
stuff like you're standing on the

355
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:28,620
shoulders of others yeah right so Mandel

356
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,320
was standing on my shoulders to get his

357
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,000
seed company started but I'm not

358
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,860
standing on the ground I'm starting I'm

359
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,139
standing on the shoulders of Staten

360
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,759
Island and various other friends who

361
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,500
gave me the strains that I ended up

362
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,600
working with that we made those seeds

363
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,039
with and they're standing on the

364
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,040
shoulders of the P you know what I mean

365
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,198
and it just keeps going back to where

366
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,939
it's like well who gets credit

367
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,659
you know it's like well Wendy how did

368
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,180
you hold the Baton so you know uh did I

369
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:59,639
give Mandel most of what he used to

370
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,559
start a seed company yeah

371
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,360
does that mean I'm responsible for all

372
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,919
the choices that he made and all the

373
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
effort that he put in and everything he

374
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,000
did after that of course not no

375
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,679
I didn't even charge him back then

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,120
because back then

377
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,338
like

378
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,600
just you know there was like I was

379
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:21,420
saying in 2001 2002 2003 there was no

380
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,459
outlets for American private breeders to

381
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:24,838
really sell their seats

382
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:28,619
yeah

383
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,540
right there wasn't so most of us we you

384
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,980
know I would I I mentioned it before on

385
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,778
the show too like we you know we go to

386
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,579
these Harvest festivals you be given 50

387
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:36,539
or 100 seeds away to friends all the

388
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:39,479
time

389
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,099
try this I made this I got way more than

390
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,399
I need take some

391
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,339
right it was also pre-reversals for most

392
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,198
people so they were all regular seeds

393
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,180
and

394
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:54,120
um you know so yeah I mean I gave I gave

395
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:55,439
Mandel probably over a thousand seats

396
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,120
right

397
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,699
but I had

398
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,679
so so many dude

399
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:03,659
like what was I gonna do with like what

400
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,039
you know honestly like I I mean I gave

401
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:06,719
away seeds to all kinds of friends

402
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,278
because

403
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,620
um what what would I do with all of them

404
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:13,198
yeah it gets a bit like that doesn't it

405
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:17,578
yeah I mean it's like okay I got I've

406
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:19,620
got 50 000 seeds of Superdog hybrids and

407
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:21,659
so every home of mine that wanted them

408
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,980
that wanted to pop them that wanted to

409
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,719
run them in their Greenhouse that wanted

410
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,420
to do something with them sure

411
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,940
because it was long before

412
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:32,039
you there was really any weird ego in

413
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,199
the American scene about like oh I'm

414
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,879
gonna make a seed company this is my

415
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,740
[ __ ] you're gonna have to pay me you're

416
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:41,639
gonna have to it was more like weed

417
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,759
nerds trading yeah more organic right it

418
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,259
was very much more so organic and so now

419
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,940
it's like people are like you try to

420
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,320
honestly talk about it and people are

421
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,519
like oh you're trying to steal thunder

422
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,019
right

423
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,940
but has nothing to do with that really

424
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,500
it was just a different era that's

425
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,759
really all I can say about it was just a

426
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,860
different era it was like my homie

427
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,240
wanted to start a seed company I had way

428
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,220
more seeds than I knew what to do with

429
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,019
he had a couple of clones he wanted some

430
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,919
more clones he wanted some more stuff to

431
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:06,298
start with

432
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,559
here you go

433
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:10,078
you know

434
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,759
here's 1200 seeds here's 1400 seeds

435
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,279
they're like nine different crosses of

436
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,919
different things see what you find

437
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,539
go for it look I uh we're definitely

438
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,919
gonna jump into that but I want to

439
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,438
quickly ask one of the thing and then

440
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,319
we'll we'll loop back to it which is in

441
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,319
terms of the the headband with lumpers

442
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:30,119
versus your one how would you describe

443
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,399
the differences because I think they're

444
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,038
both two very good ones that go around

445
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,380
as the term headband what do you think

446
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,599
are the differences the similarities and

447
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,400
why do you think there are so many

448
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,199
different headbands out there it feels

449
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,019
to me like it's it's got to be up there

450
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,640
with sour in terms of like the number of

451
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:48,859
different cuttings that go around with

452
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,520
the same name

453
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,139
well

454
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,879
um so there's different stories to it

455
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,059
you know

456
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,400
um I'll start with the headband name it

457
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:01,019
seems like headband ended up becoming a

458
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,019
popular name right

459
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:06,599
and then it seemed like headband was

460
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,160
also tied into the the sour diesel

461
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,319
origin story

462
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,019
and there was a lot of mystery around it

463
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,759
right and so

464
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,379
when there's mystery around it and

465
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,500
there's money and there's rep to be made

466
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:24,059
sometimes names get tagged onto things

467
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:26,099
okay so I have no idea why my why the

468
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,599
the headband the LA that I have is

469
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:29,219
called headband it's just that's what it

470
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,439
was that's what it that's what it was

471
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,480
right lumpas

472
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,279
I think and he might get real mad at me

473
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:41,700
for this but I think it's an ogs one

474
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:44,519
yeah I agree my my cut is very much in

475
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,819
the sour or the diesel type of family

476
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,980
look it's it's stretchy it's got that

477
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,678
it's got those similar Terps to it it's

478
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,400
got similar growth pattern it's very

479
00:18:52,679 --> 00:19:00,240
much in that family right uh Lumpa is

480
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:04,019
very much an OG Kush type you know in in

481
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,019
my opinion uh it's really good smoke uh

482
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:08,460
it's very potent it's enjoyable smoke

483
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,679
um but to me it's just a really nice

484
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,419
Kush you know like if you had that and

485
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,679
you had ghosts and you had triangle and

486
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,440
you had a few different things it would

487
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,900
fit right in that same movie yeah and

488
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,160
then you've probably tried I call it you

489
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,780
know I mean people call it different

490
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,080
names but you've probably tried that

491
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:27,418
other one I call it the 56.

492
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:29,639
um you know uh

493
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:33,419
um mad Elite has it

494
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:36,600
um uh I see Collective has it Bob hemp

495
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,940
Hill has it right yeah um it's I think I

496
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:42,298
think it's the the one that's skunk VA

497
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,840
uses too uh and that one's a Cush

498
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:47,339
and apparently uh you know there was you

499
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,980
know you probably heard the story but

500
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:51,480
there was there was some drama and there

501
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,860
was maybe some violence or there was

502
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,500
some issues going on in Southern

503
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,918
California over this cut and this guy

504
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,538
took it to to San Francisco

505
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,520
and they didn't really want any of that

506
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:04,679
drama following them

507
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:08,279
so they intentionally renamed it

508
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,840
headband ah okay right that's the very

509
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,599
simple version

510
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,298
so you have a couple of what I consider

511
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,459
to basically be OG Kush types

512
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:21,000
as headband

513
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,500
and don't get me I and then there's so

514
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,179
much confusion where people are like oh

515
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,880
this is the day record this is the

516
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,559
original diesel this is that headband

517
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,900
and they all have these very murky

518
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,940
stories so I don't necessarily know I'll

519
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,100
be able to like explain every single one

520
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,038
of them to you but I would just say that

521
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:40,379
headband

522
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,919
was a famous strain that people wanted

523
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,900
to tie strains that they had to that

524
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,660
lineage and to that Legend and the

525
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,720
legend was murky enough it allowed for a

526
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,820
lot of that to happen yeah okay that

527
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,298
certainly makes sense actually

528
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:59,159
so let's go back to our first question

529
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,200
we normally start with take me back to

530
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,419
the beginning what was your very first

531
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,919
experience with cannabis

532
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,380
oh my God

533
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,020
that is normally how how you start but

534
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,240
we really went off field on this one um

535
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:15,359
it's not very exciting

536
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,220
uh my first experience with cannabis was

537
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,399
basically Mexican

538
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:24,179
right and in the early 90s when I

539
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,980
started smoking weed uh I knew of two

540
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,679
kinds of cannabis that you could get you

541
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,860
could get brown seeded cannabis that was

542
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:34,559
compressed and you could get hopefully

543
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:37,558
lesser compressed green cannabis that

544
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:40,440
was you know and you know the good stuff

545
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:42,298
had less seeds and was less compressed

546
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,860
and the worse stuff had a lot more seeds

547
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:45,720
and a lot more stems and was heavily

548
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,719
compressed

549
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,600
um and so my in high school that's kind

550
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,880
of really what we had access to that was

551
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,500
what was you know it was twenty dollars

552
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,200
an eighth for brown weed and it was

553
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:02,460
thirty dollars an eighth for greenweed

554
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,038
uh and you know kind bud which is what

555
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,919
we you know um we all smoke now

556
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,319
uh I first experienced that going to a

557
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,840
dead show when I was 15.

558
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,579
I'd never I'd never seen weed that nice

559
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,839
before

560
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:17,839
um and it

561
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,058
I like Mexican weed

562
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:26,519
right so the effect that I got I had

563
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:27,658
plenty of fun getting stoned on Brown

564
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,700
Mexican

565
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:32,280
you know I came up in an era in America

566
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,259
where all the various Imports that

567
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,700
people talk about like Colombian and

568
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:39,839
Thai and this and that and everything

569
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,519
else that was all previous to me it was

570
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,579
basically just different grades of

571
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,798
Mexican that's all I saw

572
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:48,298
um and that was true in Florida uh I

573
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,220
guess in Florida we'd see a little bit

574
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:51,839
of of Jamaican but the Jamaican was

575
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,700
terrible a lot of times the Jamaican

576
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,058
would get sprayed with raid

577
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,860
uh which was a cockroach killer

578
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:00,899
um it was adulterated

579
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,240
um and you know who knows I was also a

580
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,519
teenager so it's not like

581
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,740
um I had very good access I don't come

582
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,779
from a family of pot smokers none of my

583
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,079
like I didn't I don't have one of those

584
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:15,599
origin stories that my dad or my uncles

585
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,220
or anyone like that got me into it all

586
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,759
early

587
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,500
um my experience with weed was basically

588
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,538
uh friend groups

589
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,700
you know and so what is that what is

590
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:28,200
your 15 or 16 or 17 year old friend

591
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,120
group have access to

592
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,500
that was sort of the start of it so some

593
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:33,119
people get on here and they're like oh

594
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,500
you know my uncle was doing this amazing

595
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,899
stuff and he was smuggling and he had

596
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,819
all these rare seeds that was not my

597
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,220
start in fact

598
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:46,500
I would say that maybe like my curiosity

599
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:48,240
about weed and my drive to learn more is

600
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,460
started from the fact that it was so

601
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,220
hard to get for us

602
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,960
right and figuring out information about

603
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,579
it was hard and you got to realize that

604
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,079
like when I started smoking there was no

605
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:00,418
internet

606
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,639
so it was like maybe you get some High

607
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:03,960
Times you know and read some read some

608
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,299
stories in High Times there's a few

609
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,538
books out about it I I started growing

610
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:12,720
weed in when I was 18 when I moved out

611
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:14,579
of my parents house mostly because

612
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,140
I wanted to be able to get good weed

613
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,599
like I could get on dead tour and I

614
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,880
couldn't find it reliably around me at

615
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,678
all uh look you preempted my next

616
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,140
question because I was gonna say I find

617
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,480
with most younger people the thing that

618
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,580
stimulates them to start growing is

619
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,679
getting exposed to some like super

620
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:34,139
phenomenal weed and you're like wow I've

621
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,759
got to do this for myself would you say

622
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,860
that it was on dead tour that happened

623
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,740
and if so do you remember the specific

624
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,959
Bud that gave you that light bulb moment

625
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,779
I mean you know you have to realize too

626
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,460
that like names were fairly uncommon

627
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:49,200
like there was a lot of weed on dead

628
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,779
tour that was like Humboldt County

629
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,740
organic outdoor that's what it was sold

630
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:57,720
as you know cotton Bud yeah kind bud

631
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,460
nuggets you know I got them nuggets you

632
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,419
know instead of being compressed it was

633
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,519
like nicely shaped nugs you know flower

634
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,100
um so yeah I don't really remember what

635
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,500
it was I just remembered that it was

636
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:13,019
green and stinky and not compressed and

637
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,759
seedless and it worked way better

638
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:17,158
yeah

639
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,839
um and even to jump forward a second you

640
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,220
know when I was 22 or something like

641
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,058
that when I first moved to Mendocino

642
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,298
County

643
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:25,500
most weed around here was named where it

644
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:27,480
was from

645
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,700
instead of getting like a specific

646
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,919
strain you would be like oh this is some

647
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,960
Panther gapweed this is some weed from

648
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,820
whitethorn this is some Alder point lead

649
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,419
this is some weed that I got up on

650
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:41,220
spyrock road it was more like location

651
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:44,460
based than even the name

652
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:47,640
right and most of it was grown from seed

653
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,220
and most of it was mixed phinos in

654
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,460
pounds or in ounces

655
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,140
right it was it wasn't like it was mono

656
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,058
cropped like it is today with like most

657
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,700
people weren't growing cuttings

658
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:01,678
uh most people uh maybe indoor they were

659
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,080
growing cuttings but most outdoor and

660
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,460
Greenhouse stuff was from seed and so it

661
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,980
would be you might have five or six

662
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,440
different kinds of weed in the bag now

663
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,380
maybe they were sisters to each other so

664
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,679
it wasn't like you had like

665
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:18,179
wildly different strains mixed together

666
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,980
right but like somebody would grow a

667
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,659
batch of seeds and they would trim it up

668
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,400
and they would weigh it up and then they

669
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,400
would move it all along and then there

670
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,200
you go and so my early experience was

671
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,419
like

672
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,360
um you know kind bud was seedless kind

673
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:37,440
bud wasn't compressed kinda tasted

674
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:39,000
really nice and I didn't know what uh I

675
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,419
didn't know anything dude so I got out

676
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,359
of high school and I bought uh Mel Frank

677
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:47,100
and Ed rosenthal's book

678
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,519
um marijuana horticulture

679
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:54,000
and I bought uh marijuana botany from

680
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,460
Rob Clark and I bought uh what was the

681
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,440
third one uh Jorge cervanes's book that

682
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,720
he still puts out

683
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,820
um the indoor marijuana holder

684
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,740
Horticulture and other than that and a

685
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:07,259
little bit of advice from some older

686
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,640
hippies that I saw occasionally at shows

687
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,079
or whatever that was kind of how I

688
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,600
started

689
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,278
um I had one light on a mover a four by

690
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,798
eight tray

691
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:18,119
um I had a buddy of mine he's passed

692
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:19,980
away now I can say his name Johnny

693
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,899
Winters

694
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,640
um and he was probably about eight or

695
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,538
nine years older than me

696
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,419
and he was way into the Grateful Dead

697
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:32,220
um Widespread Panic uh various uh things

698
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,179
of that nature he was definitely a tour

699
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,839
rat

700
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:39,960
and he uh had a house in Carbondale

701
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,418
Illinois and he gave me these cuttings

702
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,240
called the crystal chunk

703
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:48,778
and that was the very first

704
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,940
um you know I grew 1 000 watt light on a

705
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:53,819
six foot mover over a four by eight tray

706
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,038
of Crystal chunk when I was probably the

707
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:57,418
summer of 1994.

708
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,099
yeah

709
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,960
um and that was the first that was the

710
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:04,199
first time I ever actually the first

711
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,620
time I ever grew weed to be honest uh is

712
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,480
I used to sit in my parents house and

713
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,099
dc'd you know I had to deseed and

714
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,579
de-stem the Mexican weed that I was

715
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:17,519
buying right so I would deseed it and

716
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:19,798
then I would flick the seeds and stems

717
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,000
out my window into the bushes

718
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,879
okay

719
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,700
and that was that and it was my job to

720
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,620
mow the family lawn so one time in

721
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,298
Spring I'm out there in Chicago and I'm

722
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,579
mowing the lawn and I come upon these

723
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:36,359
bushes and there's like three foot tall

724
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:37,918
pot plants really because I've been I've

725
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,740
been throwing hundreds of seeds out my

726
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,538
window for however many months you know

727
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,980
and then it got warm and some of them

728
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:45,720
sprouted and I remember like running

729
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,599
them over with my lawnmower because I

730
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,579
was so panicked I was gonna get busted

731
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,379
so the first time I ever grew I it was

732
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,599
on accident and then as soon as I saw

733
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,940
him I intentionally killed him because

734
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,079
it was not gonna go over well at my

735
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,120
house

736
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,678
um and that's another point maybe I

737
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,359
should make too is that like some people

738
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,519
grew up in a friendly wheat environment

739
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,979
my parents didn't smoke at all

740
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,980
so if I needed to get away with smoking

741
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,558
it had to be completely hidden I had to

742
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,720
take the dog on a walk you know maybe I

743
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,220
had to bring some like you know some gum

744
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,038
or something to like take it off my

745
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,960
breath I had to take a bunch of steps in

746
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:23,640
order to get away with it

747
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,860
um because my parents are cool you know

748
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,840
but they just weren't they weren't weed

749
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,939
people they weren't you know we lived in

750
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,178
a police state at the time

751
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,679
um and so as a teenager it all had to be

752
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,840
totally clandestine

753
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,940
girl you taking me back now and you say

754
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,278
that I love it you know and uh it makes

755
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,940
me think maybe um you know the dog

756
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,200
walker should have been named after you

757
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,000
uh I mean yeah it's just you just needed

758
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,679
to get out like that's you know I got

759
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,960
real religious my parents were all

760
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,899
stoked on me because when I was 16 17

761
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,380
whatever in high school I'd walk the dog

762
00:29:54,898 --> 00:30:00,239
religiously big long walks you know he's

763
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,679
a little overweight he needed to walk my

764
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,859
parents thought I was like really doing

765
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,600
a a big good deed and I get a couple

766
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:08,879
blocks away from the family and I'd

767
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:11,519
spark up my bowl and off we went right

768
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,480
so

769
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:17,639
um yeah growing weed was uh was just a

770
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,440
way like I needed I could get weed if I

771
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,500
went to Dead shows

772
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,720
but if I didn't go to a dead show there

773
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,919
was some people I knew in Chicago that I

774
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,079
could get weed from but only

775
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,759
occasionally and this this is going to

776
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,918
make you laugh right but let's say you

777
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,298
knew somebody that had a three lighter

778
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,580
okay

779
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,440
the person that bought that off that

780
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:38,939
person they would go through and

781
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,860
whatever they wanted to keep they would

782
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,380
pick out of like say the three or four

783
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:47,538
pounds they got they would pick out the

784
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:49,679
nicest pound out of the three nug by nug

785
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:50,879
and then they would sell the rest and

786
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,440
then your buddy would get it and he

787
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,679
would do the exact same thing so I might

788
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,220
only be like two people away from the

789
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,740
grower but everything I got was a small

790
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:04,980
yeah okay because it was so in demand

791
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,798
right that like didn't matter what it

792
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,480
was like it was 50 to 50 bucks an eighth

793
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,240
hundred bucks a quarter for anything

794
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,380
better than Mexican what an age and it

795
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,839
was hard to get

796
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,000
and it was it was hard to get and so par

797
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,158
I think that's actually if if it would

798
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,419
have been prevalent around me and it

799
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,640
would have been easy to get and I would

800
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:25,679
have been had multiple plugs or I would

801
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,778
have had someone to teach me

802
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,059
I learned how to grow weed by reading

803
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:31,558
books over and over and over again

804
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:33,119
I didn't know anything about electricity

805
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:34,558
I didn't know anything about wiring I

806
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,379
didn't know anything about air movement

807
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,579
I was growing in apartments in Chicago I

808
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,679
had to figure out a way to get her to

809
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:43,558
get away with it

810
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,798
um you know my Amsterdam trips were to

811
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:50,158
begin in 90 we went in 94 we went most

812
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:52,500
years between 94 and 04. is when I

813
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,720
stopped but for a good 10-year period

814
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,058
most years we went once or twice a year

815
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,600
on a seed buying trip

816
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:03,359
um and to party basically and uh that

817
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,859
was where I knew you know Dead shows and

818
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,558
Holland were where I knew to get good

819
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:09,178
weed that's brilliant and just

820
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,678
specifically when you went on those seed

821
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,019
hunting trips are there any real

822
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,220
memorable standout seeds like something

823
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:17,538
that really impressed you or maybe

824
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,278
something that even lived on until today

825
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:21,960
uh sure you know

826
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:23,640
um the I don't know if you've heard me

827
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,179
talk about or you've seen on my page

828
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,080
what I post the what we call the Maui oh

829
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:32,640
yeah

830
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:34,939
uh the Maui we got it uh I think I think

831
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,559
it was 1990 it was probably 1994

832
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,120
1994-ish so it's probably 29 years old

833
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,898
now

834
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,879
um that was gotten on a trip over there

835
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:48,178
uh probably the best thing that I ever

836
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,720
personally popped of what I bought over

837
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:54,059
there was uh black domino

838
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,860
um and it sadly did not live I got I got

839
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:58,500
an I got in trouble a couple times and

840
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:01,439
it got lost once and I've not been able

841
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,419
to find it again but as far as like my

842
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,580
personal seed pops of going over there

843
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:08,220
probably my favorite thing I ever found

844
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:11,939
from Holland genetics that I personally

845
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,980
purchased was black black domino

846
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,960
and I got it the first year it came out

847
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,179
I think I got it in like December of 96

848
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,798
or something like that it had just been

849
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:22,440
released that fall

850
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:24,058
uh and I found a killer one it was

851
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,580
really really potent tasted like black

852
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:29,940
pepper uh it was really enjoyable smoke

853
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:32,699
I miss it quite a bit actually

854
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,740
um and I was dumb too dude I should have

855
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,399
probably bought

856
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,980
two or three things and bought like 50

857
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:43,439
to 80 seeds of each right

858
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,259
but instead I'd bring home like

859
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,880
15 packs of one or two of each of each

860
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,778
of it

861
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,539
right so you have like 10 or 12 seats

862
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:55,919
you know or 15 seeds or eight seeds or

863
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:57,480
whatever and then you get like five

864
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,880
girls and then you don't find what I

865
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,500
need what you wanted if I was smarter

866
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,960
and I was older if I was doing it today

867
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,640
and that [ __ ] still existed I'd be

868
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,259
buying 50 to 80 seeds of each and

869
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,059
probably only buying two or three things

870
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:12,898
and like coming home and giving myself

871
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:16,139
20 or 30 or 35 females to look through

872
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:17,519
yeah right hindsight's 2020 for sure I

873
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,899
didn't know what I was doing I mean some

874
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,480
of that stuff like back in the day when

875
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:24,179
we were first getting it you know we

876
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,099
killed all the males we didn't make seed

877
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,480
that didn't occur to us at the time it

878
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:29,399
was like the way that you did it is you

879
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,099
got seed and you picked out the best

880
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:34,679
females and you killed everything else

881
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,480
look that's almost the perfect segue to

882
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,460
talk about the Mendo perps but I'm going

883
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,099
to resist the urge to jump there and try

884
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,898
to keep us in chronological order so do

885
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,820
you remember what it was you were first

886
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:47,398
growing when you started growing

887
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,039
yeah I mean the very first weed I ever

888
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,779
got it was uh I actually it's really

889
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:54,119
weird how the internet works but I

890
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,580
reconnected with someone

891
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,140
um who was friends with Johnny Winter

892
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,900
back then

893
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,639
um and in that same group of people and

894
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,740
um he told me that the crystal chunk is

895
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,379
some kind of he doesn't remember which

896
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:10,019
one but he said it's some kind of NL or

897
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:13,019
NL hybrid that they bought from the seed

898
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:14,880
bank uh back then oh wow and I don't

899
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:16,679
have it anymore I have some see some old

900
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,380
seeds of it that a friend gave me I

901
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:22,319
don't have this the Clone anymore

902
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,260
um but that was the very first

903
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,240
um kind bud strain I ever grew was I

904
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,760
grew a couple I grew a light of Crystal

905
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:33,479
chunk and then shortly after that we did

906
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,920
an Amsterdam trip and uh we got some

907
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,619
various different strains we started

908
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,539
seed popping and we got the Maui ended

909
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,000
up popping up in our group and that that

910
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:44,219
obviously still exists

911
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,358
um so uh

912
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:49,919
yeah that that was that was kind of like

913
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,940
that was what we were going as far as

914
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,980
like trading with other people dude like

915
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,380
two other people besides myself knew I

916
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,139
was even growing in Chicago yeah

917
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,579
I would like to keep it that crazy like

918
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,400
to make sure that I didn't get in

919
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:09,119
trouble I would literally be at parties

920
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:13,200
and I would buy an eighth off my friend

921
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,720
who I sold a pound to wow so that way I

922
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,219
did it in public right and that way a

923
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:19,199
bunch of friends would see oh this is

924
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:22,139
why Francis that this is why not so has

925
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,419
this week yeah okay I love that right

926
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:26,578
because this is this is this is why I

927
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,900
saw him he bought a quarter he bought an

928
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,019
eight of course he's got the same stuff

929
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:34,260
it's from dude right but then if you do

930
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:36,960
that in public I can't be the grower but

931
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,480
a social engineering at its finest why

932
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,400
why would I be buying it so the world

933
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,260
that you came into where like there's

934
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,358
connectivity and there's people trading

935
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,160
cuts and there's access to cuts and all

936
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,858
that type of stuff

937
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:51,779
that was Zero my world

938
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:53,819
like we had our small little group of

939
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,859
friends that had that that like were all

940
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,140
the same age that had a few cuts and we

941
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:59,578
went to Amsterdam we got some seed and

942
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:01,379
then my buddy ended up moving to

943
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,060
Colorado and that sort of expanded

944
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,440
things a little bit

945
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:08,099
um that's where I got introduced to the

946
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:11,639
caller the to what people call the cough

947
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:14,338
um the wheelchair the question mark

948
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:17,098
um the Hong Kong

949
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:19,440
um that kind of thing and then

950
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,660
I moved out to Mendocino County which is

951
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,179
a whole kind of crazy story in itself

952
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:25,440
but I moved out to Mendocino County in

953
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:27,719
the late 90s

954
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,380
and then eventually stuff really started

955
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:33,539
shifting for me I met uh Staten Island I

956
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,480
ended up getting the super skunk and the

957
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:38,279
and the chem dog I started trading with

958
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,139
various people in Mendo and getting some

959
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,240
different stuff and that's kind of like

960
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:44,578
the the journey that began

961
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,838
wow you definitely preempted my next

962
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,640
question which I was going to ask which

963
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:51,779
came first meeting started an island or

964
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:53,460
moving to Mendocino oh I guess you sort

965
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,260
of answered it but my question Still

966
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,900
Remains what was it like when you first

967
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,359
moved to Mendo was it like were things

968
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,420
big and popping off or was it still like

969
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:04,920
that old world vibe that like Mean Gene

970
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,260
talks about where you know like there

971
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,820
was just these old Afghans and NLS and

972
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,960
like not too much more was discussed

973
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,240
beyond that because it was just good

974
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,300
weed

975
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:17,459
um I would say that's true so I I kind

976
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,980
of came into like uh me and Jean and I

977
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:24,420
have chatted about it a bit you know

978
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,699
um and I came out to Mendo in a really

979
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,619
weird way uh I don't know I don't think

980
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:30,299
I've told this story publicly I'll I'll

981
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,500
give kind of an Abridged version of it

982
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,720
but

983
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,320
I had

984
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,819
um

985
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,119
my partner

986
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,500
and by partner I mean like my uh my ex

987
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,800
she

988
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,539
got cancer when we were in our early 20s

989
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,500
okay

990
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:51,119
and in back in Illinois there is no like

991
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,519
uh I don't know what it's like in

992
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,960
Australia but there is no like Universal

993
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,039
Health Coverage here

994
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,519
okay

995
00:38:56,039 --> 00:39:00,838
uh there's zero it's pretty much Darwin

996
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,280
um like if you were to get into like an

997
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,858
accident and break your leg or you were

998
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,060
to have some kind of crazy emergency

999
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:08,279
they'll take care of you but if you need

1000
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:09,900
like dialysis or you need chemo or

1001
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,060
something like that

1002
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,800
um you're pretty much out of luck

1003
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,480
um so

1004
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,579
I was in this situation where I was

1005
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,179
totally in love with her and she was

1006
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,800
sick and I needed to figure out a way to

1007
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:24,719
help her

1008
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,400
and so I started hustling and doing all

1009
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:27,659
these various things trying to earn

1010
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,300
enough money

1011
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:32,399
that I could afford the surgery she

1012
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,539
needed and the chemo that she needed

1013
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,220
right and the chemo I was like a

1014
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:41,400
Grateful Dead hippie dude so I was like

1015
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:43,500
a million percent against

1016
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,059
doing any kind of radiation or any kind

1017
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,960
of chemo I was absolutely convinced it

1018
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,000
was poison

1019
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,260
and then the doctor pulled me aside and

1020
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,559
he was like look man

1021
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:55,740
he goes if you do this right now

1022
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:58,259
she has probably like a probably a 90

1023
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,939
chance of complete remission

1024
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,680
and I went home and I was like man you

1025
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,740
know 90 is pretty good

1026
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,659
right if someone tells you you have a 90

1027
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:08,159
chance of getting what you want you if

1028
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:09,299
you do this thing you'd probably do the

1029
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,480
thing right

1030
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:15,180
so I

1031
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,460
um we did the we did the chemo and it

1032
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,480
worked it was she went into remission

1033
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,679
but

1034
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,780
I don't know if you know much about

1035
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,659
women's sizes she was about a size seven

1036
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,859
when she started she was throwing up a

1037
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:28,259
whole bunch

1038
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:30,059
and she couldn't keep food down and she

1039
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,760
was dropping weight like crazy and she

1040
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,619
ended up being like a double zero in

1041
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,700
size like she was just wasting she was

1042
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:38,460
wasting away

1043
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:40,799
and they went through every every

1044
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,358
anti-nausea medicine known to man all

1045
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,320
this different [ __ ] none of it was

1046
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,179
working

1047
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,338
and so this guy this doctor this

1048
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:50,098
oncologist that we had he was like an

1049
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:52,559
old Roman Catholic Italian guy and we

1050
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,940
were obviously Grateful Dead hippies

1051
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,400
okay

1052
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,900
and he looks at me and he goes do you

1053
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,460
guys smoke weed

1054
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,519
and I was like

1055
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,159
I smoke weed and he goes you know we've

1056
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,380
tried everything else maybe before she

1057
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,838
comes in and she does her chemotherapy

1058
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,940
you guys could smoke a bunch of weed

1059
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,440
because we've tried everything else and

1060
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,358
nothing's really worked so I'm not

1061
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,920
really supposed to say this but you know

1062
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,380
I've heard a little bit that maybe it

1063
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,480
can control nausea and it it's so why

1064
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,480
don't you give it a shot

1065
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,639
so we would wake up and we would watch

1066
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,338
the prices Bob Barker and the price is

1067
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,618
right and we would smoke joints and and

1068
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:34,619
pole bongs and I would get her

1069
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:36,660
hellaciously baked before these chemo

1070
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,720
treatments right

1071
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:42,059
and she stopped vomiting

1072
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,459
and she started gaining weight

1073
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:46,199
okay that's incredible and it was

1074
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,358
literally like it was literally like a

1075
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,759
[ __ ] miracle like she went from a

1076
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:54,779
size seven down to a double zero back up

1077
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,760
to a size five all from weed so this is

1078
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:00,780
probably I don't know this is probably

1079
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,820
1996 and I had some at this point Jerry

1080
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,859
Garcia had died and there was no more

1081
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,559
dead tour and I had friends that had

1082
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:09,420
ended up in Mendocino County growing

1083
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,159
weed that I knew from a couple friends

1084
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:15,000
that I knew from dead tour

1085
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,659
and in November of 96

1086
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,719
um

1087
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:20,940
my buddy called me up and he said dude

1088
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,759
it's time for you to move and I was like

1089
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:27,900
what do you mean and he was like we just

1090
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,599
passed the first medical marijuana

1091
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,639
law in the entire United States we voted

1092
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,700
and it went through it passed and he

1093
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:38,400
goes there's only five things that it

1094
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,719
covers and one of them is cancer and

1095
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,639
chemotherapy

1096
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,159
he's like so you can come out here with

1097
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:45,719
your lady and you can grow weed and you

1098
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,659
are safe

1099
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:53,159
they won't put you in jail for it

1100
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:55,920
so it took a little time but you know in

1101
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:58,078
97 or whatever we pretty much

1102
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,960
started shifting our life and figuring

1103
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,460
stuff out and we moved out the following

1104
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,539
year

1105
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:10,139
um into Mendocino County and um that's

1106
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:13,619
how I got out here uh in a in a totally

1107
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:17,578
random way and she went into remission

1108
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:19,380
and uh got completely healthy and I

1109
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:21,060
loved it out here and she absolutely

1110
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,380
hated it and she wanted to move back to

1111
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,679
Chicago

1112
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:29,460
and our relationship did not last and so

1113
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:31,078
she moved back to Illinois and I stayed

1114
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,579
in California in Mendocino County and

1115
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:35,160
I've been here since

1116
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:37,079
and what's weird about that is that at

1117
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,618
one point Mendocino County had the most

1118
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,079
liberal and forward-thinking

1119
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,599
um cannabis laws in the country

1120
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,519
I was actually part of the Sheriff's

1121
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,160
Department's medical marijuana program

1122
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,539
we were vetted her and I through the

1123
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,299
Department of Health

1124
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:56,460
I had a I had a Mendocino County

1125
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,880
Sheriff's department and and Mendocino

1126
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,440
County Department of Health laminated

1127
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,358
membership card

1128
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,039
that said I was allowed to carry up to

1129
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,838
two pounds on my person and I was

1130
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,579
allowed to legally smoke cannabis and

1131
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:10,199
consume cannabis and grow it for our

1132
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,180
personal use

1133
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,980
and we were part of the part we were

1134
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:14,940
part of the pilot program that they

1135
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,699
started

1136
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,838
and fast forward a number of years I was

1137
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:20,779
part of that program I think it was

1138
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:24,119
until 04 the federal government

1139
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:26,099
threatened to come in and take

1140
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,660
um all of the records that Mendocino

1141
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:31,140
County had on who was in their medical

1142
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:33,779
marijuana program and at the time our uh

1143
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:36,118
our Sheriff was so hardcore he canceled

1144
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,740
the program and burned the records so

1145
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,180
that the feds couldn't have access to

1146
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:40,919
them so

1147
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:43,679
that was how I ended up in Mendocino

1148
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,780
County and if you wanted to segue into

1149
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,118
the Mendo perp story it's got a pretty

1150
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,500
good tie to that actually lead the way

1151
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,420
my friend I just want to quickly say

1152
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,980
what a what a beautiful story of the uh

1153
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,900
the benefits cannabis can have for

1154
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,480
people battling cancer but please please

1155
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,000
lead on so

1156
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,460
um I had a I had a friend of mine who

1157
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,019
was blowing glass at a time when blowing

1158
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,420
glass was pretty lucrative and mostly

1159
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:08,579
only hippies knew how to do it right and

1160
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,818
he was trying to set up an actual real

1161
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:13,560
Glass studio in his in his shop that he

1162
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:15,539
had on his property

1163
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:17,159
which because you got to realize at the

1164
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:18,960
time a lot of the early glass blowers

1165
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:22,019
like actually ended up damaging their

1166
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,480
lungs fuming gold and silver and not

1167
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:27,059
realizing that they needed to have

1168
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,679
proper ventilation okay

1169
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:30,239
and they ended up breathing in heavy

1170
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:32,759
metals and doing some damage to

1171
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,500
themselves and so he wanted to build

1172
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,800
this

1173
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:40,019
um basically this HVAC system that would

1174
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,780
pull you know a certain amount of air

1175
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:45,599
away from the station that he was

1176
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:48,000
working and uh

1177
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,359
and not toxify him right

1178
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,519
so he hires this guy

1179
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:57,719
uh who is a retired HVAC guy and he

1180
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,460
ended up being sick and he had cancer

1181
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:00,959
and so

1182
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,880
he was kind of going through the same

1183
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,940
thing my ex was going through and so I

1184
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,460
felt really bad for him and I ended up

1185
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,500
um I ended up giving him a chunk of

1186
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,000
water hash and I don't know

1187
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,960
two three ounces of weed or something

1188
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,719
like that

1189
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,358
and he had and I was like I just hope

1190
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:19,618
this helps you the way it helped my lady

1191
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,779
right

1192
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:23,160
and he was like man I can't afford this

1193
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,900
and I'm like I don't honestly I don't

1194
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:26,818
care you can just have it

1195
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,858
right you're helping us do this HVAC

1196
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:31,679
thing you're struggling for your health

1197
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:33,239
and your life I'm doing fine you know

1198
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,598
take a little hash take a few take some

1199
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:38,639
weed you're good and he felt embarrassed

1200
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,800
and I was like just just just do it like

1201
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,679
if it helps you it helps you I I need

1202
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,318
Zero from you okay

1203
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,879
so fast forward a week and he goes man

1204
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,039
you know I used to grow back in the day

1205
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,660
but I haven't done it in a while and I

1206
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:53,219
was digging in my closet and I found

1207
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:55,980
this little thing of seed

1208
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:58,318
and I thought maybe this is a way maybe

1209
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,880
you'd accept this as payment if you

1210
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,559
won't take any money or any work or

1211
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,240
anything like that and so he gave me two

1212
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:06,299
seats

1213
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:08,879
and uh I Sprout these things up

1214
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,920
and they both pop

1215
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,740
and I'm growing them up

1216
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,200
and one ends up being a girl and one

1217
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:17,818
ends up being a boy okay

1218
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,338
and I was having a friend of mine back

1219
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:23,099
then mostly we grew in bedrooms

1220
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:24,599
right it was pretty clandestine so we're

1221
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:26,160
growing in this bedroom and I'm having a

1222
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,260
friend of mine help me set up a bedroom

1223
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,879
because I had a three bedroom house I

1224
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,520
lived in one room

1225
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,619
one room was veg and one room was was

1226
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,780
flour right

1227
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,818
and uh

1228
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,380
I had him help me hang up all these

1229
00:47:38,818 --> 00:47:41,940
these lights in this room and set up

1230
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,858
this veg so we get this veg set up I

1231
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,559
move all my plants in there I go in

1232
00:47:43,858 --> 00:47:48,539
there the next morning and one of the

1233
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,719
lights you know the old school metal

1234
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:54,358
sharp uh Hood one of the lights he had

1235
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:56,039
put one of the one of the wood hooks

1236
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:58,199
into the ceiling but it had only gone in

1237
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,480
the drywall he'd missed the stud

1238
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:03,000
and as the night went on it fell out of

1239
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,579
the thing and it swung down and it

1240
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,500
chopped the mail off at the base oh my

1241
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:09,599
God and it was just laying there on the

1242
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,059
ground wilted

1243
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,260
so I'm like oh man well at least I'm

1244
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:15,779
like in my mind I'm like at least they

1245
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,819
killed the boy okay so I had this one

1246
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,319
girl so I bloomed this girl out

1247
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:21,838
and you got to realize this is the late

1248
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:23,159
90s so this is way before Urkel or

1249
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,199
anything like that and so all of a

1250
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:29,159
sudden I get this like crazy smelling

1251
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,659
Royal Purple looking cannabis and I am

1252
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,039
tripping out I've never seen anything

1253
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:35,159
quite like it

1254
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:37,380
and so I take it to dude and I'm like is

1255
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:38,818
this what you what is this and he looks

1256
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,740
at it and he goes man I didn't think

1257
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:42,358
that even existed still

1258
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:44,578
and I was like what is it he goes I

1259
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:47,460
don't know he's like but the only time I

1260
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:49,920
grew purple weed was like the summer of

1261
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:53,159
77 in kovalo

1262
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,500
which kovalo is a little uh remote uh

1263
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:57,059
town in Mendocino County uh tucked away

1264
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,219
in the middle of nowhere

1265
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:03,119
right so

1266
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:04,199
the seeds were basically 20 21 year old

1267
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,240
seeds

1268
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,639
that he had just tossed in a cold Closet

1269
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,139
in Laytonville and ignored

1270
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,900
and

1271
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:14,759
um he died that following year so I

1272
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,460
never really got more information off it

1273
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,280
besides that but that is literally how

1274
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,780
the way I got the Mendo perps is I gave

1275
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,060
a cancer patient

1276
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:26,280
um some hash and some weed to help him

1277
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:28,858
out and he gifted me back a couple of

1278
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,859
seeds and that's how I got the perps

1279
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:33,838
what an incredible sort of real organic

1280
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:36,480
story I love that you know just someone

1281
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,460
helping another person out and the

1282
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,740
universe rewards you for that indirectly

1283
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:44,220
that's that's beautiful did you have any

1284
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:45,779
idea it would go on to become what it is

1285
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:48,659
now and I think I have to preface this

1286
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,579
by acknowledging I think Mendo perps is

1287
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:52,440
still kind of coming into its prime

1288
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:54,780
especially with all the work Caleb's

1289
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,760
been doing I think it's even still like

1290
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,500
it's not like it was big and it fell off

1291
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,880
I think it's still gaining momentum but

1292
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,000
what's your perspective

1293
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,220
I would say that as a part of the reason

1294
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,260
why when you talk to people dude that

1295
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:09,779
the stories are so funny and they don't

1296
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,940
always line up is a lot of times it was

1297
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,440
young kids that had no idea that

1298
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,940
anything that they were doing was ever

1299
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,260
going to be talked about or be important

1300
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,579
again

1301
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:20,160
sure

1302
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:23,760
right I mean think about think about for

1303
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:28,279
a second think about uh chemdog popping

1304
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,280
the chem 91 when he was 17.

1305
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,780
right yeah yeah hugely unmemorable in

1306
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:35,519
the moment just you know and that's part

1307
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,740
of why some of the stories with sour

1308
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,900
diesel or with kush or with chemdog or

1309
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:42,719
with whatever gets so convoluted is

1310
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,460
because nobody knew that they needed to

1311
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,858
be that they were going to be asked on a

1312
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:50,579
granular level what happened

1313
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:52,078
right so no I didn't I didn't know I

1314
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:54,420
mean we

1315
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:57,059
um I knew it was special because at the

1316
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,338
time I had never seen purple weed before

1317
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:01,380
like that it's not like there was no

1318
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:03,480
purple weed that's silly there's plenty

1319
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,680
of Afghans and Mendo and stuff like that

1320
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,119
that

1321
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:08,338
um will turn purple in the cold

1322
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,200
especially you know you get some a cold

1323
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:11,279
snap and fall as they're ripening or

1324
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:12,419
something like that and they'll purple

1325
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,940
right up

1326
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,440
but for me at least in my experience in

1327
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,240
my realm

1328
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,480
um that was the first thing I ever grew

1329
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:23,578
that like in a 75 degree indoor room

1330
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,940
would just turn dark purple and it just

1331
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:29,039
smelled wild right and

1332
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,920
so

1333
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,960
um we loved it and I passed it around to

1334
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,800
good friends it's kind of a crazy story

1335
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,780
how CSI got it uh because you know but

1336
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:43,079
I'd let him tell that aspect of it but

1337
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,700
it was it it's

1338
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,280
I think it was sort of it was

1339
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:49,019
pre-purpled it was pre-pre

1340
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,119
um the purp the first purple wave that

1341
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:53,280
really got popular

1342
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,019
um and it only spread out so far but we

1343
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,359
did make some hybrids with it and those

1344
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:58,920
hybrids that we made

1345
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:00,179
um one of them was intentional we

1346
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,599
crossed

1347
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:06,419
um this Durban Poison line we had to uh

1348
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,760
the Mendo p and called it anise because

1349
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:12,000
it smelled very much like licorice

1350
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,640
uh and that has gone on to make a number

1351
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,519
of different things and then

1352
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:19,139
um I had this strain called

1353
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:20,239
the effects

1354
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:23,338
okay

1355
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:24,959
ef-e-x and I got it actually you know

1356
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:26,639
I'm sure you know who Tim Blake is right

1357
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,440
yeah

1358
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,679
um Tim Blake is actually the first

1359
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:35,400
person that ever showed me a 90 lighter

1360
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:37,139
uh way back when and I became friends

1361
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,000
with him I used to go to his house and

1362
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:41,219
he'd throw like he'd throw events at his

1363
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,619
at his spa and he'd have music and food

1364
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:45,779
and you know they'd pound music all

1365
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:49,740
night and have a good time and such and

1366
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:51,540
his worker gave me this cut that that

1367
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:54,179
some people called garlic Bud and some

1368
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:56,400
people called effects and I was growing

1369
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:58,679
a room at my friend's house

1370
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,700
um that had effects right next to

1371
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:04,858
semendo perps it was summertime the uh

1372
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:06,539
air conditioner went out it took me a

1373
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:09,179
couple of days to fix it and that amount

1374
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:11,338
of time the Mendo perps hermed it harmed

1375
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:13,618
all over the effects and I got a bunch

1376
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:15,239
of purple effect seats

1377
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:17,338
um and that was that was my first

1378
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:20,098
feminized breeding totally on accident

1379
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:21,659
not not intentional

1380
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:23,160
um and that strain actually you can see

1381
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:26,699
it I think it's in the second Canna

1382
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:28,679
Bible uh purple effects and it's gone on

1383
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:32,098
it's in a number of modern strains today

1384
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:34,019
like it's in the Sprite it's in the Rose

1385
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:36,480
um it's in a few different things that

1386
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:38,280
people have used over the years

1387
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,139
um I don't have it anymore I lost it and

1388
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,280
the seeds in a bust but it percolates

1389
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:43,679
around

1390
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,720
yeah wow that's a that's a really cool

1391
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:49,139
story and and could you ever have

1392
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:50,939
imagined that like you know the Mendo

1393
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:53,098
perp was what led the way for these

1394
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,260
things plus a plethora of other strains

1395
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:57,420
like you know I know that on breed of

1396
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,880
Syndicate I mentioned that um you know

1397
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,858
the Mendo breath was one that I feel

1398
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,480
like I see a lot of the Mendo purpose

1399
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:05,880
within that strain even though there's a

1400
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,800
few Generations removed could you

1401
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,318
imagine that like not only might it be

1402
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,180
used in things but even multiple

1403
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,338
Generations later you can still really

1404
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:18,058
sort of see it shining through

1405
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:21,719
I can uh and the reason is is that the

1406
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:23,519
one thing that um makes me think that my

1407
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:27,000
that the guy was telling me the truth

1408
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,318
okay is think about 1977 that would have

1409
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,119
been

1410
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,558
um like I was saying earlier in the show

1411
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:33,480
that was sort of like the first couple

1412
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,920
of years that Afghans were started to

1413
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,619
make their way into Humboldt and

1414
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,420
Mendocino County and spreading out a bit

1415
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,700
amongst the grower community

1416
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,639
and the only reason why I think it could

1417
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:49,259
possibly be true is that it's pretty low

1418
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:51,659
THC but it's very it's very much within

1419
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,000
the range of what most things THC wise

1420
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:56,219
were in that era

1421
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,858
um and it's got a very when you S1 it

1422
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:01,078
when CSI is S1 did

1423
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:03,299
um it's got an extremely wide gene pool

1424
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,579
in there it's definitely not narrow it's

1425
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:09,000
very broad lots and lots of different

1426
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:12,539
things pop out in those s1s much more

1427
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,400
broad than most strains and it's got I

1428
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:15,960
don't want to say it's got unique Terps

1429
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,079
because I don't think there is unique

1430
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:22,280
things in cannabis but I do think that

1431
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:24,780
it might be unique to what we know today

1432
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,640
in the sense that almost anything I've

1433
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:30,180
ever smelled that smells like Mendo

1434
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:33,420
perps I find that it

1435
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:36,719
ties back to Mendo in some way

1436
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,700
right and I would say that Mendo is

1437
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:41,039
probably a better breeder than it is as

1438
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:43,078
an actual plant itself

1439
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,539
um I think it's children

1440
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:47,039
um or even some of its s1s can be nicer

1441
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:49,858
than the mother plan I love the mother

1442
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:52,318
plant but it's got some things I really

1443
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:54,239
adore but it's also missing a couple of

1444
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:56,099
things that I wish it had

1445
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,459
so

1446
00:55:56,099 --> 00:56:00,838
um you know it it uh and there's a weird

1447
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,119
thing where people don't like to give

1448
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:04,558
credit you know they like you were

1449
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,180
saying before everyone wants to walk out

1450
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,880
with their strain and have it be like it

1451
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:10,078
CR and it it I created this out of

1452
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,480
nothing

1453
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,740
so I can understand how a bunch of

1454
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,838
people don't want to give up their

1455
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:19,019
secret sauce but what I do think is cool

1456
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:20,639
is that uh Way Beyond anything that I

1457
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:24,119
had to do with it the biggest

1458
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:26,219
contribution you can make in cannabis is

1459
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:28,019
to get some hybrids out there or to get

1460
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:29,759
some crosses out there to get some seed

1461
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:31,980
Pops that you happen to be a part of out

1462
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,500
there and that those things are valuable

1463
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,240
enough that other people most of which

1464
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,880
don't even know you or might not even

1465
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:40,858
know that you exist find valuable enough

1466
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,019
in that weed to keep breeding and

1467
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:45,838
growing and smoking it

1468
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:48,000
yeah certainly certainly and that's why

1469
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:50,099
I always try to mention to people you

1470
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,420
know I think there's nothing more you

1471
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:52,920
know there's nothing more to be grateful

1472
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,318
for as a breeder than when someone

1473
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,059
dedicates some space and time in their

1474
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:58,440
grow to Growing your workout especially

1475
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:01,200
if it's multiple times you know it's

1476
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,280
it's a real Testament yeah I mean think

1477
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:03,659
about like you know when people when

1478
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,480
you're talking about how people get mad

1479
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:08,639
that people steal their work right well

1480
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,318
you know what's worse is uh everyone's

1481
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:11,179
saying man that sucks I would never work

1482
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:13,558
with

1483
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:15,719
it's actually a compliment to have

1484
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:18,300
someone to have someone use your stuff

1485
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:20,399
and maybe it's even a bigger compliment

1486
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:24,119
if they like it so much they want to

1487
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,800
obscure where it comes from and say and

1488
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,440
make up their own story about it because

1489
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,240
it's so good they wanna they they want

1490
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,519
that like rep or whatever that comes

1491
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:35,519
with it to like come to them instead of

1492
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:37,920
you right because everyone's going to be

1493
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:40,800
forgotten dude you know like we're all

1494
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,599
just passing through a bit and you know

1495
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,700
20 30 years from now like you were

1496
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:46,019
talking about like you know what do you

1497
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:48,239
think strains will be remembered

1498
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:50,699
hopefully some of the Breeders now are

1499
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:53,519
making good enough work that some of

1500
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:55,379
their stuff still exists or at least is

1501
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,179
Blended into the modern stuff that

1502
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,160
exists then

1503
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:01,919
that's really the goal of breeding right

1504
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:04,019
is like to leave a genetic imprint and

1505
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,940
to maybe improve what you found in

1506
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:06,719
certain ways and pass it on to the next

1507
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,720
group

1508
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:11,399
for sure for sure maybe in uh 20 years

1509
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,500
we'll still have rainbow belts there you

1510
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,180
go Fletcher I gave you a good one yeah I

1511
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,980
mean I mean it's it's entirely possible

1512
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:19,019
man I don't even you know I don't even

1513
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,579
like cookies very much but it's

1514
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:24,179
certainly

1515
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:26,700
um it's certainly a big part of an on a

1516
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:28,199
permanent part of the community and I'll

1517
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:30,598
say this too like you were talking about

1518
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:33,358
Caleb and his and you know

1519
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,460
most of the time Caleb told me when when

1520
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,380
he meets people that are actually the

1521
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,960
originator of whatever strain that

1522
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,160
they're using he's using they get upset

1523
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,780
at him and they want some kind of

1524
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:44,818
compensation or they want some kind of

1525
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:47,819
shout out or they want rep because he's

1526
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:49,380
using their thing right he said I was

1527
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:51,599
like the only guy that was like just

1528
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,760
super stoked that

1529
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,500
um he was doing all these really cool

1530
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,200
things with the Mendo p

1531
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,480
because I do think that no one is more

1532
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:02,219
is going to be more responsible for

1533
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,219
making sure that those genetics don't

1534
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:07,980
get lost than him

1535
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:09,838
he's made more hybrids with it and he's

1536
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:12,900
popular enough that so many of those

1537
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:15,719
hybrids have sold and he's made a bunch

1538
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,760
of s1s and he's made it so that even if

1539
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,779
him and I or somebody else lost the

1540
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,059
mother cut

1541
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,339
that it's probably a permanent addition

1542
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:25,079
to the gene pool because it's been mixed

1543
00:59:23,338 --> 00:59:26,880
it's been mixed into enough things

1544
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:29,039
that's going to survive in some form

1545
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,940
yeah definitely that's that's a great

1546
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:34,858
way to view it and um I I wanted to just

1547
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,659
quickly loop back to the other thing we

1548
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:39,420
mentioned a few questions ago which was

1549
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:41,159
you know you said you moved to Mendo and

1550
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,740
then shortly after you met Staten Island

1551
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:46,259
and you got exposed to the dog and the

1552
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:48,058
super skunk how was it exactly that you

1553
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:51,260
met Staten Island and when you did meet

1554
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:54,660
him was he already in the thick of like

1555
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:56,700
the chem 91 and the super skunk fandom

1556
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:58,798
or was it still like he'd only just sort

1557
00:59:56,699 --> 01:00:01,259
of got them like where was it when you

1558
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:04,619
sort of stepped in

1559
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:06,420
um well I would so you know memories

1560
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:08,940
vary on this one a little bit but it

1561
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:10,440
seems like

1562
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:14,099
um

1563
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:17,039
it seems like he got both let's say

1564
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:19,380
sometime in 1994.

1565
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,719
okay

1566
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,160
um and then he brought them back to

1567
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:25,439
California

1568
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:28,618
uh it seems like

1569
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,960
um skunk VA was still traveling with the

1570
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:33,059
Grateful Dead then and so he didn't

1571
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:37,380
start growing I don't think until after

1572
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:40,019
Jerry died in August of 95

1573
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,519
and it seems like

1574
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:43,739
um you could ask him I suppose but it

1575
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:45,960
seems like after Jerry died he I believe

1576
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:48,659
he quit touring right away because there

1577
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,858
was no more tour and he came out

1578
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:55,139
um and get and uh Statin gave him

1579
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:57,480
um some super skunk and he started

1580
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:59,519
growing that and I believe those

1581
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,740
Polaroids that he posts on his page are

1582
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:05,519
from those very first few grows that he

1583
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:07,439
ever did okay and so I think

1584
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:12,059
um I want to say that maybe he got it

1585
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:14,460
from Staten Island and maybe 95 late 95

1586
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:17,519
maybe early 96

1587
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:21,480
um and then I see Collective

1588
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:24,119
uh graduated high school in 97 and he

1589
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,338
ended up moving in with skunk VA and so

1590
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:29,160
that's I think he got access to it

1591
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:32,759
um by that aspect and then I got it the

1592
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:38,159
following year from Staten Island

1593
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:40,380
um in 1998 and uh we just met randomly

1594
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:43,139
and um

1595
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,280
smoked each other's weed and really

1596
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:47,039
enjoyed it

1597
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,540
and then I ended up going down and

1598
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:50,699
having some dinners at his house he

1599
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:52,500
lived in Sonoma County at the time

1600
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:53,659
um with his with his lady that became

1601
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,880
his wife

1602
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:58,980
uh and we just ended up we just ended up

1603
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,579
becoming really good close friends and

1604
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:05,219
so he he was a stickler and he

1605
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:07,079
um really was very intent upon none of

1606
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:09,598
these things ever leaking

1607
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:11,700
uh but for whatever reason he decided to

1608
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,760
give them to me

1609
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:16,439
um and so I got the skunk and the uh and

1610
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,380
the chem dog from him

1611
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,179
and uh I've had the chem dogs since I

1612
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,220
had the skunk for a number of years I

1613
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:24,719
lost it I don't know maybe nine years

1614
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:27,419
eight eight nine years after that

1615
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:29,759
something along those lines and uh I got

1616
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:31,380
I got in trouble and uh they got cut

1617
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,839
down and I was the last person I knew

1618
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:39,000
that had it so that was that

1619
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:42,119
but I will say that there was Zero Fame

1620
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,159
around those cuts

1621
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:46,380
um there was nothing of the legend that

1622
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:49,199
you guys know of there was nothing of

1623
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,220
the like I think that uh I don't think

1624
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,818
that they even started getting

1625
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:56,639
popularized very much until skunk VA

1626
01:02:53,818 --> 01:02:58,159
went on the forums in 06 maybe or maybe

1627
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:01,199
it was o5

1628
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:02,578
but for the first I don't know half a

1629
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,199
decade I had it

1630
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:06,420
uh

1631
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:07,618
it was just like some super fire weed

1632
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:10,260
that we had

1633
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:12,599
and uh Staten Island wouldn't let me get

1634
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,359
wouldn't let me give it to anyone so

1635
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:18,059
nobody else could have it

1636
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:21,058
Ah that's that's so interesting and so

1637
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:23,760
most of the stories that I believe are

1638
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:25,680
the ones that I heard earliest

1639
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,299
right yeah

1640
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:29,098
um because obviously there's you know

1641
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:30,480
you know Fame gets into it different

1642
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:33,180
people get into it and people start

1643
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,579
arguing about time and stuff and so

1644
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:38,098
you know I I came you know do I know

1645
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:40,019
it's origin stories 100 you know there's

1646
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:41,880
obviously some debate back and forth on

1647
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:43,858
that but I got it pretty early from

1648
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,838
Staten Island

1649
01:03:43,858 --> 01:03:49,558
um just by being good friends with them

1650
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,818
and the whole super dog project was

1651
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:52,920
um also just something that happened

1652
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:55,380
because I was good friends with him and

1653
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,659
him and I were doing some stuff together

1654
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:59,760
and um

1655
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:03,239
you know that whole the whole like

1656
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,559
beginning of that really was that I

1657
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:06,679
don't think this is particularly well

1658
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:11,700
known maybe it is maybe it's not but

1659
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:13,919
after Statin had given the skunk to

1660
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:15,960
um to chemdog on the east coast and then

1661
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,358
brought the skunk and the chem and the

1662
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,599
dog out west

1663
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:25,019
um chemdog called them later and said

1664
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,400
dude the first time I grew this stuff it

1665
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:28,798
harmed

1666
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,200
the skunk hermed all over the chem dog

1667
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:33,599
and I got seeds and I'm growing those

1668
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,779
seeds and they're better than both of

1669
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,780
them

1670
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:42,358
so the whole start of his idea to like

1671
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:45,960
create the super dog was basically

1672
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:46,739
trying to combine those strains into one

1673
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,380
line

1674
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:52,379
but you got to remember back then that

1675
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:54,660
was so long before there was reversals

1676
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,298
or we even knew that reversals existed

1677
01:04:54,659 --> 01:05:00,118
so in order to like even make the line

1678
01:04:57,298 --> 01:05:01,500
happen it was like you had to BX you

1679
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:03,059
know it's almost like you had you had to

1680
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,920
get a pollen Source somewhere because

1681
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:08,040
the two clones that we wanted to cross

1682
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:10,559
were both girls

1683
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:11,759
we just had a single clone of each

1684
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,740
right

1685
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,859
and I knew nothing we knew nothing about

1686
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:19,558
reversals we knew in fact back then we

1687
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:21,960
thought that hermaphrodit exceed was

1688
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:25,500
cheating and it would [ __ ] up your seed

1689
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:28,460
line by making more hermaphrodites

1690
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:31,500
so uh we didn't know anything about

1691
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:34,260
reversals or feminized breeding or any

1692
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,960
of any of in that kind of stuff so

1693
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:38,760
he ended up taking the super skunk and

1694
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,480
he ended up Crossing it

1695
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:44,220
um to a male and then I think we took

1696
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,760
that I think he took that to F3

1697
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:51,000
something like that selecting for uh

1698
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,980
skunk traits and then I believe if I

1699
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,179
remember correctly

1700
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:57,179
um we might it might there might have

1701
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:59,818
been a a back Cross of that back onto

1702
01:05:57,179 --> 01:06:02,639
the the skunk cut itself

1703
01:05:59,818 --> 01:06:06,179
and then pollen from that got thrown on

1704
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:08,039
the dog and that became super dog

1705
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:10,259
that's interesting I didn't know there

1706
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:12,599
was that outcrossing step but I'd love

1707
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:14,579
to ask you whatever happened to the

1708
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:16,798
super dog because you know like we we

1709
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:18,720
spoke to skunk VA recently and he also

1710
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,759
sort of had fond memories of the strain

1711
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:22,858
and so it got me wondering like was

1712
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,440
there any specific reason no one held on

1713
01:06:22,858 --> 01:06:29,818
to a cut or anything

1714
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:33,240
well there's a bunch of reasons so

1715
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:35,579
like I said before 99 of people won't

1716
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:39,058
hold a cut unless it's currently popular

1717
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,980
right so people plenty of people held it

1718
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:45,359
and plenty of people grew it most people

1719
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:47,039
just didn't hold it for a long time okay

1720
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:52,139
and

1721
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:53,400
uh you know there was as far as

1722
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:55,618
gosh

1723
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,298
this gets kind of tricky but I'll just

1724
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:59,579
say it so

1725
01:06:57,298 --> 01:07:02,460
I gave all that stuff I gave to

1726
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:04,559
mandelbrot which was basically a pure

1727
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:07,199
super dog and then a bunch of Superdog

1728
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,440
hybrids that uh Staten Island and I had

1729
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:14,159
made Staten Island and I the final stage

1730
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:17,818
of Superdog that we did was we took

1731
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:19,279
seven or eight males combined with our

1732
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:22,440
favorite

1733
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,298
females of Superdog so I think there was

1734
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,880
seven and seven seven and seven of each

1735
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:29,400
we put those in a room and then we put

1736
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,619
it in there with like every single cut

1737
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,798
of quality cannabis that we had at the

1738
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:36,960
time which was Mendo perps Super Skunk

1739
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:41,338
the dog

1740
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:43,079
um black black domino the Warlock

1741
01:07:41,338 --> 01:07:44,578
um the Maui all kinds of different

1742
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:46,619
things we put them we put everything

1743
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:49,619
every good cutting we had we threw it in

1744
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:52,200
there on eight lighter and we just let

1745
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:54,180
the pollen fly and we just pollinated

1746
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:56,699
eight lights which is

1747
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:59,639
using making regular seed with copious

1748
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:01,558
amounts of pollen is a ginormous amount

1749
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:04,500
of seed right

1750
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:07,500
so after that we had a ton we had a ton

1751
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:09,358
of seed I gave a bunch to mandelbrot and

1752
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:11,760
the only thing that I asked was that if

1753
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:14,038
you found anything cool give it back to

1754
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:17,219
me or if anything ever happened and I

1755
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:19,020
needed it give it back to me

1756
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:20,759
um and neither one of those two things

1757
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:22,259
happened

1758
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:23,579
so

1759
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:26,100
um the mandelbrot story I don't really

1760
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:28,318
want to get into detail too much about

1761
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,239
all that because it's a little I just

1762
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,359
you know he was my buddy and we had we

1763
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:35,218
had some issues over it I will say that

1764
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,660
you know he had a little ego that went

1765
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:38,100
to his head and he didn't want to share

1766
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:39,778
and he didn't want to admit where some

1767
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,520
of it came from

1768
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:44,520
um we had kind of a falling out over it

1769
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,900
and then we met randomly in Ukiah we

1770
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,339
bumped into each other

1771
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:49,318
and we kind of had a heart to heart

1772
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:51,298
about it and he told me he was gonna

1773
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:53,039
give me back

1774
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:55,619
um some some selections he had made and

1775
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:58,380
he'd give me back some seed and we were

1776
01:08:55,619 --> 01:09:00,420
going to be all good and then with

1777
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:02,279
before that actually happened within a

1778
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:04,679
couple of months

1779
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:08,219
um he unexpectedly passed away

1780
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:10,500
and uh when he passed away

1781
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:12,899
um I don't know exactly what happened

1782
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,819
but it seems like people went into his

1783
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,198
grow room and people went into his seed

1784
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:19,679
stock and a lot of that stuff

1785
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:22,259
disappeared put it that way

1786
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,359
so then that left me in Staten Island we

1787
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:25,079
each had a bunch of seed

1788
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:28,460
um

1789
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,460
and uh

1790
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:36,540
I had jars and jars and jars like mason

1791
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:37,920
jars full of hybrids of it dude and I

1792
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:40,359
had it stashed in a couple different

1793
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,859
places in my house and

1794
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:41,460
[Music]

1795
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:44,338
um

1796
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:48,899
I got busted I think it was in early 09

1797
01:09:44,338 --> 01:09:49,920
I got raided and uh they took all my

1798
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:51,479
seed

1799
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,219
and they actually flushed it down the

1800
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:54,899
toilet

1801
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:58,679
I don't usually tell that story very

1802
01:09:54,899 --> 01:10:02,099
much but I got handcuffed to a uh to a

1803
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:04,199
computer chair and they wheeled me in

1804
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:06,900
front of the bathroom and then they took

1805
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:08,759
all these seeds and they opened up each

1806
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:10,319
mason jar and they poured it into the

1807
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,060
toilet while they were waiting for the

1808
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,559
Paddy Wagon and they flushed all the

1809
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:17,580
seed down the toilet

1810
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:21,719
Jesus what's that death by torture

1811
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:23,340
and so then shittily right in that same

1812
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:25,739
time period

1813
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:28,679
um Staten Island went on vacation and he

1814
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:30,379
had all of his seeds stored in a fridge

1815
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:33,000
in his garage

1816
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:35,760
and someone had plugged something else

1817
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,698
into into an outlet and it popped the

1818
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:42,780
outlet while he was on vacation and so

1819
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:44,279
the fridge stopped working and they

1820
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:45,840
ended up the whole time he was on

1821
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:48,420
vacation which I think was two or three

1822
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:53,039
weeks they ended up in a 115 degree

1823
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:55,859
garage unrefrigerated uh R.I.P and so we

1824
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:57,658
had he had jars and jars of seed

1825
01:10:55,859 --> 01:10:59,880
we tried all these different ways to

1826
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:01,439
make them pop they wouldn't pop we

1827
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,359
passed them to friends we did all this

1828
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:05,698
stuff about scuffing them and soaking

1829
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,679
them and peroxiding them seed cracking

1830
01:11:05,698 --> 01:11:10,678
them and every once in a while we'd get

1831
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,420
like a tail that would pop out

1832
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:13,920
um and then it would just not continue

1833
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:18,119
and die

1834
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:19,859
and uh he actually had all that seed

1835
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:21,059
um thousands and thousands of seeds but

1836
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:24,059
we just couldn't make anything happen

1837
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:26,640
with them and then in 2017

1838
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:29,640
we had those massive California fires

1839
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:32,460
and his house burned down so we lost

1840
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:35,520
them so

1841
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:38,460
um there's a Emerald Mountain Legacy Ben

1842
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,280
who is uh Emmanuel brought's younger

1843
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:43,800
brother he has some stuff that has like

1844
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:46,259
some of that stuff worked in it I don't

1845
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,900
know if out there you know supposedly

1846
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:52,260
there's a cut called the truth

1847
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:55,500
um that is Superdog by Maui

1848
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:57,239
um that exists that I haven't grown

1849
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,819
um but it's a selection that Mandel

1850
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:03,178
brought made out of uh Super Dog by Maui

1851
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:05,399
seeds that I gave him that exists

1852
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:07,560
um and if you look in the in the second

1853
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:08,939
cannabiable the red one

1854
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,739
um there's a bunch of pictures of the

1855
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:13,619
super dog super dog seven super dog

1856
01:12:10,738 --> 01:12:15,539
three some of the phenos I selected but

1857
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:22,198
uh yeah four or five years of work

1858
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:25,019
through uh busts uh cops fire and uh uh

1859
01:12:22,198 --> 01:12:27,178
popping circuits we lost the line

1860
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,860
man that's that's heartbreaking to hear

1861
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:30,179
but you know sort of speaking to your

1862
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:32,819
point earlier

1863
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:34,800
um you know nothing more of a honor than

1864
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:36,719
to have someone want to use your work I

1865
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,699
guess and hopefully you know you get

1866
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,439
something that reminds you of it I'd

1867
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:42,119
love to ask while I got you here what do

1868
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:44,698
you think is the lineage on the chem dog

1869
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:47,519
you know the much speculated and guessed

1870
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:50,639
at do you have any ideas yourself

1871
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:53,820
so I think it's I might get in trouble

1872
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,039
for saying this but this is kind of how

1873
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:57,899
I see it right so

1874
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:59,880
um Joe B and Peabody

1875
01:12:57,899 --> 01:13:01,439
or older cats and they were on dead tour

1876
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,380
and they were buying and selling weed

1877
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:06,658
right it was very common for people to

1878
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:09,119
buy weed say a half pound a quarter

1879
01:13:06,658 --> 01:13:12,179
pound a couple pounds take it on dead

1880
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:15,119
tour and sell it in chunks and that's

1881
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:16,739
what paid for their tickets and their

1882
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:20,099
life and their partying and having a

1883
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:21,899
good time right so these guys are buying

1884
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:25,140
and selling weed all the time on dead

1885
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:27,719
tour they buy weed they give it to they

1886
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:29,640
they sell a bunch of it some of it goes

1887
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:31,020
to a 17 year old kid

1888
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,659
okay

1889
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:35,820
and then that's in 1991.

1890
01:13:33,658 --> 01:13:38,399
Peabody and Joe B don't figure out that

1891
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:41,340
anything came of those seeds until the

1892
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:44,639
Forum era 0.506.

1893
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:47,039
so literally 15 years goes by

1894
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:49,560
without them having anything to do with

1895
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:51,539
the chem story

1896
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,760
okay

1897
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:56,039
and then they're asked hey do you

1898
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,320
remember 15 or 16 years ago

1899
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:59,640
that one week when you were in Indiana

1900
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:01,259
do you remember what the weed was like

1901
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,579
that you had and that you were buying

1902
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,500
and selling then

1903
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:06,479
you see what I'm saying yeah it's a big

1904
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:08,760
ask for a non-memorable event right

1905
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:10,259
right it just it was like it was one it

1906
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,060
was like Not only was a non-memorable

1907
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:14,460
event but like they didn't even realize

1908
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:15,719
that anything came of it for a decade

1909
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,539
and a half

1910
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:20,219
and so I've I definitely I've heard

1911
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:23,760
people talk I don't even want to say

1912
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:27,658
some of the rumors I think that

1913
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:30,480
um I think that we just won't ever know

1914
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:31,920
uh I have a bunch of theories about it

1915
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,859
um some people get mad at me for talking

1916
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:38,100
about the theories because you know the

1917
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:39,719
the chemd and the chem dog and the the

1918
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,860
one through the four and all these

1919
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:42,600
different things they're all supposed to

1920
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:44,099
be from the same exact seeds which

1921
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,179
everyone assumes that they're sisters

1922
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,679
right

1923
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:48,539
but

1924
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:49,859
what if in that ounce there like I was

1925
01:14:48,539 --> 01:14:51,960
talking about before what if there was

1926
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:53,579
multiple phenos in that ounce

1927
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,980
yeah that's what I've always thought

1928
01:14:53,579 --> 01:14:58,019
what if some of them were hybrids and

1929
01:14:55,979 --> 01:14:59,519
some of them were s1s

1930
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:01,020
what if there was even more than one

1931
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,360
source of pollen I mean we just don't

1932
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,940
know and the people that we know that

1933
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:08,399
gave dude the weed they weren't even The

1934
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:10,079
Growers they were middlemen

1935
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:12,059
buying weed from someone and then taking

1936
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:13,819
an Undead tour and parceling it out to

1937
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:19,460
make money

1938
01:15:13,819 --> 01:15:19,460
what I will say is that I do think that

1939
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:23,939
um just by growing it for a long time

1940
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,579
and Crossing it to a bunch of stuff and

1941
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:30,178
seeing it I do think that the Mendo or I

1942
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:34,140
do think that the the the chem 91 I

1943
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:37,380
think it's already an S1 hmm ah okay

1944
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:39,000
interesting and so that way like when

1945
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,579
Caleb or somebody like that when you

1946
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,920
when you s want it I think part of the

1947
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,719
reason why it looks so uniform and

1948
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,539
there's like not very much variation

1949
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:49,739
going on there at all is it's already an

1950
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:51,658
S2

1951
01:15:49,738 --> 01:15:54,539
yeah okay just because like the results

1952
01:15:51,658 --> 01:15:57,599
the progeny give mm-hmm

1953
01:15:54,539 --> 01:15:59,519
just because of how narrow like

1954
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,679
if you were like remember how I was

1955
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,659
talking about how I thought like the the

1956
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:05,760
Mendo P might be land race because when

1957
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:07,500
you S1 it it's so wide

1958
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,500
like and you see so many different

1959
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:13,079
expressions and and size and and colors

1960
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:17,219
and nose and all these different things

1961
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:20,039
the chem 91 is the opposite of that

1962
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:22,260
almost all of it looks extremely similar

1963
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:24,658
to the chem 91.

1964
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:26,820
there's very little physical there's

1965
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:28,559
some potency differences there's

1966
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:31,198
actually some s1s that are even more

1967
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,060
potent than the mob

1968
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:35,819
um that strain

1969
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:38,640
uh CSI has told me he thinks that

1970
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:43,099
nothing in his entire collection passes

1971
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:46,679
on potency as consistently as that cut

1972
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:48,300
yeah but it but it just kind of is what

1973
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:49,980
it is like when you try to go through a

1974
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:52,980
bunch of s1s you're not going to find a

1975
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:54,718
bunch of wildly different things

1976
01:16:52,979 --> 01:16:56,939
yeah that's interesting and I've

1977
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,399
certainly heard you guys mention that

1978
01:16:56,939 --> 01:17:01,198
before and I've used that in some of the

1979
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:02,939
seed selections I'm making you know

1980
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:04,979
because I thought to myself all right if

1981
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:07,500
the 91 really consistently passes on

1982
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:09,479
potency maybe I should try to get

1983
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,880
crosses where the other parent is like

1984
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:13,738
really terpy or something because like

1985
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,440
if it's gonna pretty consistently bring

1986
01:17:13,738 --> 01:17:19,319
potency maybe like a a forbidden fruit

1987
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:21,119
cross chem 91 is sort of like the go-to

1988
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:23,158
you know in terms of getting like a nice

1989
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:26,158
well-rounded sort of plant

1990
01:17:23,158 --> 01:17:28,559
now that is real breeding

1991
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:30,238
so what I think happens in breeding

1992
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,100
today is people try to take two things

1993
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:33,979
that are already popular

1994
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:36,179
but you probably don't have access to

1995
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:39,238
and combine them

1996
01:17:36,179 --> 01:17:41,699
and then you get hybrids of them right

1997
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:43,859
in my opinion real breeding is like

1998
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:45,899
there's these qualities in this one

1999
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:48,238
plant and there's these qualities in

2000
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:50,759
this other plant and I wonder if I can

2001
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:52,859
get them in the same plant by making

2002
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,960
making seeds with them

2003
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:56,639
can I get these can I get these

2004
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,679
qualities from over here and these

2005
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,179
qualities from over here and can they

2006
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:02,640
combine

2007
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:05,640
and that to me is breeding

2008
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:07,440
right so yeah anything you wanted to add

2009
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,260
potency to

2010
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:13,198
um you know the 91 will do that

2011
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:14,760
you know it also you know add its look

2012
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:17,698
too

2013
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:21,539
um you know which is uh kind of that old

2014
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:23,639
dark olive dinosaur looking weed

2015
01:18:21,539 --> 01:18:25,800
um it's one of my favorite strains still

2016
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,980
it's well stood up to the test of time

2017
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,779
it has probably my favorite Indica High

2018
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:32,339
um I adore it

2019
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:36,539
um not everyone thinks it's a favorite

2020
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:39,300
but I personally love it a whole bunch

2021
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:40,500
yeah beautiful stuff beautiful stuff I

2022
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,699
wanted to quickly ask you before I

2023
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:44,399
forget because it's like a fleeting

2024
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:46,019
moment but uh when we spoke to skunk VA

2025
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:47,819
recently he mentioned that there was

2026
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:51,060
this cutting that went around sort of in

2027
01:18:47,819 --> 01:18:52,500
the 2000s it was a super silver haze and

2028
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,640
he was like oh man it went around the

2029
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,140
bay it was it was actually pretty

2030
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:57,119
memorable I wish we still had that one

2031
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:58,619
did you ever get exposed to that one

2032
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:00,539
slash what's your thoughts on the super

2033
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:03,658
silver haze in general

2034
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:05,519
I like super silver haze

2035
01:19:03,658 --> 01:19:06,839
um you know super silver haze and

2036
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,260
Neville's opinion was kind of an

2037
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:12,239
improved Jack Herer it's basically a

2038
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:13,320
blend of haze skunk and Northern Lights

2039
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:17,339
right

2040
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:19,259
uh and so you know in that regard

2041
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:21,420
um there's a lot of variation in there

2042
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:23,760
depending on which ones I had one I lost

2043
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:25,260
it in the fire I had one that was

2044
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,079
um you can still see some pictures of it

2045
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,699
on my page that I loved a whole bunch I

2046
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,219
don't think it was like elite elite

2047
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:34,019
elite but it was really nice weed it

2048
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:36,179
smelled really good it was really Frosty

2049
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:39,420
it threw chunks all over itself

2050
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:41,279
I like that line I like the mango Haze

2051
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:43,560
line a little better

2052
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,238
um but it's one of those ones that you

2053
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,400
might have to look through a lot to find

2054
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:48,839
what you really adore but it's in there

2055
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:50,879
somewhere

2056
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,440
and sometimes

2057
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,119
you know you can look as much as you

2058
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:55,139
want and you won't find what you're

2059
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:57,658
looking for

2060
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:59,340
uh and sometimes it's easy to find it

2061
01:19:57,658 --> 01:20:00,839
and sometimes it takes work and I think

2062
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:04,020
the super silver haze that are really

2063
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:07,440
good takes work but they exist

2064
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:09,900
um and I so yeah there's there's various

2065
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,658
phenos of it that float around that I

2066
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:14,939
think are quite nice and I'm a fan

2067
01:20:12,658 --> 01:20:17,039
that's awesome to hear that you uh you

2068
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:19,079
know got a soft spot for the um the

2069
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:21,060
mango Haze that's one that you know it's

2070
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:23,340
actually very popular in Australia a lot

2071
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:25,380
of the older dudes really Vibe on it and

2072
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:28,020
haven't really seen it represented as

2073
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:30,300
much in the states outside of um

2074
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:32,880
what's his name you know mango the the

2075
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:35,640
guy from Florida but um yeah really

2076
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,460
stoked stoked stoked to hear that yeah

2077
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:41,780
mango I mean mango Hayes and um super

2078
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,779
silver haze are sisters

2079
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:51,059
um they're very closely related so

2080
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:52,799
um super silver haze is C5 cross to

2081
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:56,940
um a skunk Haze

2082
01:20:52,800 --> 01:21:01,199
okay and mango Haze is a sister of that

2083
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:03,119
C5 Neville called it the 122 crossed to

2084
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:06,119
the same dad

2085
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:07,319
uh yeah yeah yeah yep yep yep does that

2086
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:09,899
make sense

2087
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:12,479
so they share so mango Haze and soup

2088
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:15,359
Super Silver Haze share the same father

2089
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:18,238
and the mothers are full sisters

2090
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:20,759
wow so yeah they're very closely related

2091
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:23,579
they're very closely related indeed it's

2092
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:24,960
just that they actually called the 122

2093
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:28,619
the mango

2094
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,840
in Holland that was one of its nicknames

2095
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:32,460
um because it had that mercy and it had

2096
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,520
some of those Terps that were that were

2097
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:36,600
like that and so I actually if I had to

2098
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,460
pick

2099
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,260
um super silver haze tends to be much

2100
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:43,260
more of a commercial Planet It's like

2101
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:45,000
got that those skunk colas all over it

2102
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:47,460
it yields really well it's like

2103
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,219
bulletproof mango Haze is a little

2104
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:52,920
hazier to me it's a little more sativa

2105
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:55,760
it's a little more finicky but I tend to

2106
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,760
like the weed better

2107
01:21:55,859 --> 01:22:00,000
um then Super Silver Haze on average I

2108
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:01,920
think it's a great strain

2109
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,619
um I you know and I think it might be

2110
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:07,679
one of the ones from

2111
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:09,359
um from shanti's uh shanti's company Mr

2112
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,219
Nice it might be one of the ones that he

2113
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:13,619
actually still has the real parents of

2114
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:16,920
which is always a big debate

2115
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:19,619
but uh I I like mango Haze

2116
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:22,380
it's a good one look while we're on the

2117
01:22:19,619 --> 01:22:24,899
topic of uh seeds and what parents might

2118
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:26,400
be in them I want to ask you you know

2119
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:28,559
sort of a two-parter but we'll keep it

2120
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,420
simple to begin with I've there's been

2121
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,520
speculation in you know the community

2122
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:34,980
for a while but more recently you know

2123
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:37,320
Matt chucked up the post which

2124
01:22:34,979 --> 01:22:40,919
um sort of openly said that the chemd

2125
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:42,658
may be a chem 91 cross skunk and I would

2126
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,760
love to hear your thoughts on this do

2127
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:46,019
you think there might be any Merit to

2128
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:49,199
that

2129
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:52,800
uh yes I do

2130
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:55,799
um I I'm one of the proponents of it I

2131
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:58,500
know it caused some battles uh with

2132
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:00,420
various various people that did not like

2133
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,319
said speculation

2134
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:04,079
um but

2135
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:07,500
that's what it is it's speculation right

2136
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:08,420
um what's the harm in speculating uh the

2137
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,520
reason

2138
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:12,779
why I think so is that

2139
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,719
you know

2140
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:18,658
um the uh

2141
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:21,658
I just see like having grown the chem 91

2142
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:24,479
for a really long time now and having a

2143
01:23:21,658 --> 01:23:27,599
a pretty long experience with the skunk

2144
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:30,839
before I lost it I just I personally

2145
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:34,079
just see both parents in that plant

2146
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:36,300
right and you know like we were

2147
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:39,359
mentioning about how narrow banded the

2148
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:41,880
chem 91 s1s are

2149
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:44,219
um you know it's also possible I mean uh

2150
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:46,079
JJ and I got into a battle about it not

2151
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:48,300
that long ago Top Dog

2152
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:49,319
and he was like well could it be you

2153
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,020
know he's like let's say that everything

2154
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:54,420
you say is true why couldn't it be sis

2155
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:56,159
by S by super skunk

2156
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:59,819
and I had to admit that that could be

2157
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:05,099
true too I just don't see that

2158
01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:06,899
the chem 91 the chemd the chem4

2159
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:08,219
um the chem one that still exists some

2160
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:11,339
of these different things I just don't

2161
01:24:08,219 --> 01:24:13,859
see them as being able to have the same

2162
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:16,500
exact mom and dad

2163
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:18,420
now whether that means that like dude

2164
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:21,179
it's all true and it's the same original

2165
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:24,420
13 seeds and there was like mixed phenos

2166
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:26,940
of actual females in that ounce that he

2167
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:28,619
had or there was multiple pollen sources

2168
01:24:26,939 --> 01:24:30,779
or

2169
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:33,238
some of the other chems are later

2170
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:35,460
hybrids you know it's like I'm not there

2171
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:37,198
I don't have any super Insight I can't

2172
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:42,300
say

2173
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:44,158
um but it is I I think that

2174
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:47,219
um I think that the chemd is a chem

2175
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:49,379
skunk I just do I I the way how green it

2176
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:52,079
is the way it grows the way it smells

2177
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:54,539
the way it harms

2178
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:57,719
um I've just grown it a whole bunch and

2179
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:59,880
that would be my guess and I hoped that

2180
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:01,980
philos or some of these other genetic

2181
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:03,840
you know offerings that people have done

2182
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:05,579
would have started to unlock some of

2183
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,100
these oral histories and some of these

2184
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:10,260
Legends and tales that we have and like

2185
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:11,760
been definitive right

2186
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:15,179
where they can be like this is

2187
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:17,520
absolutely a full sister or this isn't

2188
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:20,279
but we're not there yet

2189
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,780
right so we don't have verifiable proof

2190
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:25,259
one way or the other

2191
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:28,679
we just have you know a story about a

2192
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:31,260
teenager starting some seeds and

2193
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:33,420
you know that's all we have

2194
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:34,860
I totally can understand your point of

2195
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:36,480
view and that there's so much ambiguity

2196
01:25:34,859 --> 01:25:37,920
it's hard to really say for sure and

2197
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:41,099
something that I was thinking about

2198
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,380
myself is that a comment that sort of

2199
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:45,840
lasted with me was when skunk VA said

2200
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:48,359
none of the super dogs came out like

2201
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,100
chemd you know so like why would I

2202
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:52,920
necessarily believe that that's the

2203
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:55,140
lineage but then what I thought was if

2204
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:58,139
you look at the GMO we know what the

2205
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:59,699
lineage is chemd cross cookies mamiko

2206
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:01,260
has put out a bunch of those seeds

2207
01:25:59,698 --> 01:26:04,259
people have popped them and no one has

2208
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:05,880
found anything like the GMO yeah and so

2209
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:07,739
I thought what if it's the same with the

2210
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:10,319
chemd and the the skunk you know it's

2211
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:11,519
just like a one in a million Fino I mean

2212
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:13,619
it's kind of like the same thing with

2213
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,520
cap right when he got famous on the Mac

2214
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:17,279
one

2215
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,960
and he sold a ton of Mach 1 seeds and

2216
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:22,380
hybrids and nothing came out looking

2217
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:24,300
like it right sometimes that happens and

2218
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:27,779
you know Caleb and I have this thing

2219
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:30,300
where like plants don't lie people do

2220
01:26:27,779 --> 01:26:31,679
um most of my stuff that I just told you

2221
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:34,739
is just

2222
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:38,158
my guess is based on breeding with the

2223
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:39,299
plant growing the plants no it's in the

2224
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:41,219
other thing too is that you got to

2225
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:43,079
remember when skunk VA was talking about

2226
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:44,698
the Superdog when I kind of gave that

2227
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:47,579
quick

2228
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:50,579
um rundown of what happened with it it's

2229
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:53,039
not like the super dog was a pure Super

2230
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:56,039
Skunk by chem dog

2231
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:58,579
there were steps involved

2232
01:26:56,039 --> 01:27:01,079
right so we never actually like you know

2233
01:26:58,579 --> 01:27:02,880
maybe if we were doing it 10 years later

2234
01:27:01,079 --> 01:27:05,100
we would have just you know used some

2235
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,840
STS or something and reversed one on to

2236
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:09,179
the other

2237
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:12,119
but that's not how it happened

2238
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:15,179
right so we don't know what but here's

2239
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:18,300
the thing right is that I have a theory

2240
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:20,219
and I'll I'll just say this okay and and

2241
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,960
like this and this is where like talking

2242
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:23,880
about history gets really delicate

2243
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:28,079
because

2244
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:30,060
you know you you try to tell history and

2245
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:31,979
there's history and there's known and

2246
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:33,840
there's unknown and there's people that

2247
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:35,879
get attached to certain stories and so I

2248
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,260
start talking about this and then people

2249
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,960
are going to be like oh people are

2250
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:42,420
people are saying you know Francis not

2251
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:44,460
so dog is saying that like uh

2252
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:46,560
um that Greg is a liar

2253
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:49,380
that it's that that I don't believe his

2254
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:52,320
story and that's not what I'm saying

2255
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:55,739
um you know chem dog two of my all-time

2256
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:59,099
favorite plants uh the chem 91 and the

2257
01:27:55,738 --> 01:28:02,879
chemd came out of either you know his

2258
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:06,060
room or his efforts right so I'm

2259
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:08,699
amazingly grateful for that right

2260
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:11,280
but you also got to remember and think

2261
01:28:08,698 --> 01:28:14,219
back to your own experiences say he pops

2262
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:19,819
this stuff when he's 17.

2263
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:19,819
how on it were you between 17 and 22 23.

2264
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:26,579
you know what I'm saying yeah like not

2265
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:28,500
very own it at all not very honored at

2266
01:28:26,579 --> 01:28:30,300
all and so could he honestly believe

2267
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:33,479
that it's all the same 13 seeds

2268
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:35,340
absolutely could they be they could but

2269
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:37,379
I have a hard time believing it unless

2270
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:39,179
there's multiple moms and dads involved

2271
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:41,340
right

2272
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:43,139
um but you know there's also like

2273
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:45,179
there's some chemd fakes out there which

2274
01:28:43,139 --> 01:28:46,920
has caused its own a whole set of series

2275
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:47,880
and I've battled with people on it so I

2276
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,920
don't know if we really want to get into

2277
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:52,920
that on this thing but

2278
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:56,100
the problem with the chemd fakes is that

2279
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:58,380
they all seem to originate from Greg and

2280
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:00,780
so I've had this thought that it's

2281
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:02,400
possible that some of those seeds were

2282
01:29:00,779 --> 01:29:03,779
either

2283
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,819
um you remember how I told you when we

2284
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:07,679
the for the whole first idea of the

2285
01:29:05,819 --> 01:29:10,019
super dog was the Super Skunk

2286
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:11,639
accidentally hermed on the chems and he

2287
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:15,000
was all excited about it

2288
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:16,440
what if some of that stuff was just seed

2289
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,139
from that accident

2290
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:21,238
what if what if it just ended up he had

2291
01:29:19,139 --> 01:29:23,579
a box of different seeds and some of it

2292
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:25,019
got into a different labeling and he

2293
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:28,439
thought it was this and it was this I

2294
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:30,960
don't know it's all supposition right I

2295
01:29:28,439 --> 01:29:33,178
just know that the 91 and the one and

2296
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,679
the 4 and the D are vastly different

2297
01:29:33,179 --> 01:29:36,960
than one another

2298
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:38,760
yeah look I have to admit I've always

2299
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,698
been a bit uncomfortable about the one

2300
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:44,880
especially it's just so left of field

2301
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:48,479
yeah and it just it it it the the way

2302
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:51,719
you know and it's like the the D is like

2303
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:55,079
a short stocky Afghan thing you know

2304
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:58,020
that takes nine weeks the one and the

2305
01:29:55,079 --> 01:30:01,619
four take 12 or 13 weeks and are big

2306
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:05,940
stretchy long running colas that throw

2307
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:08,939
bats the 91 is like this mutant

2308
01:30:05,939 --> 01:30:10,138
um old Afghan leafy looking thing you

2309
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:11,638
know

2310
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:13,460
um they just have very very different

2311
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:16,619
looks and their kids look very different

2312
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:18,000
and you know I don't know that I'm not

2313
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:20,219
sitting here saying anyone's wrong

2314
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,340
because I don't know that I'm right

2315
01:30:20,219 --> 01:30:25,500
I'm just saying observationally I see

2316
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:28,260
things that make me question

2317
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:29,399
yeah of course and look I I there's so

2318
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:31,020
much more I want to ask you about this

2319
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:32,638
but I think we'll we'll have to save it

2320
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:34,739
for a part two otherwise we'll end up

2321
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,719
going down this uh Rabbit Hole forever

2322
01:30:34,738 --> 01:30:38,759
but while we're talking about the actual

2323
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:41,279
lineage of things I'm sure you've

2324
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:44,699
noticed uh Caleb's put up a post that

2325
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:47,460
he's done this F1 Durban reversal my

2326
01:30:44,698 --> 01:30:50,158
question is do you suspect he's gonna

2327
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:53,158
find anything similar to cookies in the

2328
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:55,138
dirt cross OG hybrids he's done

2329
01:30:53,158 --> 01:30:57,238
so there's there's some interesting

2330
01:30:55,139 --> 01:31:00,119
stuff in all that

2331
01:30:57,238 --> 01:31:02,579
um that probably if we want to wrap this

2332
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:04,920
up in the next few minutes I'll keep it

2333
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:09,960
pretty short and sweet

2334
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:11,880
um but there you know he is uh he has

2335
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:14,639
very different thoughts after after

2336
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:17,940
doing it than he did in the beginning

2337
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:21,480
um I gave him the FlowRider

2338
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:23,698
to use in that in that cross

2339
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:26,339
um I got the flow right the only the

2340
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:28,138
flow writer is an OG I don't know it

2341
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:30,179
could be you know

2342
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:32,400
um I don't know if that's its first name

2343
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:34,800
or you know it's it's it's it's got name

2344
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:36,779
changed or whatever but what I do know

2345
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:39,600
is that the person that the cookie

2346
01:31:36,779 --> 01:31:41,639
accident happened

2347
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,159
um that's the Kush that he had he gave

2348
01:31:41,639 --> 01:31:46,199
it to me directly in o4

2349
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:48,479
um so I am absolutely convinced that

2350
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:50,039
that's the cushion cookie

2351
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,138
um so I gave him

2352
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:54,119
um that cut so that he could add it into

2353
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:56,100
the F1 derb room and we could see what

2354
01:31:54,119 --> 01:31:59,279
what happened

2355
01:31:56,100 --> 01:32:00,539
um I think that cookie was a multi-stage

2356
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:03,960
accident

2357
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:06,060
and uh I um

2358
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:08,779
we could talk about that but that

2359
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:11,580
probably would have to be a part two

2360
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:13,800
uh yeah that would might have to be a

2361
01:32:11,579 --> 01:32:15,420
part two look we're we're definitely

2362
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,739
gonna have to do it and I do want to be

2363
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:18,840
conscious of your time because I've

2364
01:32:16,738 --> 01:32:21,299
already taken up the best part of four

2365
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,800
hours so how about uh we do one more

2366
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,480
question before we get on to the quick

2367
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,520
fire and then we'll we'll definitely

2368
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:28,619
have to do a part two but questions

2369
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,960
specifically I I was thinking about you

2370
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:32,760
and I was like oh I'm this is actually a

2371
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,698
perfect one for not so dog

2372
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,440
um I you know when we think about modern

2373
01:32:35,698 --> 01:32:39,779
breeding we have this sort of more

2374
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:41,579
analytical more scientific approach

2375
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:43,979
these days compared to in the past when

2376
01:32:41,579 --> 01:32:45,719
it was arguably a bit more intuitive you

2377
01:32:43,979 --> 01:32:47,698
know people were still using science but

2378
01:32:45,719 --> 01:32:50,579
you know generally speaking education

2379
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:52,019
was less widespread and when I think of

2380
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:53,698
that sort of breeding I think of people

2381
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:55,440
like DJ Short

2382
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:58,439
and I wonder

2383
01:32:55,439 --> 01:33:00,839
if DJ Short existed in today's climate

2384
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:03,238
as a fledgling breeder and expressed

2385
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:05,880
some of the zany some of the more wacky

2386
01:33:03,238 --> 01:33:08,579
ideas at least by modern standards that

2387
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:10,560
he has in the past do you think there

2388
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:12,000
would he would get a reception or do you

2389
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,320
think he would be sort of laughed out

2390
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,179
you know like because it feels like

2391
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:17,639
we've come so far with our understanding

2392
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:20,100
of genetics that maybe we might be at

2393
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:23,340
risk of losing some of the more left of

2394
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:25,440
field ideas what's your thought you

2395
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:27,659
gotta realize that most people breeding

2396
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:30,658
or breeding for money

2397
01:33:27,658 --> 01:33:34,198
so we haven't really Advanced all that

2398
01:33:30,658 --> 01:33:36,420
far in the sense that and I I know and

2399
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:37,678
I'm painting a broad brush so there's

2400
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:39,239
plenty there's people out there with

2401
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:42,119
passion there's people out there doing

2402
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:43,919
you know microbreedings of their own

2403
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:45,479
stuff and all that so I'm not trying to

2404
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,520
lump it in I'm just trying to talk about

2405
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:49,319
like the commercial aspect of breeding

2406
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,239
right at this particular moment

2407
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:52,799
I don't think we're actually doing very

2408
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:54,779
much in the way of breeding right now

2409
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,060
there are some people like Fletcher or

2410
01:33:54,779 --> 01:34:00,300
CSI or different people doing some like

2411
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:03,360
multi-stage breeding I think most of the

2412
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:06,900
game is take this reverse it onto a

2413
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:09,719
bunch of well-known Cuts sell

2414
01:34:06,899 --> 01:34:11,339
and it's just a one-off and that's it

2415
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:14,460
right

2416
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:16,020
so DJ is interesting in that if you

2417
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:18,658
believe his story

2418
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:20,460
he basically created everything out of

2419
01:34:18,658 --> 01:34:24,000
four plants

2420
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:26,819
right he had like an Afghan he had like

2421
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:30,300
a uh he had a couple different kinds he

2422
01:34:26,819 --> 01:34:32,819
had a wahawkin that he crossed to uh to

2423
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:35,639
a tie that he called juicy fruit and he

2424
01:34:32,819 --> 01:34:36,840
had an organ purple tie and that's

2425
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:40,560
basically it

2426
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:42,360
and so to me I don't think DJ has like a

2427
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,639
bunch of different lines I think he has

2428
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:46,738
like one line that he's pulled different

2429
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:50,359
Expressions out of and then bred with

2430
01:34:46,738 --> 01:34:50,359
those expressions if that makes sense

2431
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:54,779
so

2432
01:34:52,439 --> 01:34:57,599
um and you know I I think he probably

2433
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:59,099
bottlenecks stuff accidentally early on

2434
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,900
too

2435
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:04,440
and um

2436
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:06,238
you know I think that the the there's a

2437
01:35:04,439 --> 01:35:09,719
lot of cool breeding that's going on

2438
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:11,939
right now it's just not for sale dude

2439
01:35:09,719 --> 01:35:14,039
right like people that are making things

2440
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:17,399
for SK sale are like okay so I'm gonna

2441
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:19,019
take this Lemon Cherry gelato and I'm

2442
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:20,638
gonna cross it to Skittles and then I'm

2443
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:21,900
gonna cross it back to thin mint and

2444
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:24,719
then here you go

2445
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:25,679
right when you're trying to breed and

2446
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,480
even if you're somebody doing

2447
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:31,800
experiments like let's let's talk about

2448
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:34,379
uh CSI for a second again right he does

2449
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:38,880
you know reproductions of you know pine

2450
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:40,920
tar kush or or deep chunk or Burmese or

2451
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:43,500
these different things or Sterling skunk

2452
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:45,600
right he does open pollinations he does

2453
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:47,639
that he did the ml project he does all

2454
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,079
that kind of stuff but that stuff's not

2455
01:35:47,639 --> 01:35:51,539
as bread and butter

2456
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:53,579
like his bread and butter is like you

2457
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:55,619
know Mendo P hybrids and Skittles

2458
01:35:53,579 --> 01:35:59,698
hybrids and Crossing this by this he has

2459
01:35:55,619 --> 01:36:03,179
to make enough popular stuff right to

2460
01:35:59,698 --> 01:36:04,979
fund the weird [ __ ]

2461
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:07,199
that might not have too much commercial

2462
01:36:04,979 --> 01:36:09,599
value but still important to make seed

2463
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,519
of and half

2464
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,440
does that make sense certainly I

2465
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,000
remember Bodhi expressing a similar

2466
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:17,638
Point saying a lot of the stuff he

2467
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,979
offers is not his true passion it's to

2468
01:36:17,639 --> 01:36:22,139
pay the bills and then on the side he

2469
01:36:19,979 --> 01:36:23,759
can do the passion projects you know

2470
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:25,139
this might be a little good segue but

2471
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,520
are you familiar with the actor Michael

2472
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:30,600
Kane oh yeah brilliant so I watched you

2473
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,219
could probably watch it on YouTube

2474
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:34,320
there's this there's this thing that he

2475
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:37,139
gave where he he got this award and he

2476
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:39,299
gave this speech and it very much made

2477
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:40,560
me feel like it was about breeding even

2478
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:42,900
though it was about acting and he

2479
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:45,600
basically said look when you're young

2480
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:48,299
and you're an actor and you're poor you

2481
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,280
take any work you can get

2482
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:52,079
right doesn't matter how crappy it is

2483
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:54,899
you just take it because you need a job

2484
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:56,639
and then if you do a good job in those

2485
01:36:54,899 --> 01:36:58,198
things maybe you get some bigger roles

2486
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,900
and you're still just taking whatever's

2487
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:03,658
on offer and he goes and then

2488
01:37:00,899 --> 01:37:05,519
you get to a point in life where maybe

2489
01:37:03,658 --> 01:37:07,079
if you've been successful enough you've

2490
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,880
got some Blockbusters you've got some

2491
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:11,639
big hits you've got some stuff going on

2492
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:13,319
maybe you can take a risk on a passion

2493
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:14,880
project or something that really makes

2494
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:16,619
you feel good

2495
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:19,139
but he's like then you have to balance

2496
01:37:16,619 --> 01:37:21,359
that with some big screen production

2497
01:37:19,139 --> 01:37:22,679
because you're still trying to have a

2498
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:25,500
career

2499
01:37:22,679 --> 01:37:28,079
right so he goes when you're in the

2500
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:30,779
movies maybe every once in a long while

2501
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:33,300
you get to really follow your passion

2502
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:37,819
when mostly you're just trying to do

2503
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:37,820
good work along the way and stay afloat

2504
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:43,079
yeah huge parallels

2505
01:37:40,198 --> 01:37:45,299
right and so that's kind of what I was

2506
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:46,979
just talking about is like like you were

2507
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:48,840
saying with me talking to Bodhi or what

2508
01:37:46,979 --> 01:37:50,339
I was just mentioning about CSI is like

2509
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:53,039
in order for him to do these open

2510
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:56,039
pollinations in order for Bodhi to mess

2511
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:58,500
around with some like weird-ass sativas

2512
01:37:56,039 --> 01:38:00,840
he has to release some popular stuff

2513
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:02,158
that's going to pay the bills

2514
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,739
yeah

2515
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:07,319
you have to blend it right going out on

2516
01:38:04,738 --> 01:38:09,419
a limb and making a that that's what's

2517
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:11,158
so cool about being a private breeder

2518
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:12,779
dude is you can literally do whatever

2519
01:38:11,158 --> 01:38:14,399
the [ __ ] you want

2520
01:38:12,779 --> 01:38:16,559
when you don't have to worry about

2521
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:19,500
making money off it

2522
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:21,179
it can have Herms it cannot yield well

2523
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:22,679
it can have all these problems it

2524
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:24,300
doesn't matter you're still you're still

2525
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:25,500
doing it for you or your friends and

2526
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:27,900
you're going to look through it and if

2527
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:30,420
you find good weed you're happy

2528
01:38:27,899 --> 01:38:31,439
but if you're gonna breed and you're

2529
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:33,960
gonna sell

2530
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:35,819
right then you have to take some

2531
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:37,260
commercial aspects of that into

2532
01:38:35,819 --> 01:38:39,119
consideration

2533
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:41,699
and and so when you look at when you

2534
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:43,500
look at people right like

2535
01:38:41,698 --> 01:38:45,359
um and I'm not gonna like I'm not trying

2536
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,619
to call anybody out here by any means

2537
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:48,960
but you remember how I was speaking

2538
01:38:46,619 --> 01:38:50,880
about how a lot of famous people get

2539
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:53,158
into breeding and they kind of breed

2540
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,980
with what made them famous

2541
01:38:53,158 --> 01:39:00,138
right like NorCal icmag breeds a lot

2542
01:38:55,979 --> 01:39:00,138
with OG KB because it made him famous

2543
01:39:00,179 --> 01:39:03,960
um you know swamp boys did a ton with TK

2544
01:39:02,579 --> 01:39:04,979
because that was kind of their bread and

2545
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:08,340
butter

2546
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:09,779
skunk VA stays pretty close to the chem

2547
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:12,539
family of things

2548
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:15,059
right and these aren't disses on them

2549
01:39:12,539 --> 01:39:18,658
but imagine if skunk VA was like hey I

2550
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:20,340
got this weird loation sativa from Bodhi

2551
01:39:18,658 --> 01:39:21,420
and I got this other African thing and

2552
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:24,719
I'm gonna start doing these weird

2553
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:26,340
sativas that I'm not associated with

2554
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,539
and he puts in all this time and he puts

2555
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:28,800
in all this money and he puts in all

2556
01:39:27,539 --> 01:39:30,539
this effort and then it sells like [ __ ]

2557
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,420
and he's stuck with like 10 000 seats

2558
01:39:30,539 --> 01:39:36,960
there's a commercial aspect to it right

2559
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:39,300
where you're trying to figure out what

2560
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,219
and and I can tie that back in so like

2561
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:43,560
even if I'm not talking about breeding

2562
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:46,859
even if I'm just talking about like like

2563
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:49,080
uh preserving a large collection of moms

2564
01:39:46,859 --> 01:39:51,179
or something like that you still need to

2565
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:52,380
do enough stuff that's commercially

2566
01:39:51,179 --> 01:39:55,560
viable

2567
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:57,480
that you can fund your passion

2568
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:59,159
yeah it's interesting it's like it's

2569
01:39:57,479 --> 01:40:00,779
almost like um you know to be

2570
01:39:59,158 --> 01:40:03,299
commercially successful it almost forces

2571
01:40:00,779 --> 01:40:05,340
you to stay in your own lane

2572
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:07,860
yeah it does it limits you and then you

2573
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:10,440
get known it's like um you know like

2574
01:40:07,859 --> 01:40:12,479
take going back into acting right I'll

2575
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:15,599
use another example

2576
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:17,638
I remember watching Jackie Chan give an

2577
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,860
interview on one of the stupid late

2578
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:22,199
night talk shows or something and they

2579
01:40:19,859 --> 01:40:24,179
were talking about did he ever want to

2580
01:40:22,198 --> 01:40:25,619
Branch out and he looks right at the

2581
01:40:24,179 --> 01:40:27,840
camera and he goes I would love to

2582
01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:31,619
Branch out he goes

2583
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:34,619
they want to see me do martial arts and

2584
01:40:31,619 --> 01:40:36,779
be funny they don't want to see me in a

2585
01:40:34,619 --> 01:40:39,779
tender romantic comedy with Jennifer

2586
01:40:36,779 --> 01:40:42,119
Aniston would I do it sure it'd be kind

2587
01:40:39,779 --> 01:40:43,800
of fun do they want to cast me in it no

2588
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:45,840
they want Hugh Grant

2589
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,639
they want you know

2590
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,039
um they want bread pit

2591
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:52,739
they want Leonardo DiCaprio

2592
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:55,319
they don't want me I can be in a buddy

2593
01:40:52,738 --> 01:40:57,539
movie I can be in a martial arts movie I

2594
01:40:55,319 --> 01:40:59,939
can be in a comedy maybe but I can't be

2595
01:40:57,539 --> 01:41:02,219
in a romance or a drama that's not where

2596
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:04,859
they want to cast me

2597
01:41:02,219 --> 01:41:08,279
and I think breeding has parallels to

2598
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:10,439
that like you you get known for what

2599
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:11,219
you're known for and it's hard to Branch

2600
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:14,158
out

2601
01:41:11,219 --> 01:41:17,158
and if you are going to Branch out what

2602
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:20,039
happens if it's a total flop

2603
01:41:17,158 --> 01:41:21,599
yeah I agree and look this perfect segue

2604
01:41:20,039 --> 01:41:23,880
this is why we need to all give credit

2605
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,860
to Berner for casting Bodhi as the head

2606
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,779
of genetics you know he's given Jackie

2607
01:41:25,859 --> 01:41:30,539
Chan the role in the the dramatic

2608
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:32,819
Thriller man I will say you know uh

2609
01:41:30,539 --> 01:41:36,118
Bodhi was at the party we just had you

2610
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:39,420
know and uh he's my buddy

2611
01:41:36,118 --> 01:41:41,099
uh I will say that um him and Berner

2612
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:42,899
trying to collab I don't know if it went

2613
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:43,760
well for either one of them in my

2614
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:47,099
opinion

2615
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:50,100
a very different fan bases

2616
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:51,780
I just I hope it transpires through you

2617
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:53,100
know he said he's

2618
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:54,899
um you know trying to get some cool

2619
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:56,520
stuff on their menus and there's nothing

2620
01:41:54,899 --> 01:41:57,539
more I'd love to see than for that to

2621
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,880
work out

2622
01:41:57,539 --> 01:42:02,279
I understand why he did it and I don't

2623
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:05,400
even disagree with his reasoning

2624
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:07,920
right I'm just saying that like for a

2625
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:10,319
lot of Bodhi fans they look at burner

2626
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:13,739
and cookies as sort of the evil empire

2627
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:16,079
yeah true true but yeah I guess I think

2628
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:18,359
of it as like I think his intentions are

2629
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:19,500
coming for what he hopes is best for the

2630
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:22,380
plant

2631
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:24,719
oh he's a sweet man he absolutely he's

2632
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:27,300
not he's not thinking of it in some kind

2633
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,560
of like selfish or negative light I just

2634
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:30,960
mean that like

2635
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:33,420
you know it's a good example of stepping

2636
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:35,698
out of your lane and he had a certain

2637
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:36,719
Lane with people and he you know he

2638
01:42:35,698 --> 01:42:38,939
stepped out of it it was probably

2639
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:41,158
stepping out with Bodhi but with with

2640
01:42:38,939 --> 01:42:43,019
Berner but you know those guys they

2641
01:42:41,158 --> 01:42:45,719
desperately need people that are

2642
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:47,040
different breeders than

2643
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:48,060
um than they've been currently working

2644
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:50,939
with

2645
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:53,219
they have cookie themselves has stayed

2646
01:42:50,939 --> 01:42:54,599
way way too much in their own little

2647
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:57,420
stream

2648
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,860
and it's way too inbred in there and so

2649
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:01,079
they definitely need to bring people in

2650
01:42:58,859 --> 01:43:02,519
that can widen that pool

2651
01:43:01,079 --> 01:43:04,859
because that you've kind of gone

2652
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:06,780
anywhere you could have possibly gone in

2653
01:43:04,859 --> 01:43:09,420
that tiny little shallow in that shallow

2654
01:43:06,779 --> 01:43:11,099
end yeah yeah I definitely can say we

2655
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:12,539
are coming from and I think this is

2656
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,860
another one where we could we could

2657
01:43:12,539 --> 01:43:15,420
probably spend a whole hour talking

2658
01:43:13,859 --> 01:43:18,658
about this so we'll we'll definitely

2659
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:21,060
touch back on this one in part two but

2660
01:43:18,658 --> 01:43:23,339
we could my phone is gonna die too so

2661
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:25,199
like uh this four hours or whatever is

2662
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:27,000
like no I'm at like eight percent so

2663
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:29,039
we're probably gonna have to cut it off

2664
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,899
regardless because uh it's gonna die and

2665
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:32,698
I'm not gonna be able to chat

2666
01:43:30,899 --> 01:43:35,339
yeah no worries all right we'll we'll

2667
01:43:32,698 --> 01:43:37,859
shorten the final five to the the quick

2668
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:39,539
three then quickly so I'd love to know

2669
01:43:37,859 --> 01:43:42,000
what's the most memorable experience

2670
01:43:39,539 --> 01:43:43,920
with cannabis you've ever had

2671
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,198
the most memorable experience with

2672
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,279
cannabis I've ever had

2673
01:43:46,198 --> 01:43:49,859
um

2674
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:50,698
when I first realized how powerful Hayes

2675
01:43:49,859 --> 01:43:54,479
was

2676
01:43:50,698 --> 01:43:55,738
uh I kept going out to Amsterdam and I

2677
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:58,138
kind of thought their weed was bunk

2678
01:43:55,738 --> 01:44:00,839
compared to ours to some degree

2679
01:43:58,139 --> 01:44:03,000
and then I met one of Neville's friends

2680
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,440
who grew for him and then they sold the

2681
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,158
weed to the coffee shops he's still

2682
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:09,839
around his name's Steve and um I smoked

2683
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:13,079
some Neville's Haze

2684
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:14,520
just a little Pinner uh and a by Pinner

2685
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:15,840
for people that don't know it's just a

2686
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:17,699
skinny joint

2687
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,199
between me and my buddy who I went out

2688
01:44:17,698 --> 01:44:23,000
there with and Steve

2689
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:24,960
we smoked that joint and I felt

2690
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,260
soaring high

2691
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:30,899
psychedelic high like I was tripping

2692
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:33,840
High to the point where when I walked

2693
01:44:30,899 --> 01:44:36,118
out of his flat as a you know I was

2694
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:39,060
probably 24 then or 26 then or something

2695
01:44:36,118 --> 01:44:41,039
I like held on to the railing so I could

2696
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:42,960
walk down the steps

2697
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:44,340
and that was the first time that I

2698
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:46,980
realized that maybe some of those

2699
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:49,800
Old-Timers talking about how like some

2700
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:52,738
of those sativas had this like soaring

2701
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,900
psychedelic disassociative Speedy High

2702
01:44:52,738 --> 01:44:58,678
which I kind of thought they were lying

2703
01:44:54,899 --> 01:45:01,920
about I realized it could be true

2704
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:04,199
and I I think that that Neville's Haze

2705
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,819
cut that still exists is very very

2706
01:45:04,198 --> 01:45:08,279
different than most weed that's out

2707
01:45:05,819 --> 01:45:09,779
there and I would put it up as one of my

2708
01:45:08,279 --> 01:45:11,099
probably my most memorable wheat

2709
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:13,559
experience

2710
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:15,900
wow you got me jealous I'm gonna have to

2711
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:17,580
go hunt for it but on to the next

2712
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:19,500
question which is I'm going to drop you

2713
01:45:17,579 --> 01:45:21,719
off on a desert island and you can take

2714
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,100
three strains with you there could be

2715
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:24,480
packs of seeds if you want to do some

2716
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:26,159
breeding or they could just be clones

2717
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:27,779
and you know somehow on this island

2718
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:30,379
you've got the resources to grow them

2719
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:34,500
forever what are you taking with you

2720
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:37,079
oh my gosh uh I'm gonna take the LA

2721
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:40,319
I'm gonna take the chem 91

2722
01:45:37,079 --> 01:45:42,238
and I'm going to take an nl5 Haze

2723
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:43,559
that's a nice balance I can get behind

2724
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:45,118
that that's that's good you're not

2725
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:48,179
spreading yourself too thin in one area

2726
01:45:45,118 --> 01:45:49,920
I dig that so final question we'd love

2727
01:45:48,179 --> 01:45:50,940
to ask everyone at least on their first

2728
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,800
appearance

2729
01:45:50,939 --> 01:45:54,658
I've got a time machine for you you can

2730
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:56,460
go back anywhere Anytime Anyplace

2731
01:45:54,658 --> 01:45:58,859
presumably to collect some cannabis

2732
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:00,179
either cuttings or seeds where are you

2733
01:45:58,859 --> 01:46:01,799
going to go back to what are you going

2734
01:46:00,179 --> 01:46:05,880
to get

2735
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:08,039
oh absolutely I would go probably to

2736
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:11,819
1989

2737
01:46:08,039 --> 01:46:14,039
and I would buy everything from Super

2738
01:46:11,819 --> 01:46:17,340
sativa seed club and Neville seed bank

2739
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:19,560
that is a brilliant answer

2740
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:21,659
absolutely what that's absolutely what I

2741
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:23,520
would do and in line with the earlier

2742
01:46:21,658 --> 01:46:24,920
answer I guess we'll try to grab like 50

2743
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:27,719
of each seed

2744
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:31,260
yeah it would be it would be a lot do

2745
01:46:27,719 --> 01:46:34,800
you know that that in like 89 90 that

2746
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:38,100
Neville literally sold 50 packs of maple

2747
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:40,619
leaf Indica the same exact

2748
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:43,260
um seed batch that he found all of the

2749
01:46:40,618 --> 01:46:46,019
Finos that he used to make super skunk

2750
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:48,060
and all that other stuff with oh yeah

2751
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:49,800
yeah he called you can look it up it's

2752
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,699
in his book it's called Original Afghan

2753
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,800
mix

2754
01:46:50,698 --> 01:46:56,579
and it was just extra seed that he had

2755
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:58,800
that uh that uh Jim Ortega had given him

2756
01:46:56,579 --> 01:47:00,539
so I would absolutely go back to 89 or

2757
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:03,239
90 and I would buy both of those

2758
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:06,179
companies a lot of their stuff

2759
01:47:03,238 --> 01:47:08,519
and I would have real nl1 real nl2 real

2760
01:47:06,179 --> 01:47:10,199

2761
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,940
um just all that and just grow it out

2762
01:47:10,198 --> 01:47:15,118

2763
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:16,259
that is beautiful I love that that's uh

2764
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:17,880
one I'm definitely gonna have to

2765
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:21,179
consider for my own pick should I ever

2766
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:22,980
find said time machine so I think that

2767
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:24,600
just about brings us to the Ender are

2768

2769
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:29,340
you wanted to make

2770
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:31,860
uh the only the only General comments or

2771
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:32,760
shout outs that I would make is that

2772
01:47:31,859 --> 01:47:34,679
um

2773
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:36,780
you know to P if anyone out there is

2774
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:40,260
thinking about breeding

2775
01:47:36,779 --> 01:47:41,039
um you know or or saving clones or you

2776
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:43,260
know

2777
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:46,079
don't do it based on anything more than

2778
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:48,600
like pick things that you love

2779
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:50,939
right that you that personally Vibe well

2780
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,679
with you try to save a couple you don't

2781
01:47:50,939 --> 01:47:54,960
have to save everything try to save a

2782
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:57,179
couple of things if you can find some

2783
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:59,760
old and unpopular stuff that maybe you

2784
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:01,679
care about a bunch everybody can pitch

2785
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,119
in a little bit and this person can hold

2786
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:05,279
two or three here and this person can

2787
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:07,439
hold five and this person can hold one

2788
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:10,859
but every little bit that you hold of

2789
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:11,698
that 80s or 90s or early 2000s era is a

2790
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:13,380
gem

2791
01:48:11,698 --> 01:48:14,879
and then if you're going to get into

2792
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:16,618
breeding

2793
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,719
um try to like I said try to find two

2794
01:48:16,618 --> 01:48:20,639
plants or two lines that you have an

2795
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:23,039
idea that you could get both traits into

2796
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,659
the same line and breed for what you

2797
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:25,979
like because there's not enough of

2798
01:48:24,658 --> 01:48:27,658
breeding for what you like there's

2799
01:48:25,979 --> 01:48:31,259
breeding for what other people might

2800
01:48:27,658 --> 01:48:32,698
like so you know breed for what you like

2801
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:34,020
and then if nobody else likes it at

2802
01:48:32,698 --> 01:48:36,238
least you do

2803
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:38,100

2804
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:39,839

coming from that passion side of things

2806
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,400
it'll be much more likely for you to be

2807
01:48:42,539 --> 01:48:46,439
successful than if you just you know

2808
