86
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,639
I like the gelato 41 that's uh super gas

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,620
and uh we had a batch like a month and a

88
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,799
half two months ago of some sfv times

animal mints I've been smoking on that

90
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,560
Jake likes the gas I like more like the

91
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:46,318

92

00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,539
I love that the two different ends of

95
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,940

sort of guy myself and I caught up a lot

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,879
of flack from the gas heads for that

99
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,158

122
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,939
Josh D cut probably one of the best I

123

haven't I haven't had some in a while

124

we don't have a uh we don't have like a

129
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:13,859
pure OG we have the sfv animal mint

130
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:15,478
cross which is definitely a sfv dominant

131
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,300
um but yeah we're looking we're looking

132

140
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,639
blast from the past people are super

141
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,320
interested in it tell me a bit of the

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,538
back story you know where the seeds come

143
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,399
from where the inspiration to Fino hunt

144
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,699
this classic come from

145
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,399
yeah it's um we don't actually even

146
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,560
really remember what of where we got the

147
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,019
seeds it's been so long

148
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,360
um but we've I we've been trying to find

149
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:00,478
about white widows since we started

150
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,879
growing that and Northern Lights and um

151
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,740
you know you just you pop seeds you can

152
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,719
pop hundreds of seeds and none of them

153
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,280
are winners we've done a lot of northern

154
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,900
lights in the past and we haven't been

155
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,758
able to put any out

156
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,918
um just because they haven't you know

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,680
been you know the blood structure hasn't

158
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,538
been good or they haven't smoked as good

159
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,000
or that the smell just isn't quite there

160
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:23,639
so we're really stoked to have a white

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,079
widow come to Market that you know it

162
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,960
kind of hits everything the blood

163
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,418
structure the Terps the look

164
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,359
um it's it's just very pungent we're

165
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:35,219
super excited about it a lot of um I

166
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,580
think people want to

167
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,319
put their stamp on new brains and cross

168
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:42,300
things and and eventually we want to do

169
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,520
that too but there's just some sort of

170
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,538
nostalgia that you know these old school

171
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:50,339
strains have I think for a lot of people

172
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:53,939
um you know growing up smoking these

173
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:56,099
strains uh they were so potent back then

174
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,199
um and and there's definitely a need and

175
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,580
want for these old school strains to

176
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,079
kind of surface to the recreational

177
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:02,279
Market again

178
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,918
um so that's just kind of what we're

179
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,619
focusing on and yeah we're super excited

180
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,959
to have the white widow White Widow come

181
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,538
back so we we know hunted a bunch of

182
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,538
seeds and the number 11 was the was the

183
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:17,879
seed that we chose that made the cut

184
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:20,579
also something too with uh with these

185
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,019
old strains that are that are somewhat

186
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:23,579
making a comeback and we're bringing

187
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,418
some back as well

188
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:29,698
with that a lot of people may remember a

189
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:32,339
white widow they've smoked 10 15 years

190
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,680
ago and ours may not be the same as that

191
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:36,779
it's definitely not the same because we

192
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,120
hunted it from seed

193
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:42,239
um whereas a lot of these old strain

194
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,038
names were clone only strains of a

195
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,478
specific cut

196
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:51,240
and so white widow originally was bred

197
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,758
between two land race strains so it's a

198
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,660
Brazilian sativa crossed with an Indian

199
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,819
indica and our Fino that we found is

200
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,099
definitely more on the sativa hybrid

201
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,460
leaning side it's super fruity it's got

202
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:08,339
like a like a candy chem nose on on it

203
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:11,159
and uh it's delicious it like the

204
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:13,258
flavors are outrageous yeah so we're

205
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,300
really excited for it to drop

206
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,680
yeah that's a good disclaimer there Jake

207
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,939
I think I think

208
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,759
um yeah with all these old school

209
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,098
strains a lot of people will have uh you

210
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,660
know a certain

211
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:27,060
phenotype in mind you know like a

212
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,879
certain clone that they had one time and

213
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,658
it's just like there's so many other

214
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:36,778
phenos from the same lineage of seeds

215
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:38,819
um so that was really good Jake that you

216
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:41,399
yeah hugely there's this huge sort of

217
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,560
reminiscent Rose shade glasses thing

218
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,778
when people look back and I also find

219
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,539
sometimes people maybe even try the

220
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,580
exact clone they are nostalgic over and

221
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:52,439
they're like oh this actually isn't as

222
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,440
good as I sort of remembered it but

223
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,779
that's a different story I'd love to ask

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,940
um out of the other phenotypes the ones

225
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:02,039
that didn't quite make the cut

226
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,480
um were they just sort of more bland or

227
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,039
did you find things that were maybe

228
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,019
unique but as you referenced like it

229
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,939
didn't have the bag appeal or the

230
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,440
structure or was it like yeah how did it

231
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,180
go

232
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,540
sometimes just you know the bug gets

233
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,979
really larfy or um it's just not as

234
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,919
dense

235
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,980
um as we'd like it uh and then it just

236
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,338
also the nose just isn't quite there

237
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,500
that the what we want it to be

238
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,899
um we pride ourselves in having some of

239
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,700
the terpios flower around and if if

240
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,679
you're not opening the jar and it's not

241
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,980
slapping you in the face

242
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,379
then then we don't want it in our jars

243
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,000
what a great answer this sort of segues

244
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,500
nicely into the next point because I

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,820
noticed on your Instagram you guys do

246
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,639
Fino hunt

247
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,440
um various stuff and I love that and I

248
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,539
saw the post about the Pineapple Express

249
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,339
where you sort of said oh you know we're

250
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:55,439
not sure if it's gonna sort of make it

251
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,660
let's see how it smokes it got me

252
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,640
wondering how often is it that you Fino

253
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:02,219
hunt something and at the end of it you

254
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,860
may not have anything really to show

255
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,740
most of the time most of the time yeah

256
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,039
like pretty much out of a hundred seeds

257
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,039
you may find one or two uh and if you

258
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,199
find five or more than five that's like

259
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,199
really good

260
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,259
um and so if we if we pop a batch of

261
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,278
seeds and there's like 10 or 15 from one

262
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:28,019
strain like it's I mean it's a roll of

263
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,700
the dice you really never know until you

264
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,440
grow it and sometimes we have to grow at

265
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,899
a second or third time

266
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,600
and sometimes that second or third run

267
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,820
actually gives it a better chance

268
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,560
um so oftentimes it's not even after the

269
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,140
first round of testing that we even know

270
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,739
we if something is closer on the on the

271
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:49,078
fence we will run it a second time

272
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,659
um and yeah like most of the time it

273
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,639
doesn't work out

274
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:56,399
yeah that's uh that's cool to hear that

275
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,799
you guys have like such a high standards

276
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,019
for things to meet and before we sort of

277
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,699
move on I'll just quickly curious are

278
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,740
there any other sort of strains from

279
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,300
yesteryear that you guys are thinking

280
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,220
about maybe delving into in the near

281
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,479
future

282
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,459
yeah well we are hunting some stuff

283
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,720
right now we have some green crack on

284
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,578
the hunt

285
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,720
um as well as a couple train wreck

286
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:20,578
finners uh some ghost train Haze ghost

287
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,139
train Haze and there's a one or two

288
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,899
Afghani

289
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:27,120
um so we'll see what's up with those oh

290
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,740
wow and Northern Lights northern lights

291
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,820
were always one against the northern

292
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,480
lights

293
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,459
um

294
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,100
but yeah I think I think if we could

295
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:38,759
find a solid green crack too that's

296
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,740
another just super pungent strain that

297
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,120
is a blast from the past as well I

298
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,579
remember the first time I was smoking

299
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,200
green crack and it was just

300
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,639
it was something like I never tried

301
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,339
before

302
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,159
that's beautiful it sounds to me like

303
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,920
you guys run a reasonably balanced

304
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,299
selection of sort of really new hype

305
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,338
stuff like maybe you say like you know

306
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,379
the gelato or the cushman's and then

307
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,000
also some of this older stuff is that

308
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:06,179
how you view it and and was that

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,399
intentional yeah definitely I

310
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:12,000
um yeah especially on the on the rec

311
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,379
Market you have to have flavors of all

312
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,100
kinds

313
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:18,659
um you know it's so challenging nowadays

314
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,300
uh in the recreational markets so many

315
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:23,039
Brands so many marketing tools so you

316
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,479
definitely have to have an array of

317
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,939
flavors

318
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,440
um at any given point so we like to try

319
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:32,760
to keep it

320
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,560
um you know 50 gas 50 fruity

321
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,078
um you know any flavors uh you know

322
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,759
sativa dominant leaning Indica dominant

323
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,099
leaning we definitely try to keep a nice

324
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,379
well balanced so uh customers can go

325
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,759
back and and get something different or

326
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:47,399
they can have something you know for the

327
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,720
daytime something for the night time

328
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:51,120
um yeah it's really important to have

329
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,879
well-balanced flavors

330
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,560
yeah and when when I talk to guests

331
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,958
often we move into this idea of like

332
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,578
sort of like a hierarchy of traits and I

333
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:01,559
guess I'd be interested in knowing for

334
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,179
you guys what's your hierarchy if like

335
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,159
obviously you know in an ideal world

336
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,958
everything looks great smells great it's

337
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,480
great you know but let's just say we had

338
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,039
a plant that maybe didn't look quite

339
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,139
where you wanted it to but the effect

340
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,299
was just unparalleled just Second To

341
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,860
None would you entertain that or do you

342
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,620
feel like it does sort of need to be

343
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,459
well-rounded in a sense it's um

344
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:26,940
it's a balanced combination of a lot of

345
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:31,739
different factors and so

346
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:34,320
what we really are looking for is one

347
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,180
how does like how is it growing because

348
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,860
that's that's the first thing is is it

349
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,199
is it can it make it through the growth

350
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,539
process can it clung can we flower it is

351
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,278
are the buds is it not herming out

352
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,039
so that's the first thing that we'll be

353
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,419
looking at and then I mean really the

354
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,338
first thing is like the Terps and

355
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:52,679
smelling it but then it then it goes to

356
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,380
the growth process and so as we're

357
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:57,778
looking at how the plant is growing we

358
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,700
then if we have 10 seeds of of one

359
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:01,740
strain let's say with the white widow

360
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,560
for example when we're hunting through

361
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,139
that we're looking at the growth of each

362
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,239
plant in addition to the terp profile

363
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,700
and then and the the nug structure as

364
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,339
well while it's growing because we can

365
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,440
tell a lot of a plant while it's still

366
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:19,740
in the flowering room

367
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,480
um and that's how we like we originally

368
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,220
selected Our Winning Our Winning White

369
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,620
Widow Fino in the flower room because

370
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,220
the Terps were just out of the like

371
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,139
person out of the room and uh none of

372
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,778
the other femos really really hit that

373
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:37,019
so the biggest thing is like looking at

374
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:39,720
the Terps but then it's also a large

375
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,480
combination of the growth of the plant

376
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,860
and does it grow does it yield is it the

377
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,659
right structure for how we farm

378
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,100
and then once we chop it we have to dry

379
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:53,819
it we have to smoke it we have to

380
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,560
actually see how it smokes and like with

381
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,240
the white widow for example we knew like

382
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,159
that was destined to Winter from the

383
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,778
flower room but sometimes something will

384
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,240
smell great in the flower room and then

385
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:05,820
you dry it and it's just really enough

386
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,198
yeah wow you read my mind always let's

387
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,639
let's delve into that because I was

388
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,620
about to ask you and you just started

389
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,480
answering it so I was going to say it's

390
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,459
obviously genetic dependent right it

391
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,920
depends on the strain but in my

392
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,379
experience I find exactly what you said

393
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,659
right often you see a plant and it looks

394
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,759
like the winner and most of the time it

395
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,259
does translate and I've always felt that

396
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,899
was interesting right because as you

397
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,059
said looks doesn't necessarily determine

398
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,278
the effect but I find a lot of the

399
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,539
genetics I run it sort of does correlate

400
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:35,879
right the one that looks like the winner

401
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:37,139
often smokes the best as well do you

402
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:39,299
find that to be the case like do you

403
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,278
think it's an exception to the rule less

404
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,838
of the time or do you think it's it's so

405
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,820
variable you can't really make make

406
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,800
these broad statements well I think it's

407
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,980
safe to say I mean obviously there's

408
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,078
some phenomenons like the old school

409
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,860
cherry pie that everyone talks about

410
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:58,919
that would like perm out you know

411
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,778
um but other than that if it if it's

412
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,479
looking good and smelling good in the

413
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:06,778
flower room it's most likely if you do a

414
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,579
proper drying cure gonna also be good

415
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:12,120
but that's another thing too if you're

416
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:14,638
not properly drying and and curing the

417
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,500
flour I've seen harvests get absolutely

418
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,778
ruined

419
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,799
um because that process isn't handled

420
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:24,659
with care

421
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:27,659
yeah um exactly and uh and like Marco

422
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,639
was saying most of the time if it seems

423
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,980
good in the flower room it's gonna smoke

424
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,959
well but there is you know time to time

425
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,180
again where you do where you have a

426
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,219
strain that's just fire but it it

427
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:40,198
occasionally harms and that's kind of

428
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,940
like you have to make the choice is it

429
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:43,679
good is it that good that you want to

430
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,360
keep running it

431
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,939
um or is that like a you know is that a

432
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,879
deal breaker and so when we're hunting

433
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,579
stuff it it's really a combination of

434
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,620
everything we we have to look at like I

435
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,239
even smell the stem when it's vegging

436
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,179
like you rub the stem and see how it

437
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,579
smells in in the vegetative growth and

438
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:05,279
sometimes feeling the stems in the

439
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:07,619
vegetative growth can help you like can

440
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,639
really show you how resinous the plant's

441
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,619
gonna be

442
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,500
um if it's just like like stems can

443
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:17,418
straighten up just be sticky

444
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,419
um and sometimes Jake actually

445
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,679
oh no no no go ahead

446
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,100
I was gonna Jake actually picked our

447
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:30,840
winning Mimosa Fino

448
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:34,500
from a veggie Mimosa clone that we had

449
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:36,959
in the bedroom it was crazy wow is it

450
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,359
just like super stinky yeah it was like

451
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,240
like me I was looking at the leaf

452
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:45,000
structure the the actual internodal

453
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,620
spacing as it veggies because that's

454
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,839
something that's very important too how

455
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,399
lanky is the plant is it just super

456
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,678
stacked where it's not going to grow

457
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,140
tall at all so like that's a factor and

458
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,820
then also yeah like the like how the

459
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,500
stem smells

460
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:00,538
once you've been doing it for a while

461
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,759
you really can kind of start like

462
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,079
telling which plants are gonna are gonna

463
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,298
do well

464
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,879
yeah that's great and I mean on the

465
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,798
topic of you you mentioned mimosa and a

466
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,460
little earlier ghost train Haze got

467
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,619
mentioned I feel like you guys are one

468
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,779
of the smaller group of people who are

469
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:21,058
putting out some very sort of sativa

470
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,740
leaning offerings in some strain and and

471
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,079
not just offering sort of these like

472
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,440
middle of the road hybrids I'm curious

473
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,538
to know do you find the public reception

474
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,980
for those sativas is is good or do you

475
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:34,140
feel like people are a bit hesitant

476
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,798
compared to like gassy indicas how does

477
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,620
it all play out I think originally you

478
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:44,220
know Southern California was all about

479
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:46,979
the gas I grew up smoking OG and

480
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,620
especially LA with you know the San

481
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,798
Fernando Valley OG and and Josh G and

482
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:56,879
all like it it California has just been

483
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:59,160
heavy with OG and and I've always leaned

484
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,799
like once I started once I started

485
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:05,220
smoking sativas after being heavily

486
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:07,440
smoking the ogs I just really Started

487
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,919
Loving sativas a lot more

488
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,798
um just you know the fruitier strains

489
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,700
um and I'm absolutely seen a shift in

490
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:21,119
the market and people being really uh

491
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:24,058
receptive to our fruity strains

492
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,918
um they I think because a lot of Growers

493
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:28,200
don't really grow them

494
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,538
uh I it's it's been really good for us

495
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,840
we've had a lot of positive feedback

496
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:36,058
but yeah I would say the uh because the

497
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,859
market has been growing a lot of just

498
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:41,099
like cake strains and we've stayed away

499
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:43,439
from all the cake strains and uh

500
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,178
there's just a lot of that kind of bland

501
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,580
hybrids out there so when we bring

502
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,400
something that's just super fruity and

503
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,980
pungent and it also hits the the market

504
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,900
definitely receives it well yeah

505
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,599
brilliant that's that's sort of the

506
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,298
answer I was hoping to hear and as sort

507
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,019
of an extension of that idea do you guys

508
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:05,339
in general prefer to run your own

509
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:06,720
phenotype of a certain strain because

510
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,699
it's like it's a bit different to what

511
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,679
other people have to offer or do you

512
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,240
feel like you know when you've got an

513
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,860
established clone like a lot of the

514
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,319
marketing's done for you like where do

515
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:19,500
you sit on that one we're so we're like

516
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:23,579
a mix of both we love running our own

517
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,679
phinos because nobody else has them and

518
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:28,439
they're like are marked that's what

519
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,679
we're cultivating but at the same time

520
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,440
for example the gelato 41 is probably

521
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,660
one of the best gelato cuts out there

522
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,120
um and we are cultivating it to a really

523
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,640
high degree so there are strains like

524
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,199
that that we like that you know you

525
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,080
couldn't grow without having the Clone

526
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,720
because it's a clone only strain but in

527
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,339
general we are trying to cultivate our

528
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,279
own phenos and phenohunt everything

529
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:56,459
in-house and eventually one day breed

530
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,440
but that's a long time down the road

531
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,120
um but the more that we can cultivate

532
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,919
in-house and come out with our own

533
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,979
phenols that nobody else has it really

534
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,140
helps kind of create like a a market for

535
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,058
us that of of strains that other people

536
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,340
are not farming

537
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:12,899
so much of the market

538
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:14,220
um you know a lot of these a lot of

539
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,259
people don't realize a lot of these

540
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,660
Brands they don't even cultivate their

541
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:20,819
own flower they're just buying bulk

542
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,120
flour from these other farmers and

543
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:27,119
slapping their label on it right and so

544
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,399
it's it's that's why the market is just

545
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,379
flooded with so much of the same boring

546
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,500
cake streams and all that stuff is

547
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,419
because it's coming from the same

548
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,819
batches even

549
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,860
um and just all these brands are calling

550
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,678
it their own when it was grown by the

551
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:46,019
same grower and so yeah being able to

552
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,538
differentiate ourselves not only just

553
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:52,440
growing and living soil but then also

554
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:55,019
having our own phinos is is absolutely

555
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,659
what we're going for yeah that's that's

556
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:59,639
brilliant and um and Jake touched on

557
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,320
maybe down the road breeding I was going

558
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,120
I was gonna ask you that question and

559
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,119
sort of my thoughts have been for the

560
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,279
longest time that I view the way the

561
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,079
jungle boys did their sort of seat

562
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,639
operation as the way to do it right like

563
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,019
you spend years finding these unique

564
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,419
phenotypes and you've got this whole

565
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:18,240
whole pool of mothers to breed with

566
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,140
would you say that sort of a plan for

567
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,940
you guys

568
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,520
yeah

569
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,380
um definitely uh in major respect to the

570
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:29,038
Jungle boys they've you know created a

571
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:32,820
phenomenal uh just infrastructure of

572
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:35,279
cultivation and distribution and Retail

573
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:37,558
um and yeah they their breeding program

574
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,200
and tissue culture program is definitely

575
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,480
something to model after and in my

576
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,360
opinion every hydroponic Farm across the

577
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,240
world is modeling their hydroponic farm

578
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:51,178
system after jungle boys

579
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,980
um and yeah that's I mean that's the way

580
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,220
to do it you have to have your you have

581
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,980
to have your genetic library and then if

582
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,620
you can which jungle boys did if you can

583
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,140
hunt males only in a room they have

584
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:07,199
flowered out entire rooms of males to

585
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,259
test the pollen and then select the

586
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,058
pollen to breed with and so I mean

587
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:14,460
that's like pretty Legend status on

588
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:17,038
breeding and if we ever get to a point

589
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,440
like that that would be amazing yeah wow

590
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,720
I have to admit I hadn't heard of pollen

591
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,519
testing when you say testing like what

592
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,740
were they actually testing like like

593
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:29,038
visually or like doing like lab testing

594
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:32,099
no like they'll lab test for the terpene

595
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:35,400
profile in the pollen wow that's cool

596
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:36,839
yeah love that so yeah looping back to

597
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,740
sort of one of the questions we were

598
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:39,298
talking about earlier when you're

599
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,259
talking about pheno hunting and stuff

600
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,940
like that and you're saying you know

601
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:44,038
we're sort of always looking for an NL

602
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,140
and stuff like that like how much

603
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,000
emphasis do you place on the provenance

604
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,460
of seeds like if some guy messaged you

605
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,740
and says hey I got some old NL like my

606
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,558
gut instinct would be that that might

607
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,940
not be NL at all you know like where do

608
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:58,740
you do you feel like you got to really

609
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,779
make sure you Source the stock or are

610
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,000
you open to hunting most things if

611
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:06,720
they're given to you well we're

612
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,839
definitely we we can't be because of the

613
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,380
laws and the regulations so the seeds

614
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,000
that we have are the seeds that we have

615
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,179
to work with

616
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,919
so you know the the people that are

617
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,200
familiar with the metric system in

618
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,759
California it's just been very

619
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,900
challenging to really grow things that I

620
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,079
mean it

621
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,419
yeah it's uh it's pretty difficult

622
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,339
but yeah we don't we're not uh we're not

623
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,900
looking to basically take random seeds

624
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,519
we have a good seed stock that we've

625
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,919
been hunting for a while or that we've

626
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,359
been like saving for a long time and

627
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,659
what Marco was talking about it's the

628
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,939
it's this m metric m-e-t-r-c it's the

629
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:50,700
software system that the state requires

630
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,340
licensed uh all licensed cannabis

631
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,460
businesses to use and it's the track and

632
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:59,339
Trace uh software and so

633
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,279
basically stuff has to be in integrated

634
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:04,019
in the system already for you to use it

635
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:05,639
um and that's why we eventually want to

636
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,339
get into seed production so that we're

637
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,860
able to produce our own genetics

638
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:14,279
um but yeah and it just like it it takes

639
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:16,918
so much time effort money resources to

640
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,538
actually Fino hunt a strain and so we

641
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,000
want to know that if we're going to hunt

642
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:24,599
something that it's legit

643
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,400
um absolutely and yeah so we definitely

644
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:29,038
don't don't take random seeds from

645
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,340
random people yeah that's uh totally

646
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,019
understandable so let's delve into some

647
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,240
of the more the more technical aspects

648
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:39,720
of it but but quickly I'd love to ask

649
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,599
what inspired you guys to to go down the

650
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,759
organic cultivation side of things even

651
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:48,298
before say you open the facility what

652
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,058
was your entry into the organic world uh

653
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:53,639
Mountain Organics actually

654
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:55,798
um you know he's kind of a what we

655
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,880
believe the legend in the space was one

656
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,019
of you know

657
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,179
the earlier guys that was uh showcasing

658
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:05,278
no-till on in you know with cannabis

659
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,880
indoors

660
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,900
um

661
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,720
and uh we just saw him on Instagram and

662
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,179
we just became absolutely fascinated

663
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,298
that you don't have to throw away soil

664
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,400
that you know all these worms

665
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:22,859
microorganisms are living in these pots

666
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,580
um and that it truly is you know a

667
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:29,099
healthier better terpier alternative and

668
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:30,359
the first uh side-by-side grow that I

669
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,639
had

670
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:35,759
um

671
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:39,720
growing just in regular soil versus uh

672
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,220
no-till was so much of a difference and

673
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,038
just kind of never looked back after

674
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,558
that um a clear High

675
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:50,220
um you know a terpier taste every you

676
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,379
just felt better smoking it ever since I

677
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,558
grew my first no-till pot it was just a

678
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,020
clear way not only that knowing how

679
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,759
small of a cultivation we are just being

680
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,639
Jake and I and then you know we have

681
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,919
eight employees we knew going into the

682
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,200
legal Market that we had to do something

683
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,960
different anyways

684
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,558
um and so it just made even more sense

685
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,880
for us to grow indoor living soil yeah

686
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:17,519
wow and

687
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,700
um what what stimulated you to

688
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,319
transition from say like growing

689
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,900
wherever you were before your current

690
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,879
facility is to being like let's do this

691
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,038
big operation was there any was it just

692
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,419
a slow sort of gradual thing or was

693
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:31,679
there like a defining moment where

694
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,440
you're like you know what no one's doing

695
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,460
this I reckon we can pull it off it was

696
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,919
uh it really was so in California

697
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,860
Cannabis became recreationally legal on

698
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:46,620
the in the ballot in 2016. in November

699
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:47,399
it was voted in to be recreational and

700
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:50,459
so

701
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,798
uh uh Marco and I grew up working in the

702
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,500
prop 215 era and uh you know working

703
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,278
with the shop and

704
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,019
um

705
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:00,298
we had small you know a small grow

706
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:02,759
before and we just

707
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:03,960
are the goal was to join the legal

708
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,599
Market

709
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,819
and to transition out of what was the

710
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,619
medical Market before

711
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:12,480
um because the whole licensing structure

712
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:14,579
is still a learning process for

713
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,798
everybody but each city is different and

714
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:19,740
so basically we had to make the decision

715
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,839
to stop trying to cultivate on the

716
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,000
medical Market that wasn't the licensed

717
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,558
Medical Market because now there's the

718
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,140
licensed medical license recreational

719
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,538
but it's it's all together now and so we

720
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,120
had to really make the decision to stop

721
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:35,879
doing everything we were doing and look

722
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,259
at how we can get a license and get a

723
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,380
license in the city that will allow us

724
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:42,179
to operate and so it just spent like it

725
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,860
spent a year we I spent a year looking

726
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,840
for a building we had to get this

727
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,399
building we built it out we took a year

728
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,859
to get another year to get our building

729
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,360
permit so we're two years in and then a

730
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:52,918
year to build the place so basically

731
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,199
three years we had to kind of put

732
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,820
everything on hold so we could go legal

733
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,558
and not have to look over our shoulder

734
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,240
and not have to worry about getting

735
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,000
everything chopped down and all the

736
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,919
money lost for no reason

737
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,740
um so we so we put everything on hold

738
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,960
and then we uh you know we dove into the

739
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,038
licensing I got the license and I built

740
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,038
the facility

741
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:17,278
and uh yeah it's been a it's been a

742
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:20,759
gnarly gnarly process that's for sure

743
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,778
hey uh I'm I'm so sorry I I gotta jump

744
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,839
out

745
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:26,579
um because of this emergency but uh I

746
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,918

right bye

763
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:06,960
cool cool cool so I mean on that on that

764
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:09,178
topic Jake do you find that the the

765
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,798
legal framework is still really

766
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,600
challenging to navigate or do you feel

767
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,278
like you're at a point where where it's

768
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,719
sort of a little bit of smooth sailing

769
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:17,720
but you know it's still hard

770
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:24,840
um like for us because we have the

771
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,558
license it's not as bad now but to get

772
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:30,839
the license was just a nightmare and the

773
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,538
regulations are still evolving and

774
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:38,220
changing on the city level and the state

775
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:39,960
level and so it's just like the taxes

776
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,720
are changing

777
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,159
um and like certain licensing procedures

778
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,038
are changing

779
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,320
and so it is still it's still evolving

780
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,240
we're in a better place than I would say

781
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,119
if you were like just trying to get your

782
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,220
license now because it's just the market

783
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,719
has become inundated over the last you

784
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,659
know four years with so many people

785
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,100
getting uh licensed

786
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:04,140
so it's uh

787
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:06,839
it's been it's been a wild roller

788
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,580
coaster that's for sure yeah certainly

789
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:11,220
and and just as like a little follow-up

790
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:13,139
I hear from lots of people who go

791
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,240
through the trials and tribulations you

792
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,520
just mentioned and sadly many of them

793
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,500
aren't able to get the license and or

794
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,418
various things happen and a lot of

795
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,278
farmers that have ended up ultimately

796
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,778
leaving California because it's just

797
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:28,919
they feel like they've been pushed out

798
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:30,839
of the market do you feel like that sort

799
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,100
of um sentiment has ever affected you

800
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:34,259
have you ever considered leaving

801
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:36,658
California or was the goal always to do

802
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:39,058
your thing there of

803
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:42,960
yeah I mean we've just been like

804
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:45,839
extremely persistent and so I'm from you

805
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,519
know I'm from San Diego and uh in

806
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,980
California and uh we're up in Long Beach

807
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,220
now so we cultivate in Long Beach but

808
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,558
I've never considered leaving California

809
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,419
um in my opinion it would be an I mean

810
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:59,700
it's really tough here don't get me

811
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:02,340
wrong but it's gonna be tough anywhere

812
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,159
and I don't know any other area like

813
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,898
another state to go operate in

814
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,340
um and to have the connections and you

815
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:10,439
know the to build things and have

816
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:12,240
contractors and all that and so we've

817
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,460
kind of established a network here but

818
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,200
thankfully we haven't had to consider

819
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,360
leaving but a lot I mean It's just tough

820
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,058
a lot of farmers were left behind and

821
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:23,278
most of that is like it's a combination

822
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:25,678
of reasons there's some Financial a lot

823
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,898
of it is that the city that they are

824
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,840
that they live in or they're operating

825
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:33,239
in just won't license them because the

826
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:35,579
city bans it still or the county bans it

827
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,859
still because there's a lot of farms in

828
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,619
what we are considered unincorporated

829
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:42,778
land where it's not in us like it's if

830
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:45,658
you're in the city of Los Angeles for

831
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:48,839
example there's also the County of Los

832
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:50,460
Angeles and the county has been illegal

833
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:51,959
for up until now I think there was a

834
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,480
ballot I don't know if it got passed yet

835
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,319
but the county did not have any

836
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,200
licensing only the city and so

837
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,960
the unincorporated land which most land

838
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,000
like in San Diego County San Diego has a

839
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,579
bunch of different cities in every

840
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,079
single city has a different licensing

841
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:13,139
structure

842
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,960
and so in order to get licensed in any

843
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:20,640
particular city the city that you are

844
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,798
operating in has to sign off on what

845
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,080
you're gonna do so if you wanna if you

846
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:28,259
want to build a cultivation facility in

847
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,960
whatever City it is that city has to

848
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:34,079
have ordinance and a licensing structure

849
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,140
to Grant you a City license

850
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:40,319
if the city that you are in will do that

851
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,960
then the state will grant you a license

852
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,480
if you do all the stuff you have to do

853
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,600
to get the state license but it all

854
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,120
hinges on the local on the local area

855
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,918
that you're operating in and that's the

856
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,859
biggest problem is that so many cities

857
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,080
in California just outright banned

858
00:33:55,859 --> 00:34:00,599
cannabis because they're

859
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,980
just not with it and they don't see the

860
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,019
benefit

861
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,179
and that will change but it's going to

862
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:07,980
take it's going to take years and takes

863
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:10,740
ballot initiatives and people to vote

864
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:13,378
and ordinances to get written

865
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,719
um and so it's a slow slow process but

866
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:18,239
that's why the Black Market has been

867
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,239
fueled for the past you know forever in

868
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,918
California because it's a lot easier for

869
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,299
these guys to just keep selling on the

870
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,398
black market

871
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,460
because the city they're in won't even

872
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,618
give them a license anyway yeah that's

873
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,398
that's an interesting point and I have

874
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:37,919
for a long time wondered what the uh the

875
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:41,279
landscape of the scene will be in say 10

876
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,480
to 15 years time and I'd love I'd love

877
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,580
to hear your thoughts do you think we're

878
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,099
going to move more towards like a jet

879
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:48,838
like an alcohol style model where you

880
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,338
know there's maybe less Brands and

881
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:52,259
there's like your Bud Light sort of

882
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,000
equivalent or where do you think we'll

883
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,820
be in 10 15 years

884
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,300
I think so like

885
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,700
it's a it depends like it depends on if

886
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,200
cannabis becomes federally legalized in

887
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:08,879
the United States

888
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:10,919
and if that does happen and Brands like

889
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,460
us or anybody that's legal in California

890
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,800
or any other state if we are allowed to

891
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,940
sell to other states legally

892
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,160
that will change the market a little bit

893
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:26,460
however with that being said

894
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:29,940
this is a brand new category

895
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,639
of a commodity so like cannabis is one

896
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,760
of the largest agricultural crops

897
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,739
by volume and dollars sold in the world

898
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,359
now and especially in the United States

899
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:41,819
and in California it's like it's a it's

900
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:44,039
in the top ten and so

901
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,920
because of that

902
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:50,519
we like the whole cannabis industry has

903
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:53,039
created an an entirely New Concept of

904
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:56,179
how things like a whole new category of

905
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:59,460
things legally sold is now available

906
00:35:56,179 --> 00:36:01,199
and that's why there's and like I'll get

907
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,039
to the point that I'm making but that's

908
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:07,679
why that there's all these

909
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:08,759
we had to create stores just to sell

910
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,159
cannabis

911
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,320
whereas there are individual liquor

912
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,199
stores there's individual beer stores

913
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,800
but there's all but they also sell all

914
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,939
of those products at gas stations at

915
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,579
supermarkets anywhere in the United

916
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,019
States is selling alcohol and uh liquor

917
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,480
you have to have a liquor license but

918
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:30,559
with cannabis we had to create an entire

919
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,420
new structure of

920
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,338
licensing and retail stores and all

921
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,180
these new ordinances to sell this

922
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:40,739
product

923
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:43,379
so I don't know if the regulations will

924
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:46,858
ever allow like a normal grocery store

925
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,619
to sell cannabis or not because this is

926
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:52,920
a brand new agricultural commodity that

927
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:56,700
required all of these retail stores to

928
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:59,460
be opened purely to sell the product

929
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:02,098
so that like that's the challenge and

930
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,858
the other challenge in the United States

931
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,059
is that even once it becomes federally

932
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:08,838
legal

933
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:12,420
it's going to be dependent on each state

934
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:16,259
to create the licensing structure so

935
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,858
let's say a state just outright bans it

936
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,660
then you know it's uh they might ban

937
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:23,400
sale like it's it there's a huge gray

938
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:25,078
area in the United States with that if

939
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,119
if a state is Banning it but it's

940
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,519
federally legal can you go buy it in

941
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,740
another state and bring it over it's one

942
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,000
of those tough things and so once it

943
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:37,858
goes federally legal it's going to be

944
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,199
somewhat similar to what it is now it's

945
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:43,199
just going to be more available and

946
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,939
you'll be able to see brands that you

947
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,299
might not have seen in a state because

948
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:51,179
they couldn't sell there but with that

949
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,980
there's currently large groups that are

950
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:55,078
multi-state operators where they're in

951
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,780
California they're in Michigan in

952
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,660
Florida now in New Jersey too and New

953
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,660
York and so there's a lot of like not a

954
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:05,819
lot there's like a handful of large

955
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:07,858
large companies that have partnered with

956
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,420
some of the top brands that are from

957
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:12,299
California

958
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,000
so that they position themselves to have

959
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,220
the cultivation infrastructure in

960
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,858
multiple States because currently to

961
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:22,259
sell in a particular State you have to

962
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:23,578
grow it in that state so to sell weed in

963
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,040
Florida you have to grow it in Florida

964
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:28,079
to sell weed in California legally you

965
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,579
have to grow it in California in a

966
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,039
licensed facility

967
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:34,740
and that's also one of the craziest

968
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:38,699
things too because no other agricultural

969
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:40,379
commodity is required to be sold like

970
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:42,838
everything from that region that is

971
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,358
grown required to be sold in that same

972
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,279
region because nothing nothing could

973
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,358
sell that much and that's part of the

974
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,420
problem with the market there's

975
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:55,019
oversupply because everything has to be

976
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,180
sold in the state that it's grown in

977
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:59,338
and it's just crazy it's I mean it's

978
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:01,379
it's a crazy concept because like if you

979
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:03,539
think of like wine that comes from most

980
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,420
of the wine produced in Australia is

981
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,099
produced for export they're exporting it

982
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,579
to other countries

983
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:13,380
because like no no country could consume

984
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,780
the amount of agricultural Commodities

985
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,920
that the country produces

986
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,780
and that's what we're seeing with

987
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,180
cannabis and that's that's hurting the

988
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,060
market also to touch on that point about

989
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:25,618
like the brands and a Big Brand like the

990
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:27,779
thing with cannabis that is different

991
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:30,240
than alcohol is

992
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,480
like even if there's a brand that

993
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:36,479
becomes like the Bud Light of of you

994
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,219
know cannabis it's such a challenging

995
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,380
thing like there's going to be like the

996
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:42,539
low quality weed that is basically the

997
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,838
same across all the states once it's

998
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:47,940
federally legal but if you want like top

999
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,659
quality flour stuff like that we're

1000
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:54,000
cultivating you can't

1001
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:55,319
reproduce that on a massive scale basic

1002
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
like and that's the channel is that

1003
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,460
these large groups have been trying to

1004
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,039
do what like what we can cultivate with

1005
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,679
a hundred lights you can't replicate

1006
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:07,500
that and do 10 000 lights and have it be

1007
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,480
the same quality and so that's the

1008
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,780
challenge with cannabis because it's a

1009
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,420
we're growing like a dense flower that

1010
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:19,140
has a ton of moisture content and so

1011
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,940
it's so hard to standardize that on a

1012
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:23,639
massive production scale

1013
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,858
and actually scale the quality whereas

1014
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,139
with beer it's a lit I mean it's still

1015
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:30,960
hard like they can't do the craft batch

1016
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:34,259
on a massive scale either and so it's

1017
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,539
kind of like that but cannabis has

1018
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,480
always started from that craft batch

1019
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:41,639
quality type type of grow and so that's

1020
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,559
kind of the difference there of what

1021
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,420
will be of like the massive outdoor

1022
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:47,659
Farms just putting out flour that's

1023
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,700
super cheap that is the same basically

1024
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:53,940
and like your top quality you know

1025
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:56,639
indoor grown hundred light facility so

1026
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,838
there's a huge difference yeah you

1027
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:00,118
nailed it that was going to be one of

1028
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,739
the questions so as a quick follow-up do

1029
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,900
you think the answer then is if you

1030
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,939
can't scale up if if the quality starts

1031
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,039
to drop off at a certain point is the

1032
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,838
answer to set up a second facility

1033
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,639
somewhere else that equally does a

1034
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,380
second small craft batch

1035
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,139
yeah

1036
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,760
um I mean it's tough right so like the

1037
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:20,039
reason that you know or part of the

1038
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,440
reason we're able to have the quality

1039
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:25,079
that we have right now is because you

1040
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,179
know I'm here operating the facility all

1041
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,920
the time and so

1042
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:31,500
everything that's coming through our

1043
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,599
Harvest Room my eyes are on and it's

1044
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,579
like until we can really put the

1045
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,500
training in place and you know the

1046
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,300
standard operating procedures to teach

1047
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,800
all this stuff and replicate it It's

1048
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,579
just tough because the one thing with

1049
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,820
cannabis is a lot of it is nuanced uh

1050
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:51,599
like how we dry stuff when it's 14 days

1051
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,700
dry versus 16 days dry and like the the

1052
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,700
moisture content in the stems and the

1053
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:59,460
leaves and actually seeing the bud cure

1054
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:03,719
and all of those things it's it it all

1055
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:06,539
comes with experience and so it's not it

1056
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:08,819
what these large groups are finding is

1057
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:11,880
that even if they're setting up 10

1058
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,740
facilities that are all 200 lights not

1059
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,200
every facility is going to produce the

1060
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:20,338
same quality because it's just really

1061
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:22,679
hard and so even for us like personally

1062
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:25,078
if we were to do another facility we

1063
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:27,539
would want to do a large Greenhouse

1064
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,060
because a lot of it would go for

1065
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:33,599
extracts we would also do some for flour

1066
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:36,179
but we know that we just can't produce

1067
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,338
the quality of flour that we produce now

1068
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,500
on a massive scale

1069
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:42,779
and that's just the challenge like

1070
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,699
either you want to stay quality and and

1071
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,099
do it small like there's maybe one or

1072
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:49,858
two companies right now that are that

1073
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:52,140
have been able to scale and keep their

1074
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:54,059
quality and It's just tough it's just

1075
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:56,519
really tough It's really cash intensive

1076
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:58,318
it takes a ton of money

1077
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:00,119
um to actually build another facility

1078
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,519
and then actually run it and all that

1079
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,440
it's uh it's definitely tough yeah so

1080
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:06,239
for us I don't I don't know that we

1081
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,338
would even want to do another another

1082
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:11,459
facility yet until we're until their

1083
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:13,500
demand is so high that like we can't

1084
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,659
even keep a jar on the Shelf then it

1085
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,599
makes sense but the demand's got to be

1086
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:21,659
there sure and as a final quick question

1087
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,818
on this sort of discussion of scale if

1088
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:26,940
you did scale up with your organic

1089
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:28,440
cultivation practice what is it in your

1090
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,940
mind that's the primary thing that

1091
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,099
affects the quality is it the pest

1092
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,720
pressure or is it just each plant is

1093
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,859
getting less attention because there's

1094
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:37,618
more plans

1095
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:39,779
yeah it's um

1096
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:43,680
it's a con like it it could be a

1097
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:47,040
combination of those so as groups scale

1098
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:49,440
look it's hard to care as much because

1099
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:52,139
you've got so much more volume that

1100
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,659
you're putting out and and so much more

1101
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:56,759
plant material to work with so if

1102
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:58,318
there's a bad run it's like oh well

1103
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,940
there's another one coming down next

1104
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,239
week

1105
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,940
um and so it's It's just tough but what

1106
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:07,858
happens is that just keeps continuing

1107
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,659
down the line oh this is bad oh that

1108
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:10,980
runs bad oh well now everything is just

1109
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:13,980
mediocre

1110
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:18,059
and uh and and it's just tough I think

1111
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:20,519
uh I think scaling is in cannabis is

1112
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:22,980
like in the cultivation side of cannabis

1113
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:26,159
is one of the toughest things to do yeah

1114
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,440
no doubt well let's jump into some of

1115
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,659
the brass tacks of some organic growing

1116
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,338
so I wanted to know what's the basic

1117
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:35,338
composition of your soil is it the

1118
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:39,299
standard 111 ratio of compost aeration

1119
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:41,818
peat moss is it anything different so uh

1120
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:44,760
so we run the like our base soil is the

1121
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:47,579
Builder soil 3.0 blend

1122
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:51,540
um and then after we have that that's a

1123
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:53,940
well-blended mixed like living soil base

1124
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:56,460
um once we get that so if we like for

1125
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,500
for one room it'll take about 20 yards

1126
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:03,240
of soil

1127
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:05,579
um 20 cubic yards and 20 to 24 or so and

1128
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,858
then with that we will then we're

1129
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,859
running 24 foot long growing beds so

1130
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:13,139
they're four feet wide by 24 feet long

1131
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:15,000
basically one meter a little more than a

1132
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:15,960
meter wide

1133
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,239
um

1134
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:23,579
but yeah four feet wide by 24 feet long

1135
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:26,879
and we put 10 000 worms per bed to start

1136
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:28,920
and then we will also soil we will test

1137
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,660
the soil when we get it to see if we

1138
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,400
need to amend it with something else to

1139
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:33,960
kind of help it get up to the elemental

1140
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,639
levels that we want to the mineral

1141
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,199
content

1142
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:38,940
um and then we will let the worms kind

1143
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,460
of work in there we put mulch over it so

1144
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,240
the worms have something to eat

1145
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,579
um

1146
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,459
and then and then it's pretty much ready

1147
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:49,920
to rock and as we continue growing in it

1148
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,780
we keep testing the soil so we can add

1149
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,240
the top dressings of the minerals that

1150
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,940
we need as well as we water in

1151
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:59,519
biodynamic compost so the compost that

1152
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,559
we use is extremely rich and beneficial

1153
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,920
uh beneficial fungal networks and

1154
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:07,679
nematodes and beneficial bacteria

1155
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,079
and so we uh water in what's what we

1156
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,179
call a compost extract because we do not

1157
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,220
brew compost teas anymore we got away

1158
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:16,858
from that a few years ago

1159
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:19,980
um and the reason is because when you

1160
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:23,880
are brewing a tea for an extended period

1161
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:26,400
of time 12 or 24 hours it has quite a

1162
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,400
high chance of becoming anaerobic where

1163
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,460
it is without oxygen and when you put

1164
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,500
that into your soil you end up killing

1165
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:38,119
all of the beneficial bacteria and you

1166
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:41,159
end up in like uh you end up putting in

1167
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:43,200
anaerobic bacteria which wants to like

1168
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:45,960
destroy the soil

1169
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,259
yeah definitely some wise words there I

1170
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,059
myself have been guilty of using a uh a

1171
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,760
pump that was not sufficient and I come

1172
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:56,219
back to my tea and I've got cider so um

1173
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,079
I can I can relate to that one for sure

1174
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:01,379
I wanted to ask

1175
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,440
um do you use any microbial supplements

1176
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,480
So like um mycorrhizae trichoderma

1177
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,159
anything like that you specifically want

1178
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,559
to get in there

1179
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,960
when we transplant so whenever we

1180
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,719
transplant clones into like a small pot

1181
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,699
we we use a micro we use a powdered

1182
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:19,919
micro his eye and then we it's mixed

1183
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:21,779
with water and so we'll we'll coat the

1184
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,760
roots with some microhizae and then also

1185
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,180
anytime we transplant into our flowering

1186
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,460
beds uh we will put micro his eye on the

1187
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:31,379
like we'll just spray with the water

1188
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,699
solution so micro his eye on the root

1189
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,318
ball

1190
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:37,379
um to really help that Network grow

1191
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:39,179
that's amazing and I love that you uh

1192
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,519
mentioned you inoculate the soil with

1193
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:43,019
worms to begin with I think a lot of

1194
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,858
organic Growers can sort of understand

1195
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:50,519
that my question becomes I know that um

1196
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:52,679
Mountain Organics uses uh some wedding

1197
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:56,159
agents and I know that some wedding

1198
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:58,799
agents like saponins can be harmful to

1199
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,899
worms but I haven't tested it in reality

1200
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,760
I've only read the literature do you use

1201
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,960
any sort of wedding agents or saponins

1202
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,220
and do you feel like it has any effect

1203
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,920
on the worms or you think it's probably

1204
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:09,719
a bit overblown I mean not like we're

1205
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,639
not using stuff like directly in the

1206
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:15,419
soil we use the Mountain Organics

1207
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:18,118
Botanical tinctures that we foliar spray

1208
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,039
um but for the most part the worms when

1209
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:22,140
they're down in the soil protected by

1210
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:24,259
the mulch layer if you're not putting

1211
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:27,618
you know actually harmful stuff in there

1212
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:31,440
uh most everything stays pretty solid

1213
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:34,380
uh yeah yeah I would say for the most

1214
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,420
part the worms are pretty chill as long

1215
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,099
as you're not you know as long as the

1216
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,680
environment that they're in doesn't

1217
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:43,260
become hostile

1218
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:45,419
um they're they're pretty tough yeah

1219
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,700
brilliant brilliant and do you do

1220
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,260
anything to your water do you have to do

1221
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:50,519
anything to your water or you find it's

1222
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,520
pretty good where you're at and you can

1223
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:57,599
just use it straight so uh we do reverse

1224
00:48:53,519 --> 00:49:00,539
osmosis and that the main reason is one

1225
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,519
it gives us uh chlorine free water so

1226
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:05,519
that we're not harming the worms but

1227
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:08,519
also the problem with City water in in

1228
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,440
California Long Beach La is there's so

1229
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,179
much stuff in the water

1230
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,220
um mainly we've got like a ton of

1231
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:17,098
nitrates and chlorides and then

1232
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:20,759
chloramines as well but the problem with

1233
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:24,119
chloride is that the chloride will lock

1234
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,819
out nutrients and so by doing reverse

1235
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,760
osmosis we keep it the water stays at a

1236
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:33,358
neutral pH right around seven

1237
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,819
um and that allows us to really like

1238
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:39,179
when we water in our compost it's just

1239
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:41,219
plain RO water mixed with compost and we

1240
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:42,960
just water that into the soil and then

1241
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:46,500
the nutrients that we use which are from

1242
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:50,519
Organics alive and they create basically

1243
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:53,159
a dehydrated uh powder that is produced

1244
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:55,440
from a bacteria and so there's a

1245
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:58,279
specific bacteria in an enzyme and when

1246
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,740
they're together the byproduct

1247
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:05,040
uh is then dehydrated and the specific

1248
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:06,899
byproduct that they make is

1249
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,539
like depending on the bacteria and

1250
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:13,619
enzyme that they're using it creates an

1251
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:15,539
A and like an NPK ratio so they've got

1252
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:17,099
four different bacterias and enzymes

1253
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:19,019
that they use so and so they have four

1254
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:21,599
different products that all have a

1255
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:23,699
slightly different NPK ratio

1256
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,559
and like one is higher in nitrogen and

1257
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:26,818
then one of them is higher in potassium

1258
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:29,460
and then they've got one that's also

1259
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:32,159
higher in phosphorus and so

1260
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:34,260
those uh the Organics alive nutrients

1261
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:36,420
that we use along with some of the other

1262
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,760
stuff from like soil symbiotics uh all

1263
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:42,059
like all made for living soil having

1264
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,280
that neutral pH and by using RO water

1265
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:47,699
really helps uh stabilize everything and

1266
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:50,839
so we do not pH the water it it will

1267
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:55,279
change slightly down to like a like a

1268
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:58,739
6.36 between a 6.2 and 6.5

1269
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:01,380
uh based on like the the nutrients that

1270
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:04,019
we're putting in and so we lab test the

1271
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,400
nutrient water as well to actually check

1272
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:08,818
everything that's in it and all that

1273
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,440
yeah brilliant brilliant so throughout

1274
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:12,058
the cycle do you guys ever top dress

1275
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,619
with amendments or is it more done at

1276
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,680
the end of the cycle

1277
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:19,500
yeah so normally when when we transplant

1278
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:21,838
a room and also keep in mind when we

1279
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,579
when we do transplant a room it's not

1280
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,799
immediately flipped to flower we

1281
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:28,500
actually veg in the flower room for

1282
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,539
about two weeks so that the plants can

1283
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,858
really soak their Roots into the into

1284
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:35,039
the soil

1285
00:51:31,858 --> 00:51:38,039
and we will Top dress generally right

1286
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:41,460
when we transplant and then we will try

1287
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:44,880
to top dress again before week three of

1288
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,519
flower and so generally we'll have to do

1289
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,980
a soil test about two weeks after we top

1290
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:53,759
dress so that we can then have a new

1291
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:55,219
amendment made for love you know the

1292
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,440
first two weeks three weeks of flour

1293
00:51:55,219 --> 00:52:00,719
yeah okay so just to clarify it sounds

1294
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,818
like whenever you're adding nutrients

1295
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,039
you're basically going off tests and

1296
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:07,920
you're not really like winging it

1297
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:10,019
yeah so so we do a lot of soil analysis

1298
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,780
and we work with this group called

1299
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:15,119
cressive soil and they help us dial in

1300
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,839
our our actual amendments that we use

1301
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:21,240
and it's all based on uh like the soil

1302
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:24,119
core sample so we take core samples from

1303
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:26,578
each bed uh and like we blend it

1304
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:29,039
together for one room and so we send

1305
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:31,380
that out to a lab to Logan Labs here in

1306
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,960
uh they're in Ohio

1307
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:36,300
um in the United States and we uh and

1308
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,818
they analyze all the elemental content

1309
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,019
they check the pH of the soil and they

1310
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:42,358
look at

1311
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:44,579
all the available new like all the

1312
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:45,358
available minerals

1313
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:49,859
um

1314
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:51,838
and then from that test then we uh then

1315
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:54,420
that then it changes what we amend with

1316
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:57,480
or the quantities of what we amend with

1317
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:59,220
yeah okay interesting and out of a

1318
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,059
personal curiosity

1319
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:04,980
to what degree do you allow beneficial

1320
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:06,599
microbes and biology to exist because I

1321
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,280
know sometimes I look at my pots and I'm

1322
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,200
like man there's a lot of Rove beetles

1323
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,000
and hypoapsis just running around having

1324
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:13,799
a ball do you have to keep your eye on

1325
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,420
that or your you can just be comfortable

1326
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,480
letting it do its thing

1327
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:22,380
most of it stays in check so it's it's a

1328
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:25,380
combination of the soil biology as well

1329
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,838
as the elemental and mineral content so

1330
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,519
the compost extract really helps the

1331
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,019
soil biology

1332
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,300
um we also one of the people from

1333
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:34,619
cressive is a microbiologist and so we

1334
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,539
haven't done it in a while but we need

1335
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:39,240
to do start doing it more is we send

1336
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:41,219
soil samples to them and then she will

1337
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:44,039
look at it under a microscope and

1338
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:45,899
actually chart the bacteria like the all

1339
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:49,019
the colonies of fungal networks that are

1340
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:51,480
in the soil and from that they can tell

1341
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:54,239
us are these beneficial bacteria is this

1342
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,760
is this anaerobic bacteria

1343
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,500
um so we we need to start doing it more

1344
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,720
but that's how we check the health of

1345
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,519
that type of stuff is by doing uh by

1346
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,959
looking at the biological activity of

1347
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:08,579
the soil

1348
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:10,679
so so and as a general question do you

1349
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,359
you know like crop steering is like the

1350
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:14,759
trendiest word in the industry at the

1351
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:17,098
moment in my opinion and I'm wondering

1352
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,380
do any of those specific Protocols of

1353
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,000
how those soilless guys do crop searing

1354
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,559
does any of that translate to you like

1355
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,818
are you doing anything that would fall

1356
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,500
into that realm or do you think now

1357
00:54:23,818 --> 00:54:27,719
we're still sort of doing the the more

1358
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,980
organic thing yeah and like are you

1359
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:31,379
talking about guys that are all farming

1360
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:33,119
in Rockwall yeah yeah I guess what I'm

1361
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,800
referring to is like you know the way

1362
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,420
they do the temperatures and they're

1363
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,099
pumping certain nutrients at certain

1364
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,960
times like is any of that applicable

1365
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:40,980
like outside of the obvious difference

1366
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,179
in

1367
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:47,219
not so um when they're watering multiple

1368
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:50,460
times per day they're generally farming

1369
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:52,558
hydroponically in Rockwall and also for

1370
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:55,199
people that aren't aware when we say

1371
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:58,619
farming hydroponically we mean that

1372
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:02,098
someone is farming in a soilless media

1373
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:05,039
so they're farming without soil so cocoa

1374
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:06,900
is a hydroponic media and so it and so

1375
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:09,599
is Rockwall one of the most famous ones

1376
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:11,338
and uh because it's so light and easy to

1377
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,039
work with

1378
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:17,460
um but yeah we we do not water like that

1379
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,619
we also hand water but Rockwell cubes

1380
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,199
have to be watered four to five times a

1381
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:24,900
day because they dry out quickly as the

1382
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:26,519
plants get so big in them so

1383
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,318
um that's not something that we have to

1384
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:30,300
do with soil

1385
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:33,239
um and then there's also a blend of

1386
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,220
people farming in soil pots using

1387
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:38,279
hydroponic nutrients

1388
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:40,019
and what happens there is that they end

1389
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,660
up throwing away all their soil each

1390
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:44,400
round uh whereas we're able to reuse it

1391
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:47,460
and like in one of our rooms we're on

1392
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,980
our 13th cycle so we have harvested it

1393
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,900
12 times before

1394
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,880
that's amazing that's that's the dream

1395
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,500
right I um I did want to ask you because

1396
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,079
I saw that post

1397
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,760
do you think that theoretically soil can

1398
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,318
be used infinitely or do you think that

1399
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,940
like you know at a certain point it

1400
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:05,639
might be beneficial to get a new batch

1401
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:08,700
no I think that as long as we're

1402
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:10,799
amending it properly it will get better

1403
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:13,980
with time and the worms will keep

1404
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,440
working it but it's it's it's kind of a

1405
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:20,579
it's a strange thing because when you

1406
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:25,338
farm indoors there is there's not a long

1407
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:28,318
off cycle so a normal indoor Farm can

1408
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:30,960
realistically get four to five harvests

1409
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:33,239
a year if they time it all 60 days apart

1410
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,338
they can get five harvests a year

1411
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:37,318
because they're just replacing the

1412
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:39,719
growing media every time whereas in

1413
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:42,719
living soil we really can only max out

1414
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:45,838
at four harvests a year because we have

1415
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,818
to let the soil rest in between harvests

1416
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:49,858
and so

1417
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:51,480
it's it's one of the things that we just

1418
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:53,338
have to do in order to farm in living

1419
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,019
soil and to produce a higher quality

1420
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:58,679
product

1421
00:56:55,019 --> 00:57:01,679
um and with that if we keep amending it

1422
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:04,139
and working it it will get better but

1423
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:07,558
the the difference between farming

1424
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:09,779
indoors in living soil and like rotating

1425
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:11,880
your crops on like four acres of land

1426
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,200
where let's say you grow on this acre

1427
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,400
and then you rotate and you grow

1428
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:15,838
something else

1429
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,358
it's just different because we're

1430
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,739
growing the same you know we're growing

1431
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:21,960
different strains but we're farming

1432
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:24,779
cannabis in this same body of soil over

1433
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,420
and over again and so it will get better

1434
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:29,880
but we have to actively work every month

1435
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,039
to amend it and make sure otherwise it

1436
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,180
does get depleted and you'll see that in

1437
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:36,058
the runs

1438
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:37,818
yeah nice nice and in terms of when

1439
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:40,859
you're amending at the end of a cycle

1440
00:57:37,818 --> 00:57:42,838
what sort of nutrients are coming up

1441
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:44,578
like is it like it's it's mostly a lot

1442
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:46,078
of nitrogen and calcium we're trying to

1443
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:48,780
replace like what sort of things are you

1444
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,880
commonly yeah I mean it's everything so

1445
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:54,960
like we're replacing nitrogen calcium

1446
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,838
phosphorus uh uh like amino acids from

1447
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,400
all the trace minerals as well

1448
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,858
um so you've got like you know Iron

1449
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,700
copper other trace minerals

1450
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:05,098
um

1451
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:08,219
and so it's a combination of everything

1452
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:10,079
that that has to get replenished and

1453
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:11,219
that's we can tell that by testing the

1454
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,079
soil

1455
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:15,299
and the question I wanted to ask you

1456
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:18,119
most prominently in this whole interview

1457
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,640
was how do you deal with IPM I have to

1458
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:22,559
imagine this is one of the big issues on

1459
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:25,739
scale for you guys is your pest pressure

1460
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:28,200
what sort of your protocols for that

1461
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:31,078
yeah so I mean it's a combination of

1462
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:33,239
things uh first and foremost is keeping

1463
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:36,000
the facility clean

1464
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:38,459
um when you farm in living soil there

1465
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,559
are bugs and that's just part of the

1466
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,559
soil life in the soil food web is

1467
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,540
there's a balance of beneficial bugs in

1468
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,180
there and beneficial insects that are

1469
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:50,579
going to be in the soil and so

1470
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:53,460
when we've had fungus gnats in the past

1471
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:57,059
we've uh put in nematodes into the soil

1472
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:59,039
and we water in uh nematodes and those

1473
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:01,079
really help kind of clear stuff that we

1474
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,539
don't want we also use sticky fly traps

1475
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:05,519
everywhere and we spray them out in

1476
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:07,558
Organics Botanical tinctures in veg

1477
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:09,960
which is all like all organic

1478
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:11,280
ingredients in there and so the like the

1479
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,838
peppermint and stuff that's in the

1480
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,760
Botanical tincture that stuff really

1481
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:16,318
helps with the you know the Leafs and

1482
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,880
things like that

1483
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:20,338
um and like thrips and stuff that could

1484
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,858
like be living on the leaves but in

1485
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:24,358
terms of in the soil like if you look at

1486
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:25,739
our soil you'll see all sorts of stuff

1487
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:27,960
crawling around in there and there's

1488
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:29,578
beneficial we've got like beneficial

1489
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,000
mites in the soil that have kind of just

1490
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:34,980
appeared over time and uh all that stuff

1491
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,480
is fine and it just stays it stays in

1492
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,059
the soil and it's helping work the soil

1493
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,798
food web so like the biggest thing is

1494
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:42,359
yeah we use Mountain Organics Botanical

1495
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,719
tinctures

1496
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,639
um that would be like our main spray if

1497
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:49,379
you want to put that on the IPM list it

1498
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:51,000
would be like Organics Botanical

1499
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,740
tinctures

1500
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,139
um as well as just really trying to keep

1501
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:58,500
a clean environment the nematodes are a

1502
00:59:55,139 --> 01:00:00,358
huge IPM protocol as well

1503
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,338
um because those get watered in and they

1504
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:03,000
really help the soil out

1505
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:04,440
um

1506
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and yeah just really trying to keep

1507
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,179
everything healthy and just inspecting

1508
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,099
inspecting the plants regularly

1509
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:12,719
and if you were to get some sort let's

1510
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:15,359
just let's just hypothetically let's say

1511
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,039
you've got a my infestation is that

1512
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,659
something which with your facility you'd

1513
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:22,619
be able to handle reasonably easier or

1514
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:25,259
is it a bit of an uphill one I feel like

1515
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,660
I feel like with like spider mites you

1516
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:30,119
have to really be neg ENT

1517
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:31,259
to like for it to become a massive

1518
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:33,780
problem

1519
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,180
because like if you aren't inspecting

1520
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:39,599
the plants regularly and you don't see

1521
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:41,460
that the mites are starting to appear

1522
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,200
um it's like it's just not good in

1523
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:46,019
general like you might have pm on your

1524
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,219
buds at that point and uh and so I feel

1525
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:49,920
like

1526
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:52,919
anything that is bad like if you notice

1527
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,559
it you just gotta get it out right away

1528
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:58,200
um but if you're doing a spray regularly

1529
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,940
and like ours is all organic 100 but

1530
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:03,539
other other Farms that are spraying a

1531
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,980
pesticide every every week uh I mean

1532
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:08,279
that normally does it for them but like

1533
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:10,380
we're spraying only organic stuff and

1534
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,540
that seems to do it just as fine as well

1535
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,400
without harming the beneficial insects

1536
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:16,679
that are in the soil yeah a brilliant

1537
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,420
answer a brilliant answer so one of the

1538
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:20,159
uh patreon submitted questions we got

1539
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,380
from one of our listeners was they're

1540
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,239
big fans and they wanted to know you

1541
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:27,119
know do you still have the terpene

1542
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:29,578
content displayed on the packaging and

1543
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:32,400
do you think that that sort of education

1544
01:01:29,579 --> 01:01:36,240
is translating to the consumer

1545
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:39,539
yes yeah so we do put our terpene graph

1546
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:41,939
uh on the back of our box uh we've been

1547
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:44,279
using that now for a bit and people

1548
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:46,260
definitely like it I think uh

1549
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,180
I think it's still new like people

1550
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,040
looking at the Terps that are on it but

1551
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:52,318
it really helps you know it helps kind

1552
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:54,179
of catch the eye to our box

1553
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:56,460
um and it helps us display the strain

1554
01:01:54,179 --> 01:02:00,838
name as well

1555
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:03,059
um but it definitely it's taken time a

1556
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:05,759
lot of people still care about THC but

1557
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:07,859
thankfully for our brand not as many

1558
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,559
people care about the THC numbers it's

1559
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:13,380
really about the quality of the flower

1560
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,240
um but yeah it's hard to say like the

1561
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,160
knowledge of terpenes and the different

1562
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:19,500
terpenes and how they and how people

1563
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:22,019
like the different flavors it's still

1564
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,239
kind of evolving and uh people are being

1565
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:26,699
educated at the dispensaries you know

1566
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,338
what are terpenes like what are all

1567
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:31,798
these things listed on here and so it it

1568
01:02:29,338 --> 01:02:33,420
just takes time it's still it's getting

1569
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:36,420
there for sure a lot of people a lot of

1570
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,980
people are being educated about it

1571
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:40,019
um and I think us having it on the box

1572
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,298
it really helps show the consumer you

1573
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:44,219
know what what are the eight like

1574
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:46,079
prominent terpenes that are in this

1575
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,939
specific batch

1576
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,400
um and for like people that buy our

1577
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:52,500
flower regularly they'll see batch to

1578
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,440
batch the the terpenes change a little

1579
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:57,000
bit and uh you know we want it to be as

1580
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,679
consistent as possible but when you're

1581
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,139
farming something like this there's

1582
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:03,598
going to be a little bit of changes and

1583
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:05,578
so I think as people see that over time

1584
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,280
like you know they'll really start to

1585
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:12,119
get a good idea of hey I like this

1586
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,859
strain because it has this terpene in it

1587
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:15,720
um you know stuff like that but it's

1588
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:19,199
just it's kind of still a little early

1589
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:21,838
and not not a lot of people are you know

1590
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:24,779
yeah it's still early and it's just

1591
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:26,759
being educated still sure sure so

1592
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:30,359
another question we got from one of our

1593
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:33,420
patreon supporters was are you under any

1594
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:35,219
additional or more stringent testing in

1595
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:37,559
regards to like you know how we talk

1596
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:39,358
about like cfu units on the plant and

1597
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:41,160
because we use beneficial microbes that

1598
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,659
might play into it does that affect you

1599
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:44,699
any differently to anyone else or it's

1600
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:46,379
all pretty straightforward easy sailing

1601
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:49,558
no

1602
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:52,380
um yeah no everything gets tested the

1603
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:55,079
same in California and so there's like

1604
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:58,079
we're tested for a whole list of

1605
01:03:55,079 --> 01:04:01,200
pesticides uh and everything heavy

1606
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,880
metals the the like the the microbial

1607
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,199
test test for five different types of

1608
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,460
mold

1609
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:07,199
um and so

1610
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,519
like we've definitely gotten that

1611
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,379
question before because people will

1612
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:12,960
think we'll hear hey you're watering in

1613
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,539
all this biology is it not just on the

1614
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,818
buds but it's definitely not at all like

1615
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:22,199
what we put into the soil stays in the

1616
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:24,239
soil and it really the biggest thing in

1617
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:27,719
farming when you're farming cannabis

1618
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:30,000
indoors is the grow environment and the

1619
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:32,039
temperature and humidity that you keep

1620
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,079
in the room as well as the airflow

1621
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:36,599
that's what causes microbial

1622
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,480
contamination is when you don't have the

1623
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:43,019
right VPD where your your vapor pressure

1624
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:45,838
deficit is off and your temperatures and

1625
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:47,579
humidities are not correlated and you

1626
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:50,039
can get mold that's what causes all the

1627
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:52,019
issues yeah sure

1628
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:54,119
another listener is Keen to know what's

1629
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:55,980
the biggest challenge you've faced in

1630
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:58,740
running the facility in today's market

1631
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:01,079
and do you feel like people are becoming

1632
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:04,199
more interested in organic cannabis

1633
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:06,539
yeah I would say people definitely are

1634
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:09,779
becoming more interested

1635
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:12,000
um in you know living soil organically

1636
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,280
farmed things and I think with cannabis

1637
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,818
it just takes more time

1638
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:20,099
um but as people you know are demanding

1639
01:05:17,818 --> 01:05:22,019
more living soil products we hope to be

1640
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:24,480
positioned where we are one of the

1641
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:26,880
original living soil Brands

1642
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,619
um but it's just it's just tough I would

1643
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,019
say I mean I don't know what the

1644
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:32,940
toughest thing would be that we faced in

1645
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:35,119
today's market uh like

1646
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,440
everything is super tough just

1647
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:40,380
cultivating legally like I mean just

1648
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:43,980
building the facility the licensing like

1649
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:46,079
it it's all super tough and uh

1650
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:47,940
I think it's just like the toughest

1651
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:51,480
thing is just like having faith and

1652
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:55,200
staying persistent to actually execute

1653
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:56,699
on our plan because it takes months to

1654
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,919
cultivate this product and then we have

1655
01:05:56,699 --> 01:06:01,199
to dry it and trim it and package it and

1656
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,298
then sell it and sell it in a reasonably

1657
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,159
quick manner so that it's fresh and that

1658
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:08,460
it doesn't sit and you know become old

1659
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:10,379
and so it's just like

1660
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:13,318
I kind of describe our facility it's

1661
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:15,780
like having 10 like you know car engines

1662
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:18,480
running 24 7 that you always have to be

1663
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:21,240
keeping up with and it's like things can

1664
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,699
go wrong but it it's just like it's just

1665
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:26,159
there's a so many moving Parts with all

1666
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:28,679
the dehumidifiers and the ACs and the

1667
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:31,139
water and everything there's so many

1668
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:33,239
moving Parts it's uh

1669
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:36,358
it's definitely tough to run a legal

1670
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:38,519
cannabis business just overall yeah for

1671
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:40,500
sure for sure oh get heckled if I don't

1672
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:42,239
I want to ask you what's your favorite

1673
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,280
organic Amendment and your least

1674
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:45,779
favorite and I'll I'll give you mine

1675
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,280
quickly so you don't feel like you're

1676
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:49,380
getting thrown under the bus my favorite

1677
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,480
input is oyster shell flower I love it

1678
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,460
and uh my least favorite would be

1679
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,719
Dolomite because it screws your soil up

1680
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:56,699
long term

1681
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,159
oh interesting

1682
01:06:56,699 --> 01:07:01,078
yeah I mean

1683
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:02,818
I don't know like

1684
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:05,220
I don't know what my favorite Amendment

1685
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:07,798
would be I feel like because we amend

1686
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:11,519
with a lot of different things I I'm

1687
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:13,559
like uh I like I like the blend of

1688
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:15,900
everything that we use and it kind of

1689
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,119
it's kind of nice

1690
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:21,240
um well oyster shell is very nice it's a

1691
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:22,619
nice you know like soft powder

1692
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:26,219
um definitely nice he was great you know

1693
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:29,940
this this the soil likes it um I like

1694
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:31,679
gypsum also gypsum's good to use

1695
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:33,659
um

1696
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:36,118
I don't know what I I mean I don't

1697
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:38,759
really like neem I'm not we're not we're

1698
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:41,220
not big on neem and uh like neem cake

1699
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:45,240
and stuff like that we don't use it neem

1700
01:07:41,219 --> 01:07:47,699
can sometimes harm the biology but like

1701
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:49,379
like some products have Neiman a little

1702
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:51,239
bit in it and that's totally fine but we

1703
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,980
don't we try not to put a ton of neem

1704
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:54,838
into the soil or anything like we don't

1705
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:57,000
really put any

1706
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:58,679
um and like like neem seed meal I didn't

1707
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,760
really I haven't liked using neem seed

1708
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:03,419
meal before

1709
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,740
uh yeah it's not my favorite yeah no

1710
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,659
that's a good answer I think a lot of

1711
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:08,338
people including myself use a lot of

1712
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:09,659
names so that that's cool to hear that

1713
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:11,699
there's another side to the coin and

1714
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:13,318
I've certainly heard and read about some

1715
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:15,298
of those negative things about neem so

1716
01:08:13,318 --> 01:08:18,179
everyone go read into it a bit more for

1717
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:19,880
sure so final question before we do the

1718
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:22,798
quick five at the end

1719
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:26,039
do you care about the whole so-called

1720
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:27,060
Clean Smoke white ash debate or like do

1721
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:28,560
you think that because you're coming

1722
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:30,480
from this organic background it's like

1723
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,060
it's sort of a bit irrelevant

1724
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:34,139
yeah that's a good it's a good question

1725
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:37,980
um

1726
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:40,140
so there's two sides to it so when you

1727
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:42,419
farm high oh okay let me press if it

1728
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:44,819
preface it with a living soil and how we

1729
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:47,699
approach it so when you are farming in

1730
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:50,940
living soil it's not as big of a deal

1731
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:53,639
and it's not a clear indicator that this

1732
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:57,479
is good or this is not but with that

1733
01:08:53,640 --> 01:09:01,319
said uh when you do farm in living soil

1734
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:04,198
and the plant ripens at the right rate

1735
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,580
and is cut when it's mature and ready to

1736
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:09,358
be harvested

1737
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:10,920
the ash should be fairly white even if

1738
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,539
it's mixed a little bit kind of salt and

1739
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,640
pepper looking it should have a nice

1740
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:17,640
looking Ash and it should hold together

1741
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:22,140
well and part of that comes with the

1742
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:24,900
plant dying appropriately and being at

1743
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:27,480
the end of its life and when the soil is

1744
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:29,818
healthy the plant will ripen on its own

1745
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:33,178
now we all we will water with plain

1746
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:36,120
water for the last you know week usually

1747
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:39,239
um so when we're in living soil it's not

1748
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:42,000
as big of a deal because there's still

1749
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:44,159
nutrients in our soil 100 we're not

1750
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,500
flushing out all the nutrients by any

1751
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:50,099
means there's still a lot of nutrient

1752
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:52,679
content in the soil but the plant is

1753
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,800
ripening on its own and ready to be

1754
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:58,020
harvested and when that is the case it

1755
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,760
should have a good Ash and if it's dried

1756
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,860
properly if everything else is done

1757
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,079
properly it should have a nice looking

1758
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:09,500
Ash now on the flip side when you farm

1759
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:12,659
hydroponically the reason that white ash

1760
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:17,779
like the reason in cannabis why white

1761
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:20,399
ash is uh preferred is because

1762
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:22,738
hydroponic farming is what kind of

1763
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:24,960
jump-started cannabis into the culture

1764
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:27,479
that it is and so when you farm

1765
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,039
hydroponically you have to flush out the

1766
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:30,899
nutrients because you don't want to

1767
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,158
smoke the synthetic nutrients that

1768
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:33,960
you're feeding

1769
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:37,379
and so

1770
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:39,420
in hydroponic farming a white ash can

1771
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:41,819
sometimes indicate that this has been

1772
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,899
flushed better than let's say if it's

1773
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:44,939
darker

1774
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:47,099
so that's the difference on the White

1775
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:49,500
Ash debate when you farm hydroponically

1776
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:52,199
versus when you farm in living soil

1777
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:54,119
I love it I love it everyone should uh

1778
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:56,359
should just growing living soil and then

1779
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:59,698
it's not a big issue right

1780
01:10:56,359 --> 01:11:01,920
exactly exactly so that brings us on to

1781
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:04,799
our tail end and what we call our final

1782
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,600
five so first question I want to ask you

1783
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,219
what is the single most memorable

1784
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,539
experience you've had with cannabis so

1785
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:11,340
it doesn't necessarily need to be like

1786
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:13,019
the most potent hit but just like you

1787
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:14,039
know maybe you're at the creek and you

1788
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,600
went for a swim and just like everything

1789
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:18,719
was just hitting right like what's the

1790
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,400
most memorable thing for you

1791
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,198
oh

1792
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:25,198
um

1793
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:26,698
I don't know probably like I'm just like

1794
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:28,019
tracing through my head like racing

1795
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:31,859
through my brain right now thinking

1796
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:36,060
about that and I popped to when I

1797
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:38,519
harvested my first flower successfully

1798
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:40,679
um because before and it was like three

1799
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,719
clones that I had grown outside in San

1800
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:45,840
Diego that I got from clone because

1801
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:49,260
before that I grew probably 15 or 17

1802
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:51,539
plants and they all died like nothing

1803
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:54,060
came out of it there was no flower there

1804
01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:55,979
was nothing and then I finally after a

1805
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:59,039
summer successfully harvested these

1806
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:01,619
clones and uh that's probably one of the

1807
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,600
most memorable things of like actually

1808
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:06,658
being able to harvest it I dried it it

1809
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:10,860
smoked it was awesome it was a sfv cut

1810
01:12:06,658 --> 01:12:12,960
and uh it smoked really nice

1811
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:16,139
um and that kind of was like wow like

1812
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,460
you can grow this plant and then if you

1813
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:19,619
do everything right you can then smoke

1814
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:21,539
it and it was like I always knew like I

1815
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:23,399
love smoking weed I want to grow this

1816
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:27,060
because I don't I want to be able to

1817
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:28,500
produce it for myself and uh that was a

1818
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,780
huge point for me to actually

1819
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:34,020
successfully Harvest a plant after

1820
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:35,819
failing like literally 17 times

1821
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,320
yeah yeah I love that that's cool

1822
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:39,779
there's so many aspects like the

1823
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:41,579
realization of self-reliance is there

1824
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:42,960
and I just as a quick super quick

1825
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:45,119
follow-up do you think the fact you

1826
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,560
harvested an sfv might have been the

1827
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,559
stepping stone for why you love gas

1828
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,520
not just that like I also worked at I

1829
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:56,460
ran the

1830
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,739
we only sold OG and so I was just I've

1831
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:02,939
been brought up on OG and like some of

1832
01:12:58,738 --> 01:13:04,979
the best ogs in LA and uh

1833
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:07,919
yeah I don't know it's definitely what I

1834
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:09,119
like to smoke I think it's uh I think a

1835
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,399
lot like

1836
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,439
for like heavy heavy smokers a lot of

1837
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:16,139
heavy smokers like like those kind of

1838
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,299
like deeper strains but I also love

1839
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:20,100
smoking fruity stuff too

1840
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:23,039
um it's just you know it it's all a

1841
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,780
different time oh yeah don't don't you

1842
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:26,579
worry I'm gonna when I hang up this call

1843
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:29,639
I'm gonna smoke some biscotti pancakes

1844
01:13:26,579 --> 01:13:31,738
it's very gassy so on the other end of

1845
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,420
the spectrum quickly what's a strain

1846
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:35,099
where like everyone was hyping it up

1847
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,480
when it came out and you were super Keen

1848
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:39,060
to try it and then when you finally

1849
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:43,259
tried it you were like oh is that it

1850
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:45,380
oh that's a good question let me think

1851
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,380
um

1852
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:51,238
I don't know I mean I try to just smoke

1853
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:54,960
like the like

1854
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:57,779
fire ass stuff and so like it's

1855
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,760
it's uh it's tough like I've been

1856
01:13:57,779 --> 01:14:01,979
smoking what we grow for a while but let

1857
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,579
me think

1858
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:07,559
they're a hyped up strain that I've like

1859
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:09,059
tried that I didn't like

1860
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:11,880
um I don't know I don't want to put any

1861
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:13,739
brands on blast but there's some of the

1862
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,140
top brands that have been grow like some

1863
01:14:13,738 --> 01:14:17,639
of their stuff's been falling off and

1864
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,140
it's just like

1865
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,780
but that's what we were talking about

1866
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:24,659
back to the scale is like you just

1867
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:26,819
you can't scale with the quality and so

1868
01:14:24,658 --> 01:14:28,619
it's like there's been like some of the

1869
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:31,559
top top brands that that you can think

1870
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:33,599
of uh their batches just aren't quite

1871
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,580
there anymore and so it's like stuff

1872
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,960
that I might have wanted to try of the

1873
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:38,579
strains that they were growing three

1874
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,640
years ago I don't even want to try

1875
01:14:38,579 --> 01:14:43,800
anymore because it's just like you know

1876
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,600
that the quality is not there

1877
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,699
yeah so I'd say it's it's more stuff

1878
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,199
like that I think

1879
01:14:47,698 --> 01:14:50,819
I'm trying to think there's like I mean

1880
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:52,079
jungle boys grow a ton of strain so

1881
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,420
they'll even admit they've got some

1882
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:57,059
batches that aren't the best

1883
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,619
um but I feel like when I uh all the

1884
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,360
stuff I used to pick up before we were

1885
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:03,359
cultivating here like I was you know I'm

1886
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:05,759
very particular like super particular

1887
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,319
and so like I feel like even if I picked

1888
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,239
a bad one it's still kind of it's like

1889
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:11,698
all right you know

1890
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,919
um oh you know what I I there's one

1891
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:15,599
strain I remember that I was before like

1892
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,699
dispensary time it was called snow cap

1893
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,260
and I thought it was gonna be uh I

1894
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:21,599
thought it was gonna be great but it was

1895
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,619
just like a terrible representation of

1896
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,380
it like

1897
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:27,479
it was just like it smelled like hey I

1898
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:29,400
mean it was terrible like and the guy

1899
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:32,399
was hyping it up and it was just like

1900
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:34,339
man this what am I gonna do with this

1901
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,658
like

1902
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:39,119
yeah that's one I could remember that

1903
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:41,719
was like oh this is not I thought this

1904
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:41,719
was gonna be great

1905
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:46,198
yeah I remember having some snow cap a

1906
01:15:44,819 --> 01:15:48,479
long time ago that it wasn't

1907
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:51,599
particularly memorable so there you go I

1908
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,979
love that okay so uh next question oh

1909
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,120
yeah by the way I want to say it because

1910
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:56,158
you won't when I was in the states

1911
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:59,039
recently I had a lot of good connected

1912
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:02,759
Cali stuff but high rise from connected

1913
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:04,560
California was [ __ ] yeah other but but

1914
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,079
they also had some great stuff their

1915
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,420
geline was sick yeah exactly and it's

1916
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:12,238
it's that's exactly my point like they

1917
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:15,800
they've got great genetics but they just

1918
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:18,658
are that the scale is losing the quality

1919
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,219
definitely definitely so next quick fire

1920
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:21,779
one is I'm gonna drop you off on a

1921
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:23,698
desert island and you can take three

1922
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:25,079
strains with you they can be clones or

1923
01:16:23,698 --> 01:16:26,519
they could be seeds if you want to maybe

1924
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:27,779
do some breeding what are you gonna take

1925
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,300
with you

1926
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:31,759
oh that's tough

1927
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:35,159
um

1928
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,940
definitely like the best OG cut that you

1929
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:37,500
got

1930
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:39,960
uh

1931
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:41,760
uh probably yeah like Josh D like one of

1932
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,800
one of his cuts of OG whatever the best

1933
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,199
Kush that they have right there

1934
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,199
uh and then

1935
01:16:46,198 --> 01:16:50,939
I really do like gelato 41 a lot like

1936
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:53,219
it's fire

1937
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:56,339
um that strain is dank

1938
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:58,560
so I I would say the best OG and then

1939
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:00,480
gelato 41

1940
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,940
and then

1941
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:05,759
I need a I need like a sativa strain too

1942
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:07,619
for the desert island so there's a

1943
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,679
strain that I haven't been able to get

1944
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:14,579
in a long time uh called Alaskan Thunder

1945
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:17,359
[ __ ] and that strain is like the

1946
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:21,420
craziest sativa that you've ever smoked

1947
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:23,279
and I would love to have that strain

1948
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:25,260
yeah those three

1949
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:27,420
that's some good picks there I like that

1950
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:31,380
and I agree you can throw the hate you

1951
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:34,140
want at me but gelato 41 slaps oh yeah

1952
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:35,520
so next one this one's a little Varian a

1953
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,079
second last one it's a variant from what

1954
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,960
we normally do I'm gonna give you a time

1955
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:43,559
machine you can go anywhere you know in

1956
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:46,079
history and around the world and when

1957
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,940
you're there you're going to collect a

1958
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,679
big bag of humus

1959
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:52,158
where do you want to get humus from

1960
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:54,899
throughout history

1961
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:57,359
uh I don't know I feel like

1962
01:17:54,899 --> 01:18:00,238
I'd have to go like

1963
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:02,219
hundreds of years back like maybe like a

1964
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:05,779
few thousand years to get some like real

1965
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:09,359
nice like untouched like volcanic soil

1966
01:18:05,779 --> 01:18:10,380
that hasn't been tainted with pesticides

1967
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:13,799
and stuff

1968
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:16,260
yeah like I like at least you know 2 000

1969
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,779
years probably yeah man let's get let's

1970
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:19,560
get that Nazareth Jesus OG going for

1971
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:22,920
real

1972
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:24,420
exactly yeah so I mean yeah something

1973
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,340
like that I don't know so there's still

1974
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:27,420
like I don't even know that's a good

1975
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,039
answer that's a good answer now I'll

1976
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:30,600
give you the the final question we

1977
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:31,800
always ask people so same thing I'm

1978
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,060
going to give you a time machine you can

1979
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,380
go back in time you can do whatever you

1980
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,900
want but this time you're going to

1981
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,819
collect some seeds or a cutting where

1982
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:42,539
are you gonna go what are you gonna get

1983
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:45,479
oh where would I go hmm I don't know I

1984
01:18:42,539 --> 01:18:49,319
mean uh I would go

1985
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:53,218
back to the 90s and get a cut of OG with

1986
01:18:49,319 --> 01:18:56,039
like the original Kush crew and uh

1987
01:18:53,219 --> 01:18:59,279
because that's like that's that's like

1988
01:18:56,039 --> 01:19:02,158
one of the like Kush at that time was

1989
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:04,019
like the top of the market

1990
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:06,059
um yeah so I would get like a real cut

1991
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:08,820
of OG Kush

1992
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:10,920
yeah so I think that just about brings

1993
01:19:08,819 --> 01:19:12,658
us to the end of it for today were there

1994

01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,359
um and be consistent with it as well and

2005
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:38,639
I think that's the toughest thing is

2006
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:41,759
just being consistent batch after batch

2007
