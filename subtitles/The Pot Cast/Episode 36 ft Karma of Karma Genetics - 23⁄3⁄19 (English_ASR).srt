36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,400
today

37
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,640
hello

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,719
good to be here

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,599
so the first thing i wanted to ask you

40
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,239
what are you currently smoking on

41
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,679
um i'm smoking on some sour mamba at the

42
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,118
moment

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,118
ah what's that one again

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
that's a

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,759
mamba cut

46
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,199
times a sour diesel

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,879
okay and

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
how do you find that one more sativa

49
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:59,039
more indica

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,600
and this fino is a bit more on this sour

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,439
side but it's it's like typical hybrid

52
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,519
weed

53
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,279
yeah i wouldn't call it sativa even

54
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,239
though it flowers a bit longer it's a

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,080
bit looser in butt structure

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,520
okay and overall would you describe

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
yourself as more of an indica or a

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,120
sativa guy

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
no i really smoke

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,640
the whole spectrum

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,080
but um

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,839
like

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
depends on what i'm doing

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,598
like for every occasion yeah there is

65
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,479
like a different weed

66
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,799
um

67
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,280
so i i do like smoked sativas i smoke

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,319
sativas more during the day or when i'm

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,560
um going into nature

70
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,679
when i'm doing uh artwork things like

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,080
that then i like smoking sativas um

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,560
in the end of the day in the evenings

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,200
and stuff yeah then i'm uh i'm all about

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,519
ogs and heavy indicas

75
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,399
yes i can very much relate on that point

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,159
so

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,560
take us back what was your first

78
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,158
experience with cannabis

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,199
um

80
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,840
well um well let me start off with uh um

81
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:08,719
i'm dutch

82
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:11,759
um i was born in the 70s um

83
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:15,280
so yeah when i was like pretty young um

84
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,359
it was pretty accepted in holland

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,280
so i smoked my first joint when i was

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,400
like 13.

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,598
it was moroccan hashish ah hell yeah

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,360
because the

89
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,238
in those days there wasn't even that

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
much wheat here yet even

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,480
there was like jamaican

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,640
and thai weed

93
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,039
a little bit of the first dutch type

94
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,759
growing weed yeah which was

95
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,199
not that impressive to be honest

96
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,439
um

97
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,199
so yeah most people smoke moroccan hash

98
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,799
in those days so

99
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,318
yeah i got a little piece of moroccan

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
hash and

101
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,919
it's right smoking it

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,640
and was it in a joint or just through

103
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,318
like a pipe or something

104
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,919
no it was in a joint with um

105
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:06,798
uh dutch tobacco and uh

106
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,958
oh yeah it was it wasn't that good to be

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
honest either yeah i had to cough a lot

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,120
because i didn't i never smoked anything

109
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,959
before that

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,239
so did you get high the first time you

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,319
smoked

112
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,918
yeah you know i didn't get high

113
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,759
i did get high

114
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,079
but i was really nauseous as well i

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,319
think from smoking tobacco first time

116
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,800
yeah definitely it's it's interesting

117
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,439
how interlinked tobacco and hash are

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,439
within the netherlands scene is that a

119
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,800
trend you continued to do as you kept

120
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,199
smoking

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,600
uh no i smoke my wheat pure now these

122
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,160
days i still smoke um

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,240
like a moroccan and nepalese hashish i

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,800
do smoke dead with tobacco

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,960
i smell wheat pure because tobacco like

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,879
[ __ ] it ruins the whole flavor of it

127
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,959
i think yeah um

128
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,800
so i always smoke weed pure

129
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,560
i smoke mostly bongs

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,600
not so much

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
weed in

132
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,160
in in joints

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,759
ah you're a man after my own heart we

134
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,840
need to have a session hitting all the

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,280
points that i do

136
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,000
so

137
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,000
so what i found very interesting is my

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,680
first ever weed experience i think it

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,720
was

140
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,319
2009 2010 i went to holland and i tried

141
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
weed and this was before i was really

142
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,360
into weeds seriously so

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
i

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,479
well it was just when i was starting so

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,400
i don't remember too much like sadly you

146
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,918
know i didn't try all the different

147
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,000
strains all that type of thing but i

148
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,038
remember trying the hash and i tried it

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,079
with tobacco and there's this undeniable

150
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,240
actually i say kind of romance within

151
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,279
like when you mix tobacco and hash and

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,360
though i'm pretty strictly anti-tobacco

153
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,758
i'll i'll ge i'll let people off if

154
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,629
they're smoking hash with tobacco why do

155
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,960
you think it blends together so well

156
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:56,319
[Music]

157
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,399
in the in the dutch culture yeah um

158
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,280
the first hashish that came here came

159
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,839
from

160
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,599
morocco and nepal and afghanistan

161
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,638
there they all smoke it with tobacco

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
yeah

163
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,639
so

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,199
i think that has to do with it what

165
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,519
started it off yeah um

166
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,520
these days people here they're

167
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,959
it's just how they're used to it as well

168
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,918
yeah so there's not much people that

169
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,439
smoke pure wheat here even

170
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,599
most people here still smoke with

171
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,478
tobacco and that counts for a big part

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,479
of europe as well

173
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,120
last years it starts to change a little

174
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,120
bit but

175
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,520
yeah okay

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,560
so i mean bodhi raised this point many

177
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,680
many moons ago the the art of you know

178
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,918
mixing

179
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,918
or blending different herbs together

180
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,159
hasn't really been explored too much

181
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,918
especially outside of amsterdam if you

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
rule out hash do you think there's

183
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,758
something more there that we could learn

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,199
kind of in the way that concentrates

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,680
evolved or do you think it's kind of

186
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,680
limited

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,439
i definitely think

188
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,598
different herbs in combination with

189
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,959
cannabis can give different effects

190
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,478
because um

191
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,359
i mean

192
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,758
the tobacco even when you smoke weed

193
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,479
with tobacco yeah it makes feel

194
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,038
you get a very different high than when

195
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,680
you smoke wheat pure yeah it's very

196
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,399
different like the moroccans used to say

197
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
that

198
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,120
by if you wouldn't mix tobacco with it

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,079
yeah you would fly away yeah they say

200
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,959
that it keeps you on the earth

201
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,279
i like that that's a cool idea

202
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,478
so what type of hash is your favorite

203
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,359
then

204
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,879
um

205
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,800
i would prefer like high quality

206
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,279
nepalese

207
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
but that's very rare these days uh also

208
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,839
here

209
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,800
um

210
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:54,959
but moroccan i still smoke mostly uh

211
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,960
moroccan um i'm very picky though so

212
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,799
from what's here i probably can only

213
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,638
smoke like the f top five percent

214
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
yeah no i think a lot of people can

215
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,120
relate to that point even if it just

216
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,519
came down to flower but i guess i'd love

217
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,199
to know from you what are your top picks

218
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,439
for the coffee shops in amsterdam or do

219
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,720
you just not even go to them

220
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,478
um these days i almost don't go to them

221
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,960
anymore but

222
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,000
for good hashies

223
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,519
and

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,680
nice hazes

225
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,240
most of the time

226
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,598
it's the old damn crane on the hanbok

227
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,519
strat

228
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,200
that's a great coffee shop yeah very

229
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,879
fair price

230
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
the names are real

231
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,080
you get really what's [ __ ] on the

232
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,199
menu

233
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,440
um

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
who else um if you like all the modern

235
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,480
stuff um one of my young friends he does

236
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,480
the plug he has all the modern

237
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
new stuff that all the

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,759
younger people like

239
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,720
um

240
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,799
well good voyager voyagers really really

241
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,800
nice people they have a smaller menu but

242
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,799
it's it's always nice they care a lot

243
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,958
for what they put on

244
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,559
those three shops are probably

245
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,799
good ones to visit if you go to

246
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,359
amsterdam at the moment

247
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,519
yeah solid advice i mean the uh i can

248
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,320
never say it right is it the damp king

249
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,639
damp damp king whatever i'll just

250
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,760
probably cut cut and paste your one in

251
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,120
it's the

252
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,360
dump king

253
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,080
that's what they say in dutch yeah okay

254
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,120
yeah i hear about that all the time

255
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,600
it's a smoke circle it's kind of if you

256
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,480
translate it yeah

257
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,560
ah okay yeah it makes sense makes sense

258
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,240
how do you think they they became like

259
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,599
the cream of the crop because everyone

260
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,759
talks about them

261
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,639
well they always been

262
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,519
very good yeah um

263
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,919
and now a friend of mine runs

264
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,399
uh the old dank ring and he's just a guy

265
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,360
that cares a lot about all of it yeah

266
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,919
he cares a lot about of it um he's been

267
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
in it really long yeah um

268
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,759
he has

269
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,719
a great network he just he's very honest

270
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,720
and he cares about it yeah so um

271
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,440
he's willing to pay a bit more when it's

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,440
really good um

273
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,720
and he just he's just a fair

274
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,480
a fair guy yeah um which for a lot of

275
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
the amsterdam coffee shops they're so

276
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,720
commercial now yeah um

277
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,200
so they'll put on names um

278
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,759
all kinds of stuff yeah um

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,440
this is still like an old style fair

280
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,120
honest

281
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,519
menu and and also um the good people

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,879
running it yeah

283
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,560
yeah that's really good to hear that

284
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,200
there are a few shops who are still

285
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,799
embodying those good traits so

286
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
i'd love if you could just take me back

287
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,199
for a minute what was it like through

288
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,360
you know kind of that renaissance of the

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,920
cannabis scene probably you know late

290
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,759
80s early 90s when all of the big dutch

291
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,439
companies were still in existence like

292
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,439
you know neville was kind of there doing

293
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
his thing and all the rest were you a

294
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,519
part of the scene back then

295
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,679
now i started um growing in the late 80s

296
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,360
early 90s yeah

297
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,759
and those first times were just like a

298
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,800
few plants outdoor and stuff i was still

299
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:16,159
pretty young at that time

300
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:19,599
but from the 95 i really

301
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:22,000
really started to kick it in yeah um

302
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,560
well the fun thing is like these days

303
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,399
here it's not as free as it used to be

304
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,399
um i remember back in the day i could

305
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,240
have like cannabis plants in the front

306
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,839
of my house yeah and i was living behind

307
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,200
the police station and there was never a

308
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,440
problem

309
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,399
um now you can't do anything like that

310
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
yeah

311
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,679
that's definitely not possible

312
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,919
yeah okay

313
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,079
and so was there like good quality

314
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,039
genetics floating around at that time or

315
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,439
it was still a bit limited

316
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:56,000
no i think that um

317
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,880
until early 2000s um there was quite a

318
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,240
lot of diversity yeah and that's because

319
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,600
um there was a lot of small growers

320
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,639
um

321
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,560
uh

322
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,560
like um

323
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,559
moms

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,480
uh people that only live in like a small

325
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,799
house do a little bedroom yeah so you

326
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,000
get a lot of people that are like home

327
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,679
growers that do like small rooms um so

328
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,679
you have a lot of diversity and also a

329
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,359
lot of quality yeah

330
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,759
then they changed the rule here that

331
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,480
they could kick you out of your house

332
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:34,078
and then all these small ones kind of

333
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,720
stopped yeah which was in early 2000s

334
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,039
um and that really changed it yeah so i

335
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,120
think there was more diversity um before

336
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,399
2005 than after then it started to go

337
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,159
down

338
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
and what were the first strains that you

339
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,240
were growing

340
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
my first things were

341
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,399
viking

342
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,799
early girl

343
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,559
silver pearl

344
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,319
those were some of the first things i

345
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,399
grew

346
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,639
it's very interesting that you mentioned

347
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,720
viking because that's one which gets

348
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,440
thrown around a bit in australia is one

349
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,000
of the possible strains that's used for

350
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,600
the commercial cash cropping scene did

351
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,720
you get the impression that that's what

352
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
the strain really was

353
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,480
that was a

354
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
like a

355
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,600
pretty early finishing um outdoor

356
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,159
variety um

357
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,360
it was very wild so it's very it's very

358
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,919
leafy here um but it was very strong it

359
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,320
made it makes huge buds as well yeah it

360
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,958
did yield a lot and we grew it outdoor

361
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
that's what it was for here here at the

362
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,799
time

363
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,720
yeah i got it as a clone

364
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,000
interesting and so were clones passed

365
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,920
around rather freely back at that time

366
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,159
yeah it was it was even legal so you

367
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,159
even had ads in the newspaper and stuff

368
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,799
and so do you think that this may have

369
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,439
kind of led to people getting

370
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,639
questionable clients those days it was

371
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
not

372
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,519
that commercial

373
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,759
um

374
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,000
and it was still everybody that ran it

375
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,679
and they're like old hippies and the

376
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,159
hippie people and

377
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,719
you know so it was very different type

378
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:21,519
of scene in those days as well so no it

379
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,759
was all positive yeah

380
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,078
it was all positive

381
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,879
wow what a different world back then and

382
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,679
so

383
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:33,278
when was kind of the first time you

384
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,719
started to look at the idea of breeding

385
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,240
um

386
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,959
i

387
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,480
that was when i was working

388
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,679
in a coffee shop for a couple of years

389
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,959
and

390
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:49,439
the things you get offered um to buy

391
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,518
because that was my job i used to

392
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
um like stand at the back door as they

393
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,320
call it in holland

394
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,399
uh

395
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,519
well there wasn't that much diversity

396
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,799
yeah

397
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,240
um so and that that was because the grow

398
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,958
shops which is where the clones were

399
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,720
sold in those days yeah they only had

400
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,719
like two or three different things you

401
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,879
could pick from yeah so everybody in

402
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,199
that neighborhood would grow only those

403
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,958
two or three things

404
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,439
almost no one grow the dutch people

405
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,599
didn't grow with seeds a lot yeah

406
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,000
they all you they're so so spoiled by

407
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
having those clones from early on and

408
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,440
just getting them at the shop where they

409
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,198
needed to buy their light and everything

410
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,800
else as well yeah

411
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,278
so um

412
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,359
yeah so that's when i started to

413
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,838
like grow from seed and after i grew

414
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,639
from seeds then it went really fast yeah

415
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,720
then it went really fast

416
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,480
yeah definitely okay and so do you think

417
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,360
that having an environment where clones

418
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,039
are freely available does hamper people

419
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,639
popping new seeds and finding new

420
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,719
genetics and it kind of bottlenecks

421
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,440
things

422
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,320
it definitely makes that less seeds are

423
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
popped yeah so um

424
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,360
yeah

425
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,240
of course people are

426
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,399
lazy i guess yeah or they think it's

427
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,560
it's easier or they're scared for

428
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,519
germany if people never

429
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,679
grown from seed um there's a bit scared

430
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,440
for it as well yeah i can see that with

431
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,198
some of the dutch people that i know

432
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,800
people that growing for

433
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,319
many years and they've never germ to

434
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,159
seed

435
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,160
they're just scared of it

436
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,759
they're like oh no i heard about you can

437
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:28,319
get a mail or um you can get a

438
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,959
hermie yeah and then everything can be

439
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,560
full of seeds yeah so they're scared

440
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,439
yeah um

441
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,359
which

442
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,519
they should not be to be honest even

443
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,839
though i always advise people if they do

444
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,440
selections to do it separately from your

445
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,959
cash crops and

446
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,040
your income type things so

447
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,919
yeah i mean it raises an interesting

448
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,360
point

449
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,799
how do you feel about people who

450
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,519
live in say

451
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:58,159
countries where cultivation is illegal

452
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,240
and they they don't want to pop new

453
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,159
seeds because they're too dependent on

454
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,000
the money for their livelihood i guess

455
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,359
in general do you feel like people

456
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,038
should try to keep an external job to

457
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,438
cannabis if they live in an illegal

458
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,078
country so that they have the freedom to

459
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,279
experiment with their grow or it's okay

460
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,519
to be locked into that production mode

461
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,119
i think

462
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:25,279
it's okay to be

463
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:28,719
locked into a production mode but um

464
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,480
i mean if you can spare one light yeah

465
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,960
that's all it takes yeah you can just

466
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,640
pop seats under even in a little tent

467
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
yeah with just one large you can just

468
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
keep on popping seeds there in the

469
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,400
corner

470
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,558
um

471
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
if you only have like one light yeah

472
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,599
then

473
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,279
you're not the type that will keep moms

474
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,918
but if you like diversity and it's for

475
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,359
your own smoke oh then i would always go

476
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,038
from syria

477
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,439
i would just keep on popping seeds and

478
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,519
you get a lot of diversity you see all

479
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,400
different kind of things because

480
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,879
cannabis is so wide yeah

481
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,360
most of us have not seen a lot of things

482
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,000
that are there yeah

483
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,159
yeah most certainly

484
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,038
so if we just loop back to yourself

485
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,880
again

486
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,519
what was the first ever cross you made

487
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,440
when you did start breeding

488
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,798
uh my first crosses were um with uh

489
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,240
jackhammer

490
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,960
um

491
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
sage

492
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,840
those are some of the

493
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,080
earlier things jack harry is what i

494
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,240
started with yeah that's what i started

495
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,199
to play with and that's just

496
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,880
um

497
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,120
with regular seats from sansi um

498
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,320
and just starting to incross them and

499
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,119
stuff not even

500
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,678
crossing them out to anything else just

501
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,399
keep making seas every generation yeah

502
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,600
and just playing around and stuff yeah i

503
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,440
was just

504
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,519
learning it myself

505
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,919
um

506
00:18:53,519 --> 00:19:00,639
yeah that's that was probably the first

507
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,880
okay and and were you aware of

508
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,559
kind of how good the genetics around you

509
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
were like i'm assuming you know it's

510
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,599
kind of 95 you had access to scentsy

511
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,678
stock this is often regarded as kind of

512
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,879
the golden period

513
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,840
did you feel that way at the time

514
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,919
um well i think at the time all i knew

515
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,079
is that that was the standard

516
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
so

517
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,240
at that time i didn't think

518
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,240
i mean i popped other things that i i

519
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,759
didn't like as well yeah

520
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,440
in those years

521
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,599
um

522
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,440
but if i look back now yeah there's a

523
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,558
huge difference that everybody knows

524
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,400
yeah since

525
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,160
the law changed here and they couldn't

526
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,280
we're not allowed to grow for seed

527
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,200
anymore

528
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,279
a lot of people lost a lot of genetics

529
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
and a lot of moms and stuff yeah when it

530
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,759
all had to go underground

531
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,519
so that's why a lot of that changed

532
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,400
um

533
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,720
which is a big pity yeah um

534
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,200
i mean the dutch are very good at

535
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,038
doing these things yeah but then if it

536
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,159
becomes small and uh illegal and

537
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:09,200
you lose moms and stuff which happens um

538
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,280
yeah then it can be really hard yeah

539
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,600
and what do you feel was the ultimate

540
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,359
downfall of the dutch breeding scene

541
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,879
given it was at the pinnacle at that

542
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,119
time

543
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,520
that's 98 when they changed that law

544
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,599
that that really that's the start of it

545
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,000
yeah then people had to move all their

546
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,599
plans underground

547
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
um

548
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,199
some of them

549
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,039
kept them for a few years some of them

550
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,720
lost them really fast yeah um that's all

551
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,960
those are all police busts it's that

552
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,880
simple and they they couldn't even say

553
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,480
that of course as well yeah they're not

554
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,000
going to make a public statement saying

555
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,159
oh yeah well

556
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,279
we're doing illegal stuff and we got

557
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,760
busted

558
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,158
yeah they so

559
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,720
they never told the people that

560
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,960
um it changed yeah

561
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,919
yep i can understand that

562
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,400
and so i guess the question has to be

563
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,880
asked do you feel like any of those

564
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,320
really really elusive old school clones

565
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
are still around or do you think they're

566
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,399
all just gone now

567
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,480
no they're still there's definitely

568
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,880
still some um

569
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,360
old plants um still alive yeah um i mean

570
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,720
i keep some of these uh the old neville

571
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,959
cuts um i i keep those for a long time

572
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,360
already um i have a really old hindu

573
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,558
kush cut which is like uh more than 30

574
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,199
years old

575
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,119
um i still keep a k2 cut

576
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
which is from

577
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,079
late 90s

578
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,880
um

579
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:41,519
no there's still some plans around um

580
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,600
that kept the time and stuff yeah

581
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,759
and but they were like

582
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,798
cared for by like a little

583
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,319
group or cells yeah um

584
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,960
things always need to be on multiple

585
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,839
places for it to survive longer times

586
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,720
because everything goes wrong

587
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,558
sometime yeah it's that simple yeah

588
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,240
definitely we'll have to loop back have

589
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,480
a chat about those neville coins in a

590
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,400
minute but just to kind of keep the

591
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,919
linearity of things

592
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,000
when you were doing your breeding and

593
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,000
you're kind of first starting out

594
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,640
was there anything else besides just

595
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,400
that allure of new variety which

596
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,440
attracted you towards it did you kind of

597
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,798
think oh you know what i think i could

598
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,759
do a probably a better job than what's

599
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,759
been done thus far

600
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,440
no that didn't come till

601
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
like a few years ago to be honest that i

602
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,038
thought [ __ ]

603
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,038
i think i'm pretty i'm pretty pretty

604
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,480
okay at doing this yeah

605
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,960
um

606
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,759
that only came when like huge numbers

607
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,480
were grown out yeah

608
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,558
in in the states yeah that's when i

609
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,960
saw the difference like then you can

610
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:49,519
really see the difference between

611
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,720
those and uh some of other people's

612
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,200
seeds yeah

613
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,120
um if you grow a bigger groups of all of

614
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,519
them next to each other

615
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,079
and then you can see the difference here

616
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,879
which is which was um

617
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:07,279
like a bit more vigor um

618
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,039
less pheno variation um things like that

619
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,918
yeah certainly

620
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,119
so when did you think to yourself

621
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,640
you know i'm going to take this

622
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,319
seriously you know i'm going to pursue

623
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,200
it kind of full time and i'm going to

624
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,439
make this my my new gig

625
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,519
um yeah i always was just breathing and

626
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,519
i was on the forums and stuff and it was

627
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,440
all hobby um

628
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,960
i shared some seeds with some friends

629
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,120
but i didn't want to sell anything yeah

630
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,600
then i entered an icy makeup because

631
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:38,158
they asked me

632
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,480
and then the guy running that um he said

633
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,440
to me you're gonna you gotta sell seats

634
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,079
uh yeah you sell seats to me yeah

635
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,278
so that kind of pushed me yeah um and

636
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,599
that kind of started it to be

637
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,278
yeah honest

638
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,319
that's like two

639
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,759
yeah that's later like 2007

640
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,839
probably

641
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:02,079
maybe even yeah 2007 2008

642
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,918
before that i never sold the seed i made

643
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,158
a lot of seeds and gave them away and

644
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,880
all my friends and we all grew them and

645
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,400
people on the forums i shared them and

646
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,200
things like that but they were never

647
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,440
sold before that

648
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,519
okay and what was the first project that

649
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,960
you created that caused you to go down

650
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,240
the rabbit hole and you kind of thought

651
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,038
you know what i might work this one a

652
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,038
bit more forward

653
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,200
um

654
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,000
the happy brother which is that old

655
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,200
hindu kush cut

656
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,359
that was a thing that was a

657
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,798
it it was like a clone only thing here

658
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,240
yeah and i thought oh this needs to be

659
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,558
in seed yeah

660
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,038
um so that was kind of my first like

661
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:47,678
release

662
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:49,519
aimed uh project um i did um which to be

663
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
honest in my eyes was not the biggest

664
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,798
success that's why it's not there

665
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,759
anymore i'm gonna restart the whole

666
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:54,798
project

667
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,440
from

668
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,319
um zero

669
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,600
okay

670
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,200
it's interesting you bring that up

671
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,879
because i had some questions about that

672
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
because i've actually i got the uh the

673
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,240
genetics in front of me

674
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,038
in terms of what you did with the happy

675
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,440
brother and to my surprise

676
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,879
you paired it with the chem d which i

677
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,120
like i mean that's not too surprising

678
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,000
but what i found surprising was that

679
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:20,399
like people in the past you had felt

680
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,038
that like the hindus or the afghanis in

681
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,559
general were a good match for the chem

682
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:29,519
dog genetics do you still stand by that

683
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,918
if i had like if i had to do it today

684
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,440
i'm probably going to restart it uh i

685
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,480
would definitely use something different

686
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,278
yeah but i will use an afghani though

687
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,440
i think an afghani be good to be honest

688
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,519
so like an afghani in cross type of

689
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,480
thing

690
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,918
yes

691
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,159
and how would you describe the happy

692
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,919
brother clone in general

693
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,000
um

694
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,080
well at the time that was the

695
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,599
strongest tasting weed that i've ever

696
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:59,839
smoked at that time and now there was

697
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,599
some a few things that went over it but

698
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,558
at that time there was and it was

699
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:07,519
extremely strong yeah it was like really

700
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,639
hard uh small nuggets

701
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,480
um

702
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,360
and it was really strong yeah like

703
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,720
really really strong it kind of

704
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:19,359
has a little bit of an og type structure

705
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,120
in the butt but it's more leafy

706
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:25,439
it's very resonance light green um

707
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,519
it has a very specific flavor as well

708
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,919
which i don't see in cannabis a lot to

709
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,839
be honest

710
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,679
do you think it's one that's just not

711
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,720
quite valued and has fallen by the

712
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,720
wayside or it's just that unique

713
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,960
no

714
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,880
i think there's someone uh must be a few

715
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,840
other people that still keep it as well

716
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,400
yeah

717
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,359
so it no it is a very it is pretty

718
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,519
unique plant from what i see today yeah

719
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:56,240
and from what i have seen myself coming

720
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,240
from seed from all kinds of sources

721
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,159
but i've never grown

722
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,278
certified hindu kush land raised seeds

723
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,880
that are

724
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,278
like 100 percent

725
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,278
behind

726
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,960
um which is hard to find any

727
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,919
certified land race today to be honest

728
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,919
yeah so um

729
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,559
yeah

730
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,840
there's no

731
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,759
material for me to compare it with on on

732
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,918
that yeah

733
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,319
so if you have if you could just kind of

734
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,480
click your fingers and get access to any

735
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,879
land race you wanted which one would you

736
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,038
want to work with the most

737
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,840
um

738
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,240
i'm probably gonna have to pick two and

739
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,558
that be afghani and thai

740
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,519
oh good selection did you ever get to

741
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:48,398
try any of the old school thai

742
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:51,679
yeah i we used to have a lot of thai

743
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:54,079
imports here in the old older days so

744
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,798
um yeah i would definitely do a thai

745
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,918
thai is all about for by the higher

746
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,079
um

747
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,240
and then the afghanis would all be about

748
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,398
their power here and also i like the

749
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,319
flavor of

750
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,079
i think a lot of the strong flavors and

751
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,599
smells that people like in some of these

752
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:15,038
strains are afghani based yeah

753
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:17,278
yeah certainly certainly and so

754
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,359
just afghani in general or is there one

755
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,119
specific you kind of gravitate towards

756
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,359
because these days it seems like we're

757
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,839
starting to see more diversity within

758
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,599
afghanis and they're not just one group

759
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,678
they're kind of subdivided into the

760
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,038
different regions is any one region

761
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,519
particularly calling out to you or

762
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,038
you're just happy with whatever

763
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,440
um

764
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,558
no i do like well i wouldn't go for

765
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,759
pacific

766
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,759
region but i do like the shorter broad

767
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,919
leaf

768
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,599
type versions yeah

769
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,840
for sure for sure i think that's kind of

770
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,319
the ones that speak to me as well so

771
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:54,798
it's a perfect little segue question

772
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,359
what do you think about the history of

773
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,960
og overall you know you kind of made the

774
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,879
reference earlier on that the happy

775
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,038
brother reminded you a little bit of oh

776
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,360
gee in some ways what do you think's the

777
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,440
backstory behind it

778
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,439
yeah that's uh

779
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,558
well all these years yeah and all the

780
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,159
stories and everything and stuff um

781
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,278
i wasn't there

782
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,520
yeah so there's not much i can really

783
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,839
say on it that

784
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,639
would be like genuine and certified all

785
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,798
i can say are things that i hear read or

786
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,679
have been told yeah um

787
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,759
yeah

788
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,960
and i think most of those things are

789
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,240
already like open in there yeah um

790
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,120
i do 100

791
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,399
um

792
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:42,000
think it's genuine that my friend josh

793
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:44,079
was one that grew it uh the first in uh

794
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,119
california and stuff and blew it up

795
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,960
there

796
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,879
um but yeah it came from florida um

797
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,798
then what happened before that i don't

798
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,679
know yet and what it is i don't know at

799
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:55,038
all

800
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,038
so um

801
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:58,398
yeah definitely shout out to josh d

802
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,119
really nice guy

803
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,479
um i was gonna follow this question up

804
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,119
by saying you know we've seen that the

805
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,120
whole tk origins crew is slowly coming

806
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,959
out of the woodworks do you tend to

807
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,719
believe their story i remember i spoke

808
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,120
with josh at the emerald cup and he said

809
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,679
yeah he's pretty sold on the story

810
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,000
yeah i don't know um like i said i

811
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,600
wasn't there so i have nothing to verify

812
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,599
anything what anyone says about it yeah

813
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:27,359
i mean i know josh well um

814
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,158
but i don't know anything before that

815
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,479
kind of thing so

816
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,240
okay and so how do you think we went

817
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,399
from having let's just let's just for

818
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,159
arguments like say that the josh d cut

819
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,079
was the original or the tk they're kind

820
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,120
of very similar let's say that's the

821
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,798
original

822
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,319
how do you think it went from there to

823
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,319
the point where we've got all the

824
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,639
different og cuts do you think that they

825
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,480
were just like crosses made with the

826
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,399
original or it was just stuff locked

827
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,038
within it and they were kind of bag seed

828
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,959
how do you think we got there

829
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,038
um well there's multiple things

830
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,000
happening there at the same time yeah

831
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:04,000
one is um it did make like every pound

832
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,440
would have probably like four seats or

833
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,960
whatever yeah um when josh and his crew

834
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,080
and everybody grew it yeah in the

835
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,038
beginning

836
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,759
um

837
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,278
so those seeds would be germed yeah and

838
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,640
then there were a lot of people when the

839
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:21,599
cut kind of were uh shared with other

840
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,799
people and stuff yeah um people wanted

841
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:27,119
to know like this is my og i grew this

842
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:29,519
yeah this is mine so they all started to

843
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,119
name it different as well yeah so the

844
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,440
that's where

845
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,319
kind of the mess started to be honest

846
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,360
yeah

847
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,038
um

848
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,359
and then you had that people started

849
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,759
calling the backseat the same thing

850
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,558
as the plan that the bots they found it

851
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,119
in

852
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,599
um and not labeling it like that yeah

853
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,398
which you see a lot today as well

854
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,158
um

855
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,398
so yeah then it all gets

856
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,320
like so messy yeah and because this is

857
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,000
all like

858
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,000
underground and everything yeah it's

859
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,398
gonna be hard to

860
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,759
really find a solid or like a hundred

861
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,278
percent proven type of thing yet yeah

862
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,759
it will always just be people saying

863
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,759
things now

864
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:14,000
yeah okay and so do you think that the

865
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,480
idea at least when you look at some of

866
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,880
these og cuts the common story i hear

867
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,319
from people and it's always like i

868
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,919
always get the impression that they're

869
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,439
kind of a bit new to the scene because

870
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,799
they come up to me and they say it as if

871
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,600
like i've never heard it before and

872
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:30,398
they're always like oh og's just like

873
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,079
lemon [ __ ] crossed into

874
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:33,839
you know hindu or something like that

875
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,158
you know like that really typical

876
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,918
genetics which is probably not true

877
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,399
do you feel like that does explain why

878
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,399
some of the og cuts are really lemony

879
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,158
and yet you know the josh d cut it

880
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,839
doesn't really have any lemon at all or

881
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,919
do you think it was just locked inside

882
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,918
it

883
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,600
um

884
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,159
well here's another thing yeah some

885
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,158
people will call some smells lemony well

886
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,360
other people say that's not lemon as

887
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,240
well yeah

888
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,240
um

889
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,038
i thought i see that when i give like

890
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,679
wheat and so i can give uh some oh gee

891
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,599
nuggets yeah to a few different people

892
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,519
let them all smell it and some people

893
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,038
that almost never smell weed like it

894
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,038
they say it smells lemony while the

895
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,119
other ones that smoke oh geez oh this

896
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:15,919
doesn't smell like a lemon yeah

897
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,239
yeah

898
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,320
so i think there's it's pretty hard with

899
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,038
that even on that part as well there is

900
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:26,240
lemon more lemony type oh geez more pine

901
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:29,038
soul more piney and more earthy yeah

902
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,880
all those flavors and then in different

903
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:35,679
percentages yeah they're all og yeah

904
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,080
that's all in og yeah so when you start

905
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,159
breeding with it or when seeds or s-ones

906
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,639
yes some of these percentages it becomes

907
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,600
way more earthy yeah um it becomes way

908
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,200
more lemony or pine-silly or pine yeah

909
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,278
just like that yeah

910
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,480
um then the way it's grown also makes a

911
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,398
clear difference with og's as well like

912
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,880
if they're grown on soil

913
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,719
if they're grown outdoor

914
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,880
which type of nutrients make a little

915
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,679
difference as well yeah

916
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,600
temperatures um those things make the

917
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,360
same clone come out very different

918
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,159
sometimes as well yeah

919
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:12,559
like if you give the same og clone to 10

920
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,639
different growers and they all return it

921
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,480
there will be quite some differences a

922
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,079
lot of times in it yeah

923
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,159
it doesn't look like exact the same weed

924
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,079
yeah definitely and i i can't remember

925
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,639
who said it but i think it might have

926
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,560
even been caleb from csi forgive me if

927
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,919
i'm wrong but basically

928
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,759
someone told me something along the

929
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,158
lines of like they rounded up all the

930
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,000
different og cuts and grew them all out

931
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,480
and there was really only like two or

932
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,398
three different og's across what was

933
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,760
meant to be like 40 different cuts they

934
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,519
were just as you said just different

935
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,520
grow conditions different noses

936
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,599
describing different flavors

937
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,280
would you would you be like

938
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,119
would you be happy to believe that that

939
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,000
could be true

940
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,000
uh yeah i i i'm a bit surprised though

941
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,358
one that on 40 it would be only three

942
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,519
different

943
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,598
things yeah i would expect it a little

944
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,280
bit more but um

945
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,519
yeah

946
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,320
multiple the same yeah under different

947
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,400
names 100 if you all collect all kind of

948
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,640
og cards from everywhere

949
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,280
you'll definitely have the same clone

950
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,440
under different names

951
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,280
yeah yeah yeah i think i might be

952
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,358
mistaken on some of the finer details of

953
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,119
that but yeah i think you got the point

954
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,279
more or less correctly and i think one

955
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,519
of the things people say to me is that

956
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,599
the the sfv cut

957
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,159
so to speak people will call that a

958
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,599
myriad of different names like people

959
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,559
have said to me that the larry is

960
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,000
definitely different to the sfv and

961
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,679
there's a few others that are definitely

962
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,519
different but you know some of those

963
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,279
other ones you hear about with like a

964
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,880
little bit more obscure that they're all

965
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,359
just really the same thing like just

966
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,960
like a lemon og

967
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:53,519
yeah like we would um with short um we

968
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,400
grew probably like seven or eight of the

969
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,759
cuts like at the same time and they were

970
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,519
different yeah

971
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,440
yeah so

972
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,199
they're all like bit older type cuts

973
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,200
yeah they were all different

974
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,279
they were all different they were all

975
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,598
straight og but they were all different

976
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,280
yeah so um

977
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,720
and then sometimes i think as well if a

978
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,000
clone is like

979
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:18,399
not kept right yeah or um it's in a too

980
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,960
hard of a room for a long time all these

981
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,960
things it gets like ptsd yeah and then

982
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,800
it changes some people call it genetic

983
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,400
derived but i don't think it i don't

984
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,039
call it genetic drift yet because if you

985
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,039
keep that plant really well for a year

986
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,039
and you treat it really well it comes

987
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,000
back by itself as well

988
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,079
so

989
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,079
hell yeah so that's an idea which has

990
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,680
been kind of expressed by a few of our

991
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,000
guests in the past

992
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,078
do you believe that there is a way to

993
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,079
rejuvenate the plant indoors because

994
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,760
most of our past guests when they kind

995
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,079
of echo that sentiment you just

996
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,920
expressed they'd say oh you kind of got

997
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,240
to get it outside get it under the sun

998
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,000
and that'll really rejuvenate it a bit

999
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,598
do you find you're able to do it indoors

1000
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,119
just in a really well maintained

1001
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,280
environment

1002
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,320
no i didn't with all the old cuts i have

1003
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,800
they go outdoor every year

1004
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,838
yeah okay really

1005
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,839
reinvigorates it with that life

1006
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:15,838
yes yes very rich soil

1007
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,920
and then um like a few weeks before

1008
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,440
flower that's when take off

1009
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,440
new cuts and then move them inside again

1010
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,280
yeah definitely well we'll loop back to

1011
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,559
that in a minute i guess the last

1012
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,839
question i want to just quickly ask on

1013
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,159
the topic is

1014
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,480
how do you feel about the rise of tissue

1015
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:35,118
culturing and kind of the merry stem

1016
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,639
culturing as a way of rejuvenating these

1017
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,160
plants and getting them back to their

1018
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,759
former glory do you feel like it's

1019
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,519
something you'll explore more or are you

1020
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,480
still just kind of waiting to see how

1021
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,159
that technology pans out a bit more

1022
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,838
oh that's that that's that's the whole

1023
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,879
future yeah

1024
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:53,519
no it's perfect it's ha it's great

1025
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,599
it works really well as well

1026
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,960
do you see the price point coming down

1027
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,960
to the point where

1028
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,880
pretty much every old clone will be

1029
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,240
tissue cultured eventually or it's just

1030
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,880
those really select standouts

1031
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,439
well no i think there will be huge

1032
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,480
uh genetic libraries in made into tissue

1033
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,480
culture 100 percent yeah 100

1034
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,240
and and the more legally becomes all

1035
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,119
over the world i think the whole future

1036
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:22,000
will be just that yeah

1037
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,320
why would you i mean it's gonna in it if

1038
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,320
it would be legal in the whole world

1039
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,760
it would push away the

1040
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,519
big part of the seed market 100

1041
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,599
you would sell a tissue culture yeah you

1042
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,358
would create and breathe things but you

1043
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,039
would sell the tissue culture to people

1044
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,960
then

1045
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,279
yeah it's definitely a

1046
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,400
a future outcome which isn't really

1047
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,359
discussed as much

1048
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,280
no but it's i mean you look at it from a

1049
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:53,199
client point it's very logical yeah it's

1050
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,040
very logical so

1051
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,039
yeah i agree so

1052
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,679
this brings us to the first big question

1053
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:02,400
that i think people were waiting for

1054
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:05,118
when and how was it that you came about

1055
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,760
to decide that the hell's og was the og

1056
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,200
that you wanted to work with

1057
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,040
well those

1058
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,639
cuts um

1059
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:17,599
i got in

1060
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,559
let me think must be 2a 2008 2009.

1061
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,039
um

1062
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:23,119
i had that and as a v yeah but the sfv

1063
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,838
died so this was the only

1064
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,400
original well one of the older og cuts

1065
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:32,078
from the us i had at that time as well

1066
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,000
the rest i had was all from seed

1067
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,760
so that was one of the reasons to be

1068
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,599
honest yeah

1069
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,359
apart from that i like it a lot yeah

1070
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,359
it's very strong

1071
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,159
it's got a serious kick to it compared

1072
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,078
to some of the other ones

1073
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,399
it's not as light green as most of the

1074
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,359
ogs

1075
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,519
the cut itself doesn't show much purple

1076
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,838
but the gene pool definitely has quite a

1077
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,960
lot of purple in

1078
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:58,320
it um

1079
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,000
yeah so

1080
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,640
and the cut that i got

1081
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,639
did have some ptsd problems and not that

1082
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,400
much vigor and stuff as well yeah it

1083
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,199
took like almost three years before it

1084
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
really

1085
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,759
came back to good power

1086
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,279
um so yeah seeds are always a good thing

1087
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,280
then

1088
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,880
definitely i mean limited availability

1089
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,040
can often be the reason for a lot of

1090
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,039
things you mentioned there's not a lot

1091
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,318
of purple in the gene pool and and it's

1092
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,838
amazing you mentioned that because i had

1093
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,440
a question specifically about that where

1094
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,239
i was saying a lot of the biker or the

1095
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,519
hell's og lines that you've worked they

1096
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,519
tend to be pretty green there's not a

1097
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,199
lot of purple in them and it's kind of

1098
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,719
like a bit of a polarizing thing for

1099
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,000
people some people see purple and

1100
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,759
they're just put off they think it's

1101
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,760
weak can't be good

1102
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,680
do you tend to fall into that same camp

1103
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,920
or do you think no it's just purely a

1104
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,679
genetic thing

1105
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,760
um

1106
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,598
i think the strongest weeds that i've

1107
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,880
smoked were not purple

1108
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,440
yeah

1109
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,358
and there is definitely weaker purple

1110
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,599
things just as there is

1111
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:58,639
weaker green things as well

1112
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,160
um

1113
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,920
so yeah

1114
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,440
there's there's some strong purple type

1115
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,519
things yeah um

1116
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,880
like even the cookie type gene pool and

1117
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,880
stuff yeah that's not

1118
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,599
that's not weak weed yeah

1119
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,240
they're stronger much stronger stuff but

1120
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,240
it's not weak yeah so um

1121
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:20,559
then there's some other strains which i

1122
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:22,639
think are pretty weak they are purple so

1123
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,318
i understand why people have that

1124
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:26,078
thought or say things like that but i

1125
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:29,440
don't think it's that easy or you can

1126
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,039
put it over like uh that easy yeah

1127
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,000
there's definitely strong purple weed as

1128
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:35,440
well

1129
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,119
it's that simple yeah okay i agree with

1130
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,880
you on that one so

1131
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,039
just to quickly loop back to the hell's

1132
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,519
og if you weren't able to work with the

1133
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:46,239
hells angels og and you were still

1134
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,159
limited by that selection you had

1135
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,279
which og would you have opted to work

1136
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,279
with next in line

1137
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,119
um

1138
00:41:53,679 --> 00:42:00,078
the og jg card that's the some people

1139
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,079
call it jew gold

1140
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,000
wow that's a rare one we don't hear

1141
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,000
about that outside of the dna crew

1142
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,880
yeah

1143
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,599
um

1144
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,720
that cut comes from a friend of mine

1145
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,960
at bibi he's from calicus farms

1146
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,719
they're the originators of they they

1147
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,119
have that cut since they did

1148
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,039
since the old days yeah and it has that

1149
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,280
name because um

1150
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,519
when a one of a kid in their crew when

1151
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,319
he grew it yeah and he's a jewish kid

1152
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,239
yeah

1153
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,679
then it was word gold yeah because he

1154
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,279
just grew it the best

1155
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,480
that's the oh that's why it was called

1156
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,640
that yeah

1157
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,039
it was the little kids they called him

1158
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,199
the jew so it was the jews gold yeah

1159
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,480
that's why it's called that yeah and

1160
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:47,759
it's not negative at all um

1161
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,519
that's just a very flavorful very strong

1162
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,520
um it yields really nice as well yeah um

1163
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,318
that's just like for me that's an

1164
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:59,039
all-rounded uh oh gee that i personally

1165
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:02,318
like probably like the most of mo of all

1166
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,318
the older og cuts

1167
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,639
yeah it's an interesting one i've spoken

1168
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,719
to many people about it and i mean the

1169
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,799
first kind of point of view i heard

1170
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,959
expressed about it was that

1171
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,839
some people kind of doubted it existed

1172
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,720
like in the sense that no one disputes

1173
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,960
kosher as a good strain unquestionable

1174
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,719
however when i was asking some people

1175
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,800
about the jew gold they were like oh you

1176
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:27,118
know what you never really saw photos of

1177
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,400
it or anything until well after kosher

1178
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,240
was out and

1179
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,880
some people had even thought well maybe

1180
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,118
maybe you know the the original is was

1181
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,760
produced just to explain where things

1182
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,800
came from if you get what i mean

1183
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,480
no it is a clone um

1184
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,960
i don't know the

1185
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,480
background before much before that to be

1186
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,920
honest but they've been growing that for

1187
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,960
a [ __ ] long time yeah way before

1188
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,680
uh dna entered it um and then made the

1189
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,760
kosher cushy eats yeah way before that

1190
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,639
that cuts been grown a long time before

1191
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,400
that

1192
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,920
i smoked it way before they andrew

1193
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,599
ditched that's why

1194
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,240
yeah okay and so how do you feel about

1195
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,280
the dna crew they're quite polarizing in

1196
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,598
many people's eyes

1197
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,599
yeah

1198
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,159
i have no problem with

1199
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,640
dna even though

1200
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,000
like this kosher thing there's there's a

1201
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:21,440
lot of

1202
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,280
i don't know

1203
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,000
those are not things that i

1204
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,240
um i'm good with everybody yeah so i

1205
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,400
don't like to go into those things i

1206
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,879
know everything let me put it that way

1207
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,720
yeah i know all the backstories and

1208
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,599
everything that really happened anything

1209
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:37,358
like that

1210
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,720
i just don't like talking about that

1211
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,279
stuff

1212
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,639
yeah okay what about some of the more

1213
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,079
blatant

1214
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,078
kind of uh

1215
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,318
questionable breeding practices that

1216
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,480
have occurred like for example we've had

1217
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,559
guests on in the past such as brita

1218
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,159
steve who have had their issues with

1219
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:55,838
barney's farm

1220
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,920
given that you know they're blatantly

1221
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,358
ripping off one of his strains how do

1222
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,519
you feel about those situations where

1223
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,440
it's a little more clear-cut let me just

1224
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,800
be honest about it then yeah about

1225
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,440
almost the whole

1226
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,039
dutch thing and what these companies do

1227
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,800
kind of these days and what a lot of

1228
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,318
them kind of are yeah

1229
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,000
um yep

1230
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,199
yeah they'll find something from someone

1231
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,838
and then just

1232
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,679
make it theirs that's what happens here

1233
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:21,440
um it's the same with the kosher thing

1234
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,559
yeah they bought that wheat they entered

1235
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,159
it um

1236
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,920
and then made the [ __ ] strain out of

1237
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,239
it and then then called it that yeah

1238
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,240
they didn't even have to cut so that's

1239
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,318
how those things go and then yeah

1240
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,759
barney's there's loads of them i don't

1241
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:35,759
even like to call the names because then

1242
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,000
i'm like pointing at them yeah but they

1243
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,480
all do this type of stuff yeah and

1244
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
they've been doing that for many years

1245
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,240
most of these things are not bred by

1246
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,239
them yeah they'll find someone like you

1247
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,399
or someone else or like me or whatever

1248
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,000
yeah and you show them something

1249
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,559
it'll take it

1250
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,159
certainly not a point of view we're

1251
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,318
hearing for the first time a lot of

1252
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,159
people have said things along this line

1253
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,440
but it's nice to get clarification from

1254
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,039
someone who's so

1255
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,920
you know kind of connected with that

1256
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,318
scene

1257
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,079
yeah no i'm i'm connected like i said i

1258
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,759
mean in all these

1259
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,200
different

1260
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,520
lines in in the scene yeah so um i'm

1261
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,399
still connected to everyone in the down

1262
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,880
market

1263
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,720
in the shade um but i'm also connected

1264
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,240
to people in that are standing in the

1265
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:21,279
spotlight yeah

1266
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:22,959
um

1267
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,720
and all of these people love cannabis

1268
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,280
though don't get me wrong yeah

1269
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,838
it's just that i think

1270
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,240
the commercial and then the pressure

1271
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,559
and everything like that yeah um

1272
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,318
made it go that way and you also have to

1273
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,719
be honest yeah um

1274
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:41,599
you have to start somewhere yeah jeans

1275
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,358
don't fall from the sky yeah

1276
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,760
yeah so you always have to get it

1277
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,759
somewhere or from someone as well yeah

1278
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,519
yeah most certainly most certainly

1279
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:53,358
so

1280
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,639
i guess my next question is it's a

1281
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:56,480
little different but i'd love to get

1282
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:58,879
your perspective on it

1283
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,960
how did the dutch scene react to when

1284
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,800
cookies first came out because it kind

1285
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,000
of you know took over a lot of scenes

1286
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,240
was that the same case in holland

1287
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,960
well

1288
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:13,598
first time cookies came here is when

1289
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,480
jiga came over here as well i don't know

1290
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,400
which year it is

1291
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,159
2013 or

1292
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,760
2012 or 14 i don't know it's one of

1293
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:24,239
these years that the high times copy

1294
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,000
came here that's when he showed people a

1295
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,679
lot of the people that didn't have that

1296
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,119
didn't go to the us had not seen it

1297
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,879
before that

1298
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,760
um

1299
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,240
when he was away that same year you had

1300
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,079
uh girl scout cookies on menus yeah but

1301
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,000
it was not girl scout cookies yeah it

1302
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,240
was weed that was purple

1303
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,239
um

1304
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:47,759
i think it took like probably

1305
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,079
three years something like that when the

1306
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,079
girl scout cookie form cut kind of went

1307
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,839
to europe and things like that then you

1308
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,519
started seeing it but it's more like in

1309
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:57,599
the still in the underground yeah with

1310
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,519
like smaller growers and the foreign

1311
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,119
people

1312
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,000
and these days yeah you can get buy

1313
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,079
cookies these days it's like yeah it's

1314
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,039
there not many dutch people grow it

1315
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,800
though because they don't like it

1316
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,279
because it doesn't yield enough for them

1317
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,359
they're used to growing amnesia

1318
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,680
which yields a lot yeah it's very easy

1319
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:17,920
to grow no matter what you do if you

1320
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,558
feed it too much it doesn't matter

1321
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,800
so yeah they all grow amnesia here

1322
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,680
how do you feel about the fabled core

1323
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,440
cut of amnesia is it a staple for you or

1324
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,039
it's just a bitter

1325
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,838
yeah that's funny thing that it's

1326
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,679
labeled core cod these days but um yeah

1327
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:35,838
so that's a cut that

1328
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,838
went from sweep which is the owner of

1329
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:40,558
high pro which is kind of the base of

1330
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,519
that amnesia gene pool yeah

1331
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,760
um

1332
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,920
from other to other people and then into

1333
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,240
the forum and then core was a member of

1334
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,680
the forum yeah here in europe and he

1335
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,439
sent it out to a lot of people that's

1336
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:53,519
why it's labeled core cut yeah but

1337
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,159
that's a high pro amnesia cut there's

1338
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,960
two or three of them around in europe

1339
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,879
um that's kind of what the staple is for

1340
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,400
amnesia

1341
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,119
there's a few that are a little bit

1342
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,880
better but they flower a bit longer or

1343
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,519
things like that

1344
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,680
yeah okay so it's just kind of that nice

1345
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,159
balance of all things

1346
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,759
yeah that it's a really good plan yeah

1347
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,759
um

1348
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,319
it's not my favorite we me personally

1349
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,119
yeah but um it's easy to grow it's very

1350
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:28,159
strong it can take a lot of abuse it has

1351
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,160
a high pr thc percentage yeah um

1352
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,719
it breathes pretty nice as well yeah if

1353
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:35,920
you like that stuff yeah so um it's a

1354
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,959
good overall clone and plant yeah

1355
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,159
yeah

1356
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,400
okay

1357
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:43,118
so if we jump back to your own breeding

1358
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,119
for a moment it seems to me like your

1359
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,440
first major cross that kind of started

1360
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,599
to get you widespread attention was the

1361
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,599
biker kush would you agree with this

1362
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,000
analysis and how did you feel when it

1363
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,200
initially took off

1364
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,119
yeah i think

1365
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,838
og is definitely the thing that made me

1366
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,720
noticed and i think the reason was at

1367
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:07,039
that time yeah when that came out

1368
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:09,039
almost every ogc that came out no matter

1369
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,039
if they were regular or whatever

1370
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,000
they had like a lot of herm problems

1371
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:15,039
here

1372
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,599
and this line had way less here

1373
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:20,558
like it's just a small percentage yeah

1374
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,039
um and i think that's the thing that got

1375
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,040
noticed

1376
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,880
yeah so do you feel like crossing og

1377
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,480
with things there is an intrinsic risk

1378
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,559
with it because there's this debate

1379
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,159
which surrounds og and how it's a little

1380
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,559
bit herme prone

1381
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,480
and people often give the example of

1382
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,160
well you should never cross girl scouts

1383
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,639
and og together because it's just

1384
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,558
guaranteed to get you hermes how do you

1385
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,400
feel like about that idea do you feel

1386
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,000
like it's intrinsic and inevitable that

1387
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,440
you're going to get some hermes with og

1388
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,838
and would you ever cross it to girl

1389
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,400
scouts

1390
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,400
um well the girl scout gene pool if you

1391
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,960
take one of those old cuts they're way

1392
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,599
more terrible for her type things yeah

1393
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,800
cherry pie is even worse than that

1394
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,760
um

1395
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,760
i think if you clean up an og lion yeah

1396
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,839
meaning if you do like back crosses and

1397
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,280
in crosses and every time you select

1398
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,799
away from it

1399
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,519
um you can

1400
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,079
the lower the percentage here

1401
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,159
og is not as bad as

1402
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,559
some of the chem and the sour gene pool

1403
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:25,598
bar in the

1404
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,920
um girl scout cookie cherry pie those

1405
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,359
two are like i haven't been able to get

1406
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,200
those

1407
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:32,880
really clean

1408
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,679
yeah so i don't like to work too much

1409
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,838
with those two lines oh geez i'm very

1410
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,480
confident these days with my own lines

1411
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:41,679
yeah so um i dare to cross it with all

1412
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,440
kinds of stuff

1413
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:45,279
um and i'm not worried about herms

1414
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,920
coming from that side

1415
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,839
yeah okay so what what would be the big

1416
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,599
no-no for you in terms of crossing

1417
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,599
genetics together would it be og and

1418
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,119
cherry pie

1419
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,359
yeah that's

1420
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,920
i mean i did hat stash which is girl

1421
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:02,318
scout cookie cherry pie nog

1422
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,920
and that's the only line i have not been

1423
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:08,558
able to clean yeah so um

1424
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,480
yeah no i don't i try to stay away these

1425
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,000
days from the girl scout cookie cherry

1426
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,519
pie

1427
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,559
things

1428
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:19,119
okay so let's just say that you didn't

1429
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,440
create the biker og line

1430
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,200
which out of your own creations would

1431
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,679
have been next in line for you to

1432
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,598
consider working forward or using as

1433
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,799
kind of a line you wanted to represent

1434
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,200
yourself

1435
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,240
oh it definitely would be the the

1436
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,879
headbanger i think is the strain that's

1437
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,399
became most popular from me

1438
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,559
um

1439
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,318
and that was all because everybody wants

1440
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,440
sour dia

1441
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:44,318
um

1442
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,960
which

1443
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:50,159
is normal because i think it's some of

1444
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,599
the best weed in the world so um

1445
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:55,519
yeah it's kind of the headbanger yeah um

1446
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,920
and then that's kind of what i did now

1447
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,358
with like the back crosses to that sour

1448
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,720
d cut

1449
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:02,400
um

1450
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,318
and that's that's what people always

1451
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,240
asked for kind of but i didn't ever did

1452
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:09,358
it before

1453
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:11,919
yeah okay and so do you feel like sourdy

1454
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,838
just totally overtook the og craze when

1455
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,079
it came

1456
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:19,358
about i think um

1457
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:22,559
og is way easier to grow than than sour

1458
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,960
d is yeah sour d is not easy to grow a

1459
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,440
lot of people won't have

1460
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,838
the big success right away with it and

1461
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,599
stuff yeah it's uh it needs a different

1462
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,400
feeding

1463
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,079
than most other plants yeah

1464
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,519
so

1465
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,760
it's it's certainly one of the more

1466
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,599
unique ones and what do you feel about

1467
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,160
the history you know it's it's almost

1468
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,440
got a more disputed history than og

1469
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,318
itself

1470
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,119
yeah that one's like even a bigger mess

1471
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:52,000
than

1472
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,920
than the og background um

1473
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,079
i've been so interested in trying to

1474
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,079
find that out for so many years

1475
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,640
at the moment i don't even

1476
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,119
care that much anymore yeah and i think

1477
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:05,598
people really care

1478
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,440
when they don't have it

1479
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,920
once you have it that's kind of the most

1480
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,440
important thing yeah and

1481
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,920
even though you would still like to know

1482
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,639
what it is it's less important than you

1483
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,639
smoking it

1484
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,200
yeah i can i can certainly agree with

1485
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,279
that point that's a good one to make so

1486
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,879
it's interesting because as i'm sure

1487
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,960
you're probably well aware there's

1488
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,960
there's a bit of drama that surrounds

1489
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,960
your sourdy climb because it

1490
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,440
specifically comes from a res dog

1491
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,400
release which kind of adds a extra layer

1492
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,960
of complexity to the whole situation

1493
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,960
how do you feel about working with you

1494
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,679
know people's gear who

1495
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,400
other people may not drive with or be as

1496
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:51,039
willing to work with

1497
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,599
well in this case i understand a hundred

1498
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:55,039
percent which is one of the reasons i

1499
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,280
didn't

1500
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,318
backcross it before either

1501
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,480
i mean

1502
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:03,039
that's why i even try not to call out

1503
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,719
his name too much yeah but this plant is

1504
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:09,679
so special yeah this plant is so [ __ ]

1505
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:12,639
good yeah that people just deserve this

1506
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,558
yes that's simple um these seeds just

1507
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,078
need to go [ __ ] everywhere and then

1508
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,680
everybody needs to have this yeah

1509
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,960
everybody needs to have smoked this at

1510
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,598
least once in their life um

1511
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,599
it's just that so good of a weed yeah

1512
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,000
if i had to pick one thing that i could

1513
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,640
bring to me um to an island i would

1514
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,559
bring that 100

1515
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:35,118
and so how many seeds did you pop when

1516
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,280
you initially found this clone

1517
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,119
i got two packs

1518
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,960
wow that's a good answer i guess that

1519
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,559
goes to show all you need is one or two

1520
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,240
packs and you can find something really

1521
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,000
special

1522
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:48,639
yeah oh yeah of course you know

1523
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,400
definitely definitely and those seeds

1524
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,879
then um

1525
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,200
i mean this is very simple yeah you get

1526
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,079
lucky sometimes yeah it's that simple i

1527
00:55:55,199 --> 00:56:00,399
got really lucky and why did i get lucky

1528
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,640
i got lucky because this

1529
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,798
plant did not herm

1530
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:08,159
and its offspring doesn't hurt almost

1531
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:10,318
either yeah which is very rare for

1532
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,440
all those seeds from res and from those

1533
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,119
days yeah

1534
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,119
because they were pretty messy if i'm

1535
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,358
honest yeah they were like hey finos

1536
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,280
there were herms in it

1537
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:20,318
it was just messy yet but then there was

1538
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,280
some

1539
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:25,279
like diamonds in there as well yeah um

1540
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,280
my card comes from the same badge that

1541
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,480
another cut that's around in europe

1542
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,760
comes from which is the reary cut that's

1543
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,798
from exact same c badger which is the

1544
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,599
first time he released his sour d ibl

1545
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:42,318
which is not ibl by the way yeah

1546
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,798
it should not have been labeled ibl but

1547
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:46,798
um yeah that's 2006. i bought them in

1548
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:49,119
2007.

1549
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,838
do you feel like people tend to view

1550
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,720
reza's work with kind of rose shaded

1551
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:56,639
glasses like a lot of people acknowledge

1552
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:58,558
the controversy surrounding him but at

1553
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,400
the same time a lot of people won't deny

1554
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,480
that the gear was really good or at

1555
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,240
least so it said do you feel like people

1556
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,000
gloss over the fact like what you just

1557
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,719
mentioned that there were a lot of herms

1558
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,838
and a lot of junk in there

1559
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:14,798
um i think for that time yeah

1560
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:16,480
those genes were not spread yeah when

1561
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,480
things go into seed they go over the

1562
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,358
world yeah and then it goes really fast

1563
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,559
yeah

1564
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:21,838
um

1565
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,760
so

1566
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,599
just for people seeing that for the

1567
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,839
first time yet the good things that were

1568
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,480
in there yeah that just made it like

1569
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:32,798
that yeah the time and being the first

1570
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,480
with that yeah that just made it to what

1571
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,719
it is because he was not a nice guy on

1572
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,719
the forums either yeah not before all

1573
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,558
the snitch problem and all this other

1574
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,078
stuff happened either yeah he was not a

1575
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,559
nice guy yeah

1576
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:47,200
he always was [ __ ] cursing at people

1577
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,960
on the forums he was not a nice guy it's

1578
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:52,159
that simple

1579
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,400
yeah okay well we've seen him pop his

1580
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,960
head back up i was probably about a year

1581
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,119
or more ago now on instagram and they

1582
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,519
quickly kind of ducked out again

1583
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:04,400
just to play devil's advocate how would

1584
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:07,519
you feel if say res dog came back

1585
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,079
and he bought five or ten packs of your

1586
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:11,679
sauer dbx2 and wanted to work that

1587
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,280
forward would you see that as an honor

1588
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,118
or an insult

1589
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,920
um

1590
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,519
not

1591
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,880
you gotta see that as an honor yeah

1592
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,400
because that means

1593
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,720
he [ __ ]

1594
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,039
admits that i did it better than he did

1595
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,639
even though i started with his stuff i

1596
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:29,119
cleaned it out it's that simple there's

1597
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:30,480
no her almost no herm in it yeah and it

1598
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,400
breathes um

1599
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,079
if you pop these back cross two seats if

1600
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,079
you look on my instagram there's so many

1601
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,960
people i had had them grow out before

1602
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,200
they were even released yeah and you can

1603
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,039
see it in there yeah every female is

1604
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:45,759
sourdy yeah

1605
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,440
um there's variation in that of course

1606
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,760
yeah um

1607
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,440
but they all have that smell and that

1608
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,280
stink

1609
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,200
and most of them have the high which

1610
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,960
it's very important about it as well

1611
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,558
yeah

1612
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,280
so yeah

1613
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,839
if you pop two of these pack of seeds

1614
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,920
you'll definitely get

1615
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:08,318
a better choice of

1616
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,159
what you want to keep compared to what

1617
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:12,159
it was then

1618
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,078
yeah certainly and i i definitely wanted

1619
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,039
to make the point of complimenting you

1620
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:20,720
on that when i look at those photos that

1621
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:24,400
absolutely imma unmistakable undeniable

1622
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:26,480
that uh very swollen calyx look that the

1623
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,519
sourdy has all the females i've seen

1624
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,000
from your

1625
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,159
uh bx2 they've got that look and i kind

1626
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,480
of on initial glance i'm like is that

1627
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,558
the clone and then uh but then you're

1628
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,719
like oh oh it's the bx2 that so yeah you

1629
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:41,440
did an amazing job on that

1630
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:44,480
yeah that's that came out really well um

1631
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:48,159
the backross one i didn't release

1632
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,159
that was kind of iffy yeah um that was

1633
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:52,000
not good enough to be sold as a seed

1634
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,558
yeah there were quite a lot of weaker

1635
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,719
plans in it um

1636
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,599
and i think the

1637
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:02,078
headbanger meal i used um

1638
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,599
probably was not the best pick

1639
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,039
that's probably why that's what i

1640
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,119
started it off with

1641
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,599
um then from the back cross one i found

1642
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,519
some really good males here and

1643
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,039
i used multiple males as well in this

1644
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:14,719
back cross yeah

1645
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:16,639
hell yeah hell yeah

1646
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,879
so what do you feel is the proper

1647
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,039
breeding etiquette for using someone

1648
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,640
else's work do you kind of think that if

1649
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:25,199
you bought it you don't really owe them

1650
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:26,639
anything or how do you like to deal with

1651
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:29,199
other breeders when you're using some of

1652
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,798
their work well what i did here is

1653
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,519
normally wrong yeah

1654
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:35,519
i think yeah i think it's wrong um if

1655
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:37,759
you buy seats and this is all about

1656
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,280
commercial sales yeah if you do whatever

1657
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,799
you do for yourself your friends and

1658
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,839
trainers that's a totally different

1659
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:44,880
thing yeah um but if you buy someone's

1660
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:48,318
seats

1661
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,039
um you don't in cross them um and then

1662
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:53,599
sell them like a pure version yeah

1663
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:55,759
that's that's kind of a no-go thing um

1664
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,838
but outcrossing yeah yeah you buy those

1665
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,839
seeds they're yours yeah so when you buy

1666
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:01,838
my seeds cross it with whatever you want

1667
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:04,078
yeah that's of course and you can sell

1668
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:06,159
it as well that doesn't matter at all

1669
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,160
that's freedom if you don't want people

1670
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:10,719
to do that then you shouldn't sell seeds

1671
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,399
yeah it's that simple yeah most

1672
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:15,838
certainly and so

1673
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,480
do you like to if it's at all possible

1674
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,159
kind of open lines of communication with

1675
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,639
someone if you are going to use some of

1676
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:25,519
their work or you just tend to use it

1677
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:27,920
and do your thing well apart from this

1678
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:30,960
sour d thing because i didn't uh talk to

1679
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,119
raz dog about that one um all my other

1680
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,280
things like co-ops or other things

1681
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,280
they're all like in agreement with these

1682
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,760
people yeah most times they give me this

1683
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,640
stuff to do that with it yeah

1684
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,480
so if you look at sour power og hordy

1685
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,719
lab gives me that cut yeah i'm very good

1686
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,719
friends with camarado he gives me stuff

1687
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,639
to do things with yeah i do it the same

1688
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:52,159
the other way um

1689
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:53,598
i mean i share a lot with a lot of

1690
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,920
people yeah also a lot of people that

1691
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,680
have seed companies and stuff i share

1692
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,079
stuff with them which is not for my own

1693
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:03,199
work as well yeah like i have a very big

1694
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,960
um genetic seed stash here um i shared

1695
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,439
stuff from that through the years with a

1696
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,519
lot of people online and

1697
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,599
a lot of people made things with it

1698
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:12,798
started lines with it and stuff like

1699
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,640
that

1700
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:17,519
yeah most certainly so it's interesting

1701
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:19,598
that you bring up the sour power because

1702
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,679
i think it's it's an interesting strain

1703
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,559
for mostly one reason but it's probably

1704
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:24,960
more

1705
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,280
how do you feel about undisclosed

1706
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,039
genetics and would you ever release a

1707
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,280
cross where you didn't

1708
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,400
release the genetic information around

1709
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,640
it

1710
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,480
now if i know it then i will i'll always

1711
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,078
tell it yeah but

1712
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,719
because with how things are you

1713
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,200
sometimes don't even know yeah

1714
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:45,519
yeah okay so do you feel like with hordy

1715
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,838
labs they truly didn't know

1716
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,159
what the uh the star bud was or do you

1717
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,599
think that that was a bit of a marketing

1718
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,679
ploy

1719
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,599
no i think you really don't know

1720
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:57,038
and the other question about them i

1721
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,119
wanted to quickly ask was i had heard

1722
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:03,680
some whispers saying that

1723
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:05,838
old dave watson a skunk man sam is the

1724
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,558
the mastermind behind hordy labs do you

1725
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:10,159
know if that's true or not

1726
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,359
no i know

1727
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,838
the

1728
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:15,519
guy behind horny lab that's not david

1729
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:17,038
watson

1730
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:18,318
he knows him though

1731
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,559
i mean

1732
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:21,679
he knows him though i i i think he knows

1733
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:26,000
them

1734
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:27,919
i mean david is in is in amsterdam um

1735
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,719
hardy used to be

1736
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,159
in amsterdam a lot as well um they have

1737
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:33,598
an acquaintance

1738
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:36,078
you know so

1739
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,680
yeah no they do they they must have met

1740
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,240
each other a couple of times but he's

1741
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,838
definitely not behind it yeah

1742
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:45,038
okay cool

1743
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:47,759
so the sour power og your your work with

1744
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,440
the sour power is a lime which

1745
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,880
definitely gets a lot of attention and i

1746
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,039
mean the photos on your instagram

1747
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,559
they're gorgeous how do you feel about

1748
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,240
that cross of yours is it one of your

1749
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,839
ones that you're more kind of proud to

1750
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,759
put forward or do you feel like there's

1751
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:01,759
kind of other ones that you'd be more

1752
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,520
looking to get people to grow if they

1753
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,079
had a choice

1754
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:08,559
um i think flavors are always very

1755
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,079
personal yeah i mean i like sour d most

1756
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,160
of everything

1757
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,359
and so i kind of always pick something

1758
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:15,920
that has

1759
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:18,159
so i mean sour power og has sour in it

1760
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,960
yeah but headbanger is way more like a

1761
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:22,719
sour d-type hybrid yeah so i would

1762
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,159
prefer personally to

1763
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:26,159
smoke that

1764
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,480
and when it comes to growing sour power

1765
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,639
og is very sturdy plant

1766
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,559
um it's very easy very resinous yeah it

1767
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:33,440
looks beautiful as well

1768
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,160
um

1769
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,000
and it's pretty powerful as well yeah um

1770
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:40,960
so a lot of people find things in it

1771
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,639
they they keep and they can produce yeah

1772
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,519
definitely

1773
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:45,838
so

1774
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:48,960
if we just jump back to biker kush for a

1775
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:51,279
moment i noticed in an instagram thread

1776
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,440
you said that the initial mail you used

1777
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,559
on the hell's og

1778
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,159
was an sfv bx2 that you actually got

1779
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,000
from swerves gear

1780
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,598
swerve's a guy who gets a bit of flack

1781
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,719
from some people in the community so i'd

1782
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,720
be interested to hear what's your

1783
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,399
opinions on the cali con and swerves

1784
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,159
gear in general

1785
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,760
well let me say i got those seeds from

1786
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:14,078
captain [ __ ] yeah um but uh swerve said

1787
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,839
he he makes them um

1788
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:18,559
those two people used to work with each

1789
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:20,960
other so whatever it is i don't know

1790
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:23,599
don't know yeah um

1791
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,639
as for swerve um i know him as a person

1792
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,480
um

1793
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:29,279
he may have made some mistakes here in

1794
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,358
the area he was young um

1795
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,200
i don't know when it comes to

1796
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:35,598
when it comes to the breeding or

1797
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:37,838
how he runs his business or how he named

1798
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,680
some of his strains i have a very

1799
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:42,880
different philosophy on that yeah and

1800
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:45,838
how i do things yeah i would never cross

1801
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,000
call across the name of the clone yet

1802
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,838
um because when the people grow them out

1803
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,440
after that yeah everybody starts to call

1804
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:53,920
it that and that's where

1805
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,838
all this mess comes from yeah like in

1806
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,960
europe there are so many people who say

1807
01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:01,199
i have sfvog

1808
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,639
i have a

1809
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:07,759
larry og yeah and this larry og is larry

1810
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:10,239
or g times whatever it is yeah

1811
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,799
um so yeah i have different views on

1812
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:15,118
things and stuff um

1813
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:16,239
but he's definitely not a bad guy yeah

1814
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,358
though

1815
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:20,879
as a person he's a really nice guy

1816
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:23,598
yeah for sure

1817
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,519
so when you're thinking about oh gee in

1818
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,119
general i'm i kind of already asked this

1819
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:29,679
question in relation to happy brother

1820
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,079
but in specifically for og

1821
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:34,558
what in your mind is the perfect partner

1822
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,559
for an og cross

1823
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,599
i think og

1824
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,920
does not cross well with um like very

1825
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,359
sativa type things like the real hazes

1826
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,880
and stuff yeah i don't think that

1827
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:48,639
crosses well

1828
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:50,079
um what i think crosses well with ogs or

1829
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:52,239
um

1830
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,010
to be honest kind of tighter body type

1831
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,078
things yeah like um

1832
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:59,200
[Music]

1833
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:01,280
there was a good example um

1834
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,838
like oh geez chems and sours yeah which

1835
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,319
are all kind of pretty maybe even

1836
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:08,159
related yeah um those things all mix

1837
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,798
with each other pretty well as well yeah

1838
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,960
it makes yields go up um

1839
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:16,960
it does keep the flavor kind of pure um

1840
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,119
i'm not the biggest fan of crossing them

1841
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,280
out to like fruity things and stuff it's

1842
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,798
kind of like most times it weakens both

1843
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,880
of them yeah

1844
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:27,358
yeah definitely i i would tend to agree

1845
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,358
that the the cam and the og do tend to

1846
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:31,440
blend pretty well together and what a

1847
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:34,400
perfect segue in terms of talking about

1848
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,639
that collab you did with jj from top dog

1849
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,639
how did you find the road dog came out

1850
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:42,239
and did that stimulate you to want to

1851
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:44,639
look into the chem genetics a bit more i

1852
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:48,479
like chem genetics a lot yeah

1853
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:48,480
i prefer chem 91

1854
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,880
probably most

1855
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,920
because probably because it's more gassy

1856
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,480
i guess

1857
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,440
i think camdee is one of the strongest

1858
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,599
um

1859
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,798
that's star dog that i use that's from

1860
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,880
one of his earlier releases as well

1861
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:05,838
at the farm

1862
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,240
and

1863
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:10,558
that's the own selected cut as well

1864
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:12,479
and i i like the i like the outcome of

1865
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,519
that a lot yeah um

1866
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,640
it's very

1867
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:19,278
gassy mostly most of them um

1868
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,039
the only problem with that line is and

1869
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,640
with i think with some

1870
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:24,960
most of these scams yeah is they don't

1871
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,440
have that long of a shelf life so if you

1872
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,279
make a lot of flour of it and you keep

1873
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:31,119
it for three four months

1874
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:33,759
it tends to

1875
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:36,399
like get a darker tint and stuff like

1876
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:38,000
that faster than a lot of other strains

1877
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,079
so i kind of like to smoke it a bit

1878
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,479
fresher as well i like to smoke it three

1879
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:45,519
four weeks after it comes down

1880
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:47,838
yeah most certainly i can attest to

1881
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,159
the more fresher stuff just being so

1882
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:52,318
punch in your face strong so with that

1883
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:54,238
comment being said though what strains

1884
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,880
do you think have a good shelf life and

1885
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:59,439
that longevity within the flower

1886
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,838
oh that's with the hazes they they're

1887
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,919
really good at like they're even better

1888
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:06,079
after six months

1889
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,399
and if you take them out of the bag or

1890
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:10,798
out of your jar after two years

1891
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:12,879
they are still 100 dead yeah

1892
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:16,158
sour d does really well as well yeah you

1893
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,798
can jar that up for a long time yeah

1894
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:21,119
yeah very very interesting i think um it

1895
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:23,359
was in fact aj who put a post up

1896
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,439
yesterday of some six month old

1897
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,520
uh sour and he was saying yeah it

1898
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:30,079
definitely tastes better

1899
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:33,199
yeah the longer sativa type things are

1900
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:35,920
more sativa genes they tend to

1901
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:38,079
cure a better for long term

1902
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,079
i have the same with og's i like my og's

1903
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:41,359
to be smoked within six months after

1904
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:44,158
harvest

1905
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:46,400
yeah okay i think i've sadly never had

1906
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:48,719
the production capacity or patience to

1907
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:51,358
wait that long to smoke any stuff i've

1908
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,600
grown but i've got a new benchmark

1909
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,640
yeah you'll see with most like tight

1910
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,560
indica type buds yeah um

1911
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,360
they are kind of better smoked a bit

1912
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,760
faster and then the hazes they they're

1913
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:05,439
kind of better if they've laid like at

1914
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,480
least three months

1915
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:10,238
yeah okay and so in general what are

1916
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:12,559
some of the other strains you find that

1917
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:14,799
are best fresh off the bat you know just

1918
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,280
a few weeks after coming down

1919
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,760
um i think like um

1920
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:22,158
these more fruity type things yeah um

1921
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,400
that people like a lot these days yeah

1922
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:27,439
that type of stuff doesn't cure well for

1923
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:29,119
long term as well yeah um which is also

1924
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,839
kind of why the live resins and

1925
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:34,158
everything of them are way better than

1926
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,119
the cured resins of those type of plants

1927
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:37,119
a lot of times as well

1928
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:41,279
yeah i can definitely agree with that

1929
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:45,198
the the live resin from some of the

1930
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:46,880
fruity stuff is off the chain so just to

1931
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:49,119
jump back to uh some of the

1932
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,039
collaborations you've done before i

1933
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:53,279
noticed you you've done a plethora of

1934
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:55,039
collabs it's quite impressive out of all

1935
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,119
the ones you've done

1936
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:59,279
what were you most surprised with and i

1937
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,359
shouldn't say surprised but which one

1938
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,079
were you most pleasantly

1939
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:06,238
surprised to see the end outcome like

1940
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:07,920
which one was just really good and you

1941
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:09,439
always you always go into something

1942
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,880
thinking it's going to be a good outcome

1943
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:12,799
but you were just blown away by the

1944
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,719
result

1945
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,760
um

1946
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,560
i like a lot when i the camaraderie og

1947
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,400
came out as even though it's og and i

1948
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,520
already had a lot of 4g

1949
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:26,559
um

1950
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,480
i just like that a lot um apart from

1951
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,280
that something which is not that known

1952
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:34,319
yet is um african dream

1953
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:39,359
which is jj's nigerian haze times wide

1954
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:41,679
a5 that came out like wow as well yeah

1955
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:44,479
yeah i mean that that's a really diverse

1956
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:47,840
mix of genetics in there like the

1957
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:50,879
the sativa african with the uh the a5

1958
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,800
white that's that's got to be special

1959
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,600
yeah those are really nice yeah they're

1960
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,520
really nice they're very sativish style

1961
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,120
in grow and stuff like that yeah so

1962
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,760
they'll be

1963
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:03,679
mostly 12-14 weeks

1964
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,840
yeah okay it's only for the truly

1965
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,600
committed sativa heads

1966
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,400
yeah if you want to grow real hazes you

1967
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:14,159
you got to be accepting to go

1968
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:15,519
between 12 and 16 to 17 weeks sometimes

1969
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:16,399
even

1970
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,360
yeah

1971
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,639
yeah okay so this kind of brings us to

1972
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,719
one of the

1973
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,400
questions i've been most excited to ask

1974
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:26,079
you about going into this

1975
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:28,238
a little birdie told me that you have

1976
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:29,679
some projects in the works with bodhi

1977
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:31,678
would you be able to elaborate a little

1978
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,679
more on that for us

1979
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,560
um

1980
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:39,279
i don't know that much about it yet to

1981
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,719
be really honest um

1982
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:43,279
my friend

1983
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,119
is settling that up yeah so i haven't

1984
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,439
that's not fully worked out yet so

1985
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:49,439
there's not much i can say yet to be

1986
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:52,719
really honest yeah

1987
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:53,839
so your bird flies fast your bird flies

1988
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:57,039
really fast

1989
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:58,079
yeah i got little birds everywhere but

1990
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,399
but um

1991
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:03,840
the question i'd love to ask then is in

1992
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:05,359
in your kind of dream situation what

1993
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,520
types of things would you want to bring

1994
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:09,679
to the table and what types of things do

1995
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,360
you think that he has that would be cool

1996
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:13,920
if he was bringing that side of the

1997
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:15,359
cross to the table

1998
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,359
um

1999
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:20,719
i'd love to

2000
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:22,399
have um some involvement with his nepali

2001
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,719
gene cool

2002
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,000
definitely that's what i brought

2003
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:29,198
yeah

2004
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,359
um what would come from me um knowing

2005
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:33,839
him and what interests him i think it

2006
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:35,359
would be the hazes though

2007
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,440
i think that's what

2008
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,880
probably i have that probably interests

2009
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:42,238
him the most

2010
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:44,719
i mean oh geez or and sauer he he has it

2011
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:47,599
all yeah and so i think he would prefer

2012
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:51,279
those gene pools more

2013
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:54,159
because he did the band-aid haze which

2014
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:58,000
was done with the a5 tie those seats i

2015
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:59,679
sent all over the world years ago

2016
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:05,439
so i think it would be like probably

2017
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:06,960
that gene pool a5 c5 um dosas

2018
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,879
yeah okay so

2019
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,520
funnily enough this is a good segue i

2020
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,640
heard from a different little birdie

2021
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,400
that and you referenced it before the uh

2022
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,880
you might have access to some of

2023
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:22,079
neville's original breeder cuts like the

2024
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,840
c5 and the a5 for example

2025
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,840
is this true and what plans do you have

2026
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,119
with them

2027
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,719
no i've

2028
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,439
in the

2029
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:33,679
early 2000s

2030
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:38,158
i used to make a lot of clones

2031
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:38,158
of all these plants for that group

2032
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:43,439
i've been kind of part of that southern

2033
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,359
which is where i live as well yeah i

2034
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,158
live in south holland

2035
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:48,479
um

2036
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:51,039
so i've been connected to this group

2037
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:52,879
since i was really young

2038
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:56,880
okay and they're the crew who kind of

2039
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:59,600
safeguard the c5 and the a5

2040
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,279
yeah they worked with neville's as well

2041
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,000
when he was here

2042
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:05,599
okay so i guess the thing which maybe a

2043
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,679
lot of people might be interested to

2044
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,600
hear is that like a lot of these breeder

2045
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:13,119
cuts do still exist which i was

2046
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,600
surprised to hear myself initially

2047
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:17,439
yeah now these cuts are um

2048
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,840
well some people call them breeder cuts

2049
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:24,639
they they come out of his breeding yeah

2050
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:30,239
so c5 is is the nl5 times the haze mill

2051
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:32,239
c um the a5 is nl5 then the haze mill a

2052
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:34,238
there's not even one cut yet there's

2053
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:36,559
more cuts of it as well when that

2054
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:38,639
selection was done yeah but most people

2055
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:41,039
only know one or two

2056
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,440
um then there's hph which is the hash

2057
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:46,479
plant haze

2058
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:49,678
the ag-13

2059
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,599
there's a couple more even yeah um

2060
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:53,840
like for instance the a5 is which most

2061
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,000
people are interested in yeah

2062
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,079
there were five cuts of that they are

2063
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,640
labeled one to five

2064
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,319
number five being the most sativa

2065
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,159
um

2066
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:06,238
the number two is what some called the

2067
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:08,158
diesel cut which is the cut i work with

2068
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:08,879
the cut that i gave to sammy and which

2069
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:11,439
is

2070
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,440
went out a little bit to some people

2071
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:15,519
and that's the number two

2072
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,759
um the number four

2073
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,360
is still around as well but that never

2074
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,840
forgot grown that much it's way more

2075
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:21,839
hazy

2076
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:26,079
and do you feel like these are really

2077
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,319
kind of

2078
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,840
the benchmark to try to aim for with

2079
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:32,079
breeding or do you think they're just

2080
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,840
impressive for when they were produced

2081
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:35,840
given it was you know 30 years ago

2082
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,819
no those cuts are very special still

2083
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,440
100 very special

2084
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:45,198
[Music]

2085
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:49,039
i think it's the combination with the

2086
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:50,158
nl5 uh and those haze that really makes

2087
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:51,039
it yeah

2088
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:54,879
um

2089
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:57,439
like that haze pure from those days um

2090
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:00,239
kind of tickles me way less than these

2091
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:03,439
two plants yeah

2092
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:05,519
yeah a5 is a really special one to be

2093
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:08,158
honest

2094
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,560
yeah okay yeah i remember i was lucky

2095
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:13,119
enough to try some of the c5 when i was

2096
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,440
hanging out with bodhi and he too said

2097
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:16,019
that a lot of people think the a5 is a

2098
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:17,599
little better

2099
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,120
[Music]

2100
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,280
yeah a pipe's very strong weed um

2101
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:22,559
[Music]

2102
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,158
and it's the type of wheat you kind of

2103
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,920
need to smoke quite a lot of it and then

2104
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:27,439
you can get to a level you don't get

2105
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,079
with other wheat

2106
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:32,559
these days at all yeah it is a lot about

2107
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:34,319
uh how it works this weed yeah how it

2108
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,640
makes you feel yeah that's very

2109
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:37,519
important with that weed

2110
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,079
um

2111
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,320
like the c5 if you smoke a lot of that

2112
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:43,198
you won't almost won't be able to sleep

2113
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:45,359
yeah

2114
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:48,399
like you won't be sleeping well at all

2115
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:50,479
yeah um some people get very paranoid of

2116
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:52,238
the c5 as well yeah

2117
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,479
um

2118
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:58,238
it's also people that only smoke indicas

2119
01:17:54,479 --> 01:18:00,079
if you let them smoke a5 they'll be like

2120
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:02,479
blattered yeah they don't know what

2121
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,640
happened to them yeah they'll be like

2122
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:07,039
out of it yeah yeah now it's really

2123
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,719
funny it's really funny and sometimes

2124
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:10,880
when i go to like one of these coffee

2125
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,960
shops here then um i'll bring some of

2126
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,640
that and all they smoke is amnesia and

2127
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,399
oge yeah today

2128
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,440
and you let them smoke like two or three

2129
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:21,119
joints of that yeah oh they're all like

2130
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:22,960
flat out yeah

2131
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:24,960
it just makes them feel so different

2132
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,679
yeah they're not used to it

2133
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:30,480
i love it yeah the the sample i got to

2134
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:32,480
smoke it was actually seeded so it's

2135
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:35,119
probably nowhere near as potent as the

2136
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,399
scentsy but that c5 i can totally agree

2137
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:38,399
it was so

2138
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:40,399
uplifting and stimulating that like

2139
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,479
paranoia was the next logical step if

2140
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:44,399
you kept smoking it

2141
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:47,359
yeah and then i got the this cut the

2142
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:50,319
bandaid hay seven which

2143
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:52,799
bodhi bread the line then duck selected

2144
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:55,279
that cut um i've smoked a couple of

2145
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,440
hundred grams of that now

2146
01:18:55,279 --> 01:19:00,238
that that got a really good high as well

2147
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:03,039
yeah that's comparable to like a ca5

2148
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:05,599
yeah it really is on that level yeah

2149
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:07,519
that's a really nice plant they did that

2150
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,440
one really really well

2151
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,120
definitely definitely a shout out to doc

2152
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:12,879
and bodhi that's uh that's another

2153
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:14,960
really good one which i don't think is

2154
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,880
on the radar of enough people

2155
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,640
but just to jump back to where we all

2156
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,560
started this question which was in

2157
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,159
regards to kind of neville

2158
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,239
where do you think neville rates in

2159
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,079
terms of the the great breeders

2160
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,238
throughout the dutch history and and of

2161
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:29,840
all the breeders throughout history who

2162
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,678
has had the greatest influence in your

2163
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,440
opinion

2164
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,359
i think

2165
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:37,119
if you really look at all the work that

2166
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:39,439
people done

2167
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:42,800
he i mean he did quite some work with

2168
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:45,039
his very early days as well yeah so

2169
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,039
it's just him and a few other people as

2170
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:49,359
well yeah when it comes to the seeds

2171
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:50,479
that go out and get sold

2172
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:53,039
um

2173
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:55,119
so i those plans are very special yeah

2174
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:55,920
and he is very knowledgeable on it as

2175
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:58,800
well

2176
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,399
um but i think like uh simon from

2177
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,039
serious seeds

2178
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:06,158
that guy has been doing it way

2179
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:08,800
that guy really did a lot and um

2180
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:10,799
still does it um

2181
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,039
you know he's really good

2182
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,199
um someone that most people don't even

2183
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:20,000
think or know about anymore casey brains

2184
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:20,000
did some nice things as well um

2185
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,600
there's a there's a couple of people

2186
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,359
most of those people are not that known

2187
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,239
yet because they're not the ones

2188
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:30,559
out there or doing the sieve company

2189
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:33,198
yeah so casey brains is a very

2190
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:35,600
interesting one because he's famous for

2191
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:37,919
never releasing any of the information

2192
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,079
around his genetics i mean in some

2193
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,399
instances he says himself he doesn't

2194
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:44,000
know and in other instances i think it

2195
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,000
was just also the way he named his

2196
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,600
strains how do you feel about his

2197
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,920
strains i think earlier on you mentioned

2198
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,000
that you've got a special k2 clone does

2199
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,800
that come from him

2200
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,760
no no that's not uh that's not from him

2201
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,279
um

2202
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,719
no it's his strange um

2203
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:04,238
even though some of them have quite a

2204
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:06,560
lot of variation yeah um his seeds from

2205
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:08,718
what i've seen it been a little while i

2206
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,400
i just had new ones of it so i'm gonna

2207
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:13,359
germ them all see if they're still the

2208
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:15,839
same and he says they are so um he said

2209
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:16,799
he's still using his old mom's

2210
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,119
um

2211
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,440
they have some very fruity interesting

2212
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:23,198
flavors in there yeah if you like all

2213
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:25,519
the fruit things it's definitely a

2214
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:27,198
really nice source for

2215
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,400
all kind of different things to be

2216
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:30,799
honest yeah

2217
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:34,319
um he used a lot of um

2218
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:36,880
brazilian and afghani genes

2219
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:39,198
yeah the brazilian is one which doesn't

2220
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,560
really get explored outside of his work

2221
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:42,399
do you think there might be something in

2222
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,400
there that we're just brushing over and

2223
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:45,920
missing

2224
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,799
yeah i have a couple of brazilian

2225
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,039
friends here um

2226
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,719
yeah i think that's why i'm doing this

2227
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,639
project with them i'm popping all those

2228
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,439
feeds with them because they know all

2229
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:59,199
the old brazilian things that were

2230
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,238
around you

2231
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:02,079
um

2232
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,678
now they definitely say there there has

2233
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:09,039
been a lot of lime and melon um those

2234
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:12,880
type of terpenes and smells that they

2235
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:12,880
were there like long ago

2236
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:18,719
yeah okay and so i think most people at

2237
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,480
least when i talk to them the only real

2238
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,760
exposure they have to the brazilian

2239
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:24,399
genetics is

2240
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,400
that mango bishop from b

2241
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,319
and i think that you know maybe

2242
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,399
sometimes it gives things a bad rap you

2243
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,399
know how do you feel some of these

2244
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:33,679
genetics would go if put in people's

2245
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:35,039
grow rooms do you think people would

2246
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:37,440
give them a second chance or they're

2247
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:40,000
still not quite refined to the poly

2248
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,279
hybrid level we're used to

2249
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,198
um

2250
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,679
i think some of casey brains ones

2251
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:47,119
definitely

2252
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:49,840
could be like

2253
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:52,399
being commercial produced here

2254
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,239
for today's market and being like really

2255
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:57,119
wanted by the people that smoke it

2256
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:57,119
afterwards as well

2257
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:02,158
yeah i think he's very open

2258
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,239
yeah i think i just opened a little hole

2259
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:06,479
for everybody to

2260
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:07,839
find a lot of i mean everybody wants all

2261
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,319
these um

2262
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,480
fruity type flavors and things like that

2263
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:14,799
yeah well this guy definitely has a lot

2264
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:14,799
of it

2265
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,000
yeah okay

2266
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:20,638
so getting back to a point i've been

2267
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,039
bringing up in recent interviews do you

2268
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:25,279
see this as a way to reinvigorate modern

2269
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:28,000
genetics like a common complaint is that

2270
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:30,559
we've worked ourselves into kind of like

2271
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,800
this dead end polyhybrid type of thing

2272
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,960
where there's this same same quality

2273
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,960
amongst a lot of strains do you think

2274
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,719
that we need to go back to basics to

2275
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,359
some of these land races or just some of

2276
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:43,760
these more unworked lines and generate

2277
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:46,559
new hybrids

2278
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,719
oh yeah definitely man i think i think

2279
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,159
a lot of people have

2280
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,239
it all depends with the goal you're

2281
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:54,638
making seas for yeah and most people

2282
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:56,799
that do it today or start today

2283
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,639
they make those seats to sell them

2284
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,119
um and they look at what the market

2285
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:02,880
wants or that's easy for them to sell

2286
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:04,639
sell yeah and they get noticed for that

2287
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,639
everybody wants cookies so they all

2288
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,800
crush it with cookies yeah

2289
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:11,679
which kind of takes away their personal

2290
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,760
creativity and for me a breeder is like

2291
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,279
an artist yeah like a painter

2292
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,119
yeah so

2293
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:18,880
if everybody starts to make similar

2294
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:20,238
paintings it kind of gets boring very

2295
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,560
fast

2296
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:24,638
i think today's gene pool and the seeds

2297
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,560
that are on the market there's so many

2298
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,480
of the similar type things yeah and

2299
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,719
that's because everybody just takes all

2300
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:33,279
the cuts that are shared

2301
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:35,119
um and then pollinates it with something

2302
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:36,158
that's just been released for a year or

2303
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,079
whatever

2304
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:39,439
yeah so yeah

2305
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:40,960
you just get everything crossed with

2306
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,960
each other now yeah

2307
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:45,279
um so yeah i definitely think it's good

2308
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,158
for people to

2309
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:48,079
or

2310
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:49,599
seek a goal in like a terpenes or

2311
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:51,679
whatever you want to make lemon then

2312
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,360
find as much different lemon genetics as

2313
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:55,679
you can doesn't matter what it is what

2314
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:59,119
the name is or whatever and then start

2315
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:00,880
searching in that yourself yeah

2316
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:02,238
same for all kind of other terpenes or

2317
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,319
other things you want to do yeah if you

2318
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:06,158
want to make a haze try and find as much

2319
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:08,639
different haze genetics

2320
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:10,960
as genuine as you can germinate mold

2321
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,840
forget all the names and just pick what

2322
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:17,439
you like and start from there

2323
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:19,520
yeah that's that's a good idea would you

2324
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:21,519
would you actually do that yourself in

2325
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,840
terms of say like popping like a hundred

2326
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,320
seeds just losing all the name tags and

2327
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,360
just seeing what came out

2328
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:29,439
um

2329
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:31,519
yeah i'd love to do it to be honest i'll

2330
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:33,519
be honest i've never been as bold to

2331
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,920
really do it in the end

2332
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:38,719
i always put the tags in though

2333
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,800
but yeah that's kind of that's the best

2334
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:42,719
way to be really honest yeah um you

2335
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,199
should just put a number on everything

2336
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:47,600
write it on a paper lock it up

2337
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,039
do the whole grow do your selection pick

2338
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,920
what you like most and then look what

2339
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:52,079
you

2340
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,920
what it was that's kind of the fairest

2341
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:56,800
and the honest thing to do as well yeah

2342
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:59,119
we all get influenced otherwise yeah

2343
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,800
yeah i mean names can have a really

2344
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:02,559
powerful effect on the way people

2345
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,639
perceive them

2346
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:07,120
how do you feel about the whole candy

2347
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,960
rain situation from cookie fam do you

2348
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:11,198
feel like they really dropped the ball

2349
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:13,198
on that one

2350
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:15,519
no they definitely dropped the ball

2351
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:18,079
yeah that's just effects to be really

2352
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,000
honest yeah um

2353
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:23,519
i mean i'm not scared of

2354
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,359
germinating um i call it messy genetics

2355
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,040
yeah i'm not scared of everything i'll

2356
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,439
germinate by the thousands i don't care

2357
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:31,119
i kill all the intersex or whatever and

2358
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:33,599
things like that i'm not scared for

2359
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:35,359
those things but um

2360
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:39,039
those seeds

2361
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:40,880
clearly were not even tested yeah

2362
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:43,359
yeah otherwise this could never happen

2363
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:46,719
it's that it's that simple so um

2364
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:49,198
everybody knows i'm like very strict on

2365
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:51,119
everything needs to be tested you cannot

2366
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:53,039
just make seats and start selling them

2367
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:54,960
yeah that's like

2368
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:57,359
for me that's like not even possible to

2369
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,600
do yeah even though in today's market

2370
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:02,319
that's like probably [ __ ] more than

2371
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,320
50 percent

2372
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:09,119
yeah people can't pay to be a test

2373
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,960
yeah so how do you feel in general about

2374
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:13,519
the price that was charged for those

2375
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,800
seeds whether they had issues or not do

2376
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,120
you feel like

2377
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:19,520
it's an ever growing precedent for there

2378
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:22,479
to be these premium price seeds or do

2379
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,239
you think it was just a bit absurd

2380
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:26,638
well i think it's absurd i mean look

2381
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,718
what i sold the sour d because too i

2382
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,400
could have sold those for whatever i

2383
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:33,198
wanted yeah and people would have bought

2384
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:35,920
them right away i sell them for a price

2385
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:36,638
that i think is like almost the max of

2386
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,279
what

2387
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:40,880
seeds should be costing yeah

2388
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:43,679
i don't think seeds should be going

2389
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,359
above 150

2390
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,520
i think that should be kind of a cap

2391
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:49,039
yeah even though that has changed

2392
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,440
totally today

2393
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:54,238
and but i will i personally prefer not

2394
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:55,678
to sell anything about that

2395
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:57,119
so do you think that there should be

2396
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:58,960
kind of like

2397
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:00,559
i i don't want to use the term but

2398
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,480
there's nothing else that would fit as

2399
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,880
well but kind of like a union for

2400
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:07,919
breeders where like you agree on like

2401
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:10,159
price ceilings and price flaws and kind

2402
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,319
of like structure among seed pricing

2403
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:14,319
like an f2 you can charge this much and

2404
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:17,840
f1 you can only charge this much how

2405
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:17,840
would you feel about that concept

2406
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:21,519
no i think it's got to be a free market

2407
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,279
i mean

2408
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,679
every every other product is a free

2409
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:26,960
market yeah you can buy sunglasses for a

2410
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,800
euro

2411
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,399
you can buy sunglasses for a thousand

2412
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,159
euro yeah

2413
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:33,920
you know what i mean uh

2414
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:35,599
i don't think that

2415
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,319
no i don't think there should be a stand

2416
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,320
rule i think it's a principle yeah i

2417
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:41,119
think seats are worth that and you

2418
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:42,719
should

2419
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:44,399
if you take a lot of time reading

2420
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:46,880
something you're not

2421
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:48,799
gonna sell it for once yeah or only sell

2422
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,119
two or three hundred packs yeah you're

2423
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:54,560
gonna do that for years

2424
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:58,559
yeah so you don't need to ask 500

2425
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,920
or 400 to 500 300 for a package of seats

2426
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,760
yeah

2427
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,760
then these they all they do is like oh

2428
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,560
this is limited yeah this will never be

2429
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:08,239
there anymore these are very rare uh all

2430
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,480
these things and then that it should be

2431
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:12,079
expensive for that yeah no that's not

2432
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,718
the way it works only thing that can be

2433
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,760
more expensive or seeds that are harder

2434
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:18,158
to make

2435
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:20,079
and take longer to make

2436
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:22,158
things like that yeah or that took a lot

2437
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:24,559
of money to make so a lot of breeding

2438
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:28,799
steps yeah so yeah they need to be a bit

2439
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:30,880
more expensive to recoup your investment

2440
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,760
yeah no i mean that certainly makes

2441
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:35,760
sense so on a slightly related topic i

2442
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,520
noticed on your ig that some of your new

2443
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,360
seed packaging the what the pack i

2444
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:42,239
noticed specifically was the guava

2445
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:44,639
gelato cross sourdi sounds amazing by

2446
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:46,319
the way but i noticed on it that said

2447
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:48,719
premium seeds and it got me thinking

2448
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:50,559
about this idea of like breeders having

2449
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:52,000
different tiers of genetics like a

2450
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,679
premium line where like kind of like

2451
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,279
more work had gone into it or just kind

2452
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,440
of like more of like a quicker project

2453
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,479
but it was still ready for market

2454
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:01,279
do you think you'd ever look into

2455
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:01,279
something like this

2456
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:07,919
um i always try to like classify some of

2457
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,760
the seeds like i i do a lot of things

2458
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,239
that they're not normally not sold or

2459
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,000
released yeah but then sometimes once a

2460
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:17,119
year i'll bring them out to like a

2461
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,560
spannabis or whatever um i'll call those

2462
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:19,439
exclusives

2463
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,080
yeah

2464
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:25,359
um then i will only like sell like 10 20

2465
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:28,479
packs or whatever things like that um

2466
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:32,079
but normally um i'll breed a line and i

2467
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:33,919
intend to sell it for many years yeah

2468
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:35,439
and i spent a couple of years to make

2469
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,829
them as well yeah

2470
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:36,960
um

2471
01:30:35,829 --> 01:30:38,960
[Music]

2472
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:41,920
then i think it's very

2473
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:44,719
reasonable to ask like 100 euros for

2474
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:47,440
those seeds as well

2475
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:50,639
yeah certainly i mean just to clarify

2476
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:52,479
i'm i'm a hundred percent uh in favor of

2477
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:55,840
the free market approach

2478
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:57,839
so a question which i get drilled by the

2479
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,920
fans if i don't ask it and heck i'm

2480
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,000
interested as well what traits do you

2481
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:05,039
look for when you're trying to find a

2482
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,960
good breeding male

2483
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:07,289
okay

2484
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,800
let me

2485
01:31:07,289 --> 01:31:11,679
[Music]

2486
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:14,560
start here then if you want to be able

2487
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:16,719
to pick a good male

2488
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,760
out of a gene pool

2489
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:21,198
you have to grow that gene pool

2490
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,000
first

2491
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:25,439
yeah so you cannot have a gene pool that

2492
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,319
you have never grown so i get these

2493
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:30,319
afghani seeds yeah i've never grown this

2494
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:31,920
these seeds that i have in my hand now

2495
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:34,079
yeah i may have grown of ghani's but

2496
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:36,079
that doesn't count yeah yeah so i'll pop

2497
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:38,559
these seeds here i need to grow

2498
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:41,519
quite a lot of those before i really

2499
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,039
know the percentages of everything that

2500
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,920
pops up um

2501
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:48,560
how common it is um all these things

2502
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:50,639
yeah and you get a relationship with

2503
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:53,520
that gene pool then as well yeah so you

2504
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:55,840
recognize things even without being able

2505
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,239
exactly to say oh it's because of these

2506
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,760
leaves oh it's because of that yeah

2507
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:01,279
because you grow them you know that

2508
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,199
family yeah

2509
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:04,000
um you need to have that before you can

2510
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:05,519
really

2511
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,600
select the mail

2512
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,199
and predict um

2513
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,920
all the trades that it's going to give

2514
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:14,719
yeah this is going to make your chances

2515
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,760
way bigger of picking the right male

2516
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:18,079
easier

2517
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,239
then of course there is the stem rub the

2518
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:22,559
structure

2519
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:24,319
all these other things yeah

2520
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,159
i'd always say with breeding and

2521
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:27,759
selecting the most important thing is

2522
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:29,599
killing a lot yeah

2523
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,600
you don't start by picking the best

2524
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:34,960
thing no you start by

2525
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:38,480
taking everything out that's not good

2526
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:41,198
whether it's weaker structure

2527
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:43,119
not strong against illnesses all these

2528
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:44,960
things yeah and then what you're left

2529
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:47,198
over that's where you're gonna pick it

2530
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,198
from

2531
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:52,960
yeah definitely and so are there any

2532
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:55,359
particular techniques or

2533
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,960
um traits that you're specifically

2534
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:59,679
looking for like i mean a really common

2535
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,600
one we get told on the show is the old

2536
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:03,920
faithful stem rub are you are you a fan

2537
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,880
of the stem rub

2538
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:10,158
i always do the stem rope as well yeah

2539
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:13,920
i do stammer another good trick we use

2540
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:16,079
is uh works with a lot of lines yeah um

2541
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,119
like when you've grown everything before

2542
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,319
yeah like i just said yeah um

2543
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:22,800
you can

2544
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:24,960
the females yeah um

2545
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,600
the females you like the most yeah if

2546
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:30,000
you write down the day exactly on when

2547
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,880
it started to throw pistols

2548
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,639
yeah

2549
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,960
and then when you look at all the males

2550
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:38,719
here and you look which one is closest

2551
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:41,439
to the same day starting its sex yeah

2552
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:43,920
and then you compare all the leaves

2553
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:47,279
shapes as well between these females

2554
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:50,480
then you can kind of pick amelia which

2555
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:52,559
has similar genes to that female

2556
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:56,079
yeah just by picking the day that it

2557
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:58,159
started to flower yeah

2558
01:33:56,079 --> 01:33:58,960
yeah definitely

2559
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:01,279
so

2560
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:04,000
with that being said have you ever

2561
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:05,840
considered or done a male reversal

2562
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,479
before where you you know turn it into

2563
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:12,159
the female so you can smell the smells

2564
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:12,158
look at the structure and whatnot

2565
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:16,638
no i haven't yet i'm very interested in

2566
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:20,320
doing that though and then it would be

2567
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,319
mostly for smelling it

2568
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,279
and do you feel like that there would be

2569
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:27,198
a good chance that that smell would

2570
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:29,279
correlate to like what the male is

2571
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:31,439
actually passing on

2572
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:33,519
if when you grew that gene pool and you

2573
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:36,479
grew all those seeds before

2574
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:39,280
and you've seen um that smell being a

2575
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:41,919
higher percentage in that group yes then

2576
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:45,279
yes because then you can almost you have

2577
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,880
a big chance that it's a dominant trait

2578
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:48,399
yeah okay

2579
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,159
so i mean while we're on the breeder

2580
01:34:48,399 --> 01:34:51,198
topic in general i mean you could

2581
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:52,960
probably say that about the whole

2582
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:55,118
interview but um

2583
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,439
in just relation to that candy rain

2584
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:58,880
situation we mentioned a few minutes ago

2585
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:01,359
what do you think is a breeder's

2586
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:03,039
responsibility in regards to seeds do

2587
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:04,880
you feel like it's you know the breeders

2588
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:07,359
responsibility to replace seeds that

2589
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:11,279
have poor results or do you feel like

2590
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:13,759
their obligation ends at the wholesaler

2591
01:35:11,279 --> 01:35:16,238
well i think that if you release c's and

2592
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:18,480
you tested them and stuff then you know

2593
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:19,439
what's not wrong with them yeah

2594
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,759
um

2595
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:24,319
so if then someone comes and says oh

2596
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:26,239
everything herms or

2597
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:28,639
everything does this yeah you know

2598
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:31,118
that's not right yeah or you know that

2599
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,239
person did something wrong yeah and well

2600
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:34,079
you can't do something wrong that

2601
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:35,759
everything hurts by the way yeah that's

2602
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:37,198
that's really difficult yeah so if

2603
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:39,199
everything hurts there's a problem with

2604
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:40,559
those seats it's that simple

2605
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:44,638
um

2606
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:46,719
yeah definitely so i mean just to really

2607
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:49,039
play the devil's advocate if someone

2608
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:51,439
comes to you and says oh you know i grew

2609
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:53,679
out of pacquiao seeds and i had one herm

2610
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:55,919
out of 10. i'm not real happy would you

2611
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:58,079
try to explain that that's like a

2612
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:00,158
possibility or would you just be more

2613
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:02,719
inclined to just try to make the problem

2614
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:04,479
go away so to speak

2615
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:07,279
oh i would definitely say that yeah

2616
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:08,638
that's i tried to find out why first

2617
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:10,800
yeah

2618
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:13,679
with him yeah because if it's something

2619
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:15,679
to do with the way it was grown or

2620
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:17,440
he triggered it yeah

2621
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:18,960
then it's nice for him to know as well

2622
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:22,238
yeah because then it won't happen in the

2623
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:24,719
future um when it's like one herm

2624
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:27,359
in certain strains well it comes with

2625
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:30,399
the territory as well then yeah um

2626
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:32,399
so but i if people are unhappy i always

2627
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:34,799
give them seeds yeah

2628
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:35,599
that's that's that's not even a question

2629
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,639
yeah

2630
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,679
um

2631
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:42,079
but i if i think it's right if one plant

2632
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:43,920
herms in a pack um

2633
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:46,158
like for instance with a cookie or a

2634
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,440
sink hybrid no that that's to be

2635
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:48,799
expected

2636
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:50,638
yeah

2637
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,719
most people won't complain even about it

2638
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,039
when it's those though those gene pools

2639
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:57,118
yeah because people know it already yeah

2640
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:59,039
um i mean i have the same when i pull up

2641
01:36:57,118 --> 01:37:00,799
someone else's seats i i've

2642
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:03,359
it doesn't matter if there's two three

2643
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:06,639
herms i i i would never complain about

2644
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:08,719
it to be honest personally yeah

2645
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,960
yeah i i certainly feel like it's it's

2646
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:13,920
part of the territory a lot of the time

2647
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:17,198
so a topic i really wanted to ask you

2648
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:20,239
about is just in general the concept of

2649
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:22,879
cali import how do you feel this affects

2650
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:25,439
local markets like i mean in the uk and

2651
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,679
in holland i'm sure that there's plenty

2652
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:30,158
of cali import do you feel like it hurts

2653
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:33,118
local producers or it's too simplistic

2654
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:36,399
to view it like that

2655
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:38,719
no i was at the spannabis uh this year

2656
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:41,839
and what i've seen is that the higher

2657
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:44,319
quality local grown yeah that price went

2658
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:46,880
way up and the only reason that went so

2659
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:49,039
up so high is because that import weed

2660
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:51,199
that was there before you

2661
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:54,479
because that is so expensive it kind of

2662
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:56,238
changed the market price yeah so um

2663
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:58,479
i think if local growers grow really

2664
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:00,638
good weed they get more money for their

2665
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:03,198
wheat because the import was there yeah

2666
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,960
and that changed the market prices

2667
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:06,879
and so how do you feel about the hype

2668
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,639
strains in general do you feel like it's

2669
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,639
a good or a bad thing that certain

2670
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:14,400
strains just get these

2671
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:16,480
mind-boggling mass followings

2672
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:17,679
oh that's that's just it's like fashion

2673
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:20,158
yeah

2674
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:22,319
that's just like fashion um

2675
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:24,479
a lot of times it's not the best wheat

2676
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,479
it's not the best flavor or things like

2677
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:29,279
that yeah it has to be decent for it to

2678
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:31,118
become a hype though um

2679
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:32,000
but yeah some things just look good yeah

2680
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:34,639
like

2681
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:39,279
a purple punch yeah it looks great yeah

2682
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:42,079
i i i i don't care for it at all yeah

2683
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:43,359
um but it looks great um so yeah people

2684
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:45,279
like that yeah then you have to think

2685
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:46,880
about a lot of things that get hyped is

2686
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:49,118
by

2687
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:51,520
the younger people as well yeah

2688
01:38:49,118 --> 01:38:53,279
um what have they seen

2689
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:55,920
before

2690
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:57,519
what is the knowledge they have yeah um

2691
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,600
they can only learn from the things that

2692
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,360
they see yeah so if only thing they've

2693
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,400
seen is that og

2694
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:06,158
that gelato and that cookie

2695
01:39:04,399 --> 01:39:09,039
which is better than

2696
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:11,198
the local swag or whatever yeah then i

2697
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:13,359
understand that that's that's gold yeah

2698
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:15,439
at that moment

2699
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:17,198
yeah most certainly

2700
01:39:15,439 --> 01:39:20,079
so while we're on the topic of hype

2701
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:21,519
strains it feels like gmo and even mac

2702
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:23,600
have kind of had their time in the

2703
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:25,119
spotlight what's your prediction for the

2704
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:28,480
next strain that's going to take the

2705
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:30,799
international stage by storm

2706
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:30,799
um

2707
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:37,199
i think the skittles and the papaya are

2708
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:39,599
doing really well on that scale to be

2709
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:39,599
honest

2710
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:45,760
when about something new um

2711
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,800
that's hard to say yeah because it's

2712
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:50,320
like a fashion or like a music uh number

2713
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,199
one hit yeah

2714
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:54,639
um

2715
01:39:51,198 --> 01:39:56,479
never kind of know where it comes from

2716
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:58,639
do you ever try to predict what will be

2717
01:39:56,479 --> 01:40:02,000
the next big thing and almost get ahead

2718
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:02,000
of the curve in that regard

2719
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:07,759
now to be honest i don't really i i

2720
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:09,349
prefer i try to just work in what i

2721
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,119
really like yeah um

2722
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:13,679
[Music]

2723
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:15,839
i try not to jump too fast on all the

2724
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:17,760
hype i'll work with the strains that are

2725
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,840
the hot thing though don't get me wrong

2726
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:21,360
but i'm always a bit later than the rest

2727
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:23,840
um

2728
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:25,118
i always like to grow all of them before

2729
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,079
um

2730
01:40:25,118 --> 01:40:30,639
so yeah so like i just did that gelato

2731
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:32,800
crossing um

2732
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:35,039
that's kind of bad as well yeah

2733
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,880
um it's taking some of the hype yeah and

2734
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:39,118
i'll cross with it what i like more yeah

2735
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,960
so i crossed it with sour d

2736
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:43,920
um

2737
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:46,719
so yeah no i i definitely

2738
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:48,239
use some of the hype strains but i'm not

2739
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:50,399
trying to like

2740
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:52,879
when something new is the hype and it's

2741
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:55,039
not my hype that means it's from someone

2742
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:58,400
else yeah i'm not the type of guy to

2743
01:40:55,039 --> 01:41:00,079
then uh take it fast um make it and be

2744
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:02,719
the first to throw those seeds into the

2745
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:04,960
market yeah

2746
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:07,600
yeah of course

2747
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,359
so um if we just loop back to the mac

2748
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,600
for a moment i noticed a while back on

2749
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:14,158
your instagram you put a post up and you

2750
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:16,320
had managed to accumulate 10 packs of

2751
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:19,839
mac how did that fino hunt go for you

2752
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:19,840
did you ever get a chance to do it yet

2753
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:24,800
i think um i didn't have ten packs of

2754
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:25,679
mac one though

2755
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,520
um

2756
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:30,319
but yeah you know caps and

2757
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:33,360
sent me and my friend stewart

2758
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:34,399
multiple packs um those selections are

2759
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:37,759
just

2760
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:37,759
just happening now yeah

2761
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:42,399
okay are you excited for that one

2762
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:43,679
oh yeah yeah i'm definitely excited for

2763
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:45,599
it definitely

2764
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:48,079
definitely i haven't seen them yet yet

2765
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,920
my friend is running them in the states

2766
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:52,479
awesome and so what type of work would

2767
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,760
you want to pair with that

2768
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:55,439
um

2769
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,440
for me that would be too early to say

2770
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:58,799
yeah i got to see and smoke those before

2771
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:01,359
i can like

2772
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:03,520
before my mind starts to work and

2773
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:04,479
picking like the combinations and stuff

2774
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,159
um

2775
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:07,759
i mean i'm i'll

2776
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:10,399
next coming one and two years i'll be

2777
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:13,039
crossing a lot with the sour d line yeah

2778
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:14,960
um so everything that really interests

2779
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:16,399
me probably also get crossed with that

2780
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,439
for one thing

2781
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:19,279
and

2782
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:20,319
i don't know i think the mech is a

2783
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:23,198
pretty

2784
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:25,198
hashy type strain and

2785
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:28,719
i know he did a bangers and mac which is

2786
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:30,638
my headbanger times mac

2787
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,560
i'm very curious to see what comes out

2788
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:34,239
of those

2789
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,840
and how did you feel about the mac in

2790
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:38,000
general i'm sure you've had a chance to

2791
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,520
smoke some of it

2792
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,520
yeah

2793
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:43,600
cap came to bring me some when i was

2794
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:48,000
there

2795
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:49,679
i think it smokes very smoothly yeah

2796
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,679
it is not my

2797
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,359
personal type flavor

2798
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:57,118
and things like that yeah it's very

2799
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:59,920
strong weed it is strong um

2800
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:02,238
looks great nice nuggets everything

2801
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,440
about that is really nice it's not 100

2802
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:05,599
my flavor

2803
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:07,839
um that's the only thing it's very i

2804
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,360
think it's pretty hashy

2805
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,480
in the way it smokes

2806
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:14,639
it burns really nice yeah which is what

2807
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:17,279
when wheat looks like

2808
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:19,520
white yeah that means that the

2809
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:21,439
stock that the trichome is on most times

2810
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,320
are longer that makes the wheat look

2811
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:26,158
white it's not the trichome itself yeah

2812
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:29,039
but those type of strains that have a

2813
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:31,920
longer stock they seem to burn different

2814
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:34,319
yeah so they smoke really nice for that

2815
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,520
like the sour d has really short stocks

2816
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:37,118
yeah

2817
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,400
it has a lot of trichomes but really

2818
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:40,000
short stocks

2819
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:42,079
which makes it a good strain for dry

2820
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,880
screening

2821
01:43:42,079 --> 01:43:46,719
and the strains with longer stocks they

2822
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:50,800
they get more dirty their ice cream

2823
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,800
easier yesterday harder to screen clean

2824
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,198
um i think the mac could be

2825
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:57,679
when you breed with it i think it could

2826
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:59,439
be a good strain to grow in like morocco

2827
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:02,079
and for hash fields and stuff like that

2828
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:04,000
to be really honest

2829
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:06,319
yeah it's certainly undeniable the

2830
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,079
overwhelming resin content of at least

2831
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,238
the mach 1 cut

2832
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:11,920
some little controversy surrounding it i

2833
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:13,599
wanted to quickly ask you which you may

2834
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,199
not have too much of an opinion on but

2835
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,159
there's been some whispers recently

2836
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:18,638
about

2837
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:21,118
the the genetics of mac being possibly

2838
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:23,039
inaccurate most notably the colombian

2839
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:24,639
aspect it's it's kind of been suggested

2840
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:26,399
by a few people that it just could

2841
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,760
actually be some sort of super silver

2842
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:29,839
haze cross

2843
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:33,039
most of the evidence from that derives

2844
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:34,639
from the fact that by cap's description

2845
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:36,479
it just doesn't seem to fit the

2846
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:38,400
flowering time of colombians it's just

2847
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,158
too short at nine weeks

2848
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:43,599
did you ever suspect something like this

2849
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:43,599
or do you have any opinions on that one

2850
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:49,679
i think that what the the plan that he

2851
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,960
calls the colombian yeah he got from

2852
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:52,719
family

2853
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,679
from colombia

2854
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:56,639
um

2855
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:59,039
they said they were very special um

2856
01:44:56,639 --> 01:45:02,800
so it's not 100 sure that they're a

2857
01:44:59,039 --> 01:45:05,039
colombian land race yeah and

2858
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:08,400
um i smoked it by the way yeah he

2859
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:10,719
brought me that as well yeah um

2860
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:13,439
and it definitely has a recognizable

2861
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:16,319
thing with like a super silver type

2862
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:17,599
terpenes yeah that i know from holland

2863
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:19,198
um

2864
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,600
it definitely had a

2865
01:45:19,198 --> 01:45:22,319
similarity to things like that yeah but

2866
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,560
he's

2867
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:27,840
like i think kept very genuine though

2868
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:30,480
yeah um in where he got it from and what

2869
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:32,159
it is and what he thinks it is yeah

2870
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:34,479
um

2871
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:38,399
but yeah i i don't think it's like what

2872
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:40,638
the colombian like as most people know

2873
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,238
yes and it could be

2874
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:44,639
in some hybrid

2875
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:46,959
siege that came over from europe before

2876
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:48,480
there yeah and and that's why the person

2877
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:52,319
says they're very special yeah i mean

2878
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:52,319
there's a lot of possibilities in it

2879
01:45:52,399 --> 01:45:57,118
yeah i agree with you in the analysis

2880
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:58,880
that i believe him when he says that

2881
01:45:57,118 --> 01:45:59,839
that's what it was given to him as for

2882
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,480
sure

2883
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:04,239
um so just on a kind of oh and the other

2884
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:06,638
little caveat when i was at the emerald

2885
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:09,118
cup and i got to smoke some mac from cap

2886
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:09,920
it was by far the stand out of the cup

2887
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:13,118
so

2888
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:15,679
good smoke no question um

2889
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:18,158
he grows great well yeah his crew and

2890
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:19,840
they grow great weed yeah they grow such

2891
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:21,920
nice weed yeah

2892
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:25,279
yeah especially in the context of anyone

2893
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,719
who's ever had some mac from him

2894
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:28,000
there's no dispute they're like yeah

2895
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:30,319
that's some of the best sweet i've ever

2896
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,079
had but then other times you get other

2897
01:46:30,319 --> 01:46:34,479
people who have grown the mac one and

2898
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:36,639
it's really just not even in the same

2899
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:38,319
ballpark and so to me that highlights

2900
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,520
the skill that they've got over that

2901
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:40,960
plant

2902
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,080
oh yeah 100

2903
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:44,239
100

2904
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:45,198
and that's with a lot of strains yeah

2905
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:46,559
and

2906
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:48,319
some of them

2907
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,440
have like a certain way they need to be

2908
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:52,158
grown

2909
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:54,399
or um best way to say it is yeah when

2910
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:57,198
you select plants for a greenhouse or

2911
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:58,638
indoor grow you select them on that

2912
01:46:57,198 --> 01:47:00,559
system yeah

2913
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:02,880
which made that plant very perfect for

2914
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,639
that system as well yeah like you would

2915
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,039
probably pick a different plant if you

2916
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:09,039
grown indoor on soil then you grow

2917
01:47:07,039 --> 01:47:11,519
indoor on hydro yeah

2918
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:13,840
yeah definitely i mean i tried some

2919
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,600
outdoor grown mac and it just wasn't the

2920
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,920
same

2921
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:19,920
no but if you would have select a mac

2922
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:23,039
outdoor you probably would have selected

2923
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,039
a different plant as well yeah certainly

2924
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:28,158
i i definitely agree with that just it's

2925
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:29,198
very catered to what it was selected in

2926
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:30,079
yes

2927
01:47:29,198 --> 01:47:30,879
yes

2928
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:32,800
so

2929
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,039
last little kind of hype question for

2930
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:38,239
this little block did you ever get into

2931
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:38,238
the tangy craze

2932
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:45,198
i did do some things with orange type

2933
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:48,158
strains and also tangy jelly bean

2934
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:49,118
um i'm personally not the biggest fan of

2935
01:47:48,158 --> 01:47:51,198
orange

2936
01:47:49,118 --> 01:47:54,238
flowers yeah

2937
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:56,719
um they get sickening really fast then

2938
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:59,678
the extract of it are amazing yeah

2939
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:02,158
the extracts are always amazing yeah but

2940
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:03,840
um i'm personally not the biggest fan of

2941
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:06,399
the orange flavor i think it's a very

2942
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:08,560
good strong terpene um i think

2943
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:10,559
it's very nice and unique

2944
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,280
um it has a lot of character

2945
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:15,520
but it's not my personal smoke

2946
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:16,840
okay so with that being said what are

2947
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:22,719
your favorite

2948
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:22,719
terpenes um i i like to smoke sourdis

2949
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,920
cams

2950
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:27,600
ogs

2951
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:31,118
i gotta be honest i kind of enjoy

2952
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:34,400
skittles as well the last few years

2953
01:48:31,118 --> 01:48:36,960
smoking that during the day um

2954
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:39,359
what else do i like um i like like

2955
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,600
afghanis that have that hash type flavor

2956
01:48:39,359 --> 01:48:43,759
in them yeah that hennessy

2957
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,840
type thing and stuff as well yeah i like

2958
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,679
those as

2959
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:49,920
well so with that being said what are

2960
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:52,000
some of the terpene profiles that you

2961
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,920
really wish were still around but have

2962
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,319
seemingly vanished

2963
01:48:53,920 --> 01:49:00,039
back in the day i used to grow a plant

2964
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:03,198
that has that really smelled like

2965
01:49:00,039 --> 01:49:05,118
blueberry candy type smell yeah and i've

2966
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:07,599
tried to find that i've grown so many

2967
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:09,920
different blueberries and from different

2968
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:12,480
people and from dj

2969
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,840
and i never found that

2970
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:17,279
typical

2971
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:19,199
terp like that uh ever again yeah

2972
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:20,960
yeah that's it's such a common point

2973
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:23,519
made you know that everyone knows and

2974
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,520
recognizes dj for the amazing work he's

2975
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,760
done but at the same time it's so

2976
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,520
goddamn hard to find that bang on

2977
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:31,599
blueberry pheno which most people have

2978
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:33,840
had once in their life and so you know

2979
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:35,679
it exists but it's just like god where

2980
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:38,480
is it hiding

2981
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:40,560
yeah yeah it's exactly like that

2982
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:42,879
it's exactly like that

2983
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:44,880
and then i'm still looking for

2984
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:47,440
a jack harrow

2985
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,359
um there used to be a jack haircut here

2986
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:51,759
in the south of holland yeah which was

2987
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:54,799
uh selected by neville's

2988
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:57,840
um he sold that cut to a group that runs

2989
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:59,199
a coffee shop um they lost it they

2990
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,000
bought it again

2991
01:49:59,198 --> 01:50:02,079
um

2992
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,880
neville's didn't keep it yeah and they

2993
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:07,840
lost it again yeah so it was extinct and

2994
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:10,159
that cut off of jack herrer is nothing

2995
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,159
like i've ever found in the seeds not

2996
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:13,279
when i'm breeded with it or anything

2997
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:15,198
yeah

2998
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:17,840
and i just got some seeds

2999
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:20,000
back seeds that came out of that time

3000
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,400
from that weed in that coffee shop yeah

3001
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:26,319
so now i got hope again to

3002
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:28,559
maybe find and revive that one yeah um

3003
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:31,439
that one smells so strong of [ __ ]

3004
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:33,440
church incensia um

3005
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:36,399
none of these other hazes have such a

3006
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:38,399
strong incense smell as that had and it

3007
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:40,479
was not a high wheat it's a very strong

3008
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:43,359
stoned weed yeah which is doesn't really

3009
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:45,519
fit the haze profile either a bit faster

3010
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:48,238
flower as well yeah it should be done 11

3011
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,239
12 weeks

3012
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:52,799
yeah wow i mean i've i've been lucky

3013
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:55,760
enough to try the

3014
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,719
what's referred to as the 10k jackhair

3015
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,159
cut

3016
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:59,760
to other people

3017
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:01,679
it's known as just

3018
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:02,639
jack herrera's personal cut of jack

3019
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:04,960
herrera

3020
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:07,199
but um it sounds quite different to what

3021
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:09,039
you described but i mean everyone knows

3022
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:11,598
that good jack herrera is kind of

3023
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:11,599
unbeatable

3024
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:18,319
yeah this weed when it was here um you

3025
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,079
could only max buy two grams of clients

3026
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:23,359
yeah because otherwise they would run

3027
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:25,439
out too fast yeah so everybody every day

3028
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:27,039
went back to buy those two grams yeah

3029
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:29,759
and you would try to get your friends

3030
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:30,880
yeah to buy you two grams as well yeah

3031
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:33,679
um

3032
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,960
like total craze here in the city

3033
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:36,480
um

3034
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,800
yeah that was a big hit everybody in

3035
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:40,479
this city that's my age still remembers

3036
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:42,239
that like uh

3037
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:44,158
one of the best weed that was in town

3038
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:46,079
yeah

3039
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:48,158
yeah okay so

3040
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:50,880
brings us to an interesting question

3041
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:53,118
what is the best bud you've ever smoked

3042
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,840
ever period

3043
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:55,839
sour diesel

3044
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,679
easy answer or is there a close second

3045
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:04,479
no that was the third thing i i thought

3046
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:06,399
of but then i thought let me think about

3047
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:10,399
let me go through all these things in my

3048
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:10,399
head yeah but there's nothing that

3049
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:13,919
can top that to be honest

3050
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:19,118
it got all the flavor yeah and it's

3051
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:20,560
really strong as well yeah

3052
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:23,519
um

3053
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,520
yeah it's hard to beat

3054
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:28,400
for sure so something we've touched on

3055
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:29,598
loosely but haven't really delved into

3056
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:31,359
thus far

3057
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:33,360
how do you feel about concentrates and

3058
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:36,479
you know the rise of all the different

3059
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:38,479
connoisseur concentrate varieties

3060
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:41,359
well i like it a lot i think it's a big

3061
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:42,559
part of the future as well yeah

3062
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:44,639
um

3063
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,679
i definitely like all the solvent-less

3064
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,480
stuff

3065
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:49,840
um

3066
01:52:46,479 --> 01:52:49,839
i like smoking that as well

3067
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:56,238
um yeah i also think that it opens up a

3068
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:59,439
whole new window yeah because um when

3069
01:52:56,238 --> 01:53:01,759
life extracted yeah um a lot of these

3070
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:03,439
fertile terpenes and stuff yeah so you

3071
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,239
get a very different product as well

3072
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:07,279
yeah

3073
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:09,598
which kind of makes that um that flower

3074
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:11,679
you can change it in different type of

3075
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:15,039
tastes and stuff as well yeah even

3076
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:16,719
though it's the same source

3077
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:19,198
i like that as well

3078
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:20,880
i think medically it has a big purpose

3079
01:53:19,198 --> 01:53:22,960
as well

3080
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,599
and so i guess the extension of that

3081
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:27,760
idea how do you feel about vape pens and

3082
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:29,119
the way they've seemingly kind of taken

3083
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,599
over the

3084
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:33,039
casual enthusiast community especially

3085
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:36,000
within the states do you feel like it's

3086
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:38,840
a good or a bad thing

3087
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,198
i personally don't smoke any

3088
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:43,039
distillate nothing

3089
01:53:41,198 --> 01:53:44,879
okay and what's your reasons for doing

3090
01:53:43,039 --> 01:53:46,238
that

3091
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:48,960
well

3092
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:50,238
a lot of it is not

3093
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,760
i i i

3094
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:54,799
i don't like the way it smokes um in

3095
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,880
um

3096
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:58,480
makes my throat tingle and and stuff

3097
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,639
like that um

3098
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:02,638
i know today there's like very clean

3099
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:04,560
distillate yeah um

3100
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:07,440
a few years ago most of it wasn't even

3101
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:09,520
fully clean either um we all know what

3102
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:11,198
to get made from yeah

3103
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:13,760
um so

3104
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:16,638
no that's not my

3105
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:19,039
product to be honest i would prefer

3106
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:22,000
a solvent-less or i do smoke some of

3107
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:24,639
these saucepans though yeah

3108
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,760
but this i'm not the biggest fan of to

3109
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:27,279
be honest

3110
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:30,079
so what's your favorite type of

3111
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:30,079
concentrate

3112
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:33,198
for me that would be

3113
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,399
fresh frozen isolator

3114
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:41,118
and so what do you tend to do with your

3115
01:54:38,399 --> 01:54:42,158
trim when it's ready to be processed

3116
01:54:41,118 --> 01:54:43,039
um

3117
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:45,519
i mean

3118
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:47,198
when i see crops i i dry screen

3119
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:50,560
everything before the seeds are taken

3120
01:54:47,198 --> 01:54:52,879
out yeah so i most times have more dry

3121
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:55,119
skin to my disposal

3122
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:58,880
than other things um

3123
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:59,839
but the fresh frozen uh washed hash yeah

3124
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:01,840
and then

3125
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:03,679
freeze dried um

3126
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:05,199
i think that's a really nice product

3127
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:07,199
yeah

3128
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:09,678
yeah definitely i mean

3129
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:11,678
a lot of that really high quality

3130
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:13,520
concentrates made in that regard it's

3131
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:15,199
not really available in many countries

3132
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,840
outside of like

3133
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:20,319
say america and

3134
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:22,480
holland maybe spain

3135
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:24,479
yeah no it's true i think spain is even

3136
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:26,079
way more than it is in holland that type

3137
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:28,319
of uh hash

3138
01:55:26,079 --> 01:55:30,800
um

3139
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:32,479
yeah now it takes a lot of material as

3140
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,880
well yeah um

3141
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:36,718
it's an expensive product when uh

3142
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:39,599
cannabis is very expensive in your

3143
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:41,359
country or when it's fully legal yeah um

3144
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,119
then why would you

3145
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:44,319
then you're probably better off smoking

3146
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:47,039
flour yeah

3147
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:49,118
when it comes to um worth for your money

3148
01:55:47,039 --> 01:55:51,599
kind of thing yeah um because these

3149
01:55:49,118 --> 01:55:52,719
products get very expensive of course

3150
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:55,760
certainly

3151
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:57,920
so in line with our comments made about

3152
01:55:55,760 --> 01:56:00,400
the vape pens and kind of how they're

3153
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:02,719
taking over the the amateur consumer

3154
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:04,638
market do you feel like it's going to

3155
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:06,960
more or less be inevitable that we'll

3156
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:10,560
see the takeover of corporate cannabis

3157
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,840
and is this a bad thing per se

3158
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:13,920
um

3159
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:16,400
we will definitely see were we already

3160
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,599
seeing a takeover of corporate cannabis

3161
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:19,439
everywhere it's

3162
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:22,079
legal um

3163
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:25,039
i personally do think um that in the

3164
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:26,719
coming years that market will even out a

3165
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:28,639
little bit yeah they will first take

3166
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:31,118
everything over and they'll kick

3167
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:33,840
everybody out kind of thing yeah

3168
01:56:31,118 --> 01:56:36,000
um but then the people

3169
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:38,159
are not happy yet because then they only

3170
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,158
kind of get the mids to smoke yeah it's

3171
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:41,679
that simple to be honest

3172
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:44,319
and don't get me wrong there are some

3173
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:46,000
big people that do it well as well yeah

3174
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:47,759
they're not the biggest yeah but in the

3175
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,560
mid size there's a lot of people growing

3176
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,360
really good flour on a big scale yeah as

3177
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,239
well

3178
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:53,839
um

3179
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:56,079
and don't get me wrong when it's legal

3180
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:58,639
there's a lot of weed that's needed yeah

3181
01:56:56,079 --> 01:57:01,118
as well um so

3182
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:04,800
even though we all want it to be all

3183
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:07,359
small um home and mom and pop type

3184
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:10,320
grows i don't think that's realistic

3185
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:11,118
when it's like a fully legal market yeah

3186
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:12,880
um

3187
01:57:11,118 --> 01:57:14,719
it's same thing when you look at beer

3188
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:17,440
and wine yeah

3189
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:19,439
a real wine drinker yeah he would like

3190
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:21,678
the wines that get produced on smaller

3191
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:22,399
scale and very special and things like

3192
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:24,560
that

3193
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:26,960
but then the big messes yeah

3194
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:28,880
they only care for that cheaper red wine

3195
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,560
yeah they don't mind that much you

3196
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,199
understand it's gonna be the same with

3197
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:37,039
the cannabis market yeah the big masses

3198
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:39,279
yeah they're not like um all the really

3199
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:42,158
uh cannabis heads yeah that are really

3200
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:43,840
like patient and totally into it yeah

3201
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:45,759
so they don't even know that many

3202
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:48,079
strains or whatever and things like that

3203
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,000
yeah not everybody is smoking every day

3204
01:57:48,079 --> 01:57:51,840
or like we do

3205
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,800
so i think that's the biggest part of

3206
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:55,039
the

3207
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:57,360
public that will smoke yeah

3208
01:57:55,039 --> 01:57:59,118
so um there will always be a place for

3209
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:01,439
big corporate and for

3210
01:57:59,118 --> 01:58:03,198
as we call it midsuite yeah

3211
01:58:01,439 --> 01:58:04,879
it's that simple i think the market for

3212
01:58:03,198 --> 01:58:07,198
the high high quality and the

3213
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:08,960
specialized things yeah is smaller than

3214
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:11,118
most people think

3215
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:13,599
in the big mass

3216
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:16,238
yeah of course so how do you think the

3217
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:19,599
connoisseur community will survive and

3218
01:58:16,238 --> 01:58:21,678
adapt during this inevitable takeover

3219
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:23,760
like we always have man no matter what

3220
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:27,599
happens people will always no matter if

3221
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:29,119
it's legal illegal um whatever

3222
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:31,520
the real people that are really

3223
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:33,198
interested in they will always keep on

3224
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:35,280
germinating seeds they will always be

3225
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:36,960
growing the better wheat um

3226
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:38,238
yeah so a lot of times that will still

3227
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:40,800
stay in the

3228
01:58:38,238 --> 01:58:43,039
gray market for

3229
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,119
a while i think yeah because in these

3230
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:46,880
legal places it's not possible for every

3231
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:49,439
these licenses in some places are so

3232
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:51,760
expensive it's so hard to get them you

3233
01:58:49,439 --> 01:58:54,399
have to go through so many things yeah

3234
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:56,400
you already need capital to even start

3235
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:59,118
it off yeah it needs to be a legal

3236
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:01,598
capital as well yeah so it's not like oh

3237
01:58:59,118 --> 01:59:03,839
i made a hundred thousand growing wheat

3238
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:05,679
legally now i'm gonna start go legal and

3239
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:08,239
i'll use this hundred thousand to start

3240
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:11,118
up that's not the way it works

3241
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:14,559
yeah so legal money needs to come in for

3242
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:16,559
something big to happen yeah so

3243
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,480
there's kind of no other roads than

3244
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,400
there is yeah

3245
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:23,039
so how do you feel about the idea of

3246
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:25,359
companies or even individuals like say

3247
01:59:23,039 --> 01:59:27,198
breeders who want to patent their work

3248
01:59:25,359 --> 01:59:29,920
do you feel like this is just an

3249
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:31,759
inevitable fact of the legalization or

3250
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:33,760
do you feel like it's a significant step

3251
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:35,440
in the wrong direction

3252
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:37,760
um

3253
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:38,960
well it's always been free because it's

3254
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:41,920
illegal

3255
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:44,800
so you wouldn't copyright anything

3256
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,639
but if you look at any other

3257
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:49,279
seed or breeding

3258
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:51,199
with other plants um it's very normal

3259
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:53,039
kind of to be honest and i can

3260
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:54,319
understand for some people as well yeah

3261
01:59:53,039 --> 01:59:56,158
it's going to be abused though that's

3262
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:58,399
what every everybody's scared about

3263
01:59:56,158 --> 02:00:00,238
being abused yeah and i'm scared about

3264
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:02,000
that as well yeah so all these bigger

3265
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:04,559
people just taking [ __ ] away that other

3266
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,960
people made and things like that yeah

3267
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:09,199
um but if you really worked for things

3268
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:12,880
for many years um

3269
02:00:09,198 --> 02:00:15,839
and you could i i can't [ __ ] be angry

3270
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:17,840
at people to be honest for that yeah um

3271
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:19,840
there always will be a huge [ __ ] free

3272
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:21,599
market anyway yeah because anything

3273
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,360
that's already been sold or that's

3274
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:25,279
already won a prize that you cannot

3275
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:27,198
copyright that anymore

3276
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:29,679
yeah it's already a free-for-all it's

3277
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:32,719
that simple so um

3278
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:34,239
to copyright the strain um it's not as

3279
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:35,920
easy

3280
02:00:34,238 --> 02:00:37,759
as it looks yeah

3281
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:40,319
it needs to be unique you need to prove

3282
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:42,000
all these steps before

3283
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:44,719
so yeah a lot of these things can't even

3284
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,399
be copyrighted yeah it's that simple

3285
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:48,399
i agree i agree they're kind of already

3286
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:50,719
in public domain so

3287
02:00:48,399 --> 02:00:52,559
just jumping to a slightly different but

3288
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:54,399
related point how do you feel about the

3289
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,639
rise of celebrities jumping on the

3290
02:00:54,399 --> 02:00:59,039
cannabis bandwagon like specifically i'm

3291
02:00:56,639 --> 02:01:02,000
sorry i'm sure you've seen that seth

3292
02:00:59,039 --> 02:01:04,079
rogen has launched his own brand

3293
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,639
and you know we've had that dan

3294
02:01:04,079 --> 02:01:08,639
bilzerian guy hovering around for a

3295
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:10,400
while do you feel like this is good in

3296
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:12,239
the sense that it's just giving greater

3297
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:14,079
exposure to the masses or do you think

3298
02:01:12,238 --> 02:01:17,519
in general it's just a move towards

3299
02:01:14,079 --> 02:01:19,840
generic negative bud

3300
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:22,080
i think it's both

3301
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:25,360
um i think it's very good for the big

3302
02:01:22,079 --> 02:01:27,439
public opinion um and making it accept

3303
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:29,279
it for like all the public that didn't

3304
02:01:27,439 --> 02:01:30,960
accept it before yeah

3305
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:32,719
um i think it's very good for things

3306
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:34,719
like that um

3307
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:36,639
and no matter what it is that's gonna

3308
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:38,158
make money yeah people that have money

3309
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:40,000
invest their money in those type of

3310
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:42,238
things now if you smoke weed yeah i

3311
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:45,279
understand they will invest into weed

3312
02:01:42,238 --> 02:01:46,959
type things yeah um

3313
02:01:45,279 --> 02:01:49,118
we all know that if you're a good actor

3314
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,520
that doesn't mean you have a good

3315
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:52,559
cannabis company yeah that's

3316
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,760
i mean

3317
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,599
if you're good before the camera that

3318
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:57,039
doesn't mean you can grow good weed yeah

3319
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:58,800
but if you have good people the weed can

3320
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:01,599
be good just as well

3321
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:04,719
um so i guess we just have to test all

3322
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:07,840
of them yeah it's that simple

3323
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:10,880
yeah okay would you ever buy cannabis

3324
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:13,360
that was labeled simply as hybrid or

3325
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:13,359
indica

3326
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:17,639
um

3327
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:22,559
no

3328
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:24,559
we need to have something more than that

3329
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:26,719
it needs something more than that i i

3330
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:28,480
hate buying weed that i cannot smell or

3331
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:30,480
touch to be honest yeah i understand you

3332
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:34,000
can't touch weed in the dispensary or in

3333
02:02:30,479 --> 02:02:35,919
a coffee shop anymore today but um

3334
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,158
i want to feel and smell it yeah before

3335
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:40,079
i buy it

3336
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:42,960
yeah of course it's a very

3337
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:44,719
understandable sentiment so sadly i

3338
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:46,880
missed you at the last emerald cup we

3339
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:49,760
were both at but i'd love to know your

3340
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:52,800
opinion on the event overall and what

3341
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:55,199
event do you enjoy the most

3342
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:57,520
i love the emerald cup when i went there

3343
02:02:55,198 --> 02:03:00,399
i was

3344
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:02,960
i was so i didn't expect it to be like

3345
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:05,519
that yet there was so i thought it was

3346
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:08,239
very crowded yeah maybe a little bit too

3347
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:09,119
crowded for the space there was

3348
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:11,919
um

3349
02:03:09,118 --> 02:03:13,598
i've never seen seed sales as happened

3350
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:16,319
at the emerald cup i've never seen

3351
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:18,639
anything like that before the span abyss

3352
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:20,639
it's not like that spanish this is a

3353
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:22,319
really nice show yeah it's really good

3354
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:23,920
for seats as well

3355
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:27,198
but the emerald wow

3356
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:29,279
i've never seen anything like that

3357
02:03:27,198 --> 02:03:32,158
and what was the most impressive

3358
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:33,039
cannabis you saw at the emerald cup

3359
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:35,359
um

3360
02:03:33,039 --> 02:03:37,118
i'll be honest i didn't see that much we

3361
02:03:35,359 --> 02:03:39,279
you have to understand when i go to the

3362
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:41,439
these events yeah there's so much people

3363
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:44,719
that want to see you or you're trying to

3364
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:47,678
meet or having a little talk to you

3365
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:51,039
that the days just fly by there yeah and

3366
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:52,800
i almost never can see the whole expo

3367
02:03:51,039 --> 02:03:54,158
yeah no don't worry i can i can

3368
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:56,560
definitely agree with you and the

3369
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:58,000
interesting thing is is that you would

3370
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:00,159
expect pretty much everything that you

3371
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:03,760
get shown is pretty good but

3372
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:06,399
sadly there's only a few standouts

3373
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:09,280
oh yeah definitely definitely definitely

3374
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:11,679
it's always the private weed yeah so um

3375
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:14,000
it's kind of people that are visiting

3376
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:15,599
um that grown out stuff

3377
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,760
some of those people will have the best

3378
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:19,199
most times

3379
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:20,079
yeah for sure

3380
02:04:19,198 --> 02:04:22,399
so

3381
02:04:20,078 --> 02:04:24,880
what do you think is one of the most

3382
02:04:22,399 --> 02:04:27,679
underrated clones and why do you think

3383
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:30,159
people seem to flock to specific clones

3384
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:32,319
like cookies given that even by your own

3385
02:04:30,158 --> 02:04:35,198
admission they've got a lot of downsides

3386
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:37,118
like the yield and the stability

3387
02:04:35,198 --> 02:04:40,638
yeah that's just the

3388
02:04:37,118 --> 02:04:42,799
hype and market value and uh

3389
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:44,800
people need to have it

3390
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:46,880
that makes it still

3391
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:47,840
that yeah the cookie thing

3392
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,440
um

3393
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:53,599
so what do you think is one of the most

3394
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:55,598
underrated clones in your opinion

3395
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:58,319
um

3396
02:04:55,599 --> 02:05:00,239
i think a clone that has a very bad name

3397
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:03,118
but if you look at all the concentrates

3398
02:05:00,238 --> 02:05:05,198
from today it kind of should be in there

3399
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:07,359
it's the critical

3400
02:05:05,198 --> 02:05:09,598
yeah wow i was not expecting you to say

3401
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:12,399
that

3402
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:13,360
no it's a really nice fruity weed yeah

3403
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:15,279
um

3404
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:17,679
it's not my personal thing but i pray

3405
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:20,399
extract and it's fast it yields it's

3406
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:21,840
really easy to grow i'm surprised that's

3407
02:05:20,399 --> 02:05:24,238
not

3408
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:26,480
a big thing to be honest yet everybody

3409
02:05:24,238 --> 02:05:28,238
hates on it because the spanish always

3410
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:30,399
use it to reverse and hit everything

3411
02:05:28,238 --> 02:05:33,118
with it because it produces so much

3412
02:05:30,399 --> 02:05:34,719
pollen when it's reversed

3413
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:36,639
and it doesn't give much hermione

3414
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:38,960
offspring so that's why they love it so

3415
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:42,319
much and they cross it with everything

3416
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:45,198
um but on itself pure um that cut that's

3417
02:05:42,319 --> 02:05:47,679
everywhere in spain yeah um

3418
02:05:45,198 --> 02:05:49,118
life resin from that is gotta be really

3419
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:50,960
good yeah

3420
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:54,880
so i don't understand why that's not

3421
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:56,960
being grown in [ __ ] piles in the us

3422
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:59,760
yeah i can certainly attest that i've

3423
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:02,158
had some critical jack in the past and

3424
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,760
that was extremely memorable a really

3425
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:05,598
good smoke so

3426
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:07,840
with that being said what do you think

3427
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:09,279
overall about the spanish scene is it

3428
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:11,119
something you're looking to explore

3429
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:14,319
further yourself and do you think it's

3430
02:06:11,118 --> 02:06:16,719
going to be the new big place to be

3431
02:06:14,319 --> 02:06:20,000
well i lived in spain in

3432
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:22,000
2007 2008

3433
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,679
um

3434
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,359
it was very different then than it is

3435
02:06:23,679 --> 02:06:27,599
now but i've always been coming there i

3436
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:31,519
come there a couple times a year

3437
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:34,560
um i have many friends over all of spain

3438
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:37,199
um the scene there is really nice yeah

3439
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:39,119
it grows every year and the vibe is like

3440
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:41,279
it used to be in holland now yeah

3441
02:06:39,118 --> 02:06:44,078
because all these smaller passionate

3442
02:06:41,279 --> 02:06:46,719
growers um

3443
02:06:44,078 --> 02:06:48,639
so for that i think it's very it's it's

3444
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:50,480
making a lot of progress and i think in

3445
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:53,039
from europe it's definitely the place

3446
02:06:50,479 --> 02:06:55,359
most things happening at the moment

3447
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:57,679
um so yeah that's really nice

3448
02:06:55,359 --> 02:06:59,759
um it's still everything is illegal yeah

3449
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:02,158
people think it's legal there it's not

3450
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:03,599
um you can grow some wheat for yourself

3451
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:06,319
yeah but

3452
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:08,480
not in the way most people do

3453
02:07:06,319 --> 02:07:10,799
yeah so do you think that a lot of

3454
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:12,959
amateur people have the wrong idea and

3455
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,719
it's a common idea or sentiment to hear

3456
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:16,560
people say you know i'm gonna pack my

3457
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:19,920
bags and move to spain do you think that

3458
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:22,400
that's a bit of an ill-conceived thought

3459
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:25,118
um no when you compare

3460
02:07:22,399 --> 02:07:27,039
in europe where you're best off to grow

3461
02:07:25,118 --> 02:07:28,479
wheat it's still spain

3462
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:30,319
um

3463
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:32,078
because if you don't do it too big yeah

3464
02:07:30,319 --> 02:07:33,359
there's not much of a problem to be

3465
02:07:32,078 --> 02:07:35,198
honest

3466
02:07:33,359 --> 02:07:36,639
they don't come into your house very

3467
02:07:35,198 --> 02:07:38,479
fast yeah which has to do with the

3468
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:41,359
history

3469
02:07:38,479 --> 02:07:44,319
houses the rents are very cheap um it's

3470
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:46,799
very socially accepted as well yeah

3471
02:07:44,319 --> 02:07:48,960
so um even though it's illegal the

3472
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:50,239
chance of getting cut or getting into

3473
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,239
trouble

3474
02:07:50,238 --> 02:07:54,559
is way smaller than in almost every

3475
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:57,118
other country in europe

3476
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:58,960
yeah okay so there's still some hope

3477
02:07:57,118 --> 02:08:00,399
there

3478
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:04,158
and you can grow really good outdoor

3479
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:07,359
weed there like really good yeah so um

3480
02:08:04,158 --> 02:08:09,439
that's a cheap way for people so making

3481
02:08:07,359 --> 02:08:12,238
this step even though you're not having

3482
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:14,158
a lot of money and stuff yeah um spain

3483
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:16,319
is not that expensive as well yeah so a

3484
02:08:14,158 --> 02:08:18,799
lot of times it's cheaper to live there

3485
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:20,399
than where people live in currently yeah

3486
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:21,440
and then if they can grow some plants

3487
02:08:20,399 --> 02:08:23,279
outdoor

3488
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:25,439
that doesn't cost much money as well

3489
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:28,319
yeah so the possibility is there for a

3490
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:30,319
lot of people as well

3491
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:33,198
yeah yeah okay

3492
02:08:30,319 --> 02:08:35,039
so spain commonly known for its

3493
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:37,198
feminized seeds

3494
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:40,960
will you ever offer feminized seeds i

3495
02:08:37,198 --> 02:08:40,960
know you've been asked this in the past

3496
02:08:41,118 --> 02:08:44,319
i do some

3497
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:48,000
feminized seeds

3498
02:08:44,319 --> 02:08:50,000
i've only sold them in europe

3499
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,960
and i am currently making feminized

3500
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:55,279
seeds as well um everybody knows i i i'm

3501
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:57,840
all about regular seeds but the market

3502
02:08:55,279 --> 02:08:58,880
definitely demands feminized seeds yeah

3503
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:01,520
um

3504
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:03,440
like most companies they only sell like

3505
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:05,119
five or ten percent

3506
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:07,359
seats yeah if they offer them and then

3507
02:09:05,118 --> 02:09:09,439
the rest is all feminized and that's not

3508
02:09:07,359 --> 02:09:11,279
because they make that but that's also

3509
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:12,638
because that's what people buy in europe

3510
02:09:11,279 --> 02:09:14,960
yeah

3511
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:16,639
yeah certainly and so do you think that

3512
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:18,319
there's a misconception within the

3513
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:20,239
community that feminized seeds are

3514
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:23,599
better for growers

3515
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:26,158
i think the reason why they sell so well

3516
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:28,639
in europe is because

3517
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:29,679
a lot of people only want to grow a few

3518
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:32,480
plants

3519
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:35,118
and they grow with like one light um so

3520
02:09:32,479 --> 02:09:36,799
they cannot keep moms yeah they only

3521
02:09:35,118 --> 02:09:38,399
want to have five like in holland they

3522
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:40,159
only want to have five plants yeah

3523
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:42,238
because if they have five plants they

3524
02:09:40,158 --> 02:09:43,198
won't get any punishment if they are

3525
02:09:42,238 --> 02:09:44,638
caught

3526
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:46,479
yeah so

3527
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:49,599
yeah then they prefer feminized seeds i

3528
02:09:46,479 --> 02:09:52,238
can understand that

3529
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:54,480
if the plant number is not a problem i

3530
02:09:52,238 --> 02:09:56,559
personally prefer to just

3531
02:09:54,479 --> 02:09:58,319
pop twice as much seeds and

3532
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:01,360
pop regular seeds

3533
02:09:58,319 --> 02:10:03,599
speaking of growing what is your number

3534
02:10:01,359 --> 02:10:05,198
one grow tip for our audience you know

3535
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:07,279
what's something that you commonly see

3536
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:11,039
that gets overlooked or an aspect of

3537
02:10:07,279 --> 02:10:11,039
growing which is fairly underrated

3538
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:17,840
um

3539
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:19,279
well the thing i see here in europe

3540
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:20,078
a lot

3541
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:22,399
is

3542
02:10:20,078 --> 02:10:23,759
people only really start to concentrate

3543
02:10:22,399 --> 02:10:26,559
on um

3544
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:30,560
their yield and their flour

3545
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:32,400
once plants are in flower for four weeks

3546
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:34,960
the most important thing about growing

3547
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:36,719
cannabis is the starches the roots

3548
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:38,639
it's all about the roots if you don't

3549
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:40,880
have any roots you cannot get a lot of

3550
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:43,920
fruits it's that simple

3551
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:46,078
um so i think people should con

3552
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:49,279
concentrate a lot on

3553
02:10:46,078 --> 02:10:51,920
rooting their plans really well yeah

3554
02:10:49,279 --> 02:10:54,399
yeah a point that i've discussed with uh

3555
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:56,158
the legend himself duke diamond a lot is

3556
02:10:54,399 --> 02:10:58,158
that people don't pay enough attention

3557
02:10:56,158 --> 02:11:00,960
to the root system and even a way in

3558
02:10:58,158 --> 02:11:02,319
which people can select males is

3559
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,359
when you're doing the selection of the

3560
02:11:02,319 --> 02:11:06,078
males

3561
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:08,319
to literally tease the

3562
02:11:06,078 --> 02:11:10,799
the medium out of the root ball and take

3563
02:11:08,319 --> 02:11:12,479
a look at the root ball like kind of see

3564
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,920
the male that i think is the best does

3565
02:11:12,479 --> 02:11:16,238
it have a big root ball because i think

3566
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:18,078
that that's an interesting idea

3567
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:20,158
i think it's a very interesting and very

3568
02:11:18,078 --> 02:11:21,359
good idea as well

3569
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:23,679
cool so

3570
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:25,279
the inevitable question what medium do

3571
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:28,239
you prefer to grow in and what

3572
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:29,599
advantages do you think this has

3573
02:11:28,238 --> 02:11:32,399
okay i am

3574
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:35,039
me um i grow

3575
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:39,198
all different mediums

3576
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:42,158
but i mostly grow cocoa at the moment

3577
02:11:39,198 --> 02:11:43,678
when i look to my like my group and my

3578
02:11:42,158 --> 02:11:45,039
friends there are the people that i work

3579
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:48,239
with

3580
02:11:45,039 --> 02:11:50,560
i have one group that only grows hydro

3581
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:54,799
then i have one group that only grows in

3582
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:58,159
greenhouses they grow mostly organic

3583
02:11:54,800 --> 02:12:00,239
that's when i grow for myself to smoke

3584
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:01,679
um i prefer

3585
02:12:00,238 --> 02:12:04,638
soil

3586
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:06,719
but then i'll grow like 80 organic and

3587
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:08,800
20 mineral

3588
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:11,039
and do you feel like you're getting the

3589
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:13,440
best of both worlds because i i know

3590
02:12:11,039 --> 02:12:14,560
some really good growers who do exactly

3591
02:12:13,439 --> 02:12:17,279
that

3592
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:20,880
well i'm a very strong advocate of

3593
02:12:17,279 --> 02:12:24,319
always telling people like um or i grow

3594
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:28,159
80 mineral 20 organic yeah and that

3595
02:12:24,319 --> 02:12:30,880
would be on cocoa or a hydro system

3596
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:33,359
when i grow on soil i'll grow 80 organic

3597
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:34,480
and 20 mineral you take the best from

3598
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:35,598
both yeah

3599
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:38,078
um

3600
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:39,599
it's very smooth weed it's very clean um

3601
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:41,920
you get a lot of good

3602
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:44,400
a lot of flavor points and stuff from uh

3603
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:47,440
organic weed yeah um

3604
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:48,719
but you can get a lot of strength um and

3605
02:12:47,439 --> 02:12:50,879
a

3606
02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:54,639
nice structure and things like that very

3607
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:56,400
easily with a mineral supplement

3608
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:59,279
so this might be a bit of a hard

3609
02:12:56,399 --> 02:13:01,920
question for you to quantify but over

3610
02:12:59,279 --> 02:13:03,759
the years how many different plants do

3611
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:05,840
you think you've grown and do you think

3612
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:07,920
exposing yourself to a wide variety of

3613
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:09,760
genetics makes you a better grower or a

3614
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:12,078
better breeder

3615
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:14,079
a better breeder i definitely think yeah

3616
02:13:12,078 --> 02:13:15,840
because

3617
02:13:14,078 --> 02:13:17,840
it's just like a cook the more different

3618
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:20,400
food you've eaten and tasted yet the

3619
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:21,760
better you can work with flavors yeah so

3620
02:13:20,399 --> 02:13:23,519
um

3621
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:25,920
how many

3622
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,520
oh man i i wouldn't even dare to put a

3623
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,480
number on it yeah

3624
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:30,880
um

3625
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:33,198
but the last years we did such big

3626
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:36,319
germinations of so many different seeds

3627
02:13:33,198 --> 02:13:37,678
yeah that um it really flew up yet the

3628
02:13:36,319 --> 02:13:39,198
last years

3629
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:41,440
um

3630
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:45,198
i must have grown

3631
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:48,559
more than 500 varieties

3632
02:13:45,198 --> 02:13:49,598
more than 500 for sure

3633
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:51,199
jesus

3634
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:53,360
that's a lot

3635
02:13:51,198 --> 02:13:55,678
so when you popping a new strain whether

3636
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:57,439
it be yours or someone else's how many

3637
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:59,199
seeds do you like to pop to get a feel

3638
02:13:57,439 --> 02:14:02,078
for it and the reason why i asked this

3639
02:13:59,198 --> 02:14:03,439
is because often in australia where i'm

3640
02:14:02,078 --> 02:14:04,399
from which a lot of people probably

3641
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:07,279
already know

3642
02:14:04,399 --> 02:14:09,598
um you see people popping like three c's

3643
02:14:07,279 --> 02:14:11,359
out of a ten pack and i just like you

3644
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:14,159
know i try not to be harsh but like i

3645
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:16,158
just have to shake my head

3646
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:18,399
then you only see like that's like

3647
02:14:16,158 --> 02:14:19,598
opening a box of bon bons yeah which are

3648
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:21,679
all different

3649
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:24,319
um and you taste three yeah

3650
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:26,560
it's the same thing yeah

3651
02:14:24,319 --> 02:14:28,238
let me well it all depends on the source

3652
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:31,360
of the seed as well the three seeds are

3653
02:14:28,238 --> 02:14:34,319
not enough um but let's just say most

3654
02:14:31,359 --> 02:14:36,559
seed packs are like 10 seeds yeah um

3655
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:38,960
if you pop that you

3656
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:41,280
should see a part of the whole gene pool

3657
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:43,118
if they're good seeds yeah and if you

3658
02:14:41,279 --> 02:14:45,519
want to see everything that's in there

3659
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:46,319
and they're really good stable seeds

3660
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:50,079
um

3661
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:51,840
then it's probably like 200 seeds yeah

3662
02:14:50,078 --> 02:14:53,920
and then it's already good if you grow

3663
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:56,480
like a land raise yeah you probably need

3664
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:59,039
like five thousand yeah

3665
02:14:56,479 --> 02:15:01,039
yeah i can certainly agree and and it

3666
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:03,679
makes me look back at some of the work

3667
02:15:01,039 --> 02:15:05,679
the earlier guys did where they had to

3668
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:07,520
breed things for multiple generations

3669
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:10,560
just to stabilize it before they could

3670
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:12,159
even think about outcrossing it

3671
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,480
oh yeah for sure

3672
02:15:12,158 --> 02:15:17,279
for sure like if you start with

3673
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:20,078
um like really raw land raised seats or

3674
02:15:17,279 --> 02:15:21,599
even hybrids that are like messier as i

3675
02:15:20,078 --> 02:15:23,920
call it um so they have a lot of

3676
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:24,880
variations and herbs and everything in

3677
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:26,960
it

3678
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:29,039
then you need to grow

3679
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:31,359
a lot of seeds yet to

3680
02:15:29,039 --> 02:15:34,078
make a group out of those

3681
02:15:31,359 --> 02:15:35,759
that all don't have those bad things in

3682
02:15:34,078 --> 02:15:38,000
it yeah and you need to cross those with

3683
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:39,920
each other the whole group

3684
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,439
and then germinate them all again yeah

3685
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:43,679
and then the percentage of all the

3686
02:15:41,439 --> 02:15:47,359
problems should go down and down

3687
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:49,039
um that's why you can start only yeah so

3688
02:15:47,359 --> 02:15:52,238
it all depends on your starting point

3689
02:15:49,039 --> 02:15:55,039
how many seeds you need to germ yeah

3690
02:15:52,238 --> 02:15:57,118
if you want to be really serious and

3691
02:15:55,039 --> 02:15:59,439
want to do it all at once

3692
02:15:57,118 --> 02:16:03,679
um i think with modern hybri

3693
02:15:59,439 --> 02:16:05,359
bread seeds if you pop 500 c's you

3694
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:08,158
should be enough

3695
02:16:05,359 --> 02:16:11,279
um you don't need 10 000 like with land

3696
02:16:08,158 --> 02:16:14,078
races or 5 000

3697
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:16,399
yeah so with that point in mind what

3698
02:16:14,078 --> 02:16:18,399
requirements do you place on your own

3699
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:20,399
strains before you deem it ready for

3700
02:16:18,399 --> 02:16:22,319
market and what type of things would

3701
02:16:20,399 --> 02:16:25,118
make you reconsider whether you're going

3702
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:29,039
to release a strain or not

3703
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:31,679
okay my my aim my aim is um

3704
02:16:29,039 --> 02:16:32,638
to when you pop one or two packs of

3705
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:35,599
seeds

3706
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:38,799
that you find the type of plant that um

3707
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:41,359
i wanted you to find yeah that

3708
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:43,518
what i think the strain represents

3709
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:44,960
um or that is like the cut that i picked

3710
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:46,719
myself

3711
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:47,598
that's what i try to do

3712
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:49,598
um

3713
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:52,398
this is not on every strain yeah but i

3714
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:53,840
have quite a few strains which are like

3715
02:16:52,398 --> 02:16:55,920
that yeah that's why i like the back

3716
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:58,960
crossing so much so i can

3717
02:16:55,920 --> 02:17:02,000
corner some um

3718
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:04,799
traits and pinos uh in that gene pool

3719
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:07,200
more yeah so that there's less variation

3720
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:09,759
and you have a bigger chance to fight

3721
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:13,040
that thing in less seats

3722
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:15,599
um so like for example the headbang area

3723
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:17,599
if you pop two packs of seeds

3724
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:19,840
you some people have a hard time to

3725
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:22,239
really pick what they want to keep yeah

3726
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:25,040
um there is some variation in it but

3727
02:17:22,239 --> 02:17:28,318
it's not all over the board yeah

3728
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:30,319
every plant is clearly the same strain

3729
02:17:28,318 --> 02:17:31,760
with some of the seeds of today if you

3730
02:17:30,318 --> 02:17:33,599
pop them

3731
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:37,920
some things from me as well like let me

3732
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:40,478
give an example a skull cap yeah um

3733
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:43,840
that's a sour hat stash

3734
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:46,638
times biker yeah um that has way more

3735
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:49,840
variation than uh a headbanger for

3736
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:52,398
example yeah so you will find very a lot

3737
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:54,478
of different things in that yeah so um

3738
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:56,638
that's not like what i would normally

3739
02:17:54,478 --> 02:17:58,638
sell or release yeah

3740
02:17:56,638 --> 02:18:01,839
but people do love

3741
02:17:58,638 --> 02:18:03,358
the variation these days yeah

3742
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:05,359
i think there's also a very big

3743
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:08,159
difference in the market

3744
02:18:05,359 --> 02:18:11,359
like in america people

3745
02:18:08,159 --> 02:18:14,000
germinate these seeds to select a plant

3746
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:16,800
uh a clone to keep as a mom

3747
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,120
to be cropped yeah for production yeah

3748
02:18:16,799 --> 02:18:19,119
um

3749
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:23,120
here

3750
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:24,479
it's a lot of times not like that yeah

3751
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:27,439
so people

3752
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:29,519
kind of want to buy a pack of seeds grow

3753
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:31,359
them and then two three years later they

3754
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:33,280
think oh that was nice yeah i'm gonna

3755
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:35,040
grow that again and they want to buy a

3756
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:37,599
pack of seeds and find the similar

3757
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:38,960
things that they found before yeah

3758
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:42,159
so um

3759
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:44,879
that's a bit of a difference yeah um

3760
02:18:42,159 --> 02:18:46,558
when it's for selection um

3761
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:49,438
and for a commercial market as a

3762
02:18:46,558 --> 02:18:51,119
producer people try to have their own

3763
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:53,040
thing yeah so then they want kind of

3764
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:56,079
more variation today

3765
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:58,319
when it's to american people and stuff

3766
02:18:56,079 --> 02:19:00,799
yeah most certainly so

3767
02:18:58,318 --> 02:19:02,558
what would you say would be a

3768
02:19:00,799 --> 02:19:04,799
kind of a deal breaker for you with a

3769
02:19:02,558 --> 02:19:06,879
strain so the the hypothetical i like to

3770
02:19:04,799 --> 02:19:08,478
give people is if you had a strain and

3771
02:19:06,879 --> 02:19:10,799
you just thought it was amazing it was

3772
02:19:08,478 --> 02:19:13,279
unique it was gonna take the market by

3773
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:16,638
storm but the downside was that there

3774
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,760
was like one herme in every pack just on

3775
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:19,920
average

3776
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:22,239
would that be a deal breaker for you and

3777
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:24,239
if not what would be the definitive deal

3778
02:19:22,239 --> 02:19:26,959
breaker if everything else was just

3779
02:19:24,239 --> 02:19:31,039
perfect so to speak

3780
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:32,718
um if my own test grows um like if it

3781
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:35,359
would be one herm in a pack that would

3782
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:35,358
be like 10

3783
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:39,359
i probably

3784
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:42,478
that'd probably be the max yeah i would

3785
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:44,559
probably still release that

3786
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:46,718
i would it would be known though before

3787
02:19:44,558 --> 02:19:48,799
i release it yet because i'm very open

3788
02:19:46,718 --> 02:19:50,639
about every test grow all these other

3789
02:19:48,799 --> 02:19:53,199
things and stuff so everybody i would i

3790
02:19:50,639 --> 02:19:55,439
would clearly state it as well

3791
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,439
um

3792
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:00,478
but when i don't like to release strains

3793
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:03,520
is when um

3794
02:20:00,478 --> 02:20:05,519
the album is weaker than both parents um

3795
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:07,760
or the goal because i most times breed

3796
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:10,399
with a goal before i even start

3797
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:11,280
selecting plans and doing things yeah

3798
02:20:10,398 --> 02:20:13,680
um

3799
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:14,720
if that goal's not met i'm kind of not

3800
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:16,479
really

3801
02:20:14,719 --> 02:20:18,079
i lose interest i don't want to release

3802
02:20:16,478 --> 02:20:19,119
it yeah as well

3803
02:20:18,079 --> 02:20:20,959
um

3804
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:23,520
and when i what i really don't like to

3805
02:20:20,959 --> 02:20:26,000
release is when um

3806
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:27,120
you get like

3807
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,600
females

3808
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:30,800
in in those seed packs that are like

3809
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:33,680
really

3810
02:20:30,799 --> 02:20:36,079
not worth smoking yeah then i don't like

3811
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:38,239
to release it yet even a bad plant in it

3812
02:20:36,079 --> 02:20:41,039
yes you'd still be okay yeah it should

3813
02:20:38,239 --> 02:20:44,719
still be nice okay to smoke and

3814
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:46,399
things like that um

3815
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:48,799
of course for people when they only grow

3816
02:20:46,398 --> 02:20:51,599
like five or ten plants and there's like

3817
02:20:48,799 --> 02:20:54,639
two plants that's just not enjoyable to

3818
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:56,960
smoke yeah that that's terrible yeah

3819
02:20:54,639 --> 02:20:58,959
that's just terrible

3820
02:20:56,959 --> 02:21:02,000
yeah so

3821
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:05,279
while we're talking genetics what is one

3822
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:06,719
strain or just in general line that you

3823
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:08,800
love to work with but you just don't

3824
02:21:06,719 --> 02:21:11,799
have access to

3825
02:21:08,799 --> 02:21:11,799
um

3826
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:17,840
i gotta be honest jeff

3827
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:21,120
i've been in this i've been growing for

3828
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:23,280
almost 30 years now i was in the forums

3829
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:24,319
very early as well yes i have like a

3830
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:27,359
really

3831
02:21:24,318 --> 02:21:29,519
big white network um and i traveled a

3832
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:32,239
lot as well

3833
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:33,280
most times if i think of something yeah

3834
02:21:32,239 --> 02:21:35,680
um

3835
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:38,479
and i really start asking it kind of

3836
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:39,840
almost always really comes out yeah but

3837
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:42,398
then there are some things that are

3838
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:43,600
probably like maybe not even true yeah

3839
02:21:42,398 --> 02:21:45,279
like um

3840
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:47,920
they used to be talking about this cut

3841
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:50,800
called asia fantasia yeah

3842
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:52,719
um i never seen that um

3843
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:56,239
i would be interested to see it if it's

3844
02:21:52,719 --> 02:21:59,279
even real um

3845
02:21:56,239 --> 02:21:59,280
outside of that

3846
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:03,520
no

3847
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:06,319
well maybe some land races but then i

3848
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:08,560
just don't know i'm looking for them yet

3849
02:22:06,318 --> 02:22:11,359
so is there any land race that you don't

3850
02:22:08,559 --> 02:22:12,959
have access to that you wish you did

3851
02:22:11,359 --> 02:22:15,120
i have different

3852
02:22:12,959 --> 02:22:17,438
nepalese yeah and i have something with

3853
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:18,960
nepal as a country yeah i've spent there

3854
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:20,159
months

3855
02:22:18,959 --> 02:22:21,039
before

3856
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:22,398
um

3857
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:24,560
but it's so diverse

3858
02:22:22,398 --> 02:22:26,559
yeah all the weed that i've seen there

3859
02:22:24,559 --> 02:22:28,398
in different places so many different

3860
02:22:26,559 --> 02:22:30,079
smells and things here that someone says

3861
02:22:28,398 --> 02:22:31,760
nepalese well that could be so many

3862
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:32,959
different things yeah

3863
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:35,760
um

3864
02:22:32,959 --> 02:22:37,679
but yeah that definitely intrigues me a

3865
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:39,760
lot yeah and it's something i haven't

3866
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:40,960
[ __ ] or spent a lot of time in in

3867
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:44,079
germinating

3868
02:22:40,959 --> 02:22:45,679
seats from nepal so

3869
02:22:44,079 --> 02:22:48,478
that's definitely something i want to do

3870
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:50,559
i don't think it has a huge commercial

3871
02:22:48,478 --> 02:22:53,039
aspect though but it definitely has a

3872
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:54,879
big personal interest

3873
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:57,200
yeah of course and i guess that just

3874
02:22:54,879 --> 02:22:59,199
reinforces that point you made about b

3875
02:22:57,200 --> 02:23:01,200
and what he could bring to the table but

3876
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:03,200
with that being said are there any

3877
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:06,000
countries you would love to go and do

3878
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:08,560
your own little seed pilgrimage in

3879
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,920
yeah i'd love to go to afghanistan to be

3880
02:23:08,559 --> 02:23:14,159
honest

3881
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:14,159
um i love to go back to nepal as well

3882
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:19,600
yeah

3883
02:23:16,398 --> 02:23:21,920
and hindu couch yeah i'd like to

3884
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:23,920
yeah i like that region i would like to

3885
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:27,439
it's not the time to go there now yeah

3886
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:29,600
for me um but i would lovely like

3887
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:32,800
to search around there

3888
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:34,960
yeah so do you feel like there is still

3889
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:36,239
some really good stock to be gained from

3890
02:23:34,959 --> 02:23:38,000
these areas or do you feel like it's

3891
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:39,359
already been watered down and as an

3892
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,359
extension of that

3893
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:42,640
how do you feel about the actions of

3894
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:45,200
some of the people who have gone there

3895
02:23:42,639 --> 02:23:47,760
in the past and diluted the seeds with

3896
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:49,680
more modern genetics

3897
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:51,439
as for the

3898
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:54,559
well i think some of these places are

3899
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:56,880
not that welcoming at this time yeah um

3900
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:59,840
those places is there will be loads of

3901
02:23:56,879 --> 02:24:01,759
little cells and stuff here

3902
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:03,760
which are now kind of hard to get to

3903
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:05,600
yeah

3904
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:09,040
there's definitely a lot of stuff there

3905
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:11,359
yes still i'm 100 sure also untouched

3906
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:13,359
yeah when it comes to afghanistan

3907
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:14,800
definitely in nepal yeah because you

3908
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:17,920
have to understand those are the

3909
02:24:14,799 --> 02:24:19,119
mountains and the himalaya here so even

3910
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:21,600
when you

3911
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:23,520
bring in seeds yeah and then most bigger

3912
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:24,640
growers are always in the valley and not

3913
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:25,920
on the top

3914
02:24:24,639 --> 02:24:28,799
um

3915
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:31,760
that pollen doesn't travel as far

3916
02:24:28,799 --> 02:24:33,438
as in like a flat dry country here

3917
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,600
so um

3918
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:37,680
and it kind of breeds itself out as well

3919
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:39,680
pretty fast in most places as well like

3920
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:42,479
in morocco yeah um

3921
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:44,559
if they would not bring any more of

3922
02:24:42,478 --> 02:24:46,719
these seeds in there yeah in a couple of

3923
02:24:44,559 --> 02:24:49,439
years a lot of things will turn back as

3924
02:24:46,719 --> 02:24:51,039
well yeah which has to do with that uh

3925
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:53,359
different flowering times of these

3926
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:55,439
genetics yeah so that it kind of starts

3927
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:58,159
to separate each other as well

3928
02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:59,600
if you just let it go

3929
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:01,760
and so

3930
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:04,559
where do you think would be

3931
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:06,478
the highest chance of getting pure land

3932
02:25:04,559 --> 02:25:07,680
race

3933
02:25:06,478 --> 02:25:08,840
um

3934
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:11,120
i think the

3935
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:13,840
himalayas like like i said i think

3936
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:15,840
mountain regions are very good just

3937
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:17,600
naturally yeah because it's harder to

3938
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:19,840
get all these cross-pollinations and

3939
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:22,159
stuff and you get all these little cells

3940
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:24,159
that evolve themselves

3941
02:25:22,159 --> 02:25:25,280
um so i think those are always good

3942
02:25:24,159 --> 02:25:27,760
places

3943
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:29,359
um yeah then places where it's not that

3944
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:34,079
welcome and there's not that many people

3945
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:36,318
as well yeah um so um yeah i mean uh

3946
02:25:34,079 --> 02:25:38,079
afghanistan used to be very open and

3947
02:25:36,318 --> 02:25:40,239
very welcoming and stuff and you can

3948
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:42,959
still go there don't get me wrong but a

3949
02:25:40,239 --> 02:25:45,680
lot of people won't go there now yeah

3950
02:25:42,959 --> 02:25:46,959
so um yeah then it's protected more as

3951
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:50,318
well yeah

3952
02:25:46,959 --> 02:25:52,159
yeah most certainly let's just jump back

3953
02:25:50,318 --> 02:25:53,920
to the modern world of breeding for a

3954
02:25:52,159 --> 02:25:56,159
moment i was cruising through your ig

3955
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:57,760
last night and i saw some photos of the

3956
02:25:56,159 --> 02:25:59,680
white og

3957
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:02,079
god they looked awesome reminded me of

3958
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:05,439
the old school photos of deep chunk from

3959
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:08,000
tom hill so two-parter question

3962
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:14,159
um

3963
02:26:12,799 --> 02:26:16,559
tom hill

3964
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:18,239
i've grown deep chunk before i like tom

3965
02:26:16,559 --> 02:26:20,879

3966
02:26:18,239 --> 02:26:22,559
forums and stuff very knowledgeable gaia

3967
02:26:20,879 --> 02:26:24,639
and someone that

3968
02:26:22,559 --> 02:26:26,719
yeah did it kind of really and also

3969
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:28,799
teached a lot of us all kinds of things

3970
02:26:26,719 --> 02:26:30,879
here

3971
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:32,840
so yeah no i have big respect for tom

3972
02:26:30,879 --> 02:26:36,478
hill

3973
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:38,639
um white og y2g that's

3974
02:26:36,478 --> 02:26:41,719
the strain that i had my first prize at

3975
02:26:38,639 --> 02:26:45,279
high times cup with and i think in

3976
02:26:41,719 --> 02:26:46,478
2010 or 2009

3977
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:49,600
um

3978
02:26:46,478 --> 02:26:51,599
after that i lost that original milia in

3979
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:52,559
the police bust

3980
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:55,040
um

3981
02:26:52,559 --> 02:26:57,359
so i made a new version here

3982
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:59,439
um which is the v2 which is what every

3983
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:02,239
which everywhere now and what i've sold

3984
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:04,639
all the time um now that won almost

3985
02:27:02,239 --> 02:27:05,680
every first prize in spain years ago

3986
02:27:04,639 --> 02:27:06,959
yeah

3987
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:09,680
um

3988
02:27:06,959 --> 02:27:11,519
it's a very good strain it kind of came

3989
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:14,239
out a little bit after

3990
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:16,720
the wide fire from og rascal that was a

3991
02:27:14,239 --> 02:27:18,719
feminized thing um

3992
02:27:16,719 --> 02:27:21,039
this was like a regular

3993
02:27:18,719 --> 02:27:23,279
og times the white yeah at that time

3994
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:25,520
that there were not that many of those

3995
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:27,840
things around to be honest as well now

3996
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:30,960
there's a lot of og times the white

3997
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:33,520
yeah certainly do you think that if you

3998
02:27:30,959 --> 02:27:35,199
had for example jungle boys do a massive

3999
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:37,840
pheno hunt of your strains it would help

4000
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:39,040
put you on the map a bit more

4001
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:40,639
oh yeah of course

4002
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:42,319
everybody looks at

4003
02:27:40,639 --> 02:27:45,039
that yeah and they're very good at that

4004
02:27:42,318 --> 02:27:48,000
as well yeah um no of course if someone

4005
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:50,080
like jungle boys or if burner or

4006
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:52,159
some of these other promoting or people

4007
02:27:50,079 --> 02:27:54,079
that really get looked at

4008
02:27:52,159 --> 02:27:56,478
if they grow your things

4009
02:27:54,079 --> 02:27:58,559
it always makes you noticed way more of

4010
02:27:56,478 --> 02:28:01,039
course

4011
02:27:58,559 --> 02:28:03,840
and so how do you feel about companies

4012
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:06,479
like jungle boys and even cookie fam who

4013
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:08,639
are expanding out into kind of the

4014
02:28:06,478 --> 02:28:10,639
clothing domain and becoming more of a

4015
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:12,398
lifestyle brand than just a cannabis

4016
02:28:10,639 --> 02:28:13,920
brand what do you think of this idea and

4017
02:28:12,398 --> 02:28:15,439
would you ever consider it for your own

4018
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:17,680
brand

4019
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:20,239
uh nah not me man

4020
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:23,040
i'm like a garden guy i'm not even a

4021
02:28:20,239 --> 02:28:25,280
business or a seed company i've

4022
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:26,399
i'm not that good at all that part of it

4023
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:27,359
even yeah

4024
02:28:26,398 --> 02:28:28,799
um

4025
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:31,359
so no no

4026
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:33,438
me that won't happen for sure and i'm

4027
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:35,120
way too sober i'm like a sober dutch guy

4028
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:36,960
yeah so uh

4029
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:40,000
no

4030
02:28:36,959 --> 02:28:41,759
i go to hollywood and la a lot and

4031
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:43,680
the difference is too big i cannot

4032
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:46,639
become that yeah it's just not possible

4033
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:48,559
yeah it's not in my nature um

4034
02:28:46,639 --> 02:28:50,239
but um

4035
02:28:48,559 --> 02:28:51,840
yeah i think it's good that they do that

4036
02:28:50,239 --> 02:28:54,000
to be honest yeah i think it kind of

4037
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:55,439
fits

4038
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,000
a wrapper more

4039
02:28:55,439 --> 02:29:00,559
to be busy with a clothing brand and

4040
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,559
lifestyle

4041
02:29:00,959 --> 02:29:06,239
than a wheat brand if i'm honest

4042
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:08,159
yeah of course of course

4043
02:29:06,239 --> 02:29:10,559
so with that being said what would be

4044
02:29:08,159 --> 02:29:12,318
your advice for a newly starting out

4045
02:29:10,559 --> 02:29:14,000
breeder what's the best way they can

4046
02:29:12,318 --> 02:29:17,119
kind of get themselves and get their

4047
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:19,439
name a bit more exposure

4048
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:21,359
um

4049
02:29:19,439 --> 02:29:24,318
well the first thing i think if you want

4050
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:26,479
to like i get this question so much here

4051
02:29:24,318 --> 02:29:29,039
people want to become a start a seed

4052
02:29:26,478 --> 02:29:30,879
company and want to begin in breeding

4053
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:33,439
and things like that yeah

4054
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:35,358
now if you want to sell seeds commercial

4055
02:29:33,439 --> 02:29:37,280
with how the market is and how the

4056
02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:38,000
public looks at it yeah

4057
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,680
you

4058
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:42,159
one you have to be a little bit more

4059
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:44,639
original than it is at the moment yeah

4060
02:29:42,159 --> 02:29:46,478
that's one thing i think yeah

4061
02:29:44,639 --> 02:29:47,920
the other thing is if you're gonna make

4062
02:29:46,478 --> 02:29:49,358
regular seats

4063
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:51,680
put some effort

4064
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:53,600
in your meal yeah because the meal is

4065
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:55,600
what it's all about yeah you gotta breed

4066
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:57,760
your meal you don't pick a meal from

4067
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:59,600
someone else's seeds you always create

4068
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:01,680
your own meal you can create it with

4069
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:04,159
stuff you buy from different people and

4070
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:08,479
things like that but you create your own

4071
02:30:04,159 --> 02:30:11,119
mail by crossing things a few times or

4072
02:30:08,478 --> 02:30:13,039
things like that yeah um then you have a

4073
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:14,880
unique mail as well yeah which also

4074
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,800
makes it you don't get copied the same

4075
02:30:14,879 --> 02:30:18,398
thing like i all these other people are

4076
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:20,559
yeah

4077
02:30:18,398 --> 02:30:23,920
so i think that's very important then i

4078
02:30:20,559 --> 02:30:25,840
personally think it's always best to

4079
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:27,439
select everything from seed that you use

4080
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:29,120
yeah if you just use the cost that

4081
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:31,439
everybody use you're just gonna be one

4082
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:34,560
of the rest and you're not going to be

4083
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:36,318
noticed that much either yeah now by

4084
02:30:34,559 --> 02:30:37,279
doing that you do have to prove more

4085
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:38,879
yeah

4086
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:40,640
because then people say oh yeah well i

4087
02:30:38,879 --> 02:30:42,079
don't know what that is oh yeah you know

4088
02:30:40,639 --> 02:30:44,079
that's from seed yeah what a lot of

4089
02:30:42,079 --> 02:30:48,398
people say these days which is of course

4090
02:30:44,079 --> 02:30:48,398
is nonsense every clone comes from seeds

4091
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:52,319
then i think you do need to enter some

4092
02:30:50,879 --> 02:30:53,759
cups yeah because

4093
02:30:52,318 --> 02:30:55,279
that's kind of the starting rolling

4094
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:56,800
point that's what these cups are still

4095
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:58,640
good for

4096
02:30:56,799 --> 02:31:01,920
if no one knows about you and you win

4097
02:30:58,639 --> 02:31:04,239
these cups or you win one or two of them

4098
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:06,398
and then it get that dust get the ball

4099
02:31:04,239 --> 02:31:09,119
rolling yeah that will get a few good

4100
02:31:06,398 --> 02:31:11,519
growers interested to try out your seeds

4101
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:13,840
then when good growers grow your seeds

4102
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:15,920
um and they post it over social media

4103
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:18,318
and things like that then the flame

4104
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:20,719
really starts to burn

4105
02:31:18,318 --> 02:31:23,519
yeah what a fantastic sentiment that

4106
02:31:20,719 --> 02:31:25,760
kind of echoes my exact personal views

4107
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:28,560
so a question i do want to quickly ask

4108
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:30,880
though how long or what process should

4109
02:31:28,559 --> 02:31:33,039
someone go through before they start to

4110
02:31:30,879 --> 02:31:34,959
label themselves a breeder it seems to

4111
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:36,800
me as though as soon as people first get

4112
02:31:34,959 --> 02:31:38,719
the idea that they would like to breed

4113
02:31:36,799 --> 02:31:40,318
they're immediately a breeder

4114
02:31:38,719 --> 02:31:41,599
do you care about things like this and

4115
02:31:40,318 --> 02:31:42,478
what do you think are kind of the

4116
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:44,640
necessary

4117
02:31:42,478 --> 02:31:46,719
steps before you can really start to

4118
02:31:44,639 --> 02:31:49,199
label yourself as such

4119
02:31:46,719 --> 02:31:52,559
i didn't label myself a breeder to like

4120
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:52,560
a couple of years ago

4121
02:31:52,719 --> 02:31:54,719
i mean

4122
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:57,280
when you

4123
02:31:54,719 --> 02:31:58,559
cross things you're breeding yeah so in

4124
02:31:57,280 --> 02:32:01,040
all honesty

4125
02:31:58,559 --> 02:32:03,199
yeah they are breeders yeah um even when

4126
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:04,000
you start you're kind of are a breeder

4127
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:06,000
yeah

4128
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:08,040
um

4129
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:10,398
i think if you use it as a

4130
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:12,560
classification yeah you gotta have some

4131
02:32:10,398 --> 02:32:14,478
experience and some knowledge though

4132
02:32:12,559 --> 02:32:16,799
before you put that on i mean i hate the

4133
02:32:14,478 --> 02:32:18,959
name master grower for example yeah so

4134
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:20,639
the master breeder that that's like a

4135
02:32:18,959 --> 02:32:22,559
no-go for me

4136
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:24,799
that's like a no-go if anyone calls

4137
02:32:22,559 --> 02:32:27,119
himself a master breeder

4138
02:32:24,799 --> 02:32:28,879
yeah no i don't think

4139
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:32,640
i don't think people are capable to

4140
02:32:28,879 --> 02:32:35,039
learn in all of that in even one life

4141
02:32:32,639 --> 02:32:36,879
yeah most certainly just

4142
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:38,399
i had i had a

4143
02:32:36,879 --> 02:32:40,559
someone email me

4144
02:32:38,398 --> 02:32:43,279
asking if they could get on the show and

4145
02:32:40,559 --> 02:32:44,799
i was like uh no sorry um

4146
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:47,120
the show's really just kind of for

4147
02:32:44,799 --> 02:32:50,079
breeders and as tongue-in-cheek i was

4148
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:51,600
like oh and also master growers and they

4149
02:32:50,079 --> 02:32:55,200
replied and they were like well i'm

4150
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:57,760
actually a master grower and i was like

4151
02:32:55,200 --> 02:33:00,240
dude i was joking

4152
02:32:57,760 --> 02:33:02,000
yeah no that's a terrible term master

4153
02:33:00,239 --> 02:33:03,760
grower yeah

4154
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,600
we call them head growers yeah i think

4155
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:07,520
that's a good name for it

4156
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:10,079
in these bigger operations if you're

4157
02:33:07,520 --> 02:33:13,680
like that guy that has to um

4158
02:33:10,079 --> 02:33:16,000
manage everything and uh or the one and

4159
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:18,559
responsible and stuff yeah then you're a

4160
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:20,959
hat grower yeah that's a good term for

4161
02:33:18,559 --> 02:33:24,000
it i think a master grower that's like

4162
02:33:20,959 --> 02:33:26,000
uh that's like kung fu movie it's that's

4163
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:27,920
not the way it is

4164
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,520
i think it's kind of like you don't

4165
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:31,200
acknowledge that there's we're all

4166
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:32,560
students you know there's still more to

4167
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:34,960
learn

4168
02:33:32,559 --> 02:33:36,719
oh yeah there

4169
02:33:34,959 --> 02:33:38,639
this is so young yeah definitely now it

4170
02:33:36,719 --> 02:33:41,279
gets legal and open yeah you see

4171
02:33:38,639 --> 02:33:43,199
everything moving way faster yeah oh

4172
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:46,640
there's gonna be so much in the coming

4173
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:48,800
years yeah that's gonna

4174
02:33:46,639 --> 02:33:49,599
change yeah so oh

4175
02:33:48,799 --> 02:33:51,840
yeah

4176
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:54,079
none of us know it all yet

4177
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:56,478
of course of course so

4178
02:33:54,079 --> 02:33:58,239
what do you think about clone hoarding

4179
02:33:56,478 --> 02:33:59,920
do you think it's kind of a necessity

4180
02:33:58,239 --> 02:34:01,840
when you're breeding to just keep

4181
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:04,159
certain things to yourself or at least

4182
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:06,159
out of the hands of public so that it's

4183
02:34:04,159 --> 02:34:07,840
kind of like makes your work a commodity

4184
02:34:06,159 --> 02:34:10,559
or do you think overall it's somewhat a

4185
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:13,120
hindrance to the community

4186
02:34:10,559 --> 02:34:14,398
the only thing i don't like as much is

4187
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:16,160
like

4188
02:34:14,398 --> 02:34:18,318
when all your clones get into the hands

4189
02:34:16,159 --> 02:34:20,959
of these other seed makers yeah

4190
02:34:18,318 --> 02:34:23,279
um i kind of like it if my

4191
02:34:20,959 --> 02:34:25,679
uh breeding clones get grown for flower

4192
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:28,000
and the flower would be everywhere yeah

4193
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:30,159
i kind of like that yeah but

4194
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,159
you have to protect something sometimes

4195
02:34:30,159 --> 02:34:34,879
when you're a commercial seed company

4196
02:34:32,159 --> 02:34:37,200
though um outside of that i like to

4197
02:34:34,879 --> 02:34:39,920
share stuff yeah i've shared most of my

4198
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:42,000
things with a lot of people

4199
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:43,439
so a question i wanted to quickly run by

4200
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:45,520
or probably could have segued it in

4201
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:47,280
somewhere earlier but here is as good as

4202
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:49,040
any point i figure would you ever

4203
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:51,040
consider working with companies like

4204
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:52,800
philos and do you have any concerns

4205
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:54,960
about these kind of genetic mapping

4206
02:34:52,799 --> 02:34:56,799
companies and the potential implications

4207
02:34:54,959 --> 02:34:58,959
in the future of what could happen with

4208
02:34:56,799 --> 02:35:00,239
this data

4209
02:34:58,959 --> 02:35:04,318
um

4210
02:35:00,239 --> 02:35:06,879
well my friend sure he had some things

4211
02:35:04,318 --> 02:35:09,439
tested from me by them as well and we

4212
02:35:06,879 --> 02:35:12,879
are doing like a breeding type thing

4213
02:35:09,439 --> 02:35:14,960
with them now but then i did pick

4214
02:35:12,879 --> 02:35:17,519
what we're gonna do and which gene pool

4215
02:35:14,959 --> 02:35:19,438
kind of carefully as well yeah so i

4216
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:20,880
picked super silver haze because it's so

4217
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:23,520
widespread and there's nothing to

4218
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:25,679
protect about it but it's very special

4219
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:27,760
on all those seats

4220
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:29,520
so i thought that'd be a good one to use

4221
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:32,398
for that

4222
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:34,159
i did not enter all my special or unique

4223
02:35:32,398 --> 02:35:36,639
things in there though

4224
02:35:34,159 --> 02:35:38,959
and i'm not gonna do that either

4225
02:35:36,639 --> 02:35:41,039
but there is some clones from me that

4226
02:35:38,959 --> 02:35:42,959
did get into filos

4227
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:46,080
i'm just not the one that entered them

4228
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:49,039
the the a5 cut is in there now

4229
02:35:46,079 --> 02:35:51,439
one that i know is that came from me um

4230
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:53,200
and went to someone and that person gave

4231
02:35:51,439 --> 02:35:54,880
it away to someone else and that one

4232
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:58,720
entered it and i know that one's

4233
02:35:54,879 --> 02:36:01,679
certified yeah um that came from me uh

4234
02:35:58,719 --> 02:36:04,159
so i know that one's genuine yeah um

4235
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:07,040
that's a seats they entered it

4236
02:36:04,159 --> 02:36:09,280
um so you can check that up then my cut

4237
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:12,640
my melon cut is in there as well this is

4238
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:15,280
the mom of the seeds of the dum melon

4239
02:36:12,639 --> 02:36:16,559
um that one's in there as well

4240
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:18,239
um

4241
02:36:16,559 --> 02:36:19,680
and they think there's another one in

4242
02:36:18,239 --> 02:36:21,439
there as well

4243
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:23,439
um

4244
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:25,840
yeah do do tell us a little bit more

4245
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:27,680
about the melon or the the melon cut

4246
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:29,120
itself because i saw that one when i was

4247
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:30,880
looking at some of your strengths and i

4248
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:32,800
was like melon's one of those terpene

4249
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:34,478
profiles you you just don't come across

4250
02:36:32,799 --> 02:36:36,639
as regularly you know it's kind of like

4251
02:36:34,478 --> 02:36:38,239
a hot commodity what do you think of the

4252
02:36:36,639 --> 02:36:40,719
melon cut

4253
02:36:38,239 --> 02:36:42,559
well let me just say um

4254
02:36:40,719 --> 02:36:45,119
i named this cut

4255
02:36:42,559 --> 02:36:47,359
melon yeah this is this is

4256
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:48,720
2013

4257
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:49,520
probably

4258
02:36:48,719 --> 02:36:50,398
yeah

4259
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:52,159
um

4260
02:36:50,398 --> 02:36:53,279
and people always ask me what is it i

4261
02:36:52,159 --> 02:36:55,359
said well

4262
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:57,280
they come from seeds that i traded on

4263
02:36:55,359 --> 02:36:58,318
overgrow and they were labeled fruity

4264
02:36:57,280 --> 02:37:00,319
skunk

4265
02:36:58,318 --> 02:37:02,239
number two or three

4266
02:37:00,318 --> 02:37:04,478
and i had a few different bags with just

4267
02:37:02,239 --> 02:37:07,199
like different numbers on them there's

4268
02:37:04,478 --> 02:37:10,318
definitely no skunk in it at all um it

4269
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:12,240
is more has more og type thing to it and

4270
02:37:10,318 --> 02:37:15,039
then this one had like a

4271
02:37:12,239 --> 02:37:18,398
green melon candy yeah type smell and

4272
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:20,880
flavor to it yeah that's very unique

4273
02:37:18,398 --> 02:37:22,639
um my other friend says it smells like

4274
02:37:20,879 --> 02:37:24,239
lychees yeah

4275
02:37:22,639 --> 02:37:25,519
um

4276
02:37:24,239 --> 02:37:28,079
it's not

4277
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:29,760
the watermelon or the jeans that

4278
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:32,478
afterwards um

4279
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:35,040
came into cali and stuff like that this

4280
02:37:32,478 --> 02:37:36,799
was there way before that

4281
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:38,160
do you have any plans to work it further

4282
02:37:36,799 --> 02:37:39,358
at all

4283
02:37:38,159 --> 02:37:40,559
oh yeah 100

4284
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:43,120
the

4285
02:37:40,559 --> 02:37:44,840
that weed i used to always only grow it

4286
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:47,359
myself and smoke it

4287
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:49,040
myself it's like one of my favorite

4288
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:51,439
indicas to smoke

4289
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:53,760
so if i could only pick two weeds i

4290
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:56,639
probably have that as my indica and then

4291
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:59,200
i have my sour d as my like sativa type

4292
02:37:56,639 --> 02:37:59,199
hybrid

4293
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:02,239
yeah i'm definitely going to work more

4294
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:04,239
with it i'm selecting males at the

4295
02:38:02,239 --> 02:38:06,879
moment

4296
02:38:04,239 --> 02:38:08,799
yeah okay interesting interesting so i

4297
02:38:06,879 --> 02:38:10,559
just wanted to jump back to a point you

4298
02:38:08,799 --> 02:38:12,799
you didn't specifically say but i think

4299
02:38:10,559 --> 02:38:14,559
you're alluding to it before you've been

4300
02:38:12,799 --> 02:38:17,438
working with the dutch consulting

4301
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:19,439
company how's that been

4302
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:20,880
yeah so that's a company i've put up

4303
02:38:19,439 --> 02:38:24,720
with

4304
02:38:20,879 --> 02:38:27,839
two friends and then another person

4305
02:38:24,719 --> 02:38:30,239
that's like the financial backbone of it

4306
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,239
um

4307
02:38:30,398 --> 02:38:35,920

4308
02:38:32,559 --> 02:38:38,079

yeah that company's

4311
02:38:40,239 --> 02:38:46,318
like one was needed um and i think it's

4312
02:38:44,079 --> 02:38:49,439
a big success and it's it's only just

4313

02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:04,840
i i call it our

4344
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:06,398
bridge yeah between like um

4345
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:08,159
our

4346
02:40:06,398 --> 02:40:10,318
group and seeing like morally

4347
02:40:08,159 --> 02:40:12,159
alternative hippie really garden

4348
02:40:10,318 --> 02:40:13,680
cannabis type guys

4349
02:40:12,159 --> 02:40:16,879
and then they're like the bridge in

4350
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:16,880
between us and the

4351
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:21,840
guys that don't kind of don't grow weed

4352
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:23,279
yeah and it sits behind the desk

4353
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:25,200
yeah so

4354
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:27,600
that makes it work yeah you need that

4355
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:28,880
bridge in between it for it to work with

4356
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:32,399
better

4357
02:40:28,879 --> 02:40:32,398
and that seems to work really well

4358
02:40:32,559 --> 02:40:37,119
so when you get brought in to help fix

4359
02:40:34,799 --> 02:40:38,879
up some of these problem operations

4360
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:40,319
what's one of the most common things you

4361
02:40:38,879 --> 02:40:43,438
see that they're getting wrong that you

4362
02:40:40,318 --> 02:40:46,159
need to fix up for them

4363
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:48,159
well all the things that we've done now

4364
02:40:46,159 --> 02:40:50,639
they're definitely the genetics was like

4365
02:40:48,159 --> 02:40:53,520
very boring and just like what you see

4366
02:40:50,639 --> 02:40:55,920
all these big people grow yeah they

4367
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:59,120
they all grow a lot of gorilla glue for

4368
02:40:55,920 --> 02:41:00,000
blue dream all those type of plants yeah

4369
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:02,160
um

4370
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:05,520
so you can already make a big change in

4371
02:41:02,159 --> 02:41:06,719
that um then ipm is always a huge

4372
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,920
[ __ ] up

4373
02:41:06,719 --> 02:41:10,000
um

4374
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:11,520
all these grows most times are too dirty

4375
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,680
yeah um

4376
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:16,319
and don't get me wrong it's very hard to

4377
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:19,200
grow clean good cannabis on a big scale

4378
02:41:16,318 --> 02:41:21,039
yeah it's very difficult

4379
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:24,079
it takes a very

4380
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:25,840
good management and

4381
02:41:24,079 --> 02:41:27,279
system yeah

4382
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:29,040
for that to work yeah because you work

4383
02:41:27,279 --> 02:41:32,399
with a lot of people

4384
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:34,479
um it's not easy to do yeah

4385
02:41:32,398 --> 02:41:36,478
once you turn it around it it's like a

4386
02:41:34,478 --> 02:41:38,239
huge difference yeah it becomes a huge

4387
02:41:36,478 --> 02:41:39,840
difference

4388
02:41:38,239 --> 02:41:42,318
yeah okay so when you're dealing with

4389
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:44,318
these large commercial operations what's

4390
02:41:42,318 --> 02:41:46,398
the type of lighting technology you're

4391
02:41:44,318 --> 02:41:47,920
usually advocating for and does that

4392
02:41:46,398 --> 02:41:50,879
differ from what you would use on a

4393
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:52,000
small homegrown level

4394
02:41:50,879 --> 02:41:53,519
um

4395
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:56,318
no

4396
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:59,439
it would be pretty simple now that

4397
02:41:56,318 --> 02:42:02,639
aspect would be

4398
02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:04,880
a responsibility for not for me but for

4399
02:42:02,639 --> 02:42:07,278
a gene finder yeah

4400
02:42:04,879 --> 02:42:09,599
that would be his part of the thing he's

4401
02:42:07,279 --> 02:42:11,680
like way more knowledgeable and on all

4402
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:13,600
those things than i am yeah there's so

4403
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:17,120
much test experience with all these

4404
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:19,200
different things as well um me indoor i

4405
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:21,439
i run gravitas yeah

4406
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:22,399
if i put up a room somewhere

4407
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:24,639
um

4408
02:42:22,398 --> 02:42:27,599
but in the bigger greenhouses now that

4409
02:42:24,639 --> 02:42:30,959
we're running there um we're putting in

4410
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:34,399
led lights in the one in california and

4411
02:42:30,959 --> 02:42:35,679
seems to work well as well so

4412
02:42:34,398 --> 02:42:36,478
yeah okay

4413
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:39,040
and

4414
02:42:36,478 --> 02:42:41,519
do you have any concerns about

4415
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:44,000
the gavitas and how they were bought out

4416
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:45,760
by bayer or whatever the monsanto

4417
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:48,079
whatever it was a while ago i heard

4418
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:49,600
rumors of that

4419
02:42:48,079 --> 02:42:52,478
um

4420
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:56,399
i i don't like it

4421
02:42:52,478 --> 02:42:58,478
when it is like that um i'd be honest i

4422
02:42:56,398 --> 02:43:01,199
got ones that are very old yeah they

4423
02:42:58,478 --> 02:43:03,519
they're from way before that time

4424
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:05,680
but uh

4425
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:07,840
now it sucks if you support something

4426
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:10,000
wrong yeah

4427
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:11,840
and there is different ones these days

4428
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,318
as well which are just as good yeah as

4429
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:16,079
long as the double ended and the 400

4430
02:43:14,318 --> 02:43:18,079
volt technique is what really makes

4431
02:43:16,079 --> 02:43:20,639
those lights

4432
02:43:18,079 --> 02:43:21,520
yeah definitely definitely

4433
02:43:20,639 --> 02:43:23,278
so

4434
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:26,640
with that being said

4435
02:43:23,279 --> 02:43:28,560
i wanted to ask you a bit more of a

4436
02:43:26,639 --> 02:43:30,639
general question

4437
02:43:28,559 --> 02:43:35,439
what do you think is one of the most

4438
02:43:30,639 --> 02:43:35,439
commonly misunderstood parts of breeding

4439
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:39,120
um

4440
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:41,359
oh i think that

4441
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:44,319
like today everybody is like yeah no

4442
02:43:41,359 --> 02:43:46,800
that's an f1 it needs to be an f4

4443
02:43:44,318 --> 02:43:47,680
i'm like well what does that mean then

4444
02:43:46,799 --> 02:43:50,639
yeah

4445
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:53,120
none of those things mean anything yeah

4446
02:43:50,639 --> 02:43:56,159
um it's all about the selection and the

4447
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:58,160
stability of the parents used yeah like

4448
02:43:56,159 --> 02:44:01,039
there is not even that much of the true

4449
02:43:58,159 --> 02:44:02,719
f1 for sale in the market yeah everybody

4450
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:06,479
calls across and have one these days

4451
02:44:02,719 --> 02:44:09,438
yeah that's not a true f1 a true f1 is

4452
02:44:06,478 --> 02:44:11,199
bred by two stable parents here that

4453
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:13,040
don't give a lot of variations on

4454
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:14,720
themselves yeah

4455
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:16,640
so um

4456
02:44:14,719 --> 02:44:19,119
and then they think the f2 would be like

4457
02:44:16,639 --> 02:44:21,119
more stable and f3 would be more stable

4458
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:22,079
and f4 that all depends on how you

4459
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:24,479
select

4460
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:25,600
on the guy that bred it and how he did

4461
02:44:24,478 --> 02:44:27,599
his work

4462
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:29,760
that number doesn't say much like that

4463
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:33,200
yeah so i think that's a big

4464
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:36,079
misunderstanding at the moment

4465
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:38,000
so what type of labeling or nomenclature

4466
02:44:36,079 --> 02:44:39,920
would you want to use for kind of the

4467
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:41,920
poly hybrids where it is just you know

4468
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:43,279
two unstabilized things whacked together

4469
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:45,760
is that like a

4470
02:44:43,279 --> 02:44:47,840
we can't say p1 but maybe poly hybrid

4471
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:49,600
one

4472
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:52,960
no we can't call it a p1 because that's

4473
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:55,439
what we call a stable parent um

4474
02:44:52,959 --> 02:44:57,039
i don't know to be honest yeah i think

4475
02:44:55,439 --> 02:44:59,600
they should not they

4476
02:44:57,040 --> 02:45:01,840
it should be it's just a cross yeah

4477
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:05,200
it's just a cross that's that's what it

4478
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:05,200
is it it um

4479
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:09,120
i think that shouldn't even be labeled

4480
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:12,239
it should definitely

4481
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:16,880
not be labeled in f1 or we should label

4482
02:45:12,239 --> 02:45:17,760
the true f1s through f1 like tf1

4483
02:45:16,879 --> 02:45:20,318
yeah

4484
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:22,398
certainly i mean i i always think about

4485
02:45:20,318 --> 02:45:24,959
this in the context of like someone like

4486
02:45:22,398 --> 02:45:27,119
dj short who's very much worked his

4487
02:45:24,959 --> 02:45:29,039
lines from the bare land races it's like

4488
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:30,800
it must be frustrating when you're

4489
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:32,479
seeing people label things and yours is

4490
02:45:30,799 --> 02:45:34,239
the only thing that actually complies

4491
02:45:32,478 --> 02:45:37,358
with it

4492
02:45:34,239 --> 02:45:38,559
oh yeah for sure oh for sure

4493
02:45:37,359 --> 02:45:40,479
for sure

4494
02:45:38,559 --> 02:45:44,159
for sure like

4495
02:45:40,478 --> 02:45:47,119
ibl i hope to in my life uh make two

4496
02:45:44,159 --> 02:45:50,000
ibl's yeah which will just be like

4497
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:52,319
working on the lines that i'm already am

4498
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:55,120
because how many ibl's you think you can

4499
02:45:52,318 --> 02:45:57,119
make in a lifetime yeah

4500
02:45:55,120 --> 02:45:59,600
yeah i mean if you we go back to

4501
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:02,640
afghanistan right it took families many

4502
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:03,920
generations to do it so

4503
02:46:02,639 --> 02:46:06,559
yeah

4504
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:08,559
yeah okay so with that in mind what

4505
02:46:06,559 --> 02:46:12,719
keeps you motivated to keep breeding in

4506
02:46:08,559 --> 02:46:12,719
an ever more challenging environment

4507
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:18,000
i will never i always say you only lose

4508
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:20,159
when you quit yet

4509
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:22,879
but trust me in all these years i've

4510
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:25,200
bumped into a lot of problems

4511
02:46:22,879 --> 02:46:27,679
yeah um

4512
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:29,600
i lived the life of the snake and ladder

4513
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:31,760
a lot of times yeah so you climb up but

4514
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:33,600
you get trouble comes and you fall down

4515
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:34,559
to the ground again yeah

4516
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:37,120
um

4517
02:46:34,559 --> 02:46:39,519
but i will never ever quit you yeah i

4518
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:41,040
like i st i sell seeds so that i can do

4519
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:42,319
more breeding yeah because it costs a

4520
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:43,359
lot of money

4521
02:46:42,318 --> 02:46:45,840
um

4522
02:46:43,359 --> 02:46:47,920
the passion is bigger than

4523
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:50,318
than anything in it yeah

4524
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:51,279
like i i've got away from my family for

4525
02:46:50,318 --> 02:46:54,079
months

4526
02:46:51,279 --> 02:46:55,680
i've taken risks all kinds of things

4527
02:46:54,079 --> 02:46:57,120
yeah

4528
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:59,040
and then people think

4529
02:46:57,120 --> 02:47:01,279
how the hell can you do it for the i

4530
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:03,359
just have to do it yeah

4531
02:47:01,279 --> 02:47:04,399
it's the passion in it you had to drive

4532
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:08,800
yeah

4533
02:47:04,398 --> 02:47:10,159
i would do anything to keep on doing it

4534
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:12,959
yeah okay so

4535
02:47:10,159 --> 02:47:13,920
can't take the plan out of the boy

4536
02:47:12,959 --> 02:47:15,679
no

4537
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:17,439
no

4538
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:19,680
it's one of the most important things in

4539
02:47:17,439 --> 02:47:21,920
my life it's that and then my fam and my

4540
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:23,840
family yeah that's it

4541
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:26,559
those things are like they're they're

4542
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:28,159
almost they're almost equal to me

4543
02:47:26,559 --> 02:47:29,278
yeah no i agree

4544
02:47:28,159 --> 02:47:31,680
so

4545
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:34,239
next question i had for you who is your

4546
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:36,239
favorite breeder who's currently active

4547
02:47:34,239 --> 02:47:38,159
and have you ever considered doing a

4548
02:47:36,239 --> 02:47:39,359
collab with them

4549
02:47:38,159 --> 02:47:41,039
and

4550
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:45,359
i have a couple of breeders that i

4551
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:45,359
really like yeah and i respect

4552
02:47:46,478 --> 02:47:51,119
all of them are pretty different um as

4553
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:53,760
well yeah um

4554
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:56,800
like i have a lot of respect for simon

4555
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:59,200
from serious seeds um

4556
02:47:56,799 --> 02:48:01,438
then two of my friends which is jj and

4557
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:03,439
camarado i like them a lot and then

4558
02:48:01,439 --> 02:48:05,120
bowdai as well yeah

4559
02:48:03,439 --> 02:48:06,960
those are people i really

4560
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:08,160
like and i grow a lot of seeds from as

4561
02:48:06,959 --> 02:48:10,559
well yeah

4562
02:48:08,159 --> 02:48:12,159
um and then when people ask me or my

4563
02:48:10,559 --> 02:48:13,840
friends i say oh you gotta try some of

4564
02:48:12,159 --> 02:48:16,799
this guy and that guy those seats are

4565
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:19,040
good as well yeah so those four people i

4566
02:48:16,799 --> 02:48:20,879
really think are

4567
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:23,920
definitely deserve

4568
02:48:20,879 --> 02:48:23,920
a lot of recognition

4569
02:48:24,079 --> 02:48:26,799
yeah for sure

4570
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:29,359
so

4571
02:48:26,799 --> 02:48:31,840
with that being said i noticed that in

4572
02:48:29,359 --> 02:48:34,880
the past you'd done a collab with moscow

4573
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:36,639
using the c99bx so the first question

4574
02:48:34,879 --> 02:48:37,438
that jumped to mind was

4575
02:48:36,639 --> 02:48:40,398
when

4576
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:41,439
seoul and duke re-brought back brothers

4577
02:48:40,398 --> 02:48:43,519
grimm

4578
02:48:41,439 --> 02:48:45,600
did you immediately think to yourself oh

4579
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:48,720
cool let's let's redo that project with

4580
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:51,359
the real c99 or was it very specific to

4581
02:48:48,719 --> 02:48:53,278
that relationship you had with moscow

4582
02:48:51,359 --> 02:48:56,000
yeah i know moscow for a long time

4583
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:56,880
personally um

4584
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:59,279
so

4585
02:48:56,879 --> 02:49:01,599
and at that time there was no other he

4586
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:04,079
was the only one offering c99 at the

4587
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:07,439
time as well it was what he was known

4588
02:49:04,079 --> 02:49:10,159
for at that time on the forum as well so

4589
02:49:07,439 --> 02:49:12,880
that was the thing to do if we do a

4590
02:49:10,159 --> 02:49:14,079
co-op that it was very obvious it needed

4591
02:49:12,879 --> 02:49:17,519
to be dead

4592
02:49:14,079 --> 02:49:21,680
um i have not grown the re-releases of

4593
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:23,359
uh brother grimm's c99 yeah um i still

4594
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:25,600
have to do that to be honest so i

4595
02:49:23,359 --> 02:49:27,520
haven't grown them yet a really good

4596
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:28,800
duke did an awesome job bringing that

4597
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:31,520
one back so

4598
02:49:28,799 --> 02:49:33,278
my next question is

4599
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:35,840
do you think it's possible to

4600
02:49:33,279 --> 02:49:38,479
selectively breed cannabis for specific

4601
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:40,398
medical properties like for example do

4602
02:49:38,478 --> 02:49:42,398
you think you could set out to create a

4603
02:49:40,398 --> 02:49:44,478
strain that's going to help with like

4604
02:49:42,398 --> 02:49:46,239
crohn's for example or do you think it's

4605
02:49:44,478 --> 02:49:48,159
just kind of luck of the draw in terms

4606
02:49:46,239 --> 02:49:52,239
of if the strain happens to be

4607
02:49:48,159 --> 02:49:54,398
specifically good for a certain ailment

4608
02:49:52,239 --> 02:49:56,959
no i think with lab testing these days

4609
02:49:54,398 --> 02:49:58,478
um i mean you it needs to be tested

4610
02:49:56,959 --> 02:50:01,358
people need to test it yeah and then

4611
02:49:58,478 --> 02:50:04,719
when they find out this works way better

4612
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:06,640
yeah and we have have that happen with a

4613
02:50:04,719 --> 02:50:08,799
couple of different strains

4614
02:50:06,639 --> 02:50:10,879
then we can compare all these lab tests

4615
02:50:08,799 --> 02:50:15,199
here and then we can see

4616
02:50:10,879 --> 02:50:17,199
which terpenes or which cannabinoids um

4617
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:19,040
are like similar in those different

4618
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:20,880
strains then we know what to breed for

4619
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:23,520
and what to select for and then we can

4620
02:50:20,879 --> 02:50:25,119
make that way stronger for that so yes

4621
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:27,760
then we can

4622
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:31,439
read strains specific for certain

4623
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:34,960
illnesses and certain things

4624
02:50:31,439 --> 02:50:37,200
and so if you had the time or the space

4625
02:50:34,959 --> 02:50:39,119
what ailments would you most want to try

4626
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:40,560
to breed some cannabis for is there

4627
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:44,560
anything that's on your list that you

4628
02:50:40,559 --> 02:50:44,559
feel is not currently being catered to

4629
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:48,240
um

4630
02:50:46,398 --> 02:50:50,478
well i think

4631
02:50:48,239 --> 02:50:52,719
like me personally i have like a

4632
02:50:50,478 --> 02:50:54,079
add which is like a raising brain

4633
02:50:52,719 --> 02:50:55,199
syndrome

4634
02:50:54,079 --> 02:50:57,120
um

4635
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:58,800
i would like to make something for that

4636
02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:01,359
but i think it's a

4637
02:50:58,799 --> 02:51:04,398
pretty difficult one it needs to be this

4638
02:51:01,359 --> 02:51:06,399
tifa type gene pool i think it's

4639
02:51:04,398 --> 02:51:07,599
probably going to be found

4640
02:51:06,398 --> 02:51:09,519
um

4641
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:11,200
so i have like a lot of thoughts that go

4642
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:14,479
really fast inside my head it's like a

4643
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:16,560
ping pong ball yeah um i'm looking for

4644
02:51:14,478 --> 02:51:19,519
something that gives me like a rest in

4645
02:51:16,559 --> 02:51:21,920
my head without losing any energy and

4646
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:24,239
all those type of things yeah which kind

4647
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:26,079
of only get with some of these aces

4648
02:51:24,239 --> 02:51:28,000
um

4649
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:29,439
i think some of these hazes are like

4650
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:33,200
very

4651
02:51:29,439 --> 02:51:35,120
not unexp unexplored on the medical

4652
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:37,760
part and i think they

4653
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:40,079
definitely keep some very

4654
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:41,920
strong medical value which has not been

4655
02:51:40,079 --> 02:51:42,719
used

4656
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:44,639
so

4657
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:47,278
a bit of an odd question but i love to

4658
02:51:44,639 --> 02:51:49,599
throw it by all i guess how important do

4659
02:51:47,279 --> 02:51:51,680
you find it is to engage with social

4660
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:54,000
media as a breeder because we see you

4661
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:56,960
know breeders on both sides of the fence

4662
02:51:54,000 --> 02:52:02,000
where do you personally sit

4663
02:51:56,959 --> 02:52:05,199
um i think social media is a very um

4664
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:05,200
very valuable tool

4665
02:52:06,398 --> 02:52:11,278
it's definitely not as pleasant as it

4666
02:52:08,639 --> 02:52:13,039
sometimes can be

4667
02:52:11,279 --> 02:52:14,560
but that happens everywhere it happens

4668
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:16,479
on the forums

4669
02:52:14,559 --> 02:52:18,719
i've been online so long on all these

4670
02:52:16,478 --> 02:52:21,438
forums and stuff that i'm pretty okay

4671
02:52:18,719 --> 02:52:25,119
and pretty good in handling like all the

4672
02:52:21,439 --> 02:52:28,318
negative type things and stuff yeah

4673
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:30,880
which if you handle it the right way it

4674
02:52:28,318 --> 02:52:31,840
doesn't become too big yeah but then

4675
02:52:30,879 --> 02:52:33,119
again

4676
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:35,520
um

4677
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:37,520
i'm not that straight or i don't always

4678
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:39,840
tell my opinion or things like that yeah

4679
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:41,359
just because you don't feel the freedom

4680
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:44,079
for it yeah

4681
02:52:41,359 --> 02:52:46,000
um and on this these days on social

4682
02:52:44,079 --> 02:52:48,478
media it's okay you constantly have to

4683
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:50,398
prove yourself or um

4684
02:52:48,478 --> 02:52:53,199
you have to be used to answering the

4685
02:52:50,398 --> 02:52:55,439
same questions like every day yeah

4686
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:56,399
like i'll get the same questions every

4687
02:52:55,439 --> 02:52:59,439
day

4688
02:52:56,398 --> 02:53:01,760
from different people um

4689
02:52:59,439 --> 02:53:03,600
where can i get this or

4690
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:05,520
what is this and it doesn't matter if

4691
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:07,520
you said it five minutes before yeah

4692
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:10,000
people don't see that well on instagram

4693
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:12,800
yeah so no matter what you put on there

4694
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:14,959
that info is gone kind of in 24 hours

4695
02:53:12,799 --> 02:53:16,719
yeah so um

4696
02:53:14,959 --> 02:53:18,879
yeah you have to repeat yourself a lot

4697
02:53:16,719 --> 02:53:21,679
on social media

4698
02:53:18,879 --> 02:53:23,438
then how do you feel things online rate

4699
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:25,359
these days compared to back in the day

4700
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:28,000
when the forums were much more active

4701
02:53:25,359 --> 02:53:28,000
and popular

4702
02:53:28,159 --> 02:53:34,559
oh the forums in the old days that was

4703
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:35,840
yeah that like overgrow when that was

4704
02:53:34,559 --> 02:53:38,559
almost the only thing and then

4705
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:41,120
definitely in the earlier years of it

4706
02:53:38,559 --> 02:53:43,119
that was like so special yeah that was

4707
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:44,240
the first time um

4708
02:53:43,120 --> 02:53:46,000
a lot of

4709
02:53:44,239 --> 02:53:48,639
underground breeders

4710
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:50,879
um connected with each other yeah

4711
02:53:48,639 --> 02:53:53,680
that normally would have never ever met

4712
02:53:50,879 --> 02:53:56,398
each other and we learned so much from

4713
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:58,000
each other then in such a short time

4714
02:53:56,398 --> 02:53:59,920
yeah

4715
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:02,000
that that gave a lot of friendship and a

4716
02:53:59,920 --> 02:54:03,840
lot of connections that are like still

4717
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:06,000
solid today yeah

4718
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:07,920
um

4719
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:09,359
and people wanted to share everything

4720
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:12,559
with each other here

4721
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:14,399
everybody send it the seeds and clones

4722
02:54:12,559 --> 02:54:16,318
and uh

4723
02:54:14,398 --> 02:54:19,039
explained exactly how their system

4724
02:54:16,318 --> 02:54:22,318
worked and stuff do that to each other

4725
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:24,160
yeah um that totally changed yeah now if

4726
02:54:22,318 --> 02:54:27,359
you want to do that you get everybody in

4727
02:54:24,159 --> 02:54:29,520
saying how you should do it

4728
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:31,840
or like complaining or saying

4729
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:33,680

4775
02:56:14,639 --> 02:56:20,719
static cleaned a5 dry screen is like

4776
02:56:18,799 --> 02:56:23,679

4777
02:56:20,719 --> 02:56:26,959

4780
02:56:28,719 --> 02:56:33,199
you a color view and stuff like a

4781

mushroom type effect and stuff yeah

4782

cannabis

4784
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:41,920
so on on the other end of the spectrum

4785
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:43,359
what's the strain where you've smoked it

4786
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:46,960
and you haven't thought it was a very

4787
02:56:43,359 --> 02:56:48,640
good kind of the least agreeing with you

4788
02:56:46,959 --> 02:56:50,398
um

4789
02:56:48,639 --> 02:56:53,278
well i once

4790
02:56:50,398 --> 02:56:55,599
grew some plants and one of them smelled

4791
02:56:53,279 --> 02:56:58,000
like human [ __ ]

4792
02:56:55,600 --> 02:57:00,720
but it also tasted like now it also

4793
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:02,559
tasted like so gross that you really

4794
02:57:00,719 --> 02:57:05,119
could not smoke it yeah and none of my

4795
02:57:02,559 --> 02:57:06,639
friends could smoke it either yeah

4796
02:57:05,120 --> 02:57:10,079
like it

4797
02:57:06,639 --> 02:57:12,799
it when you just uh lighted the joint

4798
02:57:10,079 --> 02:57:14,719
yeah and you took one pull yeah it it

4799
02:57:12,799 --> 02:57:16,799
almost like make it it makes you gark

4800
02:57:14,719 --> 02:57:20,719
and stuff like that yeah it was just not

4801
02:57:16,799 --> 02:57:20,719
not smokeable you just can't smoke it

4802
02:57:20,879 --> 02:57:26,000
that is truly an interesting one

4803
02:57:23,680 --> 02:57:26,880
it was it was oh yeah

4804
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:29,120
yeah

4805
02:57:26,879 --> 02:57:31,199
so out of all of your strains that

4806
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:33,600
you've got coming out in the near future

4807
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:34,880
we're going to exclude the sour bx from

4808
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:37,120
this one because we've already spoken

4809
02:57:34,879 --> 02:57:39,358
about it so outside of that what are you

4810
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:40,960
most excited for to release in the

4811
02:57:39,359 --> 02:57:43,200
future

4812
02:57:40,959 --> 02:57:43,199
um

4813
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:50,079
i think people are very waiting for it

4814
02:57:46,318 --> 02:57:51,519
i'm making a5s ones and i think people

4815
02:57:50,079 --> 02:57:54,000
are very

4816
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:56,720
waiting for that one

4817
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,719
myself

4818
02:57:57,120 --> 02:58:02,640
i like think i'm doing some skittles

4819
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:05,520
things which i think are going to be

4820
02:58:02,639 --> 02:58:08,559
nice um

4821
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:09,840
and then some of the brazilian stuff

4822
02:58:08,559 --> 02:58:11,439
um

4823
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:14,000
but that will be a little while before

4824
02:58:11,439 --> 02:58:17,200
that comes as probably next year

4825
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:19,279
but then a5 will come this year

4826
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:22,159
put me down on the list i'm already

4827
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:24,399
sweating thinking about it

4828
02:58:22,159 --> 02:58:27,039
yeah i'm crossing the reverse pollen

4829
02:58:24,398 --> 02:58:30,879
with the other cuts as well so i'm doing

4830
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:32,399
a c5 times a5 um

4831
02:58:30,879 --> 02:58:35,199
i'm doing the

4832
02:58:32,398 --> 02:58:36,478
old-school haze which is from the sativa

4833
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:39,680
seed club

4834
02:58:36,478 --> 02:58:42,239
that old cut from them um that one times

4835
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:46,800
the a5

4836
02:58:42,239 --> 02:58:48,879
i got an hpa skunk in there as well

4837
02:58:46,799 --> 02:58:49,920
i might throw in the amnesia yeah

4838
02:58:48,879 --> 02:58:51,920
because

4839
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:55,359
everybody wants me to do that so i'll

4840
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:57,359
probably do pollinate that as well

4841
02:58:55,359 --> 02:58:58,880
yeah definitely

4842
02:58:57,359 --> 02:59:01,439
so

4843
02:58:58,879 --> 02:59:03,920
on the breeder end of the spectrum who's

4844
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:05,600
an up-and-coming breeder who you think

4845
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:08,639
might be kind of you know one of the

4846
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:08,640
