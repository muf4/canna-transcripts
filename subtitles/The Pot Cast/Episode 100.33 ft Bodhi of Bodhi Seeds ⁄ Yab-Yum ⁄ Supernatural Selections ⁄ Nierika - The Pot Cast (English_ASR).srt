like the effect like it was really nice

146
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,919

know you know i'

149
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:11,560
there's there's some strange you smoke

150
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,478
and they're either too strong or

151
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,639
they're um they just tend to or they're

152
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,399
kind of like SK not scary I would say

153
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,319
like have you ever had a strain that's

154
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,839
kind of like

155
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,840
clinical like it's very like rough

156
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,159
around the edges and just kind of

157
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,679
like like kind of like more if it had a

158
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,919
element it would like be the metal

159
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,918
element like if you could rate

160
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,439
can and like uh motive and then a wood

161
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,359
would be like I don't know wood would be

162
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,360
like I guess grounded and rooted and

163
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
then air would be

164
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,560
like like Airy kind of sativas and ether

165
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,038
would be like the electric sativas and

166
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,478
then metal would be kind of like this

167
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,000
these very clinical like in the mind

168
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:56,878
like make you kind of think but they

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
don't have a lot necessarily so much joy

170
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,840
like the Mexican Desa like I that a cool

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,478
one but it was very clinical it made you

172
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,918
kind of think about things but it it

173
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,478
wasn't super joyful it was like okay

174
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,639
let's just it was like a therapist like

175

184
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,799
created really cool cool plants with

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,959
cool highs like they that male was

186
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,879
really amazing that it could it just

187
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,439
harmonized with certain varieties you

188
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,599
know and some of the ones like uplift is

189
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,360
a really cool version of it

190
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:55,038
um some of them were a little bit heavy

191
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,680
but some of them got got kind of I just

192
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,959
love those like joyful heady highs um

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,240
let think else um I like some Wookie

194
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,878
stuff the Congo cashmir I really love

195
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,478
that's a good one that's like a

196
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
supernatural selections um and I like

197
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,199
some of the Congo cashmir

198
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,000
hybrids and

199
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,800
um yeah The Wookie stuff is cool it

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,560
always had unique things I really like

201
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,000
um killer orgasm is a good one it makes

202
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,598
you kind of feel like a kid but I think

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,038
that's more that's an unreleased one

204
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,439
um God there's so many cool I'm trying

205
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,959
to think of all the

206
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,479
different it's just been so it's been a

207
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,120
you know it's been I think I've released

208
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,759
like hundreds of strains and it's been

209
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,519
like a 20

210
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:42,319
year um catalog so it's like but the

211
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,799
ones that have kind of lasted even ones

212
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,040
that don't haven't existed for 10 years

213
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,439
and last the kind of test of time like

214
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,599
Goji Sunshine Daydream and then there

215
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,240
ones

216
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:58,440
like um black triangle

217
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,959
and um Congo cashmere dread

218
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,600
bread I like T like some the new

219
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:07,639
medicine Mountain I like I like

220
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,200
TV um what else cool on I made one

221
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:13,679
called Dharma bom that's really cool

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,160
it's the TV cross to the Big Sir

223
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,159
Nigerian but you know

224
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,959
those to kids off in is a p because I

225
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,200
out and I'll stay up all night if I

226
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,159
smoke anything it seems unless it's a

227
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,720
super Downer like

228
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,480
narud wow that's that's so interesting I

229
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,480
that's I mean yeah it sounds like a

230
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,800
double-edged blade in a sense um well

231
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,278
you just mentioned TV a good buddy of

232
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,359
mine Eli cash he's a a breeder in

233
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:45,958
Australia here he's got a seed company

234
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,959
called local bird seed definitely

235
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,879
recommend people check it out he's done

236
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:54,799
some breeding work utilizing a male he

237
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,439
found out of the TV seeds and I'm I'm

238
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,838
yeah I'm I'm really Keen to crack into

239
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,920
some of those myself uh but I'd love to

240
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,120
ask you

241
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,919
what sort of some stuff you feel that

242
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,240
strain brings to the table and um you

243
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,159
know it's got some heavy heavy weights

244
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,839
in the lineage tell me a bit about it

245
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,360
well you know for the first kind of

246
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,440
medicine Mountain was all about kind of

247
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,320
making uh approachable like narrow

248
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,360
leafes or sativas or like or like more

249
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
he super energetic heady highs like

250
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,959
making it so people could

251
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,440
actually grow them so TV was like kind

252
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,278
of like the flagship that I was going to

253
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,480
make hybrids with a lot of things and

254
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,078
also kind of as an Ode to it release it

255
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,879
too so that everybody could have the

256
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,958
parents for the for TV like I mean for

257
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,838
the first release and kind of like you

258
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,719
can make your own stuff and basically TV

259
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,959
like the vietnames 7 I want to make it a

260
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:51,120
little bit easier to grow you know and

261
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:53,159
then so I took um an F I worked the

262
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,799
Charlie's Destroyer for a couple

263
00:10:53,159 --> 00:11:00,159
generations and I used an A A really

264
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,599
quicker kind of like Stout um resilient

265
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,879
like he was really good at creating

266
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,879
stuff that uh that was workable like

267
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:10,439
that it would do what it says like if

268
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:15,039
you know he could his magic was kind of

269
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,120
making things that were grower friendly

270
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,480
and so I found a really nice kind of

271
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,278
faster

272
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,680
finishing uh it was a pearl tie dominant

273
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:27,360
uh Destroyer and destroyers like I think

274
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,120
what is it Northern Lights it's mostly

275
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,360
tie tie with some what did he BR that

276
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,759
nor light napali or nor light something

277
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,839
but it's a very manageable kind of tie

278
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,480
very strong tie dominant tie line so the

279
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,040
TV is like I always call it like totally

280
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,800
Visionary or um Thai Vietnamese and it

281
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,240
it's just like if someone's always

282
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,278
wanted to grow a tie but can't really

283
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,278
grow it in their tent or grow it outside

284
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:52,759
it it's it's you can finish it and you

285
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:56,559
can grow it and it makes good hybrids so

286
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:58,439
that was kind of the the the reason why

287
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,119
I created that as the first one and then

288
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,959
you know there was a

289
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,320
special one like a gift one that went

290
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:07,000
out just to friends it was called Dharma

291
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,560
bom and that was the

292
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,120
TV um biger Nigerian I think there was

293
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,039
zap and a few others but there's going

294
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,198
to be more to come as I find you know

295
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,599
it's when you're looking for like n leaf

296
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:22,278
and Loom sativas and stuff like that it

297
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,839
you gota go through a lot to kind of

298
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:27,519
find truly exceptional ones and then you

299
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,160
have to make sure they outcross well but

300
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,320
usually you know if they're usually just

301
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,639
distinct enough you get that hybrid

302
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,600
Vigor and you get you know nature loves

303
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,120
new things coming together it applauds

304
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,278
that and I think that's the magic on of

305
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,560
life on Earth is is bringing diverse

306
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,159
elements together to create new things

307
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,439
and so I think anytime that you take

308
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,719
like soall land Ras plants in1 you're

309
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
bound to find something that's most

310
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,199
likely better than the

311
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,120
parents and I think that's kind of what

312
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,240
medic Mountain's about yeah that's

313
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,320
incredible to hear you know a lot of

314
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,639
people wanted to know are there any

315
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,839
plans for future releases from Medicine

316
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,879
Mountain uh definitely yeah it's just uh

317
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,240
they probably we won't won't be ready

318
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,679
until next the end of next season

319
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,159
because it is it's like you know you

320
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:20,359
flowering males out for nine weeks just

321
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,958
to get pollen is not the most exciting

322
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,199
thing to do you know that's why I love

323
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,559
uh uh Supernatural selections is so cool

324
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:30,078
is because uh you know they're usually

325
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,638
F1 hybrids between narrow and broadleaf

326
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,559
and so collect the pollen from the

327
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,000
broadleaf earlier and just flower out

328
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,838
your your sativas and it's easier to

329
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,399
make hybrids that way but the medicine

330
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,120
Mountain it's your labor of love when

331
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,159
you have to grow things out you know to

332
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,320
breeding is

333
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,240
not necessarily the easiest and it does

334
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
take quite a lot of time but it's worth

335
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,879
it in the end for that what you can

336
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,519
achieve and what you can

337
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,799
make yeah totally totally and that's a

338
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,360
cool little point you raised about you

339
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:01,719
know getting the pollen from the broad

340
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,120
leaves earlier in the season out of

341
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,360
curiosity you know I mean based on what

342
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,159
you've already told us the answer is

343
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,399
probably no but I guess have you had a

344
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:13,519
chance or are you maybe more thinking

345
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:16,198
about exploring any of the popular stuff

346
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,120
we've seen Via de par and the other uh

347
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,879
land race crew you know they've

348
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,198
certainly been posting some pretty

349
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:25,320
tantalizing purple buds recently yeah

350
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,919
they have incredible stuff like yeah he

351
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,720
he we usually trade a lot and you know

352
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,799
he sent me some like

353
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,519
pretty much everything that they release

354
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,198
so there's so much to go through and I'm

355
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,560
loving a lot of these Afghan um

356
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:40,599
collections like the Maru and there's so

357
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,039
many different cool and I I just haven't

358
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,480
had a space like I would go berserk if I

359
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,759
was still at the Old Farm like I would

360
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,639
have been I would have blown through

361
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:53,680
those already like I love growing broad

362
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:56,519
leaves because they're just so they're

363
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,758
you unless you live in a a high uh mold

364
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,560
pressure environment they're just so

365
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,639
cool they're like little cousin NS like

366
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,399
they they're so easy to grow they just

367
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,000
they're so smelly and they're

368
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:11,278
so I don't know they're like gnomes or

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,799
like got garden gnomes you know and and

370
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,439
they're just so fun and they usually

371
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,120
they are they you can trace them back

372
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,480
pretty close to the

373
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,399
source I don't know I I think and they

374
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,879
have such unique and special highs it's

375
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,078
just uh having a breeding program or

376
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,318
having a

377
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,799
long-term uh line breeding program where

378
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:33,759
you can kind of bring them out of their

379
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,679
you know they have horrible uh

380
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,919
morphology for trimming because in

381
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:41,359
basically they're hash plants people

382
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,759
don't always like kind of register that

383
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,759
but most of these broad leaves they're

384
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,480
not designed to make beautiful buds in

385
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,879
the bag they're made for their resin

386
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,639
heads um so but I would love you know

387
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:58,318
what would be really cool is if someone

388
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:01,399
in the states came up with a uh like a

389
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:03,599
heirloom broadleaf uh hash repository

390
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,919
like where they just grew broadleafs

391
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,399
point of origin broadleafs and then

392
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,919
hashed them and then could offer uh

393
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,159
traditionally processed uh you know

394
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,838
you're not going to see too much Afric

395
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,318
Afghan stamp bricks here in the United

396
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,680
States for a while until we go uh

397
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,559
globally legal but until then imagine

398
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:22,958
taking those things and finding maybe

399
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,278
like a high Des environment just growing

400
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,039
like a thousand uh heirloom broad leaves

401
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,639
and then just hashing them out like how

402
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,039
cool I would love to go pick some of

403
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,079
that up sign me up like I'm sure there's

404
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,879
got to be a market people would love

405
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:39,359
that all even old- I used to get the the

406
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:41,679
red stamped you know what Afghan King of

407
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,879
Afghanistan ones or the I got red

408
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,039
Lebanese from an old lady that lived

409
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:49,278
down the block who got it from a boat

410
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:52,879
captain hairdresser that picked it up in

411
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:55,958
the kyber pass when she was hunting for

412
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,958
you know

413
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,800
Sasquatch so I wish there was a for I

414
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,319
wish there was a way that people could

415
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,678
follow their Bliss and follow their

416
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,159
their Niche and

417
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,720
really enjoy what they're doing G so

418
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,439
many people in cannabis these days are

419
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,558
just worn out and sad and disenchanted

420
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,279
and you know it's hard to keep a when

421
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:19,000
you can't feed your family it's hard to

422
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:20,599
to to have that Joy you know it's hard

423
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,599
to go that and it's so sad that that's

424
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,438
been sucked out of it because that's

425
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,759
what it's all about you know you can see

426
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,840
it even in the seed Community I mean I

427
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,519
mean there's a a immense amount of new

428
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,759
seed companies and so many people doing

429
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,639
fantastic things and boring things and

430
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,440
great things and special things and and

431
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,759
it but there's also a lot of the

432
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,798
old-timers that are having to kind of

433
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:48,879
find new go back to their old jobs or

434
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:50,519
find or just you know it's not a

435
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,440
full-time job anymore it's just their

436
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,480
kind of passion side project you know

437
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,159
because things are hard I mean that' be

438
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,759
the beautiful thing about descheduling

439
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,000
imagine if you can make seeds and sell

440
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,679
to the entire country of the whole world

441
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,038
you open it up so much more that you

442
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,080
could actually kind of cover your bills

443
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,158
because you have a lot more people that

444
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,399
can grow your seeds and that demographic

445
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,240
would be there like imag you know I'm

446
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,159
I'm hoping that someday we go federally

447
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,200
legal and I think that would really open

448
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,960
it up so many people that are

449
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,120
stigmatized because they feel it's a

450
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,798
illegal plant they don't grow it but if

451
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,359
it if that was released imagine all

452
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,079
those people that just love to grow

453
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:32,199
flowers or anything you know I yeah

454
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,000
that's that's how I stay positive is

455
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,480
just hoping that one

456
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,159
day when things do go federally illegal

457
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,240
there won't be a way to stop it and

458
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,120
people's

459
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,798
curiosity uh and the stories they tell

460
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,879
and you know kind of like how

461
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,519
legalization was brought in kind of like

462
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,520
through the charlott's web like kids

463
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,599
needing epilepsy care like that was kind

464
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,279
of the way in it's like once it's opened

465
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,480
it can't be put back

466
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,119
in and I think that's going to be the

467
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,679
thing and it's like once people realize

468
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,399
the person that's not a drug it's

469
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,919
basically the one it's a wonder cannabis

470
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,120
is a Wonder generator for life on Earth

471
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,320
like if anybody that's having that's

472
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,879
never smoked it you know you see those

473
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,960
YouTube videos sometimes of like first

474
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,960
time Grandpa smokes pot and like their

475
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,200
world just opens up like where was the

476
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,880
stuff my whole life like you know it's

477
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,880
such a it's been with us forever you

478
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,400
know the dogon feel that you know you

479
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,280
they come from the Sirus a be the star

480
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,960
system and that the the beings that came

481
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,960
from that place and came and visit him

482
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,759
they brought cannabis as a gift to have

483
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,480
better lives and to have happy times

484
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,798
here on Earth like it's a gift it's a

485
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,798
gift from Source it's a gift from the

486
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:50,279
heart of the world it's it's our most

487
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,079
it's basically our our Prime Botanical

488
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,678
Ally on this Earth it provides

489
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,240
everything we could possibly need and

490
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,919
it's an absolute crime and shame that

491
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,480
we're in this place and now we're in

492
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,720
this place of Pudo leg legalization it's

493
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,599
not legalized it's just regulated so

494
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,440
people can make money off of it it's

495
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:11,719
totally not legalized it's even worse I

496
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,400
think I think things were much better in

497
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,679
when it was illegal you know or even or

498
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,679
the best times we ever had was 215 where

499
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,000
it was like this pseudo pseudo legality

500
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,720
where people could still follow their

501
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,279
heart and so what they made and like it

502
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,759
it that was time of great I don't think

503
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,759
if we would have had 215 we would have

504
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,798
ushered right into the time we have now

505
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:35,519
we'd be even more up the creek because

506
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:38,038
there would be such it would be such oh

507
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:41,400
No Just Be A Wasteland

508
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,558
so no I I agree I think that'd probably

509
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,440
be almost a unanimous thing in our

510
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:51,119
entire community that you know 215 was

511
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,440
clearly Superior to uh to what we have

512
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,199
now and the prospect of what we have

513
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,240
going forward which is really sort of a

514
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,038
bummer but look I've thought about this

515
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,000
a lot and there's a lot of things that

516
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:03,798
are happening and and as an individual

517
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,319
it's hard to give advice and I've

518
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:06,918
thought long about like you know what

519
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,519
can you tell someone who's struggling to

520
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,320
pay their bills and stuff and the one

521
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,798
thing I've always thought is kind of

522
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:16,158
like taking Tibbits of what we've spoken

523
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,359
about already is that most of the new

524
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,320
stuff comes from passionate Hobby People

525
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,278
not big

526
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:25,079
facilities and maybe one silver lining

527
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,679
of this you know and I don't want to

528
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:28,759
call it a silver lining because anyone

529
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,960
who's forced out of say being a fulltime

530
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:33,640
grower and having to pick up some other

531
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,519
work you know I don't want to try to you

532
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,720
know minimize that or say oh a silver

533
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:42,558
lining you know but one thing that might

534
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,720
be a result of that is that you now have

535
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,639
more freedom over what you grow you know

536
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,839
because your income isn't solely maybe

537
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,320
coming from this one thing and with that

538
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:53,599
freedom you could maybe use that to

539
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:55,278
explore some stuff and who knows you

540
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,719
know you might end up finding the new

541
00:21:55,278 --> 00:22:01,200
big thing and certainly that's got more

542
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,159
of a chance of success than you know

543
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,640
just growing the same OG clone like you

544
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,039
know not the only thing you're going to

545
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,960
be able to do at the end of that is sell

546
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:10,599
the crop you know there's no Prospect of

547
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,840
making something new out of that but I

548
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:14,879
don't know what's your thoughts what's

549
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,599
your advice for the small time grower or

550
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,880
how can people try to positively

551
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,599
contribute to push the scene in the

552
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,278
right direction is it is it just grow

553
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,439
interesting unique

554
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:27,200
stuff yeah I think it's follow your

555
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,840
bliss and find your Niche and like and

556
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,640
also find your community find find

557
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,918
people around you so like you you know

558
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,038
you may not be able to grow a lot of

559
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,600
plants but if you have five people that

560
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,798
are passionate about it that you've met

561
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,079
online or at local meetups or whatever

562
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,079
you have five times the amount to try

563
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,240
you have five new uh buddies to to be

564
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,678
creative with it's like I I think it's

565
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,919
all

566
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,600
about grow growing I mean I I like seeds

567
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,320
I like finding new things but clowns are

568
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:56,199
awesome too I love growing to see what

569
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,599
like it like that's really fun to see

570
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,278
what like the new thing that everybody's

571
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,759
into because it really allows gives you

572
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,558
a benchmark on where not only where

573
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,798
we're at but where we want to be like if

574
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:08,440
this is the most ultimate thing right

575
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:11,278
now and you're like oh wow this is

576
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,759
incredible I I agree this is pretty cool

577
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:14,480
like how was this made like what is it

578
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,798
made from or you could be like H that's

579
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,919
not that great like this is actually way

580
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:23,158
cooler than you know check this out I

581
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,080
think it's all about growing as as

582
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,159
much unique things as you can but also

583
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,480
finding those if something really speaks

584
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,600
to you and speaks to your heart and to

585
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,159
your your physiology and your biology

586
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,839
endocab system there's someone out there

587
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,200
there's actually probably quite a few

588
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,558
people out there that are going to have

589
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,319
that same Vibe with it so take it a few

590
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,278
Generations really mold it like a piece

591
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:50,839
of art like a sculpture into what you

592
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:52,278
want it to say I mean it it's that's the

593
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:54,879
amazing thing about it it's just

594
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:56,519
unending Journey we can all work on it

595
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,360
together and it has so many ways to

596
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:02,558
express itself on every level

597
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,879
from from you know even people like that

598
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,200
are depressed it's like I mean sometimes

599
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,799
people will mask depression with

600
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,798
cannabis but it's like like I said

601
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,720
before cannabis is a Wonder generator

602
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,000
like it really allows you to tune into

603
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,600
the wonder of the world like no wonder

604
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,720
people love to watch movies or play

605
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,158
video games because it enhances all of

606
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,319
our senses and our senses are what allow

607
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,240
us to experience the world you know and

608
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,038
people with all this everybody getting

609
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,960
locked to their phones and all the new

610
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:34,519
talk AI like go to the original AI the

611
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,240
ancient intelligence you know go back to

612
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:39,000
the world this this incredible thing

613
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,200
it's like cannabis is Nature's Wi-Fi

614
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,759
like you know you this the signal might

615
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,360
not be there but the reception is way

616
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,679
better it's like you need to go it's

617
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,798
like it allows you to embody yourself on

618
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,440
Earth and to really see what's real as

619
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,759
we get swept away into this artificial

620
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,798
world it's one of the only things that's

621
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,919
backing us back backing us back to like

622
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,918
this Garden reality of like you know I

623
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,159
always laugh when they always say

624
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,480
oh cannabis it's a gateway drug to

625
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,278
gardening you I always think of all

626
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,599
these homeboys like during the OG craze

627
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,599
I'm like okay so now they're just

628
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,359
playing video games and smoking OG and

629
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:12,240
they're all growing G like how amazing

630
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,839
that it's like a feminite they get to

631
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,480
like experience the feminine you know

632
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:19,240
growing female plants like it it it does

633
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,679
such amazing things and it's created so

634
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,440
many unique opportunities and I feel sad

635
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,840
when people can't experience that it

636
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,919
would be like going through life not

637
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,319
making love or something you know like

638
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,080
being a virgin all your life well being

639
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:35,639
a virgin to plant medicine is just as

640
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:38,918
sad you know if you never that I

641
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,278
encourage everyone you know it to do all

642
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,278
the plant medicines that you can

643
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,038
experience ethically uh especially

644
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,679
hoping that you created them yourself is

645
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:50,000
the even thing if you can grow mushrooms

646
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,080
it's so easy like and grow them yourself

647
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,798
and put in your love and your like you

648
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,918
know play music do whatever you want put

649
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:56,440
your Vibe into them they're going to

650
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,360
give you back what you put back into

651
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,120
them it's the same with an and I feel

652
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,240
I just you know it's just a shame that

653
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,639
we people don't have the opportunity to

654
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,359
do this or if they do have the

655
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,278
opportunity they get swacked you know

656
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:11,278
they get boofed they get they just get

657
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:14,398
junk I just wish there was a way that

658
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,159
people that have love for it and are

659
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:17,959
have been doing it and really know how

660
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,840
to do it and create something have the

661
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,840
ability to offer that and be compensated

662
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,199
for that so that they can move forward

663
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,240
you know and also make it a family

664
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,880
business like it should be it should be

665
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,480
multigenerational we can't just Le you

666
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,360
know lose all of these lineages of of

667
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,960
ganja people that go back through time

668
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,278
you know it's not fair to the world or

669
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,278
to

670
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:44,918
society yeah look it's it is terrible to

671
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,678
think about how much potential knowledge

672
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,200
could be lost so you know hopeful that

673
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,759
there's a a break soon and and some sort

674
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,038
of Reform that allows these people to

675
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:58,319
continue on and you know when you were

676
00:26:55,038 --> 00:27:00,480
just talking then about encouraging just

677
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,960
plant medicine consumption of of all

678
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,519
kinds I I couldn't help but think back

679
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,399
to in the original episode when you were

680
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,480
talking about we were talking about

681
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:12,239
blending tobacco with cannabis and you

682
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,919
were describing tobacco as a bit like a

683
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,720
saddle when you're riding a horse and it

684
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:17,960
allows you to go different places you

685
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,120
might not have otherwise been able to

686
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,720
have gone I've definitely actually been

687
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,519
indulging that a little bit over the

688
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,200
years you know despite the fact I I

689
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,278
don't really consume

690
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,080
cannabis sorry I don't consume tobacco

691
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:33,519
go uh I I do once in a blue moon maybe

692
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,199
probably not even once every 6 months

693
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,079
but definitely more than once a year I

694
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,720
will consume some tobacco with it and

695
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,839
it's so profoundly different to what I

696
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,120
remember when I used to just

697
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,199
consistently consume tobacco with it and

698
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,678
it really resonated with what you said

699
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,399
you know it was a very different

700
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:55,278
experience and to me it actually made

701
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,558
anything I was smoking like a sativa and

702
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,359
I appreciated that you know obviously

703
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:03,599
people get stimulated off tobacco but I

704
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:05,199
very much was and uh it got me thinking

705
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,038
about you know like the ways in which

706
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,399
you consume it and the ways it changes

707
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:14,480
your appreciation and as 's gone by I've

708
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:16,518
sort of been consuming less and less and

709
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,278
we we had one of the um the listeners

710
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:21,839
ask and it sort of ties in with what I'm

711
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:24,119
getting at here which is has your way

712
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,678
you consume cannabis changed your

713
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:29,398
relationship with it because I think for

714
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:32,080
me at least it's been almost quite

715
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:33,839
paradoxical in that the less I consume

716
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:36,158
to a certain extent I still consume a

717
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,558
decent amount it's almost more

718
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,278
meaningful in a way I don't know maybe I

719
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,079
haven't articulated it that well but I'd

720
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:43,398
love to hear your thoughts you know how

721
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,639
how is your view on and your

722
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:48,239
relationship with it

723
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,759
changed yeah I definitely slow down but

724
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,919
it's more because I have to be more

725
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:57,038
responsible and it's not that I can't be

726
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:01,200
responsible on campus cannabis it's that

727
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:05,798
cannabis turns me into like a kid like

728
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,720
it I'm so hyp sensitive to plant plant

729
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:09,679
Spirit medicines or whatever you want to

730
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,319
call it and I'm

731
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,320
extraordinary um sensitive to cannabis

732
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,599
and I love that I cultivate that because

733
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,599
then I can really feel the nuances and I

734
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:21,759
can really kind of I can connect with it

735
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,558
in a deeper way I kind of try and bring

736
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:27,919
it in on a daily just as a something

737
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:30,038
that walks with me but it's true it's

738
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,440
like I don't know the older you get

739
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:36,839
either you do it a lot more or you start

740
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,360
to find a balance and I I I respect all

741
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,240
the people that can uh turn it on and

742
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,639
leave it on that can smoke all day and I

743
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,558
I and it and it it's like coffee or it's

744
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,799
like anything that kind of allows them

745
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,798
to move through their

746
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:53,558
experience but I think there's something

747
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:56,000
special and also uh reaching kind of a

748
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:59,759
sensitive place with it where it's

749
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,599
you're using it more as a

750
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,640
therapeutic uh experience or you know

751
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,158
you're creating an enjoyable experience

752
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,240
and starting to instead of masking

753
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,360
things you don't like about the world

754
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,720
using it or in your own body or your own

755
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:18,319
mind you're using it to experience

756
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,679
greater levels of complexity and joy in

757
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,359
everyday

758
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,278
experiences so I've definitely I would

759
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,398
love I used to you know smoke every day

760
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:28,319
and I would smoke usually at night after

761
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,199
things calm down and I would take my

762
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,798
notes cuz I had just you know 100

763
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,480
different plants hanging in the garage

764
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:37,639
and and really kind of get into it but

765
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,120
yeah it's when I do do it now it's so

766
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,679
special and so and it's like an old

767
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,558
friend you know you're like oh wow why

768
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,480
am I not doing this like every moment

769
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:50,519
but yeah I I it's hard like we were

770
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,519
talking before it's like for me when my

771
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:56,759
M mind opens my mouth closes like I'm

772
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,319
not a I I find I'm in such a Wonder

773
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,359
place that it's hard for me to interact

774
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:03,359
with people that aren't in that same

775
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,000
space you know do you ever get like have

776
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,558
you gone out to like like the Super

777
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Market stoned and it's just like going

778
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,879
to another planet and you just realized

779
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,638
I am I'm I'm like way too high to be in

780
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,320
this and it's like you're at a Crux

781
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:18,158
there either you freak out and get

782
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,918
paranoid or you just have the kind of

783
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,679
the time of your life but you kind of

784
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,880
need a sitter like I remember I used to

785
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,200
love to get blazed and go to the movies

786
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,679
but I always need someone to like like I

787
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,679
was a kid like someone to hold my hand

788
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,200
so I didn't do anything too weird um but

789
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,080
yeah I think it's just finding your own

790
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,960
balance with it everybody's different

791
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,960
you know people smoke incredible amounts

792
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,558
and do incredible things and some people

793
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,798
just smoke it once in a while so it's

794
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:46,119
like I think it's it's we're going back

795
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:48,200
to that same thing of just finding

796
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:49,839
finding your how you walk with it

797
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,798
finding your balance finding the the

798
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,959
just the right uh interaction that it it

799
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,679
enriches your life and doesn't take away

800
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,278
from it you

801
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:03,559
know yeah yeah of course and the thing I

802
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:06,278
often reflect on is that at every stage

803
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:08,200
of my life I have reflected on my

804
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:10,839
consumption and always felt like it was

805
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,080
sort of optimal and so you know it's

806
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,480
interesting to acknowledge that that

807
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,000
when I was younger and smoking more like

808
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,599
that probably was better you know it

809
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,119
probably was better I wasn't smoking as

810
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:20,079
little as I am now because maybe I was a

811
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,038
bit more anxious back then and as you

812
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,839
said it just ties back into finding

813
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:28,038
where your own sort of sweet spot is and

814
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:30,879
I'm definitely a big fan of that I

815
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:33,398
wanted to jump to uh an interesting

816
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,200
little side point which was that over

817
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:38,278
the years I've certainly got many many

818
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,200
messages from people who point out that

819
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,880
you were the first guest to essentially

820
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,360
talk about hopl and virus on the show

821
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,639
you know in the first episode you were

822
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:51,439
talking about dutting and that was

823
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:54,398
episode 10 very fitting episode 100

824
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,880
you're here uh but you you were actually

825
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,719
the first person to mention I think we

826
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,278
were talking about CIO at the time

827
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,600
um yeah and obviously hplv has just

828
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:08,679
evolved into its own huge issue since

829
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,240
the S years ago I feel like we've almost

830
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,840
gotten to a point now where it's very

831
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,798
much out of sight out of mind it's still

832
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:17,240
there but I think people are just sort

833
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,879
of letting their guard down a bit what's

834
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,480
your thoughts on it and how has it

835
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,240
affected

836
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,519
you um well the beautiful thing about

837
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,638
being involved

838
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,839
with um Hayes Valley is they you know

839
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:32,278
they do all the testing and it's really

840
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,199
interesting like and they're really

841
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,240
allowing me to see like oh this is these

842
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,480
are signs this is this this you see this

843
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,200
that and you know I've learned so much

844
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,880
about it like you know sometimes you

845
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,759
can't you don't even notice it there's

846
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,399
some strains that just grow they'll grow

847
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,440
past it it's still in it's still in the

848
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:51,000
system it's still endemic it's really

849
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:54,000
seems to kind of arise when the the

850
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,200
plant get stressed or it's in conditions

851
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,480
that it doesn't really do well and so

852
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,759
you get these big facilities that are

853
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,639
really good at pumping out flour they

854
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,359
have just the right light just the right

855
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:07,519
you know nutrient systems just like that

856
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:10,519
and it's not showing up but it's still

857
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,000
in there or you know I've even heard

858
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,559
recently that you know they're saying

859
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,639
now that it can be it could go into

860
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:19,519
seeds and I'm like yeah I get that I may

861
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,480
be the mom because the seeds are coming

862
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:25,599
if you're coming out of infected mom but

863
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,519
if the dad how is the pollen carrying

864
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,039
hpl and pollinating a new mother and

865
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,639
that's getting seeds it just baffles me

866
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:34,320
but you know science is I'm not a

867
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,960
scientist I'm an artist I you know I

868
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,039
think that you could go either way in

869
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,159
cannabis and some people can do both at

870
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:44,878
the same time which it's not I mean

871
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,280
that's not the easiest but yeah it's

872
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,118
that's a rough one it's like I've seen

873
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,159
it just Destro destroy people's Gardens

874
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,480
and Destroy just take out clones and and

875
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,280
take out clones that you know disappear

876
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,199
like we used to trade a lot back in the

877
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,960
day you know it be like sometimes you

878
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,319
get a call like six months later hey do

879
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,480
you still have the puck or do you have

880
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,920
this or that and I'm like oh no I don't

881
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,719
know what happened that thing just kind

882
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,320
of like it just croaked or it got you

883
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,919
know got something you know something

884
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,960
The Roots like no one really knew back

885
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,680
then it was that you know what duding

886
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,320
was and it was usually oh the plant's

887
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,838
dis old or it's been cloned too many

888
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,800
times and you got to wonder

889
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:24,358
where where it came from but yeah now

890
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,960
it's in everybody's Gardens you have

891
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:29,199
everybody trading and you have these

892
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,960
clone Depots that sure not

893
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,480
everybody's testing and I don't know I

894
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,599
mean this is this one where Plant

895
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,199
Pathology is just not my strong suit but

896
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,240
it's fascinating to me I mean there's

897
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,838
got it's a vroid there's got to be it's

898
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:46,519
got to happened in other species they

899
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:49,358
have antivirals that they give plants I

900
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,039
me like how how do we how do we get out

901
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,480
of this I know you can breed out of it

902
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,838
there are plants that are immune to it

903
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,719
it's very

904
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,679
rare it's just a it's just plant AIDS

905
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:02,879
reached I think we reached that as a as

906
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:08,118
a cultural phenomenon now as we've been

907
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,800
so promiscuous in our um in our ways

908
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,640
that we propagate and share that now

909
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,359
we're experiencing the ramifications of

910
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:21,199
like a free love kind of situation

911
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:23,719
or our P integrated Pest Management uh

912
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,879
is not up to par or you know are we just

913
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:27,318
in a place where we're not educated

914
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,720
enough and we have too many people doing

915
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:32,679
it just is this just what happens in in

916
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:36,799
any species any culture when we get too

917
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:38,078
freeing and to something arises I I

918
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,880
don't know I mean what are your thoughts

919
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,240
on it it's such a weird and strange

920
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,440
thing and I just saw something today on

921
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:46,318
the internet was like 99% of hom grows

922
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,318
are infected you know it's like this and

923
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:50,679
I'm like really is this is it that is it

924
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:52,719
that prevalent is it that in everybody's

925
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,318
situation is it coming through seeds

926
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,759
like what are we doing you know that's

927
00:36:54,318 --> 00:37:00,400
why I let go a lot when I moved it was

928
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,000
like I didn't feel bad about letting go

929
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,119
a lot of my stuff because you know I've

930
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,358
had it I've been able to keep it alive

931
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,559
for so long I thought you know it's time

932
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:11,000
to start new and it's time to allow

933
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,559
those plants to just move on I have

934
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,960
seeds for like a lot of the different

935
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,239
ones that I was using with Mals I can

936
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,119
always research it but you know there's

937
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,719
you never know and I don't have the

938
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,318
finances to test all my plants and I

939
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,439
don't think anyone does so it's like

940
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:27,318
where do we draw how do we fix this

941
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,519
situation it seems like it's the like

942
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:30,599
the elephant in the room that no one

943
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:34,719
wants to talk

944
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,519
about yeah yeah totally totally and uh I

945
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,279
think that that's definitely the Perfect

946
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,599
Analogy it's the elephant in the room

947
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,319
and and people are not talking about it

948
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,640
I've I've often wondered because

949
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:49,719
essentially like I don't see a way to

950
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:52,358
get rid of it per se I think the best

951
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:55,279
you could do is sort of quarantine it to

952
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:58,719
like some area that's non-compliant but

953
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,560
essentially like the idea is that

954
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,318
if if we accept there's still some

955
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,920
conjecture around whether it goes into

956
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:05,719
the seeds I I haven't done that much

957
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,559
reading but I I kind of am of the belief

958
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:09,318
that it probably does and the figures

959
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,000
that I've heard reliably quoted from

960
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:15,679
people I trust is like somewhere from 5

961
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,119
to 30% transmission rate into seeds and

962
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:20,879
so I guess if you believe that then

963
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,400
theoretically if you get a pack of seeds

964
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,400
from a infected plant then there's one

965
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,880
seed at least statistically probably um

966
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,880
in 20 if it's % and we go low ball

967
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,680
figures one in 20 seeds would have it um

968
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,000
and that's interesting because that

969
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,358
would mean that it's basically

970
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,119
everywhere because there are people

971
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:42,078
buying seeds everywhere and this was

972
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,280
certainly around for a while before we

973
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,400
knew about it and as you said although

974
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,760
there might have been some plants that

975
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,400
were really showing signs of fatigue

976
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,480
from it there was likely many others

977
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,800
that were just looking relatively

978
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,318
asymptomatic it likely swept through a

979
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,079
lot earlier than we thought but in terms

980
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:03,679
of practically what I thought might

981
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,760
happen is all the Breeders for example

982
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,440
go get certified Cuts Like what you've

983
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,560
talked about doing and then you kind of

984
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,800
just have to start fresh and then have a

985
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:15,599
policy of like I don't bring in clones

986
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,480
really maybe if you want to go get them

987
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,318
tested and then quarantine them and then

988
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,039
you know slowly like a real sort of

989
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:25,000
staged integration to your area it seems

990
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,920
like if you were really serious about

991
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,079
keeping it out that might be the best

992
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,119
way to do it but now I'm sure there's

993
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,480
some people who just won't so you know

994
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,200
what I mean like they would just sort of

995
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,400
keep certain plants around and it'll

996
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,519
just sort of continue to exist in a

997
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,039
small part but I think the big

998
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:42,639
facilities and the Breeders if they did

999
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,719
that that might be one way you could get

1000
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:47,318
it out but see I don't even know like

1001
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,199
Can it can it get transmitted like on a

1002
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:52,318
shirt like of a worker like coming from

1003
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:54,239
like is it like a bug like that or is it

1004
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,119
like you know what I mean it's sort of

1005
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,479
we still just don't really know all that

1006
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:02,200
much but I don't know that would be my

1007
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,159
thought cuz for ages I was worried about

1008
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:06,639
people importing clones to Australia and

1009
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,480
bringing in all this stuff but it's like

1010
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:12,358
if it's in seeds then it's already

1011
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,440
here so like I I don't I don't know what

1012
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:16,199
do you think yeah I don't know I don't

1013
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,358
it's kind of like I know it's in the flu

1014
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:19,799
it's it's like kind of like it's it's

1015
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:21,759
it's kind of like plant herpes it's like

1016
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,039
we won't I don't think we can get rid of

1017
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,720
it it's something that people will have

1018
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:30,358
to just live with unless we get some of

1019
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:33,598
the science folks that are good at uh

1020
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:36,639
creating some kind of antiviral

1021
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,480
preparation it just might be a part of

1022
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,239
our thing I mean how do they mitigate it

1023
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,039
in hops I mean what are they doing and

1024
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:46,318
then we have places that are

1025
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:49,679
actively spreading it like you know

1026
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,239
darkart was one of the that pretty much

1027
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,318
spread it to all of

1028
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,519
California um through their clones I

1029
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:57,719
remember seeing Tre coming into

1030
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,519
different places and going and looking

1031
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:02,598
those dark heart Clones look so hideous

1032
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,800
they're so I mean what is going on with

1033
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:08,000
they look like you

1034
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:10,160
know and then for them to recognize it

1035
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,519
and come up with a now they're selling

1036
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:15,879
the the uh the remedy for it somehow I

1037
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,519
don't know what that is but it's just

1038
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,160
like we need people need to be more

1039
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,880
responsible that are in these places of

1040
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,598
distribution if you know these points

1041
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,880
they like they're like vectors they're

1042
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,280
like disease vectors if you're Nur is a

1043
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,119
disease Vector for the

1044
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:37,839
entire uh State you need to change your

1045
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:40,440
protocols like that's not okay so I

1046
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,920
think it lies a lot I mean it's I think

1047
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,559
maybe we can just ask for greater

1048
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:50,559
scrutiny from Vector points nurseries

1049
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:52,719
um um and and such and I don't know yeah

1050
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:56,440
it's such a tough one I mean I do love

1051
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:58,759
that these new clone nurseries like you

1052
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,000
know like Jason's one and stuff where

1053
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:05,400
they're everything is being verified and

1054
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,480
tested and Mar stemmed and but even then

1055
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,880
it's like one person gets that into

1056
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,159
their room that has it and they're like

1057
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,960
oh no I just got this clone it was you

1058
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:14,118
know I paid a lot it was marem it's

1059
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,679
totally clean and they got it from

1060
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:16,838
somethingone else and it goes out and it

1061
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,558
gets it from another plant in their

1062
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:21,679
Garden it's like it's not like people

1063
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:23,760
that you know at least with the person

1064
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,159
you can get your HIV test or your herpes

1065
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,800
test and you have the ability to things

1066
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,920
but plants

1067
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,000
uh can't talk in that way they can't

1068
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,200
tell you that they infected by a viroid

1069
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,119
I mean they can definitely talk to you

1070
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,519
in other ways but yeah it's just it's

1071
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,960
it's another one of those things I would

1072
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,358
be I'm very curious to see how they

1073
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,838
mitigate it and if it's a hop lat and

1074
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,318
vroid like what do they do in hops like

1075
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,159
how do they how do how have they

1076
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:49,279
outsmarted in hops because there's so

1077
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,159
much hops being

1078
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,960
produced yeah that's a very good point

1079
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,239
gosh I I wish I knew I should have asked

1080
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,400
mve he he does a lot of writing about

1081
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:02,239
similarities between Hops and cannabis I

1082
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,200
think um there you go yeah that that

1083
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,919
would be really interesting to know

1084
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:08,919
what's going to happen I think we'll

1085
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,318
have to wait and see uh I wanted to ask

1086
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,880
you since we last spoke Todd mccomic has

1087
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,519
come out with many of his offerings and

1088
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,079
specifically the purest Indica you know

1089
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:23,960
I wanted to know had you had a chance to

1090
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,318
see it try it what's your thoughts on it

1091
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,800
actually you know what I bought a 50

1092
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:33,039
pack of it because we drew it at the um

1093
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:37,119
at the uh uh the hay Valley the late

1094
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:40,119
trials it was a cool plant it they were

1095
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,079
really neat I mean they weren't the most

1096
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:44,720
stable but they there were some really

1097
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,440
cool plants I could see how it was the

1098
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:49,399
progator for maybe a lot of these trains

1099
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,079
that had the frost LEL level kind of

1100
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,119
like the white but it but really scruffy

1101
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,880
little plants like a Bubba and like

1102
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,280
really unique I could see it as a really

1103
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,800
cool Foundation for hybrids you know not

1104
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,359
all of them had that they didn't have so

1105
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,920
much smell and some of them had a little

1106
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:11,838
bit of a neat smell but it was mostly

1107
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:14,358
just very frosty and very uh very uh

1108
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,039
just powerful structure like I could see

1109
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:17,480
really unique and power it's something

1110
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:18,759
that it surprised me that it was so

1111
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,800
unique you know it's kind of like the

1112
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,000
first time you grow like deep chunk or

1113
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,720
something but I don't think we got to

1114
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,679
try any of them because they all molded

1115
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:30,078
out that's the only issue is they do

1116
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:31,919
tend to be very susceptible to most

1117
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,400
things that broad Leafs will

1118
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,960
get oh that's a shame but there you go

1119
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,838
and you know what I too have always

1120
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,079
thought it looked similar to deep chunk

1121
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,719
and uh I'd love to give it a run it

1122
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,880
looks neat and what that's that's

1123
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:46,118
interesting you know a lot of that

1124
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,640
checks out uh another line I wanted to

1125
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:48,880
follow up with you you know I'm going to

1126
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:50,679
be honest there's there's so many

1127
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,680
strains and so many questions that just

1128
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:55,399
relate to following up on various

1129
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:58,519
strains um but I've seen a lot of people

1130
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,240
have been playing with the uh the fan

1131
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:04,719
favorite the American skunk spray aka

1132
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:08,118
the ass line do you have any thoughts on

1133
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,799
using that one again and as a followup

1134
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:12,000
any additional thoughts about the

1135
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,519
roadkill skunk do you still think that

1136
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,920
Sterling skunk is just that's it or do

1137
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:18,960
you think there's something else that

1138
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,318
the crowd is sort of endlessly looking

1139
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,559
for do you think it it will be found or

1140
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:25,639
where are we at with it I think we have

1141
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,599
a better chance of finding probably in

1142
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:31,318
those like Afghan like a selections that

1143
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,760
they're doing um deep and and those guys

1144
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:34,558
in the other groups that are working out

1145
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,960
there like you know supposedly some of

1146
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,440
the Maru lines like what do they call it

1147
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,480
the runchy red or whatever they're

1148
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,240
they're finding in in that in the point

1149
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:45,400
of origin these kind of R kill things

1150
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:48,118
and I mean I I don't Sterling skunk is

1151
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,639
the closest thing we have in seed form

1152
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,480
that I've come across and I think what

1153
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:54,000
that Caleb has come across for smell and

1154
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,480
it's a great outcrosser it can really

1155
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,318
put that smell into other things but I

1156
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,358
think roadkill skunk was a just like a

1157
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,880
class kind of like we have gassy strains

1158
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:03,920
like back then they had stunky strains

1159
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,358
it's like there was a lot of different

1160
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,400
stuff coming into the country back in

1161
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,960
the day uh hash and Buds and stuff

1162
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,838
brought back from the hippie trail and

1163
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,400
stuff and that's just what was being

1164
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,759
grown then and I think like most people

1165
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,720
agree it was

1166
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:25,359
probably a problem to grow it for law

1167
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,759
enforcement and it just got it just got

1168
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:28,598
kind of pushed to the side you know and

1169
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,119
you you know some people remember it as

1170
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,559
being this insanely potent and other

1171
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,400
people believe that you know remember it

1172
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:40,599
being not so potent give you a headache

1173
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:43,800
it's like there's so many it's it has

1174
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:47,240
that through time you know and I think

1175
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,760
it I've smelt uh narrow Leafs that have

1176
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:52,078
you know either have a pissy skunky

1177
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:55,000
smell I think it's just it comes up in

1178
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:58,079
all different plants but mostly from

1179
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,719
those kind of from that area the stands

1180
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,079
kind of like Central Asian trains seem

1181
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,919
to seem to have it and seem to have had

1182
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:08,680
it and it's just it just kind of dried

1183
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,079
up in the states and then yeah and the

1184
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:12,399
ass ass was just a particularly skunky

1185
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,760
one it's not the strongest plant like

1186
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,519
hippie Slayer is way powerful than that

1187
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,880
you know and that one is equally as

1188
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:24,079
hideous but it's more on the pissy side

1189
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,440
you know I just gave uh hay Valley a new

1190
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:33,800
one I'm the name duten

1191
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:36,800
or um Doritos with 3z um or uh garlic

1192
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:41,359
death um Cheetos or something it's it's

1193
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:43,160
a it's a rework of the um um used to be

1194
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,119
called the dragon not dragon souls

1195
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:46,799
dragon's ass whatever the stinky one was

1196
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,640
that I made a long time ago it's

1197
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,599
basically a new version of that and it's

1198
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:53,078
very it's beautiful it's so crystally

1199
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:55,760
and the bud structure so nice and is so

1200
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:58,400
hideous and so gross so people really

1201
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,640
like to smoke the really hideous stuff

1202
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,599
there'll be a new kind of it's an ass

1203
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:05,039
variant ass barant when you need more

1204
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,079
ass in your life but I'm so happy that

1205
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,440
people are enjoying that like I share

1206
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:13,519
that thing I even gave um I think I gave

1207
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,280
Kore stray Fox and Jaws all F1 seeds of

1208
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:18,559
ass to find their own ass and work into

1209
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,880
and make their own ass stuff so I we

1210
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,040
find cool stuff I love to give it to

1211
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,000
other breeders like that's what the

1212
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:27,318
whole the bandaid thing Hast that was

1213
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,358
all we gave that mail that made uh the H

1214
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:31,119
like we gave that out to like four

1215
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:34,039
different breeders and they all made am

1216
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,920
amazing things Bob hemple got it K got

1217
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:39,599
it doc d got it I think ET got it who

1218
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,159
else someone else and you know if you

1219
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,800
find something cool share it I think

1220
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:46,039
males mail sharing should be like a

1221
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,000
whole new thing I don't know how I know

1222
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:51,039
people try and sell Poland that seems

1223
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,039
hard Poland so it's such a hard thing to

1224
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,358
keep viable I don't maybe if you packed

1225
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,920
in dry ice or something but share your

1226
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:00,358
males share your females

1227
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,400
and you know if you made something cool

1228
00:49:00,358 --> 00:49:03,719
see someone else can make something cool

1229
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,358
it's like if everybody gives you a box

1230
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:08,480
of

1231
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:10,440
crowns draw a picture make it a gift

1232
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,719
totally totally I mean hey there was

1233
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,960
that G13 Haze that went around Amsterdam

1234
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:17,639
you know oh yeah yeah and that went to

1235
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,679
everybody's Gard everybody had it G13

1236
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:23,558
Haze hybrids from s yeah and and like

1237
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:25,239
and what I always say to people is and

1238
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,319
this is something I've leared over time

1239
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:28,719
you know um and maybe others learned it

1240
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:31,119
straight away but like I'm I'm just

1241
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,000
trying to say you know I I don't poo poo

1242
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,358
anyone for not being aware of this but

1243
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,960
like I'm of the same view I'm like give

1244
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,558
it out and share it because even if

1245
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,679
someone does something really cool with

1246
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:45,400
it you're you will still be in the story

1247
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,798
of like that's where it came from and

1248
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,760
there's heaps of people in our scene who

1249
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:53,559
are really well known through exactly

1250
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,040
that and it's like it's not any nothing

1251
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:58,720
gets detracted from you if someone else

1252
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:01,279
does something with your work you

1253
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,439
know yeah I was going to say it's like

1254
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,160
you get to be part of this amazing like

1255
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,318
history it's like why not be part of you

1256
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,199
know in 50 years when the bars go out

1257
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,920
and sing their hymns of all the great

1258
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,118
cannabis Creations like be part of it

1259
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,559
yeah open up share like I mean it we're

1260
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,599
all in this together we're all working

1261
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,839
on the same thing it's like this is the

1262
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:22,280
coolest thing you can get involved and

1263
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:24,279
it's like I always tell people there's

1264
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,839
so many rad things in life you can do

1265
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,200
you can get into food you can get into

1266
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:30,599
art you can do all these things but

1267
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,639
cannabis is the only thing that you can

1268
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:35,318
do and it actually manifests in your

1269
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:38,719
mind like it has a biochemical situation

1270
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:41,599
like food is amazing chefs like G I love

1271
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,480
like I'm more on the plant-based side I

1272
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,119
love food and I love to see what people

1273
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,639
can be created with food and all the

1274
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,640
things but and you elicits emotional

1275
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:52,838
responses but it doesn't get you

1276
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:54,239
illuminated like it doesn't open up new

1277
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:55,599
experiences in your mind like what an

1278
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:57,159
incredible thing that you can grow it

1279
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,640
you can trim it you can breed it you can

1280
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:01,759
do all these things and when you're done

1281
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:04,798
you finally get to bring it into

1282
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,359
yourself and experience it you know what

1283
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:10,199
other thing do you get to inhale into

1284
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:13,400
your biology and become a part of

1285
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:16,239
it yeah totally totally I like that idea

1286
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,960
of becoming part of it that resonates

1287
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:21,118
and and you know what just in line with

1288
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,559
what we just said I I I got to give my

1289
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:27,480
buddy uh Bin chicken a shout out this is

1290
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:31,079
a bloke who's creating like these crazy

1291
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,599
ABC hybrids that are like on par with

1292
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,640
modern strains but they look like ABC

1293
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,798
plants and um and he's actually used

1294
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,519
some of my work in there and I was

1295
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:42,679
saying to my wife the other day I was

1296
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:44,599
like this is so cool cuz I think this

1297
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:47,798
guy is going to go down as like the dude

1298
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:49,559
who game changed ABC stuff and and my

1299
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:52,000
work's just kind of embedded in there

1300
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:54,760
like that's so neat like that feels

1301
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,039
awesome like you know I'm stoked for him

1302

oh yeah yeah yeah you're part of the

1303
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:01,838
mandal something super cool and neat

1304
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,240
that's yeah ABC is so all those lines

1305
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,920
like the ABC and the freak Show and like

1306
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:09,479
these mutants like mutants are red and I

1307
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:12,039
know me and Caleb both we're both big

1308
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,318
mutant guys you that's why he does so

1309
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:17,558
much mutant work it is fun and cool and

1310
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:18,960
it's not easy to do what you want it's

1311
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:20,559
like a labor of love and that's like

1312
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,280
somebody finding their Niche and really

1313
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,079
taking it further and like it you know

1314
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,720
it's cool and like it's cool that W you

1315
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,000
know Wally duck being a part of that I

1316
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,919
remember I still have a pack of Old

1317
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,239
Wally duck um ABC or Ducks foot seeds or

1318
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,599
whatever you know it has so many names

1319
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:37,279
what is it quaz what are the what's the

1320
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,880
other name that they used to call it um

1321
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,559
that Fett used to call it has a name um

1322
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,559
but yeah it doesn't it all go back to

1323
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:48,400
Pro like an Australian progator like

1324
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:51,839
it's like ducks foot like so Wally Ducks

1325
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,880
stuff it um it goes back to just some

1326
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:59,119
random guy in his town I think and then

1327
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:01,240
all of the ABC stuff goes back to for

1328
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,358
the most part it all goes back to this

1329
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:05,399
this one guy we've managed to track down

1330
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,400
and he gave it to a few different people

1331
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,920
over the years but he was offline so he

1332
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,400
never had any idea that like it was

1333
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,960
popular online he just thought it was

1334
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,160
this weird

1335
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,720
thing wow that's so wild and then you

1336
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:19,558
have like what Hawaiian Ducks foot like

1337
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:22,118
you like that's something that people

1338
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,160
aren't yeah it kind of fell off what I

1339
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,920
don't understand why and you know it's

1340
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,960
the same work with like people doing all

1341
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,280
these incredible new Autos like how

1342
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,720
awesome is that like that's something

1343
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,519
that I It fascinates me like just the

1344
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:35,239
how they make the Autos but it's not

1345
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,318
something I'd want to do it's it's such

1346
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:39,239
a it's like driving a race car because

1347
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:41,159
you can't go backward like backwards

1348
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,519
you're going so fast breeding these

1349
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:45,598
really cool things and then you you

1350
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,358
can't since you're always in autof you

1351
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,400
can't Capt it's like you can only go

1352
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:52,279
forward is that how it is unless you do

1353
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,639
these photo period ones that are basis

1354
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,079
at 18 or

1355
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,920
something you've almost touched on to

1356
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,720
the next question I was going to ask you

1357
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,838
so so thank you thank you for getting me

1358
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:04,480
there which was I was I wanted to ask

1359
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,519
you know in terms of like the way you

1360
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,400
view breeding or philosophies on

1361
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:10,838
breeding has anything changed since we

1362
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,079
last spoke like some of the things you

1363
00:54:10,838 --> 00:54:14,920
spoke about last time is you know really

1364
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:17,440
flowering out the males to see what

1365
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,200
they're fully offering and and resonance

1366
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,679
males hey that's a cool little added

1367
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,118
Advantage um has anything changed since

1368
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,159
then have you do you feel like your

1369
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:28,280
views on anything have shifted at

1370
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:29,598
all yeah I mean there's so many it's

1371
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,200
such a cool topic and everybody kind of

1372
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,359
likes it's like always a question like

1373
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:36,639
oh how do you do what do you do for

1374
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:40,119
breeding I for me now I I feel like I've

1375
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:42,199
developed like almost a six sense for it

1376
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:45,640
like I can just I know it sounds dumb if

1377
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:48,239
people are be but you can almost feel it

1378
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:49,798
and like I'll double check myself by BL

1379
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:53,239
wearing stuff you know males out really

1380
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:55,079
far or doing all the smell tests and um

1381
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:56,919
checking them out I like to you know

1382
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:59,880
I'll have a mail room and I just

1383
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,880
check the males throughout their period

1384
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,480
you know because before they sex they

1385
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,599
smell differently then after they sex on

1386
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,480
the stem rub and you can get unique

1387
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:11,039
experiences like before they even sex

1388
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,920
there's so many different ways but when

1389
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:15,000
people ask me breeding there's

1390
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,760
goal-based

1391
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,400
breeding and there's exploratory

1392
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:24,319
breeding it's the breeding of of you

1393
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,318
know looking at new plants looking at

1394
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,199
things you've never seen before find

1395
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,920
finding the outliers finding special

1396
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:34,118
things finding new smells or uh finding

1397
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:37,599
new morphology uh really digging in the

1398
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:39,599
gene pool and exploring it and really

1399
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,200
finding unique things and if you see

1400
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,880
something that's really special putting

1401
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:44,919
that you into your collection and

1402
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,599
knowing that maybe at some point you're

1403
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,920
going to find the perfect partner for

1404
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:51,640
that for this amazing you know F1 hybrid

1405
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,960
like I always say that my motto is like

1406
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,798
extreme possibilities is putting two

1407
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,440
completely different things together to

1408
00:55:55,798 --> 00:56:00,679
create some of total majesty and Beauty

1409
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,200
that's that that you know that that is

1410
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:06,279
so incredible and then by that point in

1411
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:08,318
that F1 you re you get that hybrid Vigor

1412
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,760
you get that you're basically it's the

1413
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,759
gift of Mother Nature saying thank you

1414
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,039
for putting these two Creations they are

1415
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,240
completely different environments and

1416
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,640
created shape through time and space

1417
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:22,358
together to to create something

1418
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:24,639
new um and that's like the true Essence

1419
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:27,838
I think of is F1 breeding and that's

1420
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:30,279
where you're really going to find a lot

1421
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,880
of magic and also allow the person if

1422
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,839
you give a seat to someone they not only

1423
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,000
get to experience that magic but if they

1424
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:38,639
like it they can do f2s and find and

1425
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,159
really explore the parents and

1426
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:41,879
understand what created those like it

1427
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:44,480
can be a whole teaching like I almost

1428
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,440
think of the seeds I create is like a

1429
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,318
and like an interactive teaching course

1430
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,000
like take something that's very solid

1431
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:52,759
and something that's very well known and

1432
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,199
and allow people to explore that and

1433
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,359
make new things and if they like it go

1434
00:56:54,199 --> 00:57:00,038
further like it go even further and then

1435
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:02,480
when you find plants and you get that

1436
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:05,000
experience and you get those extreme

1437
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,838
possibilities and you feel familiar and

1438
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,480
you really want to go for then you can

1439
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:10,960
go into gold breeding you're like I love

1440
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,199
what this how this plant smokes I love

1441
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,838
the high I don't like the smell there's

1442
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:18,838
other plant that's like has an

1443
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:22,279
incredible smell but it just has shoddy

1444
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:23,880
structure it's like gold breeding is um

1445
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,839
it's a process and you can really you

1446
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,358
can add goals on As you move through it

1447
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:33,038
and I think you know most breeding today

1448
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:35,920
is co breeding but I really really

1449
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:38,400
suggest and and encourage people to do

1450
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,880
exploratory breeding really see the

1451
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,440
unique things that can come out of it

1452
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,240
and by default a lot of today's breeding

1453
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,639
is exploratory breeding because we're

1454
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:50,358
putting together these insane Mish

1455
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:52,038
mashes you know and in those Mish mashes

1456
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:54,480
there is great treasure but in those

1457
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:56,640
Mish mashes you're going to have to hunt

1458
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,240
through a lot of plants because

1459
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,798
they are going to segregate out in a lot

1460
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:03,439
of different ways and I think the magic

1461
00:57:59,798 --> 00:58:05,280
of f1s if even f1s that don't that

1462
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,838
aren't dis similar enough to get hybrid

1463
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,720
rigor you're still getting the unique

1464
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,719
traits of just two plants but um and

1465
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,719
like for tips for breeding yeah grow

1466
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:17,399
grow as many plants as you can have a

1467
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:19,279
big mom room have a big dad room keep

1468
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,400
things around that you like back things

1469
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,200
up in seed form um you know stem rubbing

1470
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,760
is a great way to see how turpy

1471
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,159
something is it may not smell like that

1472
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,960
once it it's flowered out but there are

1473
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:32,199
plants that are true to their stem rub

1474
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,079
and stem rub before um sexing because

1475
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:36,960
you're going to get a different smell

1476
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,760
before and after um for seed making like

1477
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,318
I always tell people you don't have

1478
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,039
you're you can make seed you can

1479
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:45,679
pollinate a plant and put it right back

1480
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,079
into your mom room don't need to keep it

1481
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,078
in the flower room it's like you can do

1482
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,000
that outside you can make seeds outside

1483
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,000
and bring it inside once your pistols

1484
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,559
are pollinated as long as the plant is

1485
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,400
healthy and happy you're making seeds

1486
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,559
you don't have to have so much space you

1487
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,400
don't have to create these Ms you can

1488
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:04,519
have a revolving you can do so much it's

1489
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:08,039
such a it's such an easy plant to work

1490
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:10,880
with you know and I think it's the key

1491
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:13,240
is yeah and is sharing and caring and

1492
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,400
finding your Niche and and just

1493
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:16,798
understanding finding that plant that

1494
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,680
you Ry identify and getting and

1495
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:21,159
understanding it and talking to it

1496
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:23,318
people don't believe in this in plant

1497
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:24,719
communication but I believe plant

1498
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:27,199
communication is through the heart the

1499
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,519
heart has like a I think it's what 5,000

1500
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:31,038
times the magnetic field of the brain

1501
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:34,159
and they're finding out now that it's

1502
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:36,599
basically like the six cense this is

1503
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,879
basically the heart is a is a field

1504
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:39,200
generat it's a signal generator and it

1505
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,640
moves out beyond the body and it

1506
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:43,000
interacts with everything around it

1507
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:46,199
other humans plants things and I think

1508
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,719
if you can listen and tune into that

1509
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:52,879
that's a really effective strategy to to

1510
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:54,598
breede is to let the plants talk to you

1511
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:59,039
and you talk back you

1512
00:59:54,599 --> 01:00:01,760
know you know it's through the heart and

1513
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:03,039
yeah I mean you you I'm sure you have a

1514
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,359
similar thing especially being a

1515
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:09,400
musician I think being a musician really

1516
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:11,318
allows you to have an like motive like

1517
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:15,318
uh it's very emotional music and I think

1518
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:18,798
that's a pathway to uh plant life

1519
01:00:15,318 --> 01:00:22,440
too yeah 100 100% you know and as time

1520
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:25,318
goes by I feel like a just from an

1521
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,240
empirical point of view the of all the

1522
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:28,679
males I've to around with in the past

1523
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:30,679
the two that I consider to have been

1524
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:32,919
sort of the most success in terms of The

1525
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:35,000
Offspring were ones that I definitely

1526
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,119
had more of a connection like I felt

1527
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,400
that connection whereas there's other

1528
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:41,720
times of use Ma where you're like looks

1529
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,960
good I guess um yeah and that's that's

1530
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:46,399
huge you know in fact I've got one male

1531
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:49,599
I've been lugging around with me

1532
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,639
for almost 4 years now and I've only

1533
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:54,640
just used it for the first time and so I

1534
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,838
thought tell you what no one can say I

1535
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,920
don't feel like you I kept it for three

1536
01:00:56,838 --> 01:01:01,798
years just going no it's time will come

1537
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,440
but it's not yet yeah that's right no

1538
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:06,159
it's true it's like that it's like yeah

1539
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,358
you'll have meales in your in your mom

1540
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:10,239
room that literally like I know yeah

1541
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:12,078
someday this is going to be perfect for

1542
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:13,719
something and you never know and there's

1543
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,039
other males that's like that just want

1544
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:17,639
to dust everything all the time with and

1545
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:19,000
it's and but it's true it's they have

1546
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:20,920
their own time and they will talk to you

1547
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,318
the plants kind of tell you what who

1548
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,039
they want to be with you can almost feel

1549
01:01:23,318 --> 01:01:28,279
it and when you work with plants enough

1550
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:31,599
and you really open up to him it's like

1551
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:34,519
you don't you can you almost

1552
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:37,119
know what needs to happen it's like

1553
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:38,838
you're I know we you know people like oh

1554
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,200
we select the plants but do we are the

1555
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:43,239
plants selecting through us who is the

1556
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,598
selector of us that's selecting the

1557
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:48,199
plants is it the plants is it us is it

1558
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,720
something higher than us you know as

1559
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:54,838
when I used to DJ and we were on vinyl

1560
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:56,838
and we we tried to just open up to

1561
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:59,358
source and open up to the crowd because

1562
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:01,278
we're usually like in nature and having

1563
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,038
these big free sound system parties it's

1564
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:06,278
the key was to open up to the experience

1565
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:08,640
of what we're doing this incredible

1566
01:02:06,278 --> 01:02:11,880
celebration and by being clear you'll

1567
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:14,199
know what what music needs to come next

1568
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:18,480
because it's a feedback loop through the

1569
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:20,719
dancers the DJ and source and it's an

1570
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,719
emotional it's an emotional connection

1571
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:24,959
and I think we can develop that just

1572
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,959
like you know I think the greatest

1573
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,679
musicians are ones

1574
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:32,639
that they had that special gift of I

1575
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:34,078
thing or any artist you know and I think

1576
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,318
that's the whole thing with Art and

1577
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,240
Science with breing and all these you

1578
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:40,798
know with now with scientific breing and

1579
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,879
everybody saying oh you guys don't know

1580
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,880
what you're doing you need to do this

1581
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,440
and that and this it's like no not at

1582
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,519
all it's like there's no way show me one

1583
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,880
strain notable strain by any scientific

1584
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,559
reader that's in the that's in the

1585
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:56,599
cultural domain do I mean there's no

1586
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,160
none that have held test the time

1587
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:00,079
there's like I can't think of anything

1588
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:02,118
oh well this guy made this and he's a

1589
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,839
scientific breeder and we still grow

1590
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:06,640
that it's like no sorry there's not

1591
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:09,759
really anything out there um it's all

1592
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:11,159
people that are doing this for the love

1593
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,880
you know and do you do you want to

1594
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:14,480
listen to machines or do you want to

1595
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,318
listen to plants on this one you know

1596
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,039
it's like it's kind of a non secter like

1597
01:03:17,318 --> 01:03:22,159
I get it and science always wants to

1598
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,278
make it better but it's already better

1599
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:27,679
and it's better through us making it

1600
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:31,119
better so I think breeding is just doing

1601
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:33,038
it for the love and really having an

1602
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,160
open heart and an open mind and really

1603
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,400
taking notes and taking notice like you

1604
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:39,759
know I have tons of breeding books that

1605
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:42,079
I can go back years and years and

1606
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,559
they're just scribbles but I don't have

1607
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,119
the best memory and I I sometimes I'll

1608
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,440
look back and I'll be like oh my God I

1609
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:50,200
forgot that's why I chose this one or

1610
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:52,358
this one was this one or I did that one

1611
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:54,118
I like oh that wasn't the original mail

1612
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:57,199
I actually used the different one it's

1613
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:59,000
like you're kind in this this beautiful

1614
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,879
creation autopilot if you don't write it

1615
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,358
down sometimes you don't even remember

1616
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,119
all the magic what was happening because

1617
01:04:02,358 --> 01:04:06,798
you're kind of in the moment with it and

1618
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:08,880
I think that's where where the fun

1619
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:11,519
really

1620
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,838
resides totally totally I think you've

1621
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:15,199
you've got to be in the moment you got

1622
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:18,719
to feel that connection more than just

1623
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:20,598
some sort of uh textbook criteria cuz I

1624
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,399
used to ask this question about like you

1625
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:24,838
know if a robot just had a

1626
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,119
checklist would it just not pick the

1627
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:29,318
best male and I think that sort of again

1628
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,000
is the Crux of what we're talking about

1629
01:04:29,318 --> 01:04:33,278
here but in and amongst that you

1630
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,079
mentioned the word book one of The

1631
01:04:33,278 --> 01:04:36,920
memorable things in our first episode

1632
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:39,079
was we we did a little book club had

1633
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,079
some book recommendations I'd love to

1634
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:43,559
hear have you been reading anything

1635
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:47,119
recently that you'd love to give a big

1636
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:49,760
UPS to or or a recommendation for people

1637
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,640
to have a read on yeah you know what

1638
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,839
it's weird I I notic that people aren't

1639
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:56,239
reading as much it's it's more of like a

1640
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:59,000
it's a lot of

1641
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:00,879
social media and a lot of YouTube and a

1642
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,079
lot of movies I notice with the younger

1643
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,880
generation um but for books yeah I don't

1644
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,640
get as much reading time as i' like but

1645
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,720
I sure would but you know I like

1646
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:12,679
anything by if you want to go more into

1647
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:16,798
like plant spirit communication like

1648
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:18,239
Stephen Boer um ell C let me think

1649
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:20,599
there's so many cool things I love

1650
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:23,679
reading if you want to go back and

1651
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:27,318
really get back into that Pinnacle of

1652
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:30,199
like the the natural scientist Movement

1653
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:33,679
Like Steiner and

1654
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:35,159
um uh you know who else is like Luther

1655
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,679
Burbank is another you know you want to

1656
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:39,278
talk about hype breeder for the day

1657
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:41,278
Luther Burbank was like friends with

1658
01:05:39,278 --> 01:05:42,798
everybody from Ford to presidents people

1659
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:47,838
would come to see him like he was the

1660
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:50,318
man and he created so many different um

1661
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,838
so many different varieties of of plants

1662
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:54,880
and fruits and vegetables like like like

1663
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:56,558
some insane amount and he did crazy

1664
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,760
stuff he would if you ask him how he did

1665
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,559
it like he was the guy that tried to

1666
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:03,799
create um a spineless cactus and I was

1667
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:06,160
reading about like how he did it he did

1668
01:06:03,798 --> 01:06:08,759
it you know he had a really insane Mac

1669
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,118
for selection like he had like one of

1670
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,799
the he was considered like one of the

1671
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:13,519
greatest plant readers of all time just

1672
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:15,400
because his ability to connect to the

1673
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:17,798
plant on a different on that kind of

1674
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,920
Heart level um but he would just do all

1675
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:20,679
kinds of crazy combinations and po all

1676
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,480
these different things and then his

1677
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:25,038
Knack of selection was just incredible

1678
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,559
but he one of the stories I heard about

1679
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:30,559
him was uh he would talk to the cactus

1680
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,480
and say hey you're safe here you don't

1681
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,278
need to make spines we got you covered

1682
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,960
we love you there's you don't need you

1683
01:06:35,278 --> 01:06:39,679
know you're totally protected and each

1684
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:42,278
generation they would select they would

1685
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:43,838
say that and eventually he made a

1686
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:46,318
spineless

1687
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:48,119
cactus and isn't that wild and that's

1688
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:51,000
kind of the same story as there's I

1689
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:54,039
heard about there was a plant um

1690
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,318
Harvester and herbalist who also would

1691
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:58,559
get their stuff tested in they did a

1692
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,838
test where they went out to the field to

1693
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:03,039
harvest like calf Frey or something and

1694
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:05,078
they went out and so first they

1695
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,960
harvested it and then they went out and

1696
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:08,318
harvest it second time and the second

1697
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,240
time the night before they went out and

1698
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:11,599
told the plants why they were harvesting

1699
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:14,479
and what they needed from them and what

1700
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,400
they'd be using for them and the plants

1701
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,920
they they talked to had naturally had

1702
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,160
higher levels of the beneficial

1703
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,838
compounds that they needed for healing

1704
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:25,679
so it's like there's so much cool stuff

1705
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:28,400
that just kind of got

1706
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:30,399
the kabush put on it like just around

1707
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,400
you know right as Automobiles and stuff

1708
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,760
were kind of kicking in gear I think

1709
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:38,519
after World War II we kind of lost the

1710
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:41,720
heart and soul of of really working with

1711
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:42,480
plants as as you know as we lost a lot

1712
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:46,358
of

1713
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,119
our our traditional ways of of working

1714
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:51,199
with plants and a lot of our traditional

1715
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:52,960
cultivars um too as well through you

1716
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,439
know just get you know feeding people

1717
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,960
and get trying to get what we could to

1718
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,599
the markets and

1719
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:01,599
really not falling back into the farmers

1720
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:03,720
markets into all you know I mean people

1721
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,039
don't realize too that migration to

1722
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:07,798
America where everybody came everybody

1723
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:09,278
came but everybody brought their seeds

1724
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:10,599
there were seeds from all over Europe

1725
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:13,599
from every part of the world that people

1726
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:15,960
came from and not only did we have an

1727
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:18,440
amazing Melting Pot of humans we had an

1728
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,039
amazing germ plasma we had an amazing

1729
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:21,639
like gene pool of stuff from all over

1730
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:25,278
the world and we've slowly lost that and

1731
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,119
I think that's a potent like a symbol

1732
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,640
and

1733
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:31,198
metaphor for what we're having now with

1734
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:33,600
our own cannabis Jean Pool bottlenecking

1735
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,358
you know you know if people want to see

1736
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,159
a really cool movie there's a movie

1737
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,759
called um seed the untold story that's a

1738
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:42,639
really cool thing all about seeds and

1739
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:45,399
how we've uh uh lost a lot of our seed

1740
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,640
stock over time through different things

1741
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:49,198
what else is cool you know I would just

1742
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,600
say if you want to go if you're old

1743
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:55,439
enough to be reading books I would say

1744
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:58,239
Steiner um it's a great Natural Science

1745
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:01,318
scientist Boer all the

1746
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,879
ethnobotanists um Terence McKenna never

1747
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:04,319
go wrong like I can listen to Terence

1748
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,199
McKenna interviews the rest of my life

1749
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,319
like I think he's probably the alltime

1750
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:14,119
him and Bob Marley should be the uh

1751
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:16,080
rulers of uh music and science um just

1752
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:17,479
because you know Bob Marley everywhere

1753
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:18,920
you go on the planet he's a saint

1754
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:21,000
everybody knows Bob Marley song you

1755
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,279
grown to the Nepal everywhere it's like

1756
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
there's these people that have shaped

1757
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:29,440
people's lives so I don't know there's

1758
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:33,880
try books that I like I love shulties I

1759
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:36,358
love um yeah I love you know what is

1760
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:38,600
going on I love actually some of these

1761
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,838
new websites too I like I just like what

1762
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,880
everybody's doing and you know I'm

1763
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:44,079
really thinking podcasts because now you

1764
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,520
know when you work you usually can't

1765
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,880
read you can listen and I've been

1766
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,480
digging a lot of the the podcast and you

1767
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,359
know even stuff like in different things

1768
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:54,079
like micro entrepreneur like on all the

1769
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,079
mushroom stuff and I love some of the

1770
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:59,238
science stuff and I love lot of the

1771
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:03,079
magical um stuff and a lot of alchemy

1772
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:04,599
like Alchemy is physical Alchemy is

1773
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:06,640
never been my thing but I really love

1774
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,440
inner Alchemy and I love to hear a lot

1775
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:13,079
of the you know some of

1776
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:15,238
the Eastern philosophy as people get

1777
01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:17,600
just get into it find stuff that's cool

1778
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:19,119
and like go for it like there's so much

1779
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,520
out there and you know people always ask

1780
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:26,000
me my like kind of what my meditation

1781
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:29,960
practice is and you know if I it's my

1782
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:32,319
primary one that I have a an initiation

1783
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:35,279
into would be Kashmir shiism and I think

1784
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:37,599
that's a really powerful um form of

1785
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:39,759
meditation and a unique way of seeing

1786
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:43,159
the world and it's also very similar to

1787
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:47,600
even certain Buddhist path like Zan

1788
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:50,000
and those are great starts um super

1789
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,600
ancient dosm like Barefoot doctor style

1790
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,920
like going back and really just walking

1791
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,640
with nature and is really cool there's

1792
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,119
still practitioners that just F same

1793
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,000
thing in anything find your Niche find

1794
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:04,319
the things that really allow you to to

1795
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,399
flower to flourish to bloom you know

1796
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,759
because the world is a big old dump of

1797
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:12,039
compost like this world right now is

1798
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:15,119
nuts what we're making right now is BS

1799
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:16,679
like pom poost like so now's the time to

1800
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:18,399
plant your seeds like that's where

1801
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:20,600
they're going to grow best you know the

1802
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,799
micro life is there from all the junk

1803
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,800
that and it's it's our time to shine

1804
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,360
it's our time to really bring this this

1805
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,679
place back through planting ourselves

1806

planted like be the best you can be use

1808
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:35,238
cannabis to be a better person that's a

1809
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,920
you know when we finally get our merch

1810

01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,600
funny culture and so much it there's so

1819
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:05,000
much joy that can be generated in this

1820
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,320
thing I think we need to focus on that

1821
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,039
and people soone what's up with

1822
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:12,359
everybody having a beef with everyone

1823
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:15,519
else can everyone just Just Do Your Own

1824
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:18,079
Thing just you know what I mean why is

1825
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,800
everybody uptight so much smoke another

1826
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:24,000

1828
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,039

no totally totally I I agree I agree I

1830
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:34,238
feel like the ongoing Paradox you know

1831
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:36,599
how come how come we all be so angry

1832
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:40,759
when there's so many joints to to calm

1833
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:43,760
you down but yeah you know I agree bod

1834
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:46,000
the historical Channeler of uh non what

1835
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,920
is it peaceful

1836
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,319
resistance I love that and you know you

1837
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:53,639
actually just quickly mentioned a

1838
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:56,238
comment about the shirts we got so many

1839
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:58,639
people asking about the shirts but also

1840
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,000
as a bit of a followup just in general

1841
01:12:58,639 --> 01:13:02,600
is there going to be somewhere people

1842
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,359
might be able to go in the future to get

1843
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,039
info about upcoming drops about merch

1844
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,920
stuff like that where would where should

1845
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:10,719
they keep an eye on is it like your

1846
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:13,399
Instagram for the moment watch this

1847
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:15,520
space sort of thing or is there a site

1848
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:17,158
yeah I mean what I mean first I want to

1849
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,400
preference like as an apology to

1850
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:22,119
everybody in the community I've been

1851
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:24,759
such a Hermit and like I really like

1852
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:26,880
it's been a challenging couple years it

1853
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,760
it's it's just been a massive Exodus to

1854
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,679
get to where we are now and when things

1855
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,560
get really hard I I just kind of go

1856
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:37,359
Inward and stick to family and and

1857
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,679
plants and so yeah it's it's been a

1858
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,039
difficult time but I feel like that

1859
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:45,359
we're putting our Roots down and we're

1860
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:48,119
really going to make a commitment um to

1861
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:50,198
be an inspiration and to to be here and

1862
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:52,279
to I'm going to try and be more and the

1863
01:13:50,198 --> 01:13:54,399
forums are hard because I'm such a slow

1864
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:56,000
writer I'm try and be there I'm going to

1865
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,519
try and I mean I think we're finally

1866
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,319
getting a website we're going to come

1867
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,560
out of the Shadows we're going to um do

1868
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,799
that we're going to bring the merch back

1869
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,239
the merch stopped because you know when

1870
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,760
we moved we couldn't really sustain it

1871
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:10,439
anymore we couldn't buy the stock um it

1872
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,199
just we didn't have the time or energy

1873
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:14,799
to do it or the finances and now we're

1874
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:16,519
looking into doing it I love the silk

1875
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,520
screen shirts from broprints those are

1876
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:21,360
my favorite but we're also looking into

1877
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:23,719
other other ways and also kind of moving

1878
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:26,079
out maybe even like a Lifestyle brand or

1879
01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:29,039
something like just trying to make you

1880
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:32,359
know more stickers like just change

1881
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,920
people's minds you know I like things

1882
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:36,439
like even funny things like you know the

1883
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,000
Matrix was a documentary bumper sticker

1884
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:40,279
you know like you know

1885
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,079
bring things like that but yeah

1886
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:45,198
definitely merch will be coming you know

1887
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:47,198
it'll definitely be the same stuff but

1888
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:51,279
also Med there's going to be n and

1889
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:53,919
Medicine Mountain and um and stuff it

1890
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:56,519
just takes time it's it's every day I

1891
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,359
feel like I do so much and and I'm just

1892
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,920
exhausted at the time I just every night

1893
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:03,000
I have like a million people on

1894
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,480
Instagram I want to write back and every

1895
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,198
day that I don't I kind of eats away a

1896
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:10,319
little about my soul but I'm gonna yeah

1897
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:13,238
I'm gonna really do my best to to at all

1898
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:15,559
of us you know we have my wife sage and

1899
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:17,000
S son that we're all working together

1900
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,120
right now and the three of us to kind of

1901
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,679
bring it

1902
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:22,880
back um you know Especial in this

1903
01:15:20,679 --> 01:15:25,920
especially in this time and age

1904
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,920
when you know it's like

1905
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,560
it's you got to you can either just fall

1906
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,800
back into the Shadows or you can really

1907
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,520
stand up and be a light and I think it's

1908
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,639
time to shine you know in the darkest

1909
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:40,400
times it's the time when it really

1910
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:43,279
really needs to shine so I'm I feel like

1911
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:44,039
we're rebirthing and I feel like I hope

1912
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:47,000
that

1913
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:49,800
everybody is rebirthing and kind of feel

1914
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,359
that that that this is the time where we

1915
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,159
all need to do it I think that's kind of

1916
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:56,839
a weird roundabout thing about do we

1917
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:59,319
have merch coming but yeah I think yeah

1918
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,960
the merch is coming it just might take a

1919
01:15:59,319 --> 01:16:03,719
little bit and it might first start

1920
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,399
maybe on some service like printful or

1921
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:09,520
something for the colorful uh shirts but

1922
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:12,198
eventually get the so screen ones back

1923
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,320
and the hoodies and the hats we you know

1924
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:16,638
try to make them

1925
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:19,039
economical that sounds awesome I know

1926
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:21,400
people will be very excited to hear

1927

1928
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:26,559

1929
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,399
sure people will be happy to grab what's

1930
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,159
available in the near future as well as

1931
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:32,839
later on I wanted to ask you one last

1932
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:36,079
question before we jump into a few of

1933
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:39,039
the patreon submit ons and that is have

1934
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:41,399
you got any thoughts about the irari

1935
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,639
lines you worked with I I remember the

1936
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:48,479
Iraqi R was some really memorable smoke

1937
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:51,119
um any is that just sort of you know in

1938
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,519
the in the mix at the moment or any

1939
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:55,920
plans yeah I think that was that was

1940
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,239
Street Fox's brother I thought brought

1941
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,239
that back um and yeah that's such a cool

1942
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:02,479
line I mean um it was kind of like since

1943
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:05,238
it was St we were just kind of

1944
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:09,119
collaborating and doing stuff with it um

1945
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:10,519
I we did grow one um the seed I have a

1946
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:13,238
bunch of seeds that I made to keep the

1947
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,440
line alive but the The Germ ratio's kind

1948
01:17:13,238 --> 01:17:19,158
of fallen off so we did get one or two

1949
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:20,919
at the last um hay Valley grow off and

1950
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:24,319
it's such a cool strain like it it's

1951
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:27,119
very Gourmand which you know is very it

1952
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:29,039
has the kind of like the coffee house

1953
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:31,840
smells and flavors of cinnamons and

1954
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:34,198
cloves and cream and and it has such a

1955
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,119
great high it's a SL it can be slightly

1956
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:37,238
unstable and it's I haven't quite

1957
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:39,920
figured

1958
01:17:37,238 --> 01:17:41,959
out how or what you know how sometimes

1959
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,319
after a couple crosses you can be like

1960
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,600
oh it doesn't do well with this kind of

1961
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:49,559
plant or it doesn't like this you know

1962
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:51,199
it doesn't like other broad leaves or it

1963
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:53,520
so I'm still trying to figure that out

1964
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:55,919
but that one's definitely that one's

1965
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,400
definitely still on point and I would

1966
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,000
like yeah I'm I'll talk to stay and see

1967
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,599
if he wants to do anything cool with

1968
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,238
that as well um and then I have another

1969
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:08,440
persion line from a

1970
01:18:05,238 --> 01:18:10,158
uh a friend of a friend who she goes to

1971
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:14,638
visit her family I'd like to check that

1972
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:17,399
one out too that cool and yeah I some of

1973
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:20,279
those those are so like people don't

1974
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:22,759
realize like those Broad Leaf those like

1975
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:24,119
point of origin broad leaves are so cool

1976
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,920
and fascinating and they really

1977
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:29,359
Encompass like every imaginable smell

1978
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,840
and flavor and even effect and like

1979
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:33,559
there's some of the if you want to find

1980
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,719
stuff that hasn't been hybridized yet I

1981
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,320
mean it's sad because the reason why it

1982
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:39,600
hasn't been hybridized is because it's

1983
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:43,238
from war torn countries that have been

1984
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:47,079
occupied by um you know people that

1985
01:18:43,238 --> 01:18:49,959
don't take kindly to anything coming in

1986
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:52,600
I mean that's kind of our last our last

1987
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:54,079
hunting grounds for truly unique old

1988
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,199
school and even then they I mean they

1989
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:59,279
clearcut it a lot of their um their

1990
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:01,279
narrow leaf plants when they started

1991
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,238
growing for massive hash production you

1992
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:06,238
know like 30 years ago there was still a

1993
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:09,238
lot of narrow Leaf hash plants and

1994
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:12,599
sativas and some of the finest hash was

1995
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:16,319
made with uh more Highland narrow stuff

1996
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,039
and then as the Warlords and the uh mass

1997
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:22,000
production came in they switched over to

1998
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:23,639
the more hashy broadleaf stuff so yeah I

1999
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,920
mean there's so much cool stuff out

2000
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:28,239
there you can still find so rad you know

2001
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,920
and people too I there's a lot of cool

2002
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,839
people doing unique stuff that people

2003
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,600
look at like Jaden ector and Jeff and

2004
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:36,719
his garden in Boulder Creek he grows a

2005
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,120
lot of incredible plants we go and look

2006
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,399
at it every year and it's just

2007
01:19:38,119 --> 01:19:43,880
fascinating you know some of them I

2008
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:45,920
think aren't totally 100% what they are

2009
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,960
but everyone is fascinating there's some

2010
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,399
ones that just are so cool like the

2011
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:53,840
there's a Philippino purple one that's

2012
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:56,238
so rad and there's some great Mexicans

2013
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,760
and ties and like he grows stuff from

2014
01:19:56,238 --> 01:19:59,919
all over the world and it's super

2015
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,119
fascinating to see in a in a big garden

2016
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,760
and it's like I almost think like

2017
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:05,760
someday I wish there was like theme

2018
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,280
parks or Botanical Parks like it's like

2019
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,679
oh it's hard you know I know Rob and

2020
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:14,800
Mojave um did move they get they got to

2021
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:17,319
go to some of the new uh uh Department

2022
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,520
of Agriculture grows where they were

2023
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:21,000
growing out these Mass sessions in like

2024
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,639
where was it some ways back east and

2025
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,238
then also at Davis and getting to see

2026
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:28,560
these government collect

2027
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:30,158
of seeds and Seed lines that were like

2028
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,039
they were growing out like thousands of

2029
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:34,879
plants so I would love to see like the

2030
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:36,519
public get to really check these things

2031
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,039
out I would probably die if I went to

2032
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:40,000
one of these because all the males all

2033
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:43,198
the Paul and I'd go in a hazmat suit

2034
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
because I'm so hyper allergic to pollen

2035
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:47,319
now that I've developed over the years

2036
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,399
like you know it starts out everything's

2037
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:54,079
good but after 20 years I can't even I

2038
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:55,479
Gotta Wear like a like a like a going to

2039
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:57,000
war or something

2040
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:59,919
to

2041
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,198
pollinate wow and out of curiosity you

2042
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,480
just attribute that to just like

2043
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:04,719
repeated

2044
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:07,879
exposure it has to be like in the

2045
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:09,399
beginning I I wasn't as it wasn't as

2046
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:11,000
intense but you know I see a lot of

2047
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:13,399
people that just can Wade through pollen

2048
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,679
it's no problem but yeah I'm not really

2049
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:17,399
an allergic person but I think just over

2050
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:19,600
time like I can get it on my skin and it

2051
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:21,920
itches and I can't if I I'll just gush

2052
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,600
even a little bit I'll gush I try to go

2053
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,960
in and sometimes do stuff like some of

2054
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,480
my males pre flow and I'll come out

2055
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:31,760
gushing um it's notnot

2056
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:33,879
everywhere yeah wow I I I can't remember

2057
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,480
exactly what happens but I think uh

2058
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:39,319
Fletcher of archive also historically

2059
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:43,039
has like some sort of reaction I can't

2060
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:45,158
if it's pollen or tricomes but yeah he

2061
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:47,079
he too has some sort of reaction and is

2062
01:21:45,158 --> 01:21:48,920
like got to be careful similarly that's

2063
01:21:47,079 --> 01:21:51,359
interesting maybe there's something to

2064
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,679
that certain trimmers some trimmers

2065
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:55,679
develop issues it's usually for yeah

2066
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:58,679
like scanning like tricomes and then

2067
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,880
some people can't handle thees for some

2068
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:04,239
reason um you know they're just it just

2069
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:07,920
sets something off and that's a whole

2070
01:22:04,238 --> 01:22:09,879
thing I mean tury it's like let's talk I

2071
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,840
is that a topic I

2072
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:16,520
mean what if if there's really 400,000

2073
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:19,279
which I'm not sure that there really is

2074
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:23,480
but that's amazing if there is like what

2075
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:26,039
a pallet and what what I mean I don't

2076
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:27,759
even know how to to think about that

2077
01:22:26,039 --> 01:22:30,238
like that's these are

2078
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:33,920
biochemical it's a biochemical language

2079
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:36,638
spoken to all of creation that's being

2080
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,480
generated by plants like what are they

2081
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:40,279
talking about like what are the all

2082
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:41,718
these like what are we're not privy to

2083
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:42,759
like what's really going on you know

2084
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:45,359
when I was in

2085
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,920
Amazon I you know I realized that

2086
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,238
there's a whole communication Network

2087
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:51,158
that we had no clue about and it was the

2088
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:54,678
insects like you know when I was doing

2089
01:22:51,158 --> 01:22:57,319
my thesis work in Amazon with IAS like

2090
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:59,199
and I realized that the bugs that's the

2091
01:22:57,319 --> 01:23:01,158
that's the true internet the Wi-Fi you

2092
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:02,839
could tell everything going on in the

2093
01:23:01,158 --> 01:23:05,399
entire Forest just listening to the

2094
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:07,199
insects and the birds like it was their

2095
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:10,519
own language so I can only imagine what

2096
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:13,839
nature is saying through these these

2097
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:16,480
this language biochemical language of

2098
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,279
Aroma yeah I'm really curious to see

2099
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:21,638
where it goes because as you've

2100
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:24,158
explained it's more and more information

2101
01:23:21,639 --> 01:23:26,840
about tpes and their characterizations

2102
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:29,319
is coming out and it seems more and more

2103
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,600
easy to present to present the argument

2104
01:23:29,319 --> 01:23:33,479
that cannabis is capable of producing

2105
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,600
any tpine profile because of the

2106
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,238
diversity of composition and

2107
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:41,679
combinations it can do with the tpin but

2108
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:44,359
at the same time what you see is that

2109
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:47,440
we're not really finding new flavor

2110
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:49,359
profiles which is kind of

2111
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:52,158
interesting yeah I mean and then we're

2112
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:55,158
not even finding we're finding these

2113
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:56,759
like hyper aromatic tpine where like

2114
01:23:55,158 --> 01:23:58,879
they're not even reading in some of

2115
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,880
these labs and it's like but they're

2116
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,520
more perceptible than the ones that are

2117
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,600
there by by weight and it's like so

2118
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,719
there's tures that we're not

2119
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:12,639
even even knowing but our but our nasal

2120
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:14,399
Center is so equipped to pull out scense

2121
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:18,000
like we're reacting even though people

2122
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:20,399
like oh well this is has the exact same

2123
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,600
you know just got mering and pining and

2124
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:23,158
lemoning and that's it it's like and

2125
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,480
this strain does too but they do

2126
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:27,960
different things is that some

2127
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:30,599
cannabinoid that we have we haven't even

2128
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:32,359
discovered yet that's active in super

2129
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,520
you know super minuscule things is it

2130
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:38,079
tpin is it is it the plant it's it

2131
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,119
itself is it's like what is it like what

2132
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:43,238
is creating these effects it doesn't

2133
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:45,679
seem like anyone has a clue except the

2134
01:24:43,238 --> 01:24:48,519
plants you know it's like no one seems

2135
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:50,960
to know like that you know or even the

2136
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:52,560
Entourage effect I mean there's a basic

2137
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:56,079
basic Entourage effect that certain

2138
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:58,560
things like LOL is calming and and

2139
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:02,279
finding is rejuvenating and and you know

2140
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,159
and then we have all the Citrus um you

2141
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:07,519
know style ones that are very energizing

2142
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:10,198
but are they really leading the

2143
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:12,400
high you know it's like what is going

2144
01:25:10,198 --> 01:25:15,399
what is happening what is going on where

2145
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:19,399
where are the effects coming

2146
01:25:15,399 --> 01:25:22,879
from yeah certainly certainly I mean

2147
01:25:19,399 --> 01:25:25,719
look you've kind of um almost stumbled

2148
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,719
into one of the questions the patron

2149
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:29,319
fans submitted so why don't we jump into

2150
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:31,760
it and we'll start with this one which

2151
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:34,359
sort of leads on which is over the years

2152
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:37,119
have you found any strains that you feel

2153
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:38,960
work particularly good for painkilling

2154
01:25:37,118 --> 01:25:42,559
or have you heard of anything that's

2155
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,198
good for like say mild opioid withdrawal

2156
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,920
and the reason I ask is because I've

2157
01:25:44,198 --> 01:25:48,599
found some strains like sour d is is

2158
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,520
really good for that and I'm wondering

2159
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:53,159
do we think maybe some strains activate

2160
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,920
opioid receptors I've also heard old

2161
01:25:53,158 --> 01:25:55,960
hash plans can help

2162
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:58,079
what's your

2163
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:00,800
thoughts yeah I mean it's fascinating I

2164
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:01,960
mean I mean that's even cool that sour d

2165
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,199
is doing that because you know

2166
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:07,118
traditionally a lot of people like

2167
01:26:04,198 --> 01:26:09,759
sativas will intensify their or you know

2168
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:13,000
whatever you want to call sativas narly

2169
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:15,520
intensify a pain response so it so comes

2170
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,439
back to being so personal I mean there's

2171
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,199
classic ones that are for pain like you

2172
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:23,799
know Baba Kush has always been a great

2173
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:25,638
thing master master kushes um you know

2174
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,760
like the Sunshine Daydream is good for

2175
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:31,440
nerve pain um certain broad leavs that

2176
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,880
are naturally very relaxing and Euphoria

2177
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:36,839
creating can do that but yeah it's weird

2178
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:39,400
when you get into stuff like depression

2179
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:42,480
you want real day brighteners it's like

2180
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:45,638
it's it seems to be we're back to that

2181
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:48,879
same thing of of really getting to try

2182
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:52,840
plants to find what really gives us that

2183
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:56,400
relief and with our gene pool dropping

2184
01:26:52,840 --> 01:27:01,039
and becoming very homogenized and very

2185
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:03,118
inbred and bottlenecked and on a

2186
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:05,279
consumer level our choices are getting

2187
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:07,238
reduced it's should be harder and harder

2188
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:10,279
to find those strains those individual

2189
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:12,079
strains that can help us with our daily

2190
01:27:10,279 --> 01:27:16,039
our maladies and our you know our

2191
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:17,479
disease like what so it's I don't know I

2192
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:22,760
think it comes back again it's the same

2193
01:27:17,479 --> 01:27:24,599
thing it's like is grow Inspire trade

2194
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:26,920
gift

2195
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,800
support do whatever you can to make sure

2196
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:31,960
that the diversity of

2197
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,440
cannabis is within our reach and really

2198
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,118
share that knowledge you know I think

2199
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:38,479
there was someone a while back on one of

2200
01:27:36,118 --> 01:27:40,319
the forums that was making a list and

2201
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:43,000
everybody could uh put in their two

2202
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:46,479
cents of what plants were doing what for

2203
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,319
them and which amazing because people be

2204
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:50,359
like oh my gosh but at the same time

2205
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:52,519
some people were like oh well that one

2206
01:27:50,359 --> 01:27:53,759
actually that does the opposite for me

2207
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:56,719
but there are you know it seems like

2208
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,400
maybe NE there's kind of there's maybe

2209
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,000
you fall into groups maybe there's like

2210
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:02,559
three groups or four groups or five

2211
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,279
groups of people and different strains

2212
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,080
kind of work for their biology whether

2213
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:08,639
they're in you then you know some people

2214
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:11,439
are endocannabinoid deficient you know

2215
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:13,840
where and some people like we have one

2216
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:16,399
of our kids you could give him like a

2217
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:18,880
whole entire edible cake and he won't

2218
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:20,719
even get high or he has like that enzyme

2219
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:23,359
thing where it doesn't break

2220
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:26,399
down canono in the system like there's

2221
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:28,079
so many fascinating things I mean I

2222
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:29,679
guess it's just getting the information

2223
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:31,000
and information on the Grassroots level

2224
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,399
because the machine ain't going to tell

2225
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,279
you and if it is it's not going to be

2226
01:28:33,399 --> 01:28:37,559
for a long time and right now is when

2227
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:39,439
we're we're having the pain you know if

2228
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:41,480
you have pain right now you're not I

2229
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,479
mean you're not going to be talking to a

2230
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:43,479
machine about it you're going to ask

2231
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:45,759
your friends you're going to ask to be

2232
01:28:43,479 --> 01:28:48,000
the dispensary you're going to be

2233
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:50,320
looking for that kind of information so

2234
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,479
I guess spread the

2235
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:55,158
word yeah totally totally I I 100%

2236
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:58,799
resonate with what you're saying about

2237
01:28:55,158 --> 01:29:00,799
like you know without the ability to try

2238
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,400
that wide exposure of things how are you

2239
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:06,119
going to find the thing that hits the

2240
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:08,039
spot for this very specific issue that

2241
01:29:06,118 --> 01:29:10,519
works for you but maybe not for the next

2242
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:12,238
person and it's uh it's sort of

2243
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,239
interesting I sort of thought to myself

2244
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:16,479
when I first started buying seeds let's

2245
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:18,479
say around

2246
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:22,479
2010 I felt

2247
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:24,559
like there was just a whisper of cookies

2248
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:27,519
hybrids in the market

2249
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:29,719
and mostly a whole range of relatively

2250
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,880
diverse other stuff and nowadays it's

2251
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:34,480
like the polar opposite 15 years or so

2252
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:36,440
later you know it's like there's barely

2253
01:29:34,479 --> 01:29:39,678
there's a whisper of things on offer

2254
01:29:36,439 --> 01:29:43,039
that don't have cookies in it and um you

2255
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,600
know very little very little otherwise

2256
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:46,198
um do do you think we'll ever be able to

2257
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,280
get out of that or do you think it's

2258
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:50,559
just it's gone too far and and to get

2259
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:53,840
stuff that sort of doesn't have any

2260
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,719
cookies or its progenitors onwards um is

2261
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,360
is just going to be like you know the DI

2262
01:29:55,719 --> 01:30:01,079
hard Forum head type

2263
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:03,519
stuff I wonder I mean through through

2264
01:30:01,079 --> 01:30:07,600
marketing and pro you know the power of

2265
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:09,400
propaganda and and and just their

2266
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,159
ability they have an incredible I mean

2267
01:30:09,399 --> 01:30:15,679
cookies is forces an incredible uh

2268
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:19,000
ability to shape the the consumer

2269
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:21,600
landscape of what people want to smoke

2270
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,639
and I think it's kind of anchored itself

2271
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:27,079
into history I don't think we I think

2272
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:30,520
it's cookies is now in the same league

2273
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:32,158
as like OG Kush and Hayes it's kind of

2274
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:35,719
created its own category I think we're

2275
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:38,799
kind of be kind of stuck it's just up

2276
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:41,039
to you know the small breeders to find

2277
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,880
those new things and maybe look outside

2278
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:46,079
of of those things and you know lots of

2279
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:48,840
people love those cookies hybrids and

2280
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:50,399
they do uh they work really well for him

2281
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:52,679
so there's always going to be a place

2282
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:54,638
but yeah I think I think if we don't

2283
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:57,399
start looking outside

2284
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:59,319
of what we consume every day we're never

2285
01:30:57,399 --> 01:31:02,359
going to find those

2286
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:04,118
outliers you know and maybe it maybe the

2287
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:06,000
newest thing will come out I mean like

2288
01:31:04,118 --> 01:31:07,880
if you have a a polyhybrid polyhybrid

2289
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,439
polyhybrid poly hybrid and you go

2290
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:12,960
through a thousand seeds you may find

2291
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:16,479
something that's like that has that's

2292
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:20,359
some kind of ancient like you know

2293
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:22,000
recessive plant from that's just the

2294
01:31:20,359 --> 01:31:23,679
that's popped out that is the new thing

2295
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,279
because it's a little bit of everything

2296
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:30,600
made made so incredibly Sublime and

2297
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:32,719
perfect that uh that it carves a place

2298
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,560
in the history of cannabis you know I

2299
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:36,039
even and the whole thing with triploids

2300
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,840
like sometimes they're found I thought I

2301
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:40,560
think didn't they say like mac might be

2302
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,239
a triploid there's a people still find a

2303
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,760
lot of the mutants are still out there

2304
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:46,439
there's still amazing treasure to be

2305
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:49,360
found there are nature still creates all

2306
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:50,719
these things and it's mostly about just

2307
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:54,439
opening our

2308
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:56,520
eyes there's incredible stuff to find

2309
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:59,198
still but I think it's in and there's

2310
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:01,440
such a a magic to the hunt to the

2311
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:03,919
treasure to the treasure

2312
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:07,039
hunters and that's

2313
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:09,520
why deeds will never go away and I think

2314
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:14,079
that's regul too always have a place

2315
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:16,360
because sure you can S2 stuff but I

2316
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:18,519
noticed with s1s you don't you have to

2317
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:21,118
look through a lot of s1s to get

2318
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:24,320
something cool you find some amazing

2319
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:26,198
combinations but it's it's just as much

2320
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:28,158
a hunt and then you don't have guys to

2321
01:32:26,198 --> 01:32:30,678
help back you it

2322
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,719
up yeah certainly you need to be able to

2323
01:32:30,679 --> 01:32:34,480
do the hunt and you don't want to have

2324
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,719
to hunt through stock where the odds

2325
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:39,039
aren't stacked in your favor that's for

2326
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:40,639
sure look while we're on the topic

2327
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,639
people have been waiting we may as well

2328
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,880
jump into it here saying as we mentioned

2329
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:47,719
cookies a lot of people have been

2330
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,000
wondering a lot of speculation tell me

2331
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:52,560
about the cookies Endeavor how did you

2332
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,279
get into it what happened and looking

2333
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:57,760
back what are some of your thoughts

2334
01:32:55,279 --> 01:33:00,279
I think the experience is like I think

2335
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,840
it's amazing learning experience like I

2336
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:04,118
I'm I'm glad I embarked on it I know I

2337
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,719
lost a lot of them my reputation I

2338
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:08,279
realized that that was going to happen

2339
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:10,118
and I had to make a decision like I was

2340
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:12,039
I had this opportunity to do something

2341
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:14,719
that I thought could really change the

2342
01:33:12,039 --> 01:33:18,639
landscape of cannabis

2343
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:23,118
and and it kind of it didn't

2344
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:26,199
necessarily come to fruti but at least I

2345
01:33:23,118 --> 01:33:28,719
tried and so the the story that came out

2346
01:33:26,198 --> 01:33:30,719
like when I was really originally making

2347
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:32,520
the lavender lemonade and really wanting

2348
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,239
to get into strain design and getting

2349
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,679
into Nursery stuff and I knew that I

2350
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:37,839
would have to be moving from my farm and

2351
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:42,118
I wouldn't I didn't have a I didn't

2352
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:45,119
really have anything I was able to do

2353
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:47,319
and so I kind of prayed on it and sent

2354
01:33:45,118 --> 01:33:49,319
the word out and kind of put out energy

2355
01:33:47,319 --> 01:33:51,279
that you know I'd like to do some strain

2356
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:54,319
design and the funny thing is like of

2357
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:57,279
course I had a dream that the first

2358
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:59,039
people that off that wanted to do my

2359
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:01,000
streams was cookies which I thought was

2360
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:04,439
so weird I was like there's no way and

2361
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,039
over time uh friend to a friend said hey

2362
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:10,238
burner wants to talk to you about some

2363
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:11,519
stuff and so I was like uh I I wasn't

2364
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:13,439
you know I'd like to make everybody kind

2365
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,800
of work for it so they kept on trying

2366
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:17,198
and trying and like well let's go on a

2367
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,279
walk in the forest or something but I

2368
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:22,279
don't know nothing panned out but

2369
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:24,880
eventually you know I I he offered uh to

2370
01:34:22,279 --> 01:34:26,840
come visit him at his house and and we

2371
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:29,480
got you know over about a year's time

2372
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:33,000
maybe I came over a couple times and we

2373
01:34:29,479 --> 01:34:36,079
had some really good talks like I really

2374
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,158
found him to be a a a kind and fun and

2375
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:41,118
unique kind of gentleman like definitely

2376
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:43,479
a Goff level like Hustler and manifestor

2377
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:45,359
which I thought was really cool in a way

2378
01:34:43,479 --> 01:34:49,959
like you know you got to give him credit

2379
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:53,079
he's created this uh movement that and

2380
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:55,800
this this force that has pretty much

2381
01:34:53,079 --> 01:34:58,639
terraformed formed the Cannabis culture

2382
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:02,119
in a way and you know I thought that was

2383
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:04,560
I found everybody at cookies to be

2384
01:35:02,118 --> 01:35:07,639
pretty passionate and actually cool and

2385
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:10,000
down to earth and uh I enjoyed talking

2386
01:35:07,639 --> 01:35:11,920
with them and I enjoyed I explained what

2387
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I kind of was into and I brought we

2388
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:16,440
brought samples and he was really into

2389
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,118
it and we talked about stuff and we kind

2390
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:21,919
of had a I think you know we had a

2391
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:23,799
common ideal that we need the gene pool

2392
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,279
we were moving into a place that they

2393
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,440
were kind of moving into a place where

2394
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:28,559
they couldn't get out of they were

2395
01:35:26,439 --> 01:35:31,839
bottlenecking themselves into their own

2396
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:34,320
creation even though this creation is

2397
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:37,360
you know like steering a huge sector of

2398
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:41,118
the Cannabis space for what people want

2399
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:44,559
to try and enjoy and what's cool it was

2400
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:47,238
naturally about to Snuff itself out like

2401
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:51,080
a flame well when it get doesn't get

2402
01:35:47,238 --> 01:35:53,919
oxygen you know and we talked about

2403
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:54,840
different plants and land uh land Racers

2404
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:59,679
are

2405
01:35:54,840 --> 01:36:01,079
heirlooms and um and the old days and

2406
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,960
kind of just went through a lot of

2407
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:07,559
different things and they uh asked if I

2408
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,039
wanted to do genetics with them and you

2409
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:11,080
know I had to think long and hard and he

2410
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:13,319
was like this is a really great

2411
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:15,639
opportunity to really expose a lot of

2412
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:18,079
people to really unique and new things

2413
01:36:15,639 --> 01:36:19,840
and the flagship straight we're start

2414
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:21,479
with was the supernatural selections

2415
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:23,699
Congo Kashmir which actually made it

2416
01:36:21,479 --> 01:36:24,879
onto the the menu

2417
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:28,719
[Music]

2418
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:31,639
um and after that we were going to do a

2419
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:35,639
lot more kind of these like creating

2420
01:36:31,639 --> 01:36:38,159
some uh lines like the D 5.3 was going

2421
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:42,600
to be the chocolate milk white chocolate

2422
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:46,000
um really creat some new flavors and new

2423
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:48,119
um effects and new uh things and really

2424
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,760
open people's minds to like a whole new

2425
01:36:48,118 --> 01:36:53,880
world and by having these new flavors it

2426
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:55,560
benefit them because they are going to

2427
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:57,960
be able to offer these things that no

2428
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,760
one's really ever experienced in that

2429
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:02,399
part of the community and really open

2430
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,840
some minds and for us for my I mean I

2431
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:07,399
think we both had our own ideas I wanted

2432
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:10,800
to kind of get the Jean Pole out of a

2433
01:37:07,399 --> 01:37:14,638
bottleneck and also really show some

2434
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:16,400
other sides of cannabis and you know uh

2435
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:19,480
things are going along we were supposed

2436
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:22,198
to have these big uh containers to be

2437
01:37:19,479 --> 01:37:24,359
able to do lots of pheno runs but it

2438
01:37:22,198 --> 01:37:26,479
never really panned out the the

2439
01:37:24,359 --> 01:37:27,679
containers uh they kept on having a hard

2440
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:29,919
time getting them

2441
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:31,560
licensed um and they'd always you know

2442
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,480
we couldn't start and it just went

2443
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:35,199
longer and longer

2444
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:38,439
and

2445
01:37:35,198 --> 01:37:41,079
um things just kind of fell apart I

2446
01:37:38,439 --> 01:37:43,839
don't have any ill will at all to them I

2447
01:37:41,079 --> 01:37:46,238
found them you know delightful I knew

2448
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:49,360
they do a lot of behind the-scenes stuff

2449
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:51,799
that isn't poetic at all and I think

2450
01:37:49,359 --> 01:37:54,039
their their karma is showing them that I

2451
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,159
know and I you know by being there I I

2452
01:37:54,039 --> 01:37:58,719
realized

2453
01:37:55,158 --> 01:38:02,238
that maybe the core group is passionate

2454
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:03,960
and and involved and really it is it is

2455
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:05,399
their their love of the life and their

2456
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:08,560
passion but there's you know there's a

2457
01:38:05,399 --> 01:38:10,079
bigger situation behind it that's

2458
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,880
controlling it and I don't think they

2459
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:14,920
were necessarily happy when I didn't

2460
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:17,159
want to make seeds for them when I just

2461
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:19,800
wanted to just do strain design and you

2462
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:21,719
know over time just fell apart and they

2463
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:24,480
had their karma to work through and I

2464
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:27,319
realized it just wasn't going in the in

2465
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:31,479
the in the direction I wanted and we we

2466
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:34,559
parted ways you know and I'm still

2467
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:36,718
working the one line out I made for uh

2468
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:38,560
burner the lavender lemonade Skittles

2469
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:39,880
and I think it's almost ready I wanted

2470
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,760
to at least you know I like to always

2471
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,880
finish up my projects like if I say I'm

2472
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,360
gonna make something cool I'm gonna I'm

2473
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:48,440
gonna come through so I I polished up a

2474
01:38:46,359 --> 01:38:51,399
really unique feno that I'm calling

2475
01:38:48,439 --> 01:38:54,000
jenz and it's like kind of like the next

2476
01:38:51,399 --> 01:38:56,279
evolution of a a skittles likee plant

2477
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,198
and and you know so far it's it's

2478
01:38:56,279 --> 01:39:01,158
exceeded All my expectations of smell

2479
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:03,678
flavor and also keeping through the Cure

2480
01:39:01,158 --> 01:39:07,598
and and the ability

2481
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:09,800
to create abundant amazing resin so

2482
01:39:07,599 --> 01:39:10,840
that'll probably be the final thing that

2483
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:13,679
you'll

2484
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:16,760
see that kind of like the closing

2485
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:18,399
chapter but yeah I it was you know my my

2486
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:21,679
whole thing about extreme possibilities

2487
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:25,598
I really thought it was super F1 hybrid

2488
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:30,039
between between this amazing force and

2489
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:32,480
also my collection of of unique genetics

2490
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:34,719
that we could do something special but

2491
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:36,919
maybe it was a lofty goal and you know I

2492
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:39,279
know people really got upset about it

2493
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:42,599
but you know when I was thinking it's

2494
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:44,319
like I also saw the writing on the wall

2495
01:39:42,599 --> 01:39:47,039
of like you know cookies doesn't have

2496
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:49,519
always the the best rep but they're

2497
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:51,599
still part of our original Community

2498
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,880
they you know all those guys they

2499
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:56,760
hustled the grew they we're all came up

2500
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:58,239
in the bay we all were part of the same

2501
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,639
force that was moving through time and

2502
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:02,839
space as cannabis and now there's some

2503
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:05,719
forces that are coming in that

2504
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:08,360
completely level everybody so you know

2505
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:11,279
it's like kind of like

2506
01:40:08,359 --> 01:40:13,839
um like the Han Solo working with the

2507
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:15,800
Ewoks or something you know it's like

2508
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,199
the Bounty Hunter and the and the forest

2509
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:21,639
Spirits working against the uh the the

2510
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:25,158
Death Star so I don't know I learned a

2511
01:40:21,639 --> 01:40:27,039
lot and you know I I I liked where it

2512
01:40:25,158 --> 01:40:28,559
was going it's too bad it it didn't ever

2513
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:31,599
really work

2514
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:33,280
out yeah certainly look I can I can

2515
01:40:31,599 --> 01:40:35,880
appreciate your point of view you know

2516
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:40,559
someone's got to get in there and do the

2517
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:44,239
work I guess just just to uh avoid

2518
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:46,560
anyone saying I I I didn't push hard

2519
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:49,158
enough my interpretation of what you're

2520
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,639
saying is that like burner and the inner

2521
01:40:49,158 --> 01:40:54,319
crew they seemed cool they seemed on

2522
01:40:51,639 --> 01:40:56,440
board but obvious VI L cookies as a

2523
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:58,880
company is much much bigger than just

2524
01:40:56,439 --> 01:41:00,519
burner and the inner crew and it just

2525
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:02,560
felt like there were sort of forces at

2526
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:05,080
play that just weren't really working in

2527
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:07,119
your favor is that sort of what you're

2528
01:41:05,079 --> 01:41:09,880
saying yeah and I think just the

2529
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:12,079
national in inera of the progress of the

2530
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,520
plan never panned out so there was no

2531
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:15,679
there was no like what do they call it

2532
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,119
proof of concept there was never the

2533
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:20,039
ability there was just you know i' moved

2534
01:41:18,118 --> 01:41:23,799
I had a few clones I offered up the

2535
01:41:20,039 --> 01:41:25,639
Congo Kashmir clone as as a as the and

2536
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:27,360
you know it it's an amazing Train

2537
01:41:25,639 --> 01:41:30,159
everybody loves it I don't know if if

2538
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:32,598
the public liked it as much and after

2539
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:34,719
that not being able to pop more seeds

2540
01:41:32,599 --> 01:41:39,319
and to really do these hunts because

2541
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:41,599
there was no you know there was no uh

2542
01:41:39,319 --> 01:41:43,759
there was no place for me to to work I

2543
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:45,599
couldn't produce any new and as there

2544
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,119
was nothing really to see and maybe it

2545
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:50,760
was just not meant to be maybe it was a

2546
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:53,439
lofty goal and a great thing and I know

2547
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:55,840
uh yeah it just fell apart and never we

2548
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:58,238
never were the plan never was realized

2549
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,560
and so when it got to a point we

2550
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:03,839
just we parted

2551
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:06,679
ways sure no look I understand I

2552
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:09,480
understand and uh and I I I'm still

2553
01:42:06,679 --> 01:42:11,199
grateful that you tried to do it I I was

2554
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:13,198
always and always have and always will

2555
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:15,079
be in support of this I think trying to

2556
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:17,919
make a difference from the inside is a

2557
01:42:15,079 --> 01:42:21,198
valid tactic for anything you're trying

2558
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:23,199
to do really and uh on on the topic you

2559
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:25,799
know you sort of mentioned the the Congo

2560
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:27,319
cashmir in the mix one of our listeners

2561
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:28,719
they uh sent in a message saying you

2562
01:42:27,319 --> 01:42:31,639
know I actually went to a cookie store I

2563
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:34,039
got to try some they said look it smoked

2564
01:42:31,639 --> 01:42:38,520
really good and I was really surprised

2565
01:42:34,039 --> 01:42:40,719
by how well it sort of fit in as like a

2566
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:43,880
flower on the cookie shelf you know like

2567
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:46,279
it didn't seem super out of line and so

2568
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:48,279
much so that like I was really surprised

2569
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:50,118
sort of as what they were saying is that

2570
01:42:48,279 --> 01:42:52,279
your experience does it sort of look

2571
01:42:50,118 --> 01:42:54,759
like cookies weed in a sense was that

2572
01:42:52,279 --> 01:42:57,639
one of the reasons you hand it over and

2573
01:42:54,760 --> 01:43:00,039
um what's it like to smoke that

2574
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:02,800
plant so yeah I'll start on Congo

2575
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:05,279
Kashmir um yeah the reason why we picked

2576
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:08,279
Congo Kashmir is because it has one of

2577
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:11,359
the most unique and uh like really

2578
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:13,599
flavorful it's t like you would never

2579
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:15,198
expect it to be an F1 hybrid I mean the

2580
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:18,159
way it looks and the way it grows maybe

2581
01:43:15,198 --> 01:43:20,960
uh because it's very it has it's very

2582
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:24,158
vigorous it's very beautiful it's it's

2583
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:25,760
very robust um

2584
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:28,679
and it's you know it doesn't take longer

2585
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:30,800
than nine weeks it was almost a it's

2586
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:33,520
it's really

2587
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:36,440
special so I had a few samples and that

2588
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:39,159
was the one that agreed upon that would

2589
01:43:36,439 --> 01:43:42,759
be kind of an entry way because we also

2590
01:43:39,158 --> 01:43:45,158
had to you can't just like Drop in like

2591
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:46,440
some crazy heirloom plant into a cookies

2592
01:43:45,158 --> 01:43:48,279
facility because they don't always look

2593
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:51,079
good we had to create some I had to

2594
01:43:48,279 --> 01:43:54,399
create the find the perfect plant to as

2595
01:43:51,079 --> 01:43:57,118
a rainbow bridge to bring that consumer

2596
01:43:54,399 --> 01:44:01,638
over to a new level of appreciation so

2597
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:03,639
they'd be open for future um creation so

2598
01:44:01,639 --> 01:44:05,480
yeah the Congo Kashmir has this really

2599
01:44:03,639 --> 01:44:07,599
Lush like it seems like it has almost

2600
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:10,799
every turpine you can imagine in it it's

2601
01:44:07,599 --> 01:44:12,679
almost kind of like um you know some of

2602
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,480
those like really hoppy alses that where

2603
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:17,480
they put like every known hop in there

2604
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:23,439
to try and get the ultimate like a

2605
01:44:17,479 --> 01:44:28,158
expression of citrus and like Pine and

2606
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:30,439
um and then what else like Earth and um

2607
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:33,279
gas and it just has like kind of

2608
01:44:30,439 --> 01:44:35,719
everything going for it it's

2609
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:38,359
visually pretty like it doesn't look

2610
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:40,359
like a you know doesn't look kind of

2611
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:42,839
jungly like some heirloom stuff it has

2612
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:45,479
really nice buds it's very crystally it

2613
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:48,079
holds on the plant through the Cure very

2614
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:50,519
well and it has a really like functional

2615
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:53,359
yet up high where someone that maybe is

2616
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:57,119
used to smoking like the cookie Style

2617
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:59,439
hybrids or indicia Style Plants it's

2618
01:44:57,118 --> 01:45:03,359
functional enough for them that it's not

2619
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:06,039
scary or uh frightening or edgy like

2620
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:08,000
it's just kind of like having a cup of

2621
01:45:06,039 --> 01:45:10,760
coffee after you had your like whatever

2622
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,760
nightly six-pack of hinin or whatever

2623
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:15,360
you know for someone that likes to slow

2624
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:18,119
down after work or to play video games

2625
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:20,598
or something it just gave a little boost

2626
01:45:18,118 --> 01:45:23,118
a relax it was kind of like relaxer size

2627
01:45:20,599 --> 01:45:25,199
you know like when you're relaxed but

2628
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:27,198
can but you want to exercise I don't

2629
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:31,039
know if that makes sense but I also like

2630
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:34,678
to call it like rert like relaxed yet

2631
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:38,479
alert it would there was a category Kong

2632
01:45:34,679 --> 01:45:40,560
Kashmir it would be very turpy rert um

2633
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:42,678
bu that that there that you know that

2634
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,360
they that's outside of the Wheelhouse of

2635
01:45:42,679 --> 01:45:46,319
that and so that was the entry way like

2636
01:45:44,359 --> 01:45:47,759
we had a lot of grandiose like I thought

2637
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:50,238
something was really going to happen you

2638
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:53,039
know and that's okay but it's like you

2639
01:45:50,238 --> 01:45:55,000
said all you can do is try and I know

2640
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:56,639
lot of people felt like I sold out and

2641
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,800
this and that I you know I didn't become

2642
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:02,079
a millionaire I didn't I just got a I

2643
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:05,079
don't know I just got a a basic monthly

2644
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:07,960
salary and I got to do basically pretty

2645
01:46:05,079 --> 01:46:11,399
much not too much

2646
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:13,960
uh you know to create something that

2647
01:46:11,399 --> 01:46:16,679
never really happened and you know I

2648
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:19,840
think you know maybe I I'm praying that

2649
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:21,399
in the future that that new that the

2650
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,239
bigger companies will pick up really

2651
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:24,238
unique and special things as long but

2652
01:46:23,238 --> 01:46:27,158
that's the whole thing of the breeder

2653
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:29,198
the breeder whether it be scientific

2654
01:46:27,158 --> 01:46:31,359
natural whoever you are in your closet

2655
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:33,638
in your things out in the fields like

2656
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:35,960
yeah I I think it's important like that

2657
01:46:33,639 --> 01:46:37,960
that's what kind of I really some of the

2658
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:40,158
I really learned a lot and you know I

2659
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,118
have respect for them even though I

2660
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:45,839
don't agree with the thing all the

2661
01:46:42,118 --> 01:46:49,439
things they do the core group and what

2662
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:51,679
they you know they just happen to be put

2663
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:53,638
in yeah I don't even know what to think

2664
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:55,480
about it anymore I just I'm happy for

2665
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:56,920
the experience I realized like it really

2666
01:46:55,479 --> 01:46:58,319
taught me a lot and it really taught me

2667
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:00,079
that that the only way we're going to

2668
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:03,079
really be able to kind of change this

2669
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:06,439
environment of bottlenecking is by

2670
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:08,719
finding things that appeal to the

2671
01:47:06,439 --> 01:47:12,799
consumer and that also that these big

2672
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:14,599
facilities can can bump out and at this

2673
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,760
point we're all you know the people that

2674
01:47:14,599 --> 01:47:19,319
are into it are into it they know a good

2675
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,920
gunch they know what's up but most of

2676
01:47:19,319 --> 01:47:22,439
the most of the states most of the

2677
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:25,359
planet I me not Planet I'm going to just

2678
01:47:22,439 --> 01:47:28,319
say most United States doesn't really

2679
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:29,799
know what good ganja is they just know

2680
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:31,319
what's in the dispensary and they've

2681
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:32,639
been forced by that it's like going to

2682
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:34,039
someone that's eat at McDonald's their

2683
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:36,319
whole life they just they want

2684
01:47:34,039 --> 01:47:39,238
McDonald's so it's like we have to make

2685
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:41,479
these new plants that are going to fit

2686
01:47:39,238 --> 01:47:44,959
in that mold but have the ability to

2687
01:47:41,479 --> 01:47:46,839
liberate them from uh not only from the

2688
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:50,599
the the effects of the old stuff but

2689
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:51,880
also the pers pervasiveness of that's

2690
01:47:50,599 --> 01:47:53,840
that's you know inhabiting their

2691
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:58,159
Consciousness this kind of

2692
01:47:53,840 --> 01:48:02,840
purple glistening candy gas that's great

2693
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:04,598
and it's great for um for doing stuff

2694
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,520
but there's a world out there that needs

2695
01:48:04,599 --> 01:48:09,279
to be explored you know I think it's a

2696
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:10,800
Birthright to be able to experience

2697
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:14,559
everything that the world has to give us

2698
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:18,440
and cannabis is a great part of that

2699
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:20,599
100% 100% look we we've been talking a

2700
01:48:18,439 --> 01:48:22,799
lot about unique and special stuff and

2701
01:48:20,599 --> 01:48:24,920
we actually got a really interesting f

2702
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,719
submited question which is that you've

2703
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:30,359
got so many magical plants in your

2704
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:33,439
garden and you've given us some unique

2705
01:48:30,359 --> 01:48:35,679
descriptions of past experiences but I'm

2706
01:48:33,439 --> 01:48:37,960
wondering what do you enjoy on a daily

2707
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:39,880
basis do you ever actually go back to

2708
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:43,158
something repeatedly or is every time

2709
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:45,199
you smoke just something totally new um

2710
01:48:43,158 --> 01:48:46,879
I try and mix it up I can tell you like

2711
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:49,279
my wife is really into

2712
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:51,440
manoni she really likes that out of the

2713
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:53,559
last ones that we've Brewing that's like

2714
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:56,319
a it's a new I think that gets released

2715
01:48:53,560 --> 01:49:00,039
in a week or two it's the it's a

2716
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:02,920
supernatural selections um and it's the

2717
01:49:00,039 --> 01:49:05,599
J mortega old Hawaiian clone um crossed

2718
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:08,399
with the angel wing Afghan and it makes

2719
01:49:05,599 --> 01:49:09,920
her like it's just happy for her like um

2720
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,719
there's a certain feno one feno is a

2721
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:15,118
little racy for her but the other feno

2722
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:17,198
just makes it's just kind of like a day

2723
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,559
brightener like just a lifter and it's

2724
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:20,158
it's it's user friendly like you can go

2725
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:22,719
to sleep on it you can do whatever you

2726
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:26,839
want it's just kind of this kind of like

2727
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:30,560
all around good vibe kind of

2728
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:32,079
Gan and let me think what else uh stuff

2729
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,760
that I like to go back to I don't know I

2730
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:36,039
you

2731
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:38,000
know I'm I'm always just things get old

2732
01:49:36,039 --> 01:49:39,479
in the jars and I'm always trying new

2733
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,520
things I'm always just

2734
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:45,000
searching you know when I used to have

2735
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:46,320
things hanging in at the Old Farm we had

2736
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,920
a garage you know we lived in the

2737
01:49:46,319 --> 01:49:49,840
coastal fog layer so I had the perfect

2738
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:52,239
humidor so I could have things hanging

2739
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,000
for years and they just only get better

2740
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:55,279
so you I would go back to certain things

2741
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,880
for certain things I would go out to

2742
01:49:55,279 --> 01:50:03,118
music I would like do some GOI or there

2743
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:04,880
was that rogery Shar that I would use uh

2744
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:07,158
that I really love that just kind of

2745
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:08,960
glistened my day like barely noticeable

2746
01:50:07,158 --> 01:50:11,158
and you know I the sativa is one I

2747
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:13,880
wanted to get really out

2748
01:50:11,158 --> 01:50:15,719
there um and really get psychedelic you

2749
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:17,359
know go down to the Dome and just trip

2750
01:50:15,719 --> 01:50:18,960
out or listen to music like I would

2751
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:20,799
really I really kind of move through

2752
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:23,520
stuff but I think for right now the

2753
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:27,440
stuff that I've gone back to more than

2754
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:30,199
once was that coni Mana you know I also

2755
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:34,319
liked um I had some of Jimmy's

2756
01:50:30,198 --> 01:50:38,000
um what's uh uh Lily what is it called

2757
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:40,399
oh yeah um lily of the valley that stuff

2758
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,920
was really cool and my friend reg makes

2759
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:47,719
has this really incredible black cherya

2760
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:50,158
one that I really I really liked I tried

2761
01:50:47,719 --> 01:50:53,158
some that Filipino I tried was really

2762
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:57,238
dreamy love that on I'm trying to think

2763
01:50:53,158 --> 01:51:00,920
of some of the ones that recent notables

2764
01:50:57,238 --> 01:51:00,919
um what's in my

2765
01:51:01,158 --> 01:51:07,920
jars yeah those are the main

2766
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:09,679
ones um that I can think of that I've

2767
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:13,039
gone back to oh there's this one called

2768
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:17,158
Blue camper that I like a lot too and

2769
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:18,479
it's a ogkb orgasmatron hybrid that's

2770
01:51:17,158 --> 01:51:20,439
kind of but that's going to be I'm

2771
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:23,039
hoping that one will make it into

2772
01:51:20,439 --> 01:51:24,759
nurseries it has like a total blueberry

2773
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:27,238
can for taste and

2774
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:29,599
smell and then you know I did like I'm

2775
01:51:27,238 --> 01:51:32,439
making this uh I had a string called

2776
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:34,360
Lush it was a la pure cush that was

2777
01:51:32,439 --> 01:51:36,799
really beautiful and so I've been using

2778
01:51:34,359 --> 01:51:39,479
that one and back Crossing it back into

2779
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:42,679
the pure cush and I'm trying to make a

2780
01:51:39,479 --> 01:51:45,759
pure cush exactly looking

2781
01:51:42,679 --> 01:51:48,800
tasting um growing but growing with the

2782
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:51,440
Vigor and the strength of the LA so like

2783
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,520
a super cush like you know you're kind

2784
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:55,198
of like pure cush is such an incredible

2785
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:58,040
strain like that

2786
01:51:55,198 --> 01:52:01,279
Malibu Malibu PK like all that whole

2787
01:51:58,039 --> 01:52:03,599
kind of family whatever that um but it's

2788
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:05,639
stringy and it's kind of a pain so I'm

2789
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:08,440
trying to create I'm almost there I'm

2790
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:10,480
creating like like the Arnold Schwarz

2791
01:52:08,439 --> 01:52:12,198
Nega version like the more like pump you

2792
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:14,519
up like strong with a little bit more

2793
01:52:12,198 --> 01:52:16,839
head high and that one's been turning

2794
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,480
out nice been smoking different fenos of

2795
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:23,599
that before um

2796
01:52:19,479 --> 01:52:26,519
before left the planet

2797
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:28,039
um yeah there and I you know and I was I

2798
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:29,880
oh I went through a serious dork out

2799
01:52:28,039 --> 01:52:32,319
phase on the lavender lemonade Skittles

2800
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:35,920
when I was trying to do the selection to

2801
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:37,960
go make the Gen z h uh gen Z selection

2802
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:41,399
had to go through a bunch of those which

2803
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:43,840
was okay it was kind of cool um they

2804
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:47,439
were really flavorful what else there

2805
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:51,000
something is there anything else

2806
01:52:47,439 --> 01:52:54,118
see those are the main

2807
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,599
ones look sounds like you uh enjoy a

2808
01:52:54,118 --> 01:52:59,078
really nice variety you know from

2809
01:52:56,599 --> 01:53:02,239
between the uh the selection of the Gen

2810
01:52:59,078 --> 01:53:05,639
Z through to the the dreamy Filipino

2811
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:08,759
land race you're you're still really

2812
01:53:05,639 --> 01:53:09,800
trying a wide diversity it sounds really

2813
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:12,079
really

2814
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:14,599
interesting while we're on the topic

2815
01:53:12,078 --> 01:53:16,639
this will be our last patreon one and

2816
01:53:14,599 --> 01:53:20,078
it's the one I actually had the most

2817
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:23,679
people asking about it's now clear to me

2818
01:53:20,078 --> 01:53:27,000
that I think something has overtaken GOI

2819
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:28,319
as uh the most popular bod strain well I

2820
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,118
mean we're sort of skirting the rules

2821
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:35,359
here a bit but without a doubt the Deep

2822
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:38,799
line Alchemy Series has just become just

2823
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:40,519
huge in its cult status and the amount

2824
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:43,239
of following it's garnered over the

2825
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:45,800
years so many people just wanted to hear

2826
01:53:43,238 --> 01:53:47,439
you talk a little bit about you know

2827
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:48,960
what's sort of your Direction with it

2828
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:50,638
you know I guess sort of your your

2829
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,118
thoughts on Why You released it the

2830
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:55,719
various versions and you you know what's

2831
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:58,759
your favorite what's the Dark Horse any

2832
01:53:55,719 --> 01:54:01,560
any plans to do anything further with it

2833
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:03,440
yeah I mean the D it's such it kind of

2834
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:07,119
take on took on a life of its own you

2835
01:54:03,439 --> 01:54:09,919
know like I I don't have the that the 88

2836
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:12,839
G13 hashplant anymore like I don't have

2837
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:14,399
that mail it was retired I do have like

2838
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:15,800
all my seed work on it and all the

2839
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:18,920
different ways I took it in line so I'm

2840
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:21,920
sure I could find another mail but uh

2841
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:25,279
I've been kind of hunting for a new mail

2842
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:28,880
and I was think about like an H Al like

2843
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:32,639
an ala or an HLA like it would be a

2844
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:34,960
heirloom um line Alchemy or an ancient

2845
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:37,480
line Alchemy because I can't do da

2846
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:42,118
because that's the original

2847
01:54:37,479 --> 01:54:44,279
um yeah I mean the I would I really love

2848
01:54:42,118 --> 01:54:46,439
the that thing of allowing people to

2849
01:54:44,279 --> 01:54:47,800
kind of because they know that male so

2850
01:54:46,439 --> 01:54:50,039
well that when you pair it with

2851
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:52,880
something else it's almost like this

2852
01:54:50,039 --> 01:54:54,800
ongoing like uh like a teaching

2853
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:56,480
presentation where you can like it's

2854
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,279
interactive because it allows you to

2855
01:54:56,479 --> 01:55:01,799
really experience that clone only like

2856
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:04,880
special uh Broad

2857
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:08,520
Leaf um I think the the big run up now

2858
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:12,840
is that uh kind of Triad it's the big J

2859
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:14,840
um angel wing artifact one male I think

2860
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:17,239
may be the one but it really needs some

2861
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:20,239
testing but you know it started just as

2862
01:55:17,238 --> 01:55:23,638
a way to to get people turned on to some

2863
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:25,678
of these really cool old um broad leaves

2864
01:55:23,639 --> 01:55:27,319
you know and I uh and the funny thing is

2865
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:29,078
I think the second one was it the first

2866
01:55:27,319 --> 01:55:32,920
or second one was

2867
01:55:29,078 --> 01:55:35,920
actually it wasn't it I didn't use the

2868
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:37,359
adh3 mail I used something else and so

2869
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,760
it was it kind of threw it off in the

2870
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:41,279
beginning and there's also some

2871
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:44,880
unofficial dlas like there's wish

2872
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:46,840
Mountain which is the Afghanistan 88 G13

2873
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,400
hash so there's some that kind of there

2874
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:51,239
actually are dlas but they snuck through

2875
01:55:49,399 --> 01:55:54,719
to other ways and I wish I could kind of

2876
01:55:51,238 --> 01:55:56,638
recom find them and uh I'm just excited

2877
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:58,439
there's so many cool plants a lot of

2878
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,279
those plants I don't have anymore and

2879
01:55:58,439 --> 01:56:02,279
there's a lot of there's a few daas that

2880
01:56:00,279 --> 01:56:05,479
were never even released like there was

2881
01:56:02,279 --> 01:56:07,319
a the last one that kind I only made

2882
01:56:05,479 --> 01:56:10,799
about five packs I just gave a few packs

2883
01:56:07,319 --> 01:56:14,319
out was the like the da 17 or 18 or

2884
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:17,119
something and it was the U the SNL the

2885
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:18,960
Captain Jack Afghan the smell of SNL the

2886
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:21,078
the one the bud that they all smoked

2887
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:24,078
during that beginning of Saturday Night

2888
01:56:21,078 --> 01:56:25,639
Live Like I guess Dan Aro and all these

2889
01:56:24,078 --> 01:56:29,799
guys this is what they smoked before

2890
01:56:25,639 --> 01:56:31,840
they would go out on a and and uh film

2891
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:35,159
The Ear Le

2892
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:37,719
snls and so I made that to anything but

2893
01:56:35,158 --> 01:56:41,960
the the mom was so worn out that the

2894
01:56:37,719 --> 01:56:43,920
seeds the seed Coats were flaking off so

2895
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:46,800
I couldn't really release

2896
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:48,719
it um so I can only find like you know I

2897
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,880
only found a out of a huge bag that I

2898
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:54,279
made I think I only found like 50 seeds

2899
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:56,920
or something so that one won't get uh

2900
01:56:54,279 --> 01:57:00,439
released but maybe I'll do an F2 of that

2901
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:02,399
you know and then there's ones like um I

2902
01:57:00,439 --> 01:57:04,919
think that I don't think the ma8 the

2903
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:06,719
Hairspray the LA hairspray cush one

2904
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:11,319
never made it out and I think there's

2905
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:15,239
one or two more that didn't make it so

2906
01:57:11,319 --> 01:57:16,920
yeah DL um so yeah the D what so what a

2907
01:57:15,238 --> 01:57:19,000
cool phenomenon what a the great thing

2908
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:20,760
and I'm so stoked that people are like

2909
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,399
F2 them and getting them into and

2910
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:23,960
finding like there's a way to like

2911
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:25,679
finding their favorite dlas because

2912
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:27,000
they're all so different like some of my

2913
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:30,000
favorite ones and I know like one that

2914
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:33,158
everyone loves is I love the D four and

2915
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,719
five like I love the A1 because the very

2916
01:57:33,158 --> 01:57:37,359
first A1 because it still had the really

2917
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:39,679
rank skunky stuff and I love the da 4

2918
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:43,839
the cashmere one because it was such a

2919
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:45,440
frosty cool Plant um I love let's see

2920
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:48,159
what are some of my other favorite ones

2921
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:50,638
you know the D with the the Lebanese is

2922
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:53,359
so cool the

2923
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:55,639
um um what else there's so many there's

2924
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:59,078
the Jala there's the you know what the

2925
01:57:55,639 --> 01:58:01,440
da with the kahar black is really cool

2926
01:57:59,078 --> 01:58:05,439
too like they're also neat and it's like

2927
01:58:01,439 --> 01:58:07,399
it's almost like that just kind of it it

2928
01:58:05,439 --> 01:58:09,439
almost became its own thing like it you

2929
01:58:07,399 --> 01:58:10,879
know it's every time it's like it almost

2930
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:13,039
seemed like there was a force behind it

2931
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:15,679
that was just working with me or through

2932
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:17,800
me like somehow a new D would always

2933
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:19,880
kind of pop out you know and like oh

2934
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:21,880
cool here's the new D like and you know

2935
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:25,159
I'm so stok that people got into those

2936
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:27,118
and really kind of sad that they're done

2937
01:58:25,158 --> 01:58:29,479
but I'm also excited because people can

2938
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:31,000
F2 them and maybe I can F2 some of the

2939
01:58:29,479 --> 01:58:33,479
ones that were never released and maybe

2940
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,279
we can move into a new era I'm thinking

2941
01:58:33,479 --> 01:58:37,638
with this new Triad mail of my three

2942
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:40,840
favorite Afghans they all have such

2943
01:58:37,639 --> 01:58:42,760
unique and beautiful traits in them but

2944
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:45,039
by breaking it into threes I think

2945
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:47,800
they'll be a lot less dominant than the

2946
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:50,960
ADH G3 turn 13 hash PL that's the only

2947
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:53,639
problem I felt like with the DNA dlas

2948
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:55,560
that was a problem itic is that male

2949
01:58:53,639 --> 01:58:57,760
tended to be even though it was awesome

2950
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:59,400
and it always brought a lot to the table

2951
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:02,960
it was a little dominant you know and

2952
01:58:59,399 --> 01:59:05,039
originally the de the ADH G13 hash plant

2953
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:06,880
was a lot it was a different maale it

2954
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:08,639
was the deadly G mail that I worked a

2955
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,719
lot further into the future but it

2956
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:13,319
became so dominant that I couldn't use

2957
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:16,078
it anymore so I had to go back and find

2958
01:59:13,319 --> 01:59:17,439
a less dominant 8h G13 flash but that's

2959
01:59:16,078 --> 01:59:18,399
the one that's used that's been used in

2960
01:59:17,439 --> 01:59:21,519
almost

2961
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:23,759
everything so yeah daa is such a such a

2962
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,560
cool it's such a cool ride and I'm so

2963
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:27,119
glad to kind of been along with that and

2964
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:28,719
there's so many cool plants it's almost

2965
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:30,598
kind of like a history lesson too like I

2966
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:32,840
get to because you know when you have a

2967
01:59:30,599 --> 01:59:34,960
chronological order you get to see like

2968
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:36,119
I remember the first one and then you

2969
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,480
know through the years there's all these

2970
01:59:36,118 --> 01:59:39,960
different ones and some of the plants I

2971
01:59:37,479 --> 01:59:42,678
got and then the plants I lost and it's

2972
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:44,480
just a really cool it's just a cool

2973
01:59:42,679 --> 01:59:45,440
thing I yeah I don't know anything quite

2974
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:48,279
like

2975
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:50,238
it totally totally and that's why I

2976
01:59:48,279 --> 01:59:53,198
think it's developed such a cult status

2977
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:56,319
and people will continue you to uh dig

2978
01:59:53,198 --> 01:59:59,039
into it f to it share it and it's uh

2979
01:59:56,319 --> 02:00:00,840
it's a testament to the work I think

2980
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:03,078
we're on to the quickfire questions to

2981
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:04,880
wrap things up and uh we've got some new

2982
02:00:03,078 --> 02:00:06,719
ones since last time so the first one I

2983
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:08,679
want to ask you is I'm going to drop you

2984
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:11,198
off on a desert island you can take

2985
02:00:08,679 --> 02:00:13,078
either three clones or three packs of

2986
02:00:11,198 --> 02:00:15,238
seeds what are you going to take with

2987
02:00:13,078 --> 02:00:18,840
you to grow out forever how big is the

2988
02:00:15,238 --> 02:00:21,118
island it's huge oh nice so I can

2989
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:23,639
segregate I won't get any like what the

2990
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:26,439
I have no p clouds I can make sure

2991
02:00:23,639 --> 02:00:28,920
everything stays you're good infinite

2992
02:00:26,439 --> 02:00:31,678
infinite resources to grow as well okay

2993
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:35,279
three I that's super basic I think it's

2994
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:38,480
pretty easy I would do like a CBD Rich

2995
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:40,198
line you know maybe like like Harlequin

2996
02:00:38,479 --> 02:00:42,718
or something for health and Harmony

2997
02:00:40,198 --> 02:00:46,960
healing and then just give me like a

2998
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:49,679
just a really nice Afghan and and just

2999
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:52,399
uh a well worked Haze line and I think I

3000
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:54,560
can make just about anything sure so

3001
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:56,719
which ones are going to be the seeds oh

3002
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:58,599
all the seeds oh they're all seeds I

3003
02:00:56,719 --> 02:00:59,920
love it perfect I'm not risking clones

3004
02:00:58,599 --> 02:01:02,520
on this island

3005
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,279
for there you go good good idea good

3006
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:08,000
idea I love it you just recreate

3007
02:01:04,279 --> 02:01:10,198
everything with that yeah why not that's

3008
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,479
perfect that's perfect all righty next

3009
02:01:10,198 --> 02:01:16,078
one is uh if you had to restart the

3010
02:01:13,479 --> 02:01:19,319
entire company all of the companies with

3011
02:01:16,078 --> 02:01:22,759
just one pack of seeds which pack would

3012
02:01:19,319 --> 02:01:24,880
you take oh I would you know I would

3013
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:26,760
probably that's a tough one I would

3014
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,039
probably start it with like it's either

3015
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:31,520
Goji or Sunshine Daydream like I think

3016
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:33,479
GOI I think I would like that's a great

3017
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:35,520
starting point I just it's just such a

3018
02:01:33,479 --> 02:01:38,598
great feel good

3019
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:40,760
strain perfect and then you know sort of

3020
02:01:38,599 --> 02:01:43,480
similar but slightly different without

3021
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:46,000
being able to know any details about the

3022
02:01:43,479 --> 02:01:47,399
person what's one strain of your work

3023
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:49,880
that you would recommend that you just

3024
02:01:47,399 --> 02:01:52,359
think you know people are going to like

3025
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:54,520
it people will like it I don't know I

3026
02:01:52,359 --> 02:01:56,598
think Congo cashmir is pretty digestible

3027
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:59,440
to just about anything I really like

3028
02:01:56,599 --> 02:02:01,360
that one um something that everybody

3029
02:01:59,439 --> 02:02:03,719
would like

3030
02:02:01,359 --> 02:02:05,799
though yeah it's got to hit every kind

3031
02:02:03,719 --> 02:02:09,840
of

3032
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:12,320
pallet okay I'm gonna say cono

3033
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:16,199
cashmir yeah that's a good pick I I

3034
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:17,078
