oh good because but uh yeah i happen to

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,920
have

58
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,759
a little bit of that and i

59
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,719
i'm just picking that as a really good

60
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,878
favorite

61
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:26,560
it's really good smoke

62
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:29,359
i love dynasty so um

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,959
his smoke just stands out

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,879
hell yeah i can definitely agree with

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,560
you on that one let's loop back to that

66
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,919
one a bit later because the first thing

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,360
i wanted to ask you is what was your

68
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,359
first experience with cannabis

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,280
that's funny too they're uh

70
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,239
you know i was a bad kid so

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,000
about fifth grade

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,400
when uh you know all the kids are

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,639
starting to score cigarettes and stuff a

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,800
friend of mine's dad had a little

75
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,279
uh wasn't convenience store it was like

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,280
a country store and he lifted uh

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,360
like cartons of the worst thing in the

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,080
world was i think camels or whatever it

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,840
was was horrible strong tobacco and we'd

80
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,159
get it together after school and you

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,200
know smoke a couple but it turned me

82
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,719
green

83
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,119
and they uh

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,719
they tended to keep smoking and i found

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,680
out that um

86
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,840
you know pot at the time was like real

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,519
weedy and it's

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,519
around i think it's probably

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
right about 80

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,640
a little bit earlier than 80 78 but uh

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,878
you know my mom had a friend

92
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,719
and uh he'd give me

93
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,158
ounces or not at the you know they

94
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,199
called it lids at the time it was five

95
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,598
to ten bucks a lid i'd have him uh

96
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:47,199
he'd get me to roll and clean it up and

97
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:49,679
roll like you know 35 40 uh

98
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,679
doobies out of uh out of a lid you give

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
me a one or two

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,799
so i smoked that it was just such swaggy

101
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:59,039
weed i never ever really got high

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,120
and um i thought i was getting high just

103
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,798
like a real poor

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
butt every time but

105
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,680
i guess i was around 12 years old and i

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,519
babysit for a friend

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,879
my mom's friends and i don't want to be

108
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,959
stereotypical but they were bikers and

109
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,639
they had some bud they knew that i'd

110
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,759
already smoked and they said it would be

111
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,478
cool to try it they gave me a bud

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,479
and it was chocolate thai for all i can

113
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,719
tell from everything i've ever seen

114
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,120
later in my life it was real chocolate

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,080
thai it was all uh basically right off

116
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,759
the thai stick and uh i pulled the seeds

117
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,199
out of it and i smoked it but it stuff

118
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,439
that hit me

119
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
and i was like euphorically high for

120
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,639
four or five hours shouldn't have been

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,040
babysitting their kids because it was

122
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,800
like super potent so then i realized

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,080
that uh

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,400
what part really was

125
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,560
yeah wow and has that always left that

126
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,839
as kind of having a little fond spot in

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,519
your heart do you want to ever go back

128
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,560
to that

129
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,719
uh it really does because the uh it's a

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,038
rarity though chocolate thai

131
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,160
and that certain uh flavor that was on

132
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:09,519
that it was a leathery tobacco-y uh

133
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,199
chocolaty flavor and

134
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,439
if i could have just had or had the

135
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,080
knowledge or any kind of sense to keep

136
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,918
those seeds man it's insane how many uh

137
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,120
you know pounds of seeds have gone down

138
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,198
the

139
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,120
into the waste because at the time all

140
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,439
the import was just seed bud and we

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,840
never thought we would want the

142
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,079
genetics

143
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,560
yeah definitely and i mean just as a

144
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,279
little random side question do you think

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,918
it's true that there ever was tai coming

146
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,198
in that had like been altered with opium

147
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,839
or anything like that you always hear

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,840
the whispers

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,639
this uh

150
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,679
i don't know that economically would be

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,840
viable uh for them to do that but i do

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,400
believe it had to have happened because

153
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,519
there was uh

154
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,758
it was talked about for sure

155
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,799
i do believe there was opium

156
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,960
uh dusted uh

157
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,120
it said opium dipped he knows what they

158
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,120
call it but it was it was basically uh

159
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,759
a very potent

160
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,519
psychoactive uh product so uh

161
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,680
i never really got my hands on it but i

162
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,758
know people that they swear that it was

163
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
uh certainly the real deal and it came

164
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,360
in

165
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,279
yeah definitely i've heard an anecdotal

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
story from a friend who

167
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,638
said that one of the only times he'd

168
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,639
ever greened out was from

169
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,160
uh some like you know some thai stick

170
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,360
and and to me that it always gave a

171
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
little bit of credence to the idea

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,919
because a lot of people when they first

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,918
have opioids they vomit

174
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,599
yeah certainly uh

175
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,439
it it'll take over your whole uh system

176
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,199
so you're not ready to

177
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,879
be hit by a truck and that's what hits

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,199
you

179
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,598
yeah so with all that being said have

180
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,759
you ever looked at some of the kind of

181
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,439
notable thai hybrids and thought oh i

182
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,000
want to get into that like for example

183
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,000
maybe haze given it was like 50 tie at

184
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,720
the end

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,839
you know it's always been

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,880
a big challenge up here

187
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,959
for um outdoor growing

188
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,839
is really a challenge up here so our

189
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,519
summers are harsh and short so

190
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,598
if you're going to do light depth in

191
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,839
greenhouse you uh you have to have a

192
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:27,038
program for it it's just devoted to it

193
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:29,279
for colombians or ties so uh

194
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,800
it's not an impossible thing but most

195
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,359
that's one of the things i've put off

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,560
the most i've hardly ever grown a very

197
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,360
very little haze due to that it's hard

198
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,680
to

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,720
it's hard to grow it up here

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,240
but i have i've always

201
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
been super fond of that and want to

202
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,519
relive it and i've i've smoked like

203
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
bodies uh you know really good 16-week

204
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,318
tie

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,439
at emerald

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,240
and uh

207
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,000
it's got a really similar high

208
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,598
but it wasn't that exact same thing that

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
i'd smoked before so yeah i'd always

210
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,319
like to relive that

211
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,918
yeah certainly i think i know the tie

212
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,598
you were talking about it was that that

213
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,359
pearl tie with like the alternating

214
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,759
calyxes

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,199
yeah it was it was kind of yellowish and

216
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,038
uh brown uh not yellowish but um

217
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,520
amberish i should say

218
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,159
and uh brown

219
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,399
and it was just hamstrings tied onto it

220
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,439
onto a uh

221
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,038
bamboo splint is what it was so

222
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,560
they they tore it off for me and

223
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,278
actually gave it to me and i broke it up

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,519
but it it it had

225
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,679
qualities and tastes that just

226
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,719
i don't know that will ever be refound

227
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,958
so

228
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,399
yeah i'm chasing that rabbit for sure

229
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,879
yeah it definitely sounds very

230
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,480
interesting let's take it back though

231
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,799
let's start off at that point where you

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,039
tried the tie from that point onwards

233
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,639
what made you or were the factors that

234
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,319
led to you then deciding to grow

235
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,039
yourself and how long did it take before

236
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
you did do that

237
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,759
it took me a little while about three

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,240
years before i uh realized that you

239
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,000
could grow at that point there wasn't a

240
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,720
ton of information

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,799
i probably accidentally sprouted a seed

242
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,320
and

243
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,079
went from there but

244
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
at the time

245
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,480
after 75

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,559
the uh here in alaska the there was a

247
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,839
supreme court decision

248
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,759
with the state of alaska supreme court

249
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,800
and it was called the raven

250
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,919
uh decision and it legalized uh personal

251
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,879
use cannabis here so there was a lot of

252
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,360
ornamental kind of like shrubbery

253
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,519
seeds being thrown out and you could see

254
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,680
people growing uh leaf

255
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,440
type of plants they never flower because

256
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,199
they're summers about 21 22 hours and

257
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,440
sunlight just blaring and then it'll

258
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,920
like shut off to nothing and freeze so

259
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,519
the plants will just start to sex and

260
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,759
maybe three weeks in the flower they'll

261
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,839
just freeze out it'll be solid winter

262
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,838
from then so

263
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,560
the

264
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,800
uh

265
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,319
i was always thinking about growing and

266
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,838
it took me about three years before i

267
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
realized it was just something easy to

268
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
do

269
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,399
yeah okay and so a lot of people outside

270
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,719
the states may not be aware that alaska

271
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,720
legalized or decriminalized

272
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,120
growing very early on compared to say

273
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,200
california and commonly i get it here

274
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,200
told in the context of yeah they were

275
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
almost trying to invite people up there

276
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,120
you know get the population boosted was

277
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,320
that the reason behind it and did it

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,839
work

279
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
you know it was kind of like opened up

280
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,120
to be a free

281
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,759
free state and um

282
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,480
just uh it wasn't like a move that a lot

283
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,759
of people would have took took this took

284
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,278
up i don't think

285
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,679
but uh

286
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,559
it was viewed as more of a freedom type

287
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,239
of a state and uh what it what the what

288
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,599
happened with the supreme court ruling

289
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,079
is it said that

290
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,000
the right to privacy was stronger than

291
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,078
the fact that marijuana was illegal so

292
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,879
you could have four ounces in your house

293
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,159
and up to 16 plants so

294
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,639
it was just like

295
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,838
so common and when you're having the

296
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,639
mindset of it being legal they did have

297
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,120
illegalities on it which was

298
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,199
transportation and selling of it but you

299
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,799
could gift it

300
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,519
you could never transport it so you know

301
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,838
they'd get you on that uh which was

302
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,720
really silly but

303
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,920
it was so commonplace to just grow

304
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,240
that uh

305
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,439
nobody there was a paranoia for sure

306
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,159
because there was apparent there was

307
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,399
federal uh rules that came into play

308
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,879
after 24 plants you'd be into like

309
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,000
federal felony land and

310
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:46,240
you just didn't want to go there

311
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,759
yeah most certainly so what was your

312
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
first setup like back then when you

313
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,720
first started

314
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,159
well outdoor sun

315
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,879
and uh

316
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,120
i knew about light depth at the time so

317
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,278
you try to just get it in

318
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,799
in september and start covering it up

319
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,720
for

320
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,240
three weeks advanced before the weather

321
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,240
really turns on you and uh

322
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,919
and i wasn't

323
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,679
we had crappy lights and and uh

324
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,799
certainly halides had just come out but

325
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:21,838
i didn't have a penny for them so

326
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,278
i used the eight foot uh high output

327
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
fluorescent lights which is pretty

328
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,799
common grow light back then

329
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,120
and uh super inefficient and

330
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,359
you'd get real stretchy plants and

331
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,278
besides the genetics were you know i

332
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,039
tried to grow colombian inside and end

333
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,958
up being 12 feet tall

334
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,838
sideways and

335
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,000
i realized real quickly that

336
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,399
we had to have something better going on

337
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,799
than that so it i learned very quickly

338
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,480
so what type of genetics did you look to

339
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,719
that would be more well suited to the

340
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,240
environment

341
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,240
well there was plenty of uh

342
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,519
you know by mid 80s there was plenty of

343
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:06,799
indica that was going around so

344
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,519
up here especially there's always been a

345
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,519
ton of local indicas that were never

346
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,039
named and

347
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,799
if you were going to grow indoor in a

348
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,958
light depth you would get something like

349
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,639
the northern lights

350
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,278
northern lights number one was super

351
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,320
common from about 80

352
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,078
to 85 and uh

353
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,240
there was others that weren't named but

354
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,638
they were just about the same three foot

355
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,120
to four foot tall maximum

356
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,519
bushy christmas tree shaped

357
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,639
solids really solid could support

358
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,839
themselves you know they'd support

359
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,480
their their bud which was heavy

360
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,480
and it'd always be mold resistant and

361
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,800
tended to be

362
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,278
just pretty good straight up easy to

363
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,399
grow indoors so that's that's what we

364
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,439
kind of

365
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,278
aim for pretty quickly

366
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,600
and this this might be a silly question

367
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,679
to some people but i've always wondered

368
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,680
you know given the name northern lights

369
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,439
do you think that there was some sort of

370
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,838
breeding effort put into the actual

371
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,279
northern lights up around the alaska

372
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,160
canadian area or do you think it was

373
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,639
purely just a marketing name

374
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,639
it had to have been a uh a marketing

375
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,959
name either i think it was developed in

376
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,600
the northwest in the seattle area much

377
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,879
more so than it was ever past british

378
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,120
columbia

379
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,600
so i don't think it was up here it only

380
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,278
it only made its way up here

381
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,759
but uh

382
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,120
by the time i saw it it was a mainstay

383
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,120
so

384
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,120
the the name stuck and uh

385
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,559
really really uh probably one of the

386
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,198
best things that ever happened to the

387
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,119
cannabis and that we've come across so

388
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,278
far

389
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,198
yeah most certainly so

390
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,120
let's fast forward a little bit when did

391
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,719
you decide to have a whack at breeding

392
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,560
yourself and what was the first thing

393
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,278
you ever made was it an accident or was

394
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,278
it purposeful

395
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,600
the first time i ever tried to breed now

396
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,560
would probably been um

397
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,240
i've been about 8 18 or 19. i just

398
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,078
thought uh

399
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,720
thought it was a way to advance

400
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,879
any uh any way to get genetics because

401
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,759
there just wasn't seed stock available

402
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,439
so

403
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,600
i would take

404
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,000
whatever uh so-and-so's

405
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,600
feve from from usually it was like

406
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,600
trailer park genetics and

407
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,120
i would cross it over to whatever other

408
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,240
one might have you know uh red petioles

409
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,399
uh stem and uh i would just start making

410
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,759
crosses just by cool looks and smells

411
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,958
right off the bat that was kind of like

412
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,560
my goal

413
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,039
try to breed the best of the best of

414
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:46,879
whatever we could find and

415
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:48,958
give it a test run that next batch

416
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,838
and what was the consumer market like at

417
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,439
the time like did you do it because you

418
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,880
knew that it would be unique people

419
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
would want to try it or there wasn't

420
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,679
that much push from consumers to say

421
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,919
develop new things

422
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,239
you know up here uh

423
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,159
there was no market such like that um

424
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,639
everybody grew their own smoke or you

425
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,639
would bomb it off with somebody that

426
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,079
that happened to have plenty excess of

427
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,639
smoke

428
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,278
uh so it was it was pretty clandestine

429
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,440
gardens but everybody knew each other

430
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,559
and they knew where there was a supply

431
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
of bud around and

432
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,599
we uh

433
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,160
they're really i don't even remember

434
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,560
even selling any bud until like the late

435
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,600
80s you know it was it was pretty unique

436
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,679
where we were just growing it

437
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,000
okay so the scene sounds like it was

438
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,439
kind of focused around the grower what

439
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,120
were the things people were most

440
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,240
interested in was it like as a grower

441
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,600
were people just interested in the

442
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
biggest yielding or was it more a

443
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,159
quality focus

444
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,920
yeah it was definitely uh

445
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,159
i'd say a lot of it had to have been

446
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,399
with yield because nobody uh [ __ ] there

447
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,198
was a lot of still a lot of people not

448
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,078
having uh nice big grown rooms there was

449
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,758
a lot of basements that were dug out you

450
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,599
know when they're growing under the

451
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,519
rafters and

452
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,318
you might get a five-foot ceiling out of

453
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:11,038
that so people were growing

454
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,798
good stocky ass plants and try to get

455
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,838
good yield but

456
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,720
i don't think that we ever

457
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,879
never

458
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,279
ever gave up but had just quality i

459
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,039
don't think nobody ever looked any other

460
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,918
direction but quality

461
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,720
it sounds like the dream almost

462
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,360
well it's kind of crazy it's crazy

463
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,679
because people did focus their own goals

464
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,038
for their own purposes

465
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,640
and uh

466
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,400
everybody basically wanted to make

467
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,038
themselves happy so

468
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,960
before all the competitive uh brand

469
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,079
naming and uh

470
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,079
so-and-so's bud is better than so and so

471
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,639
it was like a cooperative thing and

472
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,119
people were really just trying to

473
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,200
extend the good feeling of the 70s kind

474
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,000
of

475
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,519
yeah okay and so were there any breeders

476
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,519
at that time who you were kind of

477
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,639
looking up to or you were inspired by or

478
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,480
was it still a bit too early for that

479
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,799
uh still a little bit early for that

480
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
there was no advertised breeders and

481
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,160
that

482
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
the very first that i had ever heard of

483
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,240
was

484
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,558
navel schoenlocker over in

485
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
amsterdam in 88

486
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,480
it opened up you know a whole new world

487
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,279
when i realized that there was genetics

488
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,279
that could be

489
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,120
just picked up from a collector

490
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:34,000
yeah and so this is a question i i love

491
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,000
to ask people where do you hold neville

492
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,079
in the hierarchy of breeders throughout

493
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,200
history is he numero uno for you

494
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:46,480
you know that's uh

495
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,798
i'd say uh yes because when we were

496
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,558
first involved with them my

497
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,119
partner who's one of the best guys in

498
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:56,399
the world uh and i don't deal with him

499
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,879
and haven't for 30 years or better he uh

500
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,080
he would hand write letters to

501
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
neville and uh

502
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,599
he would it would be you know it might

503
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:09,199
be a two three month process to get a

504
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:12,000
return reply but he was steering us and

505
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,200
telling us and

506
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,160
he's like like such a great mentor and

507
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,960
uh

508
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,600
so in that aspect he didn't just collect

509
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,600
and breed but he wanted to spread the

510
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:27,359
knowledge so i would say he is

511
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,199
yeah most certainly i love that little

512
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,000
bit of aussie pride in that question but

513
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,080
um

514
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,679
so something i wanted to touch on

515
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,918
quickly was when i spoke to him in

516
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,240
person you mentioned this idea of like

517
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,160
up in alaska you guys were very isolated

518
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,079
and you kind of were okay with that in a

519
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,640
way would you mind expanding a little

520
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,639
more on that

521
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,080
we were

522
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,759
you know isolated in quite a bit of ways

523
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,759
to where

524
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,079
we didn't get imports

525
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,079
and when they did make it up here

526
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,558
i would say it'd be a 10-year

527
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,839
hiatus and it might have made itself all

528
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,960
the way around the world before it

529
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,279
actually hit to alaska or

530
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,519
the local region and outlawing you know

531
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,918
towns so

532
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,839
it was um

533
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,520
it was well proven by the time it got

534
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:20,399
here or it would have just faded out and

535
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,400
uh

536
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,200
when you think about our uh our

537
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,600
isolation it it made us a lot better

538
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,440
growers because there would be like

539
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,558
there's still things that were developed

540
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,120
up here

541
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:36,558
uh multiple named things that are just

542
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,879
like legends and still up here and um

543
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,119
the same old heads have got them and

544
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,039
still don't generally put it out or even

545
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:44,079
care to

546
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,558
and

547
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,720
it's amazing that the mentality is is

548
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,639
still nearly the same for 30 and 40

549
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,038
years the people have

550
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,480
kind of kept the mains the same mindset

551
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,480
so it's it's a unique thing

552
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,080
certainly and so

553
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,798
do you think that's still the case does

554
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,639
the

555
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,038
the hype strains make it up there or is

556
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,080
there still that time lag

557
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,079
no now as uh

558
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,480
like you and i are

559
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:14,480
you know different sides of the world

560
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,120
it's uh

561
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,599
technology is just here

562
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,959
you know i had a couple years ago taken

563
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,639
uh

564
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,919
live cuts

565
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,200
to

566
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,080
emerald

567
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,319
and was actually stopped

568
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,720
by the tsa there are flagged i should

569
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,960
say and then our airport police wanted

570
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,720
to interview me and

571
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,880
it got down to where they when they

572
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,400
wanted to know how much flour i had and

573
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
how much concentrate and then they

574
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,120
wanted to know the weight of all the 100

575
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,720
seed packs i carried and i i had come up

576
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,319
with the right answers

577
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,038
you know he asked me where my medical

578
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,399
growth permit was and i told him

579
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:53,919
it was supposed to stay in the groin

580
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,400
you're not supposed to copy it or it's

581
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,038
fine it's in invalid

582
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,200
everything just was the right answer and

583
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,640
i was under the weight limit for caring

584
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,319
and then he just says okay well what

585
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,240
about the live

586
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,558
cannabis plants and i said well as far

587
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,519
as i'm concerned the law says you can

588
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,519
carry six plants and the tsa

589
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,440
says whatever the state legal limit is

590
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,158
is what you can carry so

591
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,960
he you know he ran me for priors i had

592
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,880
no priors and he's like

593
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,120
okay well if this is all the medication

594
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,039
you need then we'll have a you know have

595
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,079
a good trip and you just like let us

596
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,079
straight go on our way so at that point

597
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,918
and just like you can go to emerald if

598
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,759
you're brave enough to buy uh

599
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,038
you know clones that are available down

600
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,720
there

601
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,679
you can just straight pick up any strain

602
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,000
and bring it back hype strain or

603
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,960
maybe heirloom or

604
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
and then

605
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,759
clone shipping

606
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,880
is

607
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,119
not a

608
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,640
big thing now it tends to be that

609
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,199
anybody that

610
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,640
has access to good genetics

611
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
you can just get it shipped straight to

612
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
you

613
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,240
and

614
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,000
now uh the door is wide open for

615
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,880
genetics up here every day i think

616
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,240
there's

617
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,679
20 new strains coming up here

618
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,359
it's interesting you mention that

619
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,880
because i'm not sure if it was you i was

620
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,079
talking to about this or someone else

621
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,080
but they said

622
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,759
there was a little bit of finickiness

623
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,000
with the clone shipping compared to say

624
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,599
other states in that say you sent it on

625
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,919
the friday and it was going to sit

626
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,678
somewhere over the weekend not only is

627
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,600
that you know not ideal for the clone

628
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,159
but given if it was winter time it could

629
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,000
potentially kill the clone is that a bit

630
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,720
of an overstated fact or is that very

631
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,119
much the reality of the situation

632
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,360
it's pretty common that um you could run

633
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,639
into small glitches i've had

634
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,479
you know half dozen or more uh packages

635
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
that would maybe hit during the

636
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,839
california

637
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,599
two or three years in a row man they

638
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,399
were hit with the fires then they were

639
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,158
hit with drought and flood and

640
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,120
they'd shut down county roads and

641
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,320
certain

642
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,319
outlying

643
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,399
towns they might not get a three-day

644
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:01,278
priority package you could generally

645
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,120
send a clone three days safely in a

646
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:06,960
clone porter or a clone chipper and

647
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,879
they'll make it but on the seventh day

648
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,440
they don't like to be in the dark that

649
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,278
long and i've had i've had them just one

650
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,600
after the other going to

651
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,599
even

652
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,480
like bob hemphill and the nature farm

653
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,158
and they'd get them and they'd be just

654
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,319
seven days they'd be yellow as hell and

655
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,278
droopy and ready just to die and no way

656
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,359
you're gonna

657
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,599
not gonna talk them back into life and

658
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,319
then in the summertime i think it's

659
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:34,158
better to ship in the cool season truly

660
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,918
we don't have bad luck in the cool in

661
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,919
the summertime it tends to sweat the

662
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,720
plants a lot more so if you're going to

663
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,880
send them dry tech just snips or fresh

664
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,480
cut tips you know

665
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,400
the dry tech

666
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,319
it works to a certain degree but if they

667
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,720
start to sweat it'll just cook the

668
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,839
foliage and it'll be wilted lettuce or

669
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,159
worse every time

670
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,278
yes certainly i guess it brings its own

671
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,520
challenges

672
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,440
you mentioned a minute ago that some

673
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,918
really old school really awesome strains

674
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,400
were developed up in alaska and they're

675
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,840
still being held by the locals up there

676
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,840
brings us to the question that everyone

677
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,759
knew was coming what's the story behind

678
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,319
alaskan thunder [ __ ] or matanuska

679
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,558
[ __ ]

680
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,079
yeah we know we know that was coming but

681
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,240
uh

682
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,759
there's a lot of stories behind it

683
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,240
so

684
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,480
the experience that i've had with it

685
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,640
was the

686
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,200
1970s and the mid 70s

687
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,759
quite a few uh northern california

688
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,440
emerald triangle uh people whether they

689
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,278
were coming back from vietnam at that

690
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,880
exact point or getting

691
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,319
at the end of the war about 1774

692
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
they didn't want to go into that

693
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,918
conflict so some of them went to canada

694
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,600
and some of them ditched out and came up

695
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,278
here and it's a it's a i'm not going to

696
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,240
say there's a bunch of draft dodgers

697
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,319
that just

698
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,919
that filled our state but there was a

699
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,918
lot of people that were you know

700
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
patriotic minded but didn't want to go

701
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,278
and uh

702
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,480
fight for some political cause that had

703
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,319
no no wind to it so they they uprooted

704
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,558
and they came up here and what they

705
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,079
brought was um

706
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:09,678
some bud that was you know it could have

707
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,720
been

708
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,480
originally burmese or crosses of their

709
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,360
import bud that they were growing down

710
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,599
in trinity and and humbled but

711
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,558
it didn't work up here so

712
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,199
within i'd say four or five years there

713
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,599
was no more that tall

714
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,360
structural uh

715
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,079
equatorial i'd say

716
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,599
lowland type of uh

717
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,158
flower upping there was they would

718
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,240
basically outcross it to

719
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,440
the best fastest shortest most

720
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,440
controllable grow plant there is so

721
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,640
a lot of the sativa genetics went out

722
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,960
with it by

723
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,759
1980. there was there was hardly any of

724
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,759
it to be found

725
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,400
interesting and so what's the plant like

726
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,000
itself is it is it more of a stocky one

727
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,519
as you just implied and what's the kind

728
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,519
of the flavor and the highlight

729
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,840
ours stands as uh we have a very old

730
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,240
cutting that

731
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:11,599
uh i started my job currently right now

732
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,079
in 87 and my foreman at the time

733
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,798
is where i got this and he had it at the

734
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:20,639
time growing in a quonset head so

735
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,798
it puts it at over 33 34 years old

736
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,799
and

737
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,759
the

738
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,038
plant as it stands these guys never cut

739
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:32,558
it was a cutting and it's amazing

740
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:34,960
they had it been taken bottom cuts for

741
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,879
decades on the plant and uh it started

742
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,720
getting a lot of generational

743
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,200
drift and uh

744
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,120
getting really sluggish and uh

745
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,360
woodier and woodier and they didn't have

746
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,759
any common sense to like regenerate that

747
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,479
plant in the sun or

748
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,079
you know try to advance the

749
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,240
upper growth and take cuts and get

750
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,759
better healthier cuts so

751
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,399
about

752
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,200
a long time they grew it like that and

753
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:00,959
it

754
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,038
you know it's an indica and it once it

755
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,319
are not an indica it grows like like an

756
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:09,519
affy type of a plant and

757
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,119
it'll get real thick solid base that

758
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,440
could go to two and three inches even

759
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,199
indoor gets this monster base on

760
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,720
it supports great

761
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,080
great amount of bud

762
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,240
it's uh you know super crystally

763
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,678
and it smells like

764
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,558
sweet wine and sweet chocolate it's kind

765
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,120
of a crazy combination because it's like

766
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,960
sangria wine and uh hershey's chocolate

767
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,879
bars with the terps are on it and it

768
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,240
tastes like that too

769
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,919
so um it's a real unique plant but i've

770
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,359
delving into it now by uh

771
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,880
making

772
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:49,678
bat crosses of itself and i dug into it

773
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,760
and we're finding that the uh

774
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,240
the sativa hybrids are still in there

775
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,519
just it laid dormant in there nobody

776
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,599
really wanted to deal with it now

777
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,839
there's a point to where

778
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,240
i've sent it to uh

779
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,918
you know a couple of guys to play with

780
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,159
like

781
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,559
uh deadpan head and two-tone willy and

782
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,200
they came out with a lot more

783
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,119
hybrid types not as much as the standing

784
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,519
happy that she is so

785
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,519
and i have to i've come up with really

786
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,599
really cool hybrids that and i've even

787
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,038
pulled pure skunk out of it i've

788
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,000
collected a male that's just the

789
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,278
heaviest pure skunk so

790
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,599
um

791
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:33,599
it's it's crazy to think what could

792
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:35,439
really be dug up out of the matt newsday

793
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,119
so i guess kind of the last question on

794
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,038
this one is do you think that it was

795
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,879
kind of developed in like a communal

796
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,480
sense kind of in the way that like skunk

797
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,919
was initially developed and if you had

798
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,599
to take a guess what do you think are

799
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,559
some of the genetics in there i mean you

800
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:51,199
mentioned the burmese and the affy

801
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,200
i would just equate it to being

802
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,080
a pure

803
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,519
trinity county and humboldt we the

804
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:02,879
flavors are right there real real close

805
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,000
when i used to [ __ ] let's see 1980 you

806
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,159
know humboldt

807
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,200
we would just get bud called humboldt

808
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,039
and uh

809
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,240
it was just a really

810
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,558
killer sweet affy is basically what it

811
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,319
was and you'd get some uh

812
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,639
interesting terps every which way but it

813
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,678
wasn't super skunky or anything it was

814
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,520
just like great great flower like the

815
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,798
like the best cushions that you can get

816
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,319
now

817
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:29,359
and i think that's uh half of the

818
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:33,200
genetics and then

819
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,839
there there has to be some uh

820
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,120
thai in there and

821
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:39,519
burmese because the

822
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,759
what what's coming out of it now is uh

823
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,480
is pretty uniquely

824
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,960
different than the way she stands

825
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,640
yeah okay well if we jump to another

826
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,399
kind of old australian that i know

827
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,159
you've got in the collection tell us a

828
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,839
little bit about your cat piss i wasn't

829
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,240
aware that you actually had that one but

830
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,000
i am aware that they tend to there's a

831
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,278
lot of them basically your cat piss

832
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,038
probably isn't the same as someone

833
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,000
else's so would you mind giving us a bit

834
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,278
of backstory on your one

835
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,919
yeah the uh

836
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:12,240
cat piss just came our way from imported

837
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,720
puna bud that came shrink wrap from

838
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,159
probably the very first seal of meal in

839
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,919
the world uh right around

840
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,840
85 we were getting just uh some import

841
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,360
bud from hawaii

842
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,359
of all things

843
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,359
and uh

844
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,678
it was some of the best flower that

845
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,759
we've ever smoked too real comparable to

846
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,000
i would say the uh

847
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,519
the what we would call humboldt it was

848
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,519
just a fantastic uh

849
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,759
indica though it was a kush so um

850
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,038
but

851
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:51,519
it had the craziest terps to it so

852
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:53,679
we just bred it to northern lights and

853
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,960
for years we had it

854
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,240
and it is still a super unique type of a

855
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,440
plant it's uh

856
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,679
it for whatever reason grows much more

857
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,600
sativa she'll have a very long middle

858
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,320
finger that's about

859
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,599
one third longer or two up to twice as

860
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,798
long as

861
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,599
all the others in the pattern and

862
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,759
it'll grow into this crazy

863
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,558
sativa looking bush

864
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:27,599
and i've got it in a probably

865
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:30,558
f2 f3 and then bxes and bx23

866
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,599
and 4 but i recently you know outcrossed

867
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,558
it

868
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,879
to a really ranked

869
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:40,879
uh catfist that came from california el

870
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,399
jefe gardens he has a

871
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,399
haze that was total cat piss uh indica

872
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,239
haze that uh

873
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,599
is just about it'll make your eyes water

874
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,038
when you're dealing with it when you're

875
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,558
uh

876
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,319
in the flower form

877
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:58,240
so it's it's really pungent ammoniated

878
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,879
ours is slightly sweeter

879
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,200
but super ammoniated so we couldn't help

880
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,200
but you know put it together and

881
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,558
i think there needs to be a lot more of

882
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,558
the old-fashioned uh

883
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,960
combinations of that terpene being

884
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,639
brought back our hawaiian did have real

885
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,440
unique thin

886
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,880
leafs the leaf isn't thick like it like

887
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,399
a indica leaf it's much thinner uh

888
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
and uh

889
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,518
it's a lighter green by far than most

890
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,759
any indica but uh the bud that we did

891
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,519
get for certain was a

892
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,359
really good indica and that's what they

893
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,278
called it too was hawaiian indica so

894
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,119
i've always just called it the hawaiian

895
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,440
indica but uh

896
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,439
as i'm getting to do a lot more digging

897
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,399
into it i'm coming up with a lot more

898
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,558
sativa hybrids

899
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:49,038
yeah okay very interesting quick shout

900
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,519
out to el jefe great guy one thing i

901
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,359
wanted to ask you though was that you

902
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,679
know this this idea of having these

903
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,079
clones for a while is pretty common

904
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,600
within your collection how do you keep

905
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,918
these clones for so long you know it

906
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,199
seems so common for people to just lose

907
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,120
clones over the years and you've got

908
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,918
like 30 plus year old clones

909
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,878
you have to uh farm

910
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:16,319
you keep you keep about five

911
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:18,799
plants with your trusted group

912
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,039
and hopefully uh everybody can cover

913
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,960
each other's bases

914
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,800
because certainly we've all we've all

915
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,320
had situations where we've lost our

916
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,119
mothers

917
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,000
and

918
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,159
my biggest advantage to saving genetics

919
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,398
was not necessarily

920
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,280
keeping a clone alive the whole time i

921
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,598
have a lot of old old old cuttings but

922
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,599
i've got a lot of old old old seeds we

923
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,919
would produce it in the late 80s and

924
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,960
early 90s and i would just preserve it

925
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,799
and

926
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,480
i can go back on it you know at any

927
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,960
point in time

928
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,838
and generally have a

929
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,240
very high success rate just to reproduce

930
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,920
what we were dealing with 30 30 plus

931
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,799
years ago

932
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,358
yeah okay so on the topic of 30 plus

933
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,280
years ago let's talk about that epic old

934
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,480
school northern lights freezer beans i

935
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,320
know you've got a few different freezer

936
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,240
beans but fill me on this one because i

937
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,359
believe your one was different to the

938
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,358
one coastal worked with

939
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,920
it is different um and it's the same too

940
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,200
what mine is is uh

941
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,800
85

942
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,319
just the standby

943
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,920
typical northern lights one that was

944
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,800
going around

945
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,800
and it was uh just fantastic in every

946
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,880
way i don't think that i still think if

947
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,640
it came out today it would just beat the

948
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,680
[ __ ] out of cookies everybody would just

949
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,000
go wow

950
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,000
such a complex uh

951
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,159
old school hide to it and then the

952
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,239
flavors and

953
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,239
the look and bag of peel covers anything

954
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,559
that the cookies and all of the thousand

955
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:52,319
cookies crosses are so

956
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:54,719
uh i had the 85 cut and then in 89 we

957
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,119
purchased the uh skunk

958
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,919
i mean sorry the nl1 from

959
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,320
from scentsy and it was one of our four

960
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,240
picks that year in 89

961
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,079
and it's a three times

962
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,319
inbred

963
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,160
so where his was uh

964
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,240
you know back crossed

965
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:17,440
to be extremely fast 45 days super stout

966
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:20,639
super resistant to uh molds and uh it's

967
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,920
almost a bulletproof type of a plant

968
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,639
and uh i crossed a male to my female

969
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,159
cutting and we just had seeds of it so

970
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,559
at the you know i'd grow out the seeds

971
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,279
for sure but i crossed i put them up to

972
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,159
f2 and f3 and then i'd frozen a ton of

973
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,359
it

974
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,039
and uh what i think that coastal

975
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,880
cague's

976
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,119
nl1 is the same thing

977
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,200
i'm thinking it's the exact same 85 cut

978
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,838
that i had but uh

979
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:50,960
different phenotype his has a lot of the

980
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:53,440
terpenoline and spray paint phenos

981
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,519
but it still has the same uh

982
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,440
everything on it is identical the resin

983
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,800
the look the structure

984
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,358
um

985
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,960
it's uh it's a real unique type of plant

986
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,598
that

987
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,358
it's so strong and dominant that the

988
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,039
single stemmed

989
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,279
capabilities

990
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,960
can override everything that i've bred

991
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,519
it to i don't think that i've ever seen

992
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,559
anything ever be able to override the

993
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,719
nl1 genetics

994
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,799
yeah wow it says something for dominance

995
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,559
and line breeding right so

996
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,560
a question related to this i want to ask

997
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,838
is when you were doing these early seed

998
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,838
increases or back crosses f2s et cetera

999
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,799
did you do kind of more open pollination

1000
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:34,480
types of things or were you just

1001
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,839
selecting one male kind of how more

1002
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,838
modern genetics is done

1003
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,719
we've always opened pollinated if we can

1004
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,480
i mean if there's only one male you know

1005
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,919
if you end up with one male

1006
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,079
and you're going to reproduce anything

1007
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,320
you're going to use that male so i've

1008
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,160
been at that point but every time that i

1009
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,559
can open it up

1010
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,319
i won't open it up and use the weak

1011
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,199
genetics there might be a couple real

1012
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,519
shitty males that just maybe they might

1013
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,039
not even be genetically inferior it

1014
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:04,719
might have been that they were lagging

1015
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,559
because they cracked later or they got

1016
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,480
more shade or

1017
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:12,078
but i generally take like the top five

1018
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,760
to seven uh males every single time

1019
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,839
i'm also looking for you know a lot of

1020
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,280
high quality lots of different qualities

1021
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,358
in the veils but

1022
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,599
opening up a

1023
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:26,480
population is a lot better to me than

1024
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,960
just to isolating it with one superman

1025
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,400
yeah of course of course and so do you

1026
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,079
remember the types of things you were

1027
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,000
selecting for back then and can you

1028
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,599
contrast that for us in terms of what

1029
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,400
are the traits you like to select for in

1030
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,000
your mail nowadays

1031
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,599
there's a big difference

1032
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,199
the uh

1033
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,079
we were

1034
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,919
pretty idiot idiotic i should say on our

1035
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,079
selections on our

1036
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,639
in the 89 90 years because

1037
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,280
i didn't realize the dominance in

1038
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,039
the hemp flower everything that we're

1039
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,000
basically dealing with if you're going

1040
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,920
back you know 10 000 years it's going to

1041
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,519
come down from

1042
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,280
a fiber

1043
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,280
wild

1044
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,400
strain of of

1045
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,400
flour and

1046
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,760
i realized and learned a whole lot in

1047
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,679
the first couple years because we would

1048
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,119
pick a super male it's what we call a

1049
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:22,239
super male the male that wants to

1050
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,320
dominate over everything it'll just be

1051
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:27,679
a foot taller it'll be about a week

1052
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,079
faster and in some cases

1053
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:32,480
twice as tall and three weeks faster

1054
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,240
than other males and

1055
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,880
we would think that male would just be

1056
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,358
the tits and we would grab it and breed

1057
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,079
it and

1058
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,880
i realized after

1059
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,280
three generations four generations of

1060
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,599
doing that we had actually degraded the

1061
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,760
flower to becoming so dominant and

1062
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,960
that's you'd get long internals

1063
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,800
uh

1064
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,119
stretch

1065
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,039
uh so it just basically was just

1066
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,039
reverting back to hemp and in the fourth

1067
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,279
generation of picking a super male like

1068
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,759
that it basically

1069
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,920
i think you can turn a plant's genetics

1070
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,920
faster than anybody thinks you can and

1071
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,480
send seven generations you can make a

1072
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,318
plant just just be whatever you want it

1073
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,880
to be that's that's really what we've

1074
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,440
come up with

1075
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,119
yeah yeah it's commonly held view that

1076
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,960
you know if humans were to disappear off

1077
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,880
the planet and we left cannabis to do

1078
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,240
its own thing we'd we'd get back to him

1079
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,800
pretty quickly so i guess that backs

1080
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,838
that idea

1081
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,880
yeah and on the contrast view i uh

1082
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,679
i'm i've got a lot more insight on what

1083
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,119
uh

1084
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,440
you know what is what each train is

1085
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,640
going to be a lot a lot of difference in

1086
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,639
their

1087
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,879
values and

1088
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,239
i i realize that

1089
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,480
you want to get

1090
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,000
certain males for certain things and i

1091
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,199
do everything a whole different way now

1092
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,920
so

1093
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,759
it's always just every day seems to be a

1094
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,599
you know a new chapter and a learning

1095
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,440
experience which is one of the things i

1096
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,200
really love about it

1097
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,200
yeah sounds very humbling like a lot of

1098
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,399
breeders say so let's get a little bit

1099
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:09,039
specific what type of uh attributes or

1100
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,559
kind of um tests if you want to call it

1101
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,480
that do you do on your mails are you

1102
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,318
like a stem rub guy are you more of like

1103
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,400
looking at the root zone what things

1104
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:20,159
help you identify a quality male

1105
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,519
i know most people are really really big

1106
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,039
on stem rub

1107
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,800
um

1108
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:28,480
my opinion on stem rub is that it's

1109
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,800
valuable but it uh it changes and you

1110
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,440
you might find uh day-to-day changes in

1111
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,160
males so you can't go by stem rubs so i

1112
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,480
would just go on structure

1113
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,480
the health of the plant

1114
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,079
stem rub

1115
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,358
i will generally

1116
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,160
breed

1117
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:52,480
a plant and grow it completely out and

1118
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:55,199
instead of maybe reverse a male with

1119
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,760
floral or some other hormonal

1120
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,759
spray to test to see what type of

1121
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:06,239
female type of traits it will throw like

1122
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,800
the uh what pheno it can possibly throw

1123
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,598
for terps and and the amount of crystal

1124
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,680
and

1125
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,519
structure that's one way to check but i

1126
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,519
just like to grow a male out and

1127
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,318
generally they get

1128
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:21,199
sixth to tenth week they're going to go

1129
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,119
fully ripe on you and uh

1130
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,078
show you exactly what's available in the

1131
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,358
mail so i probably have five different

1132
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,519
real big criterias that

1133
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,440
they all go go into play but definitely

1134
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,280
like to see the final product finish

1135
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,119
down

1136
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,800
yeah we've heard this sentiment echoed

1137
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,760
by a few different breeders and i think

1138
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,680
we've only really had two 707 seed bank

1139
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,520
and uh

1140
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,199
gosh the name is escaping me of the

1141
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,440
other breeder who used the florell and

1142
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,279
reversed the mail like what you said my

1143
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,079
always my question i love to ask in

1144
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,400
relation to that is do you find that the

1145
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,200
terpene profile you get off that reverse

1146
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,240
mail is quite accurate and indicative of

1147
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,239
what it will pass on

1148
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,279
you know that's a good one right there

1149
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,318
because you're inducing it so um

1150
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,240
you can change you can change uh

1151
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:15,838
vegetables and fruit so much with any

1152
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,078
amount of

1153
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,400
hormones so

1154
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,280
it's really not a super fair test is why

1155
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,280
i don't use the uh the floral i mean

1156
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,240
just think how much you can change

1157
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,240
ripening of any fruit or vegetable with

1158
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,279
ethylene and

1159
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,519
gibberellic acids and

1160
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,760
that's right on the same line so it's

1161
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,960
better i think it's better to go on to a

1162
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,480
natural test than to rely on a hormonal

1163
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,280
change that you created

1164
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,559
yeah okay and so on the polar end of the

1165
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,960
spectrum

1166
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,799
what do you feel is the role of labs

1167
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,400
within breeding do you like to utilize

1168
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,160
any of their services or do you still

1169
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,160
kind of like to use first principles

1170
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:04,880
well i was uh

1171
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,160
i'm a big advocate of analytical testing

1172
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,480
i mean i

1173
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,598
i think it's it's very very

1174
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,358
um

1175
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,318
important uh it's also

1176
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,239
a lot of times not uh financially viable

1177
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:22,318
so

1178
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:24,159
as uh since we are like crazy addicted

1179
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,239
to uh

1180
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:29,838
producing new strains and wanting to

1181
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,838
test them out at 80 to 150 dollars per

1182
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,000
test which is real cheap compared to

1183
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,960
what i hear there's there's very high

1184
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,199
testing rates at other places ours is

1185
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,800
is relatively inexpensive but when

1186
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,118
you're doing 10

1187
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,359
10 terpene tests or 10

1188
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:50,318
uh potency and kinematoid profiles

1189
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:53,279
that's 1500 out of your pocket just to

1190
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:57,199
get an answer so

1191
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,280
it only makes sense so much but um

1192
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,719
i would if i had unlimited amount of

1193
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,280
money i would probably put a lot of

1194
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,279
stock into it

1195
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,280
yeah okay and so maybe a bit of a

1196
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,599
redundant question but have you ever

1197
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,519
utilized the whole um like you know

1198
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,720
finding out the sex of seedlings when

1199
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,800
they're still just got their little

1200
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,000
petioles or do you just think like nah

1201
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,560
just go old school they'll show

1202
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,119
themselves soon enough

1203
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,318
that's funny because we talk about that

1204
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,000
quite a few people are starting to

1205
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,759
utilize the uh

1206
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,960
the different testing services i know

1207
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,839
philos has it and farmer uh

1208
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,480
farmer john i think is one of them or

1209
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,960
farmer freeman and

1210
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,440
i have never done that i i prefer to

1211
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,039
just grow the mail because i i consider

1212
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,039
that there's some uh genetic potential

1213
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,800
it might only be five percent or

1214
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,519
something but i still want to kind of

1215
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,318
like

1216
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,920
roll the dice and see what's there

1217
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:53,920
i do uh

1218
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,318
i have done about 80

1219
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,720
analytical tests though on different

1220
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:01,119
plants so

1221
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,679
i'm like i said i'm a big i'm a big

1222
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,079
supporter of it i'm just not uh

1223
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,759
financially capable of constantly

1224
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,079
testing everything

1225
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,680
but when i do narrow something down and

1226
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,720
i have to know we we test it

1227
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,960
yeah yeah good good sentiment definitely

1228
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,559
so when you are testing out some seeds

1229
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,159
you've made how many seeds you like to

1230
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,119
pop to get a good idea of what's going

1231
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:25,118
on within the line

1232
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,720
i like what i like and what i can do are

1233
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,960
way different i like to do 300 at like a

1234
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,000
minimum and then i get a pretty fair

1235
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,760
answer

1236
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,599
um

1237
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,319
at a minimum 10

1238
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,720
and that doesn't give you a whole lot of

1239
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,759
answers unless your genetics are like

1240
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:47,519
super inbred or

1241
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,040
if they're so focused and you know

1242
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,079
exactly what they are

1243
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,039
you can

1244
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,880
get a lot

1245
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,279
you can get a lot out of uh smaller

1246
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,280
batches

1247
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,880
yeah definitely so

1248
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
this is a bit of a devil's advocate

1249
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,480
question but let's just say you had a

1250
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,239
strain that you were liking the results

1251
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,559
in terms of what you were finding inside

1252
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,279
of it but you rather consistently found

1253
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,440
that you get a hernia every say three

1254
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,359
packs so you know one really definitive

1255
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,358
herme every 30 seats

1256
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:16,880
does that like rule it out for you or do

1257
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:18,639
you still think that there's potential

1258
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,400
you just maybe warn people that that is

1259
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,719
a possibility like how do you feel about

1260
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,720
that one

1261
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:29,519
that is a good question because i think

1262
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,799
that super worthy genetics would be um

1263
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,079
you know i don't think that that's going

1264
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,760
to be a problem one in 30 if you are

1265
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,839
if the people that are getting the

1266
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,599
genetics from you are wanting it because

1267
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,679
it's such a good plant they are going to

1268
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,440
deal with it and

1269
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,000
you know a bunch of people that don't

1270
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,318
really know what they're doing and

1271
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,920
grow kind of improperly or stress their

1272
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:51,838
gardens too much and might have high

1273
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,800
occurrences of hermes i would i would

1274
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:56,159
just talk to them ahead of time and uh

1275
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,599
which is near impossible if they're

1276
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,078
buying it out of a seed bank but if you

1277
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,760
tell them ahead of time what's going on

1278
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,920
that's really not a bad number but if

1279
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,200
the genetics are just mediocre and

1280
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,760
you're getting that it's totally

1281
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,919
unacceptable it should be standout

1282
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,880
genetics or

1283
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,880
the answer is no

1284
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,000
well that brings us to an interesting

1285
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,838
question how do you feel about strains

1286
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,280
that have a little bit of controversy

1287
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:24,719
surrounding them

1288
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,680
you know i'm not super familiar

1289
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:29,679
because i'm not a uh

1290
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:31,598
i'm not the type of guy that follows any

1291
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,318
drama and uh

1292
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,318
for a lot of time i've dealt only with

1293
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,318
certain genetics so i wouldn't uh

1294
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,599
necessarily study or know a lot of

1295
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,838
people's

1296
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,280
creations or what they're famous for or

1297
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,400
what they hurt somebody else's butt over

1298
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,480
or

1299
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,559
uh you know i just don't keep up with it

1300
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,318
and i get told this by a couple of very

1301
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,880
knowledgeable young people that are like

1302
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:56,880
strain fiends and they they just know

1303
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,160
everything so

1304
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,960
i uh

1305
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,440
i have no problem probably using

1306
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,599
somebody's genetics like that but i

1307
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,559
would want to go back to the person that

1308
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,359
they

1309
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,440
double crossed and uh

1310
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:14,639
i'd be straight with them first because

1311
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,440
i'm not the guy that goes out um

1312
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,440
i'll go out of this world with my name

1313
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,318
you know that's basically i'm not going

1314
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,519
to go around being talked bad about so

1315
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:28,079
i have no problem working certain lines

1316
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,920
but uh i would avoid it if it's just too

1317
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,599
much controversy i don't see the value

1318
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,760
in it

1319
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,480
yeah most certainly i mean kind of the

1320
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,480
most high profile incidence of that is

1321
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,559
res dog are you familiar with that case

1322
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,599
and would you use res dogs genetics if

1323
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,400
you had something you liked

1324
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,760
that is a real good question there too i

1325
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,400
am

1326
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,920
i'm getting old enough to quit being so

1327
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,838
spiteful but i was for my whole life the

1328
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,079
type that would cut off my nose to spite

1329
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,799
my face so i'm gonna avoid a lot of

1330
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,119
situations and not uh

1331
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,760
not go to that point but i knew all

1332
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,880
about what happened with res dog

1333
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,640
and then

1334
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,760
so that gives me a kind of a low opinion

1335
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:15,039
of the whole thing and somebody had sent

1336
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,920

1341
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,318
poly polyplopiloid but they oh they were

1342
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:32,558

1343
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,800

1355
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:58,000
for their standards and if your genetics

1356
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,559
suck and you're a piece of crap then you

1357
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,960
know that's that's just it

1358
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,400

with it going forward

1367
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:25,119

1368
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,598
ask me because uh

1369
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,079
i'm i am uh

1370
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,359
i recently

1371
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,160
met

1372
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:33,598
say

1373
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:36,879
you know lucky

1374
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:40,559
dog uh skunk va and i've known i've

1375
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:43,599
known uh duke for a while and uh

[ __ ] duke send me some uh kim cross

1377
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,720
maybe a couple years ago when i grew it

1378
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,640
and i you know i didn't think too much

1379
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,558
of it i had never been experienced with

1380
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,239
kim period at all

1381
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,519
and this is going to be a little bit

1382
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,279
harsh and

1383
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,719
i might get people to hate me because

1384
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,640
they're followers of the people but in

1385
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,159
in the high time san bernardino cup in

1386

uh 907 or falcon or 907 and this kid has

1392
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,079
a

1393
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:19,519
you know 150 000 to two hundred thousand

1394
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,680
dollars worth of genetics that he's

1395
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,400
collected and

1396
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,000
he intends to maybe start up or

1397
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,440
uh using it someday i don't know what

1398
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,199
the hell he's doing with it now but he's

1399
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,519
collected it and you know it's been a

1400
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,439
fortune to collect it so he knows every

1401
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,759
single person

1402
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,760

or something maybe he rolled i can't

1413
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:04,000
really remember because i'd smoke like

1414
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,839
20 joints but

1415
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,318
we start smoking and it's my little

1416
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:11,920
partner ak rizzo and uh

1417
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:14,719
and falconer and and uh

1418
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,639
jj and we're smoking up and man the

1419
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,799
third or fourth hit around the

1420
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:21,358
big ass seed pops out of that [ __ ] and

1421
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,280
it blows up like a grenade and uh which

1422
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:24,960
you don't normally see a lot of usually

1423
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,839
you'll see them like fume out like a

1424
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,400
little volcano but that [ __ ] popped and

1425
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:32,159
it's like oh that shit's arch and i

1426
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,440
nobody you know really wanted to smoke

1427
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,039
it and it's like oh no we're good to go

1428
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,880
i'll roll another one out of my stash i

1429
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,400
go no no we're good you know we rolled

1430
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:43,358
on and it's such a poor example of what

1431
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,720
my first my first chem dog was like oh

1432
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:48,558
so that's that that's not really uh

1433
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:49,919
you know real happy feeling

1434
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,800
and uh

1435
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,400
then and emerald that same year

1436
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,440
i was over there talking with uh he goes

1437
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,000
by montana roy now you know uh cody and

1438
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,760
uh yeah over at dukes and uh duke

1439
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,480
disappeared maybe to get a smoke or

1440
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,119
something and uh he he goes man you

1441
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:12,000
you check out this cam dog

1442
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,838
or yeah chem dog i think it was but uh

1443
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,920
he gives us a bunch of his flowers he

1444
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:19,039
gave us like

1445
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,039
you know the he had killer flowers that

1446
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,679
that year he had the like

1447
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:27,119
dominion skunk and the granny skunk and

1448
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:29,598
uh the local h and i think the dominion

1449
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,800
or the uh capital g and

1450
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,880
he had such stinky ass bud pole cat and

1451
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,960
uh he gave us some of that cam and i

1452
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,720
just sat right there and rolled it up

1453
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,358
and uh

1454
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:43,679
second or third hit

1455
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:46,400
of that [ __ ] going around i realized

1456
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,159
what cam was it's like oh they hit me

1457
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,358
between the eyes and i was like okay it

1458
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,838
overrode

1459
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:53,598
probably 15

1460
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:55,358
other times that smoked and i realized

1461
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,440
that you know cam's pretty serious

1462
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,239
pretty serious but so it's a good thing

1463
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,880
to judge by it's got rankedness to it

1464
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:05,439
it's got bag appeal

1465
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,599
it's it's a good standard to uh compare

1466
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,519
a lot of things to but i'm i'm so

1467
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,280
inexperienced with it first time ever

1468
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,960
that i was able

1469
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,680
to get my hands on it and do something

1470
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,519
with it was like you know uh this year

1471
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,919
emerald uh

1472
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:22,480
skunk va gave me a nice handful of the

1473
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,680
crossroads kim and we were smoking the

1474
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,599
[ __ ] out of it and it's really great but

1475
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,759
so um

1476
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,440
i like it a lot but i'm not going to go

1477
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,839
down that road

1478
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,679
what could i do with kim

1479
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,358
that hasn't been done and then there's

1480
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,000
people that are specializing in it so

1481
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:41,358
there's no sense in

1482
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,119
i wouldn't say competing with them

1483
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:45,519
because i don't i don't necessarily

1484
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:47,440
compete with people i'd make something

1485
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:48,719
equal or as good and then you know share

1486
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,559
it with them

1487
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,000
but

1488
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,720
i'd say that there's a lot of people

1489
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,798
specializing in kim and i don't need to

1490
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,558
go down that road at all

1491
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,719
and that's a really kind of mature

1492
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,720
mindset to have and definitely a huge

1493
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,959
shout out to cody and skunk ba i love

1494
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,798
all the skunk fam crew i'm just out of

1495
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,400
curiosity do you remember which cam you

1496
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:13,039
tried was it the 91 or maybe the d

1497
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,200
it was chem d that's what it was

1498
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,719
i'll tell you what um there was a couple

1499
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:18,879
people standing there on that third

1500
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,159
round when the when the joint came back

1501
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,760
and uh

1502
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:23,598
they backed out and didn't take a fourth

1503
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,839
drag off of it because the [ __ ] was

1504
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,079
starting to affect them heavily so

1505
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:31,279
that's a good that's a real good uh

1506
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,359
standard to go by that's what i think

1507
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,599
yeah certainly and i mean it's probably

1508
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,519
a bit of a no-brainer but if anyone

1509
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,960
including yourself ever gets the chance

1510
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,639
to try some 91 from skunk va do not pass

1511
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,318
up that opportunity

1512
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:50,000
oh i would put it in my library and uh

1513
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:52,159
i'm i think i've been offered

1514
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,318
you know he was he's always been really

1515
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,239
a great guy i don't know him super well

1516
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:57,838
but he's always been super generous and

1517
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:00,159
offered me things but i never took them

1518
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:02,400
up on it but i would keep it in my

1519
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,879
library and uh

1520
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,119
i guess that finest uh

1521
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,400
cut that was going around the chem

1522
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,280
what was it um candy at the emerald this

1523
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,000
year

1524
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,760
i know a couple people that grab that so

1525
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,599
i might uh

1526
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,079
i might snatch that up even though it's

1527
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,039
not the 91

1528
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:25,119
yeah i mean heck the d is uh really

1529
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,880
comparable to the 91 in many ways i

1530
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,640
always thought of it as though it's not

1531
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,318
quite as potent like maybe if the chem

1532
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,400
91 is kind of like a hundred out of a

1533
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:35,199
hundred impotency the chem d is like

1534
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,559
somewhere between 90 to 95 but the taste

1535
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,239
and the yield are much better so

1536
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,599
commercially it kind of makes a bit more

1537
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:41,279
sense

1538
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,440
yeah well i know uh

1539
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,240
mr bob grabbed up one of them he said

1540
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,000
his was doing real good and um

1541
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,558
he was going to prove it out but i had

1542
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
heard from second-hand sources that uh

1543
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,079
peabud mike

1544
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,760
confirmed that that was the real uh

1545
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,559
candy so

1546
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,960
i don't think you can go wrong

1547
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,359
yeah it's hard given there's so many

1548
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,159
different chemds at least three i know

1549
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:08,400
of and um it's there's there's varying

1550
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:10,399
voices vouching for each but i mean heck

1551
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,960
if peabod mike is vouching for one that

1552
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,358
that definitely stands for something

1553
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,519
well i'm i heard it second hand so i

1554
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,119
can't say but you know i was real lucky

1555
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:22,798
to to be in the middle of the

1556
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:25,519
conversation with uh skunk va tommy and

1557
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:28,880
or you know duke and a couple of the

1558
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:31,199
other guys that were actually at emerald

1559
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,440
and uh a.k.a rizzo and i happened to

1560
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:38,719
just pop in at that moment and uh

1561
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,079
duke grabs up skunk va and tells him to

1562
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,558
come over because they're gonna settle

1563
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,559
this thing right now on provenance on uh

1564
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,160
who had what on this

1565
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,359
chem d so

1566
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:48,798
it's like oh i need to hear this

1567
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:50,480
inducible i don't know this is kind of

1568
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:52,880
private conversation so we instantly

1569
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,519
just sucked up like flies on the wall

1570
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:59,200
and listen to it and at that point it's

1571
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:01,280
so valuable to get you know five of

1572
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:04,399
people that are like

1573
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,798
you know the holders of it and then all

1574
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,920
you hear is well i got it in 91. you

1575
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:11,440
gave it to him in 93. it came from him

1576
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,079
okay you're right it did that's the

1577
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,000
exact source i'm wrong and then [ __ ]

1578
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,599
just gets squared out right then and

1579
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,199
there and

1580
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,480
the provenance is like so well set on it

1581
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,239
that

1582
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,760
that's one of the best things about that

1583
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,879
right there

1584
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,359
i'm really i really really get lucky to

1585
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,720
get a hang with guys like that

1586
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:36,159
yeah most certainly i um i've been

1587
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:38,239
really grateful to have had a few

1588
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,159
conversations like that i remember the

1589
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,959
first time i was at emerald cup

1590
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,000
um just out of nowhere not so dog kind

1591
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,000
of tapped me on the shoulder and

1592
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,559
introduced himself and it was like oh

1593
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,239
awesome he's able to reveal a few things

1594
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,760
to me which was very interesting because

1595
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:53,279
he's tied into more things than you

1596
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,920
might know of

1597
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,880
you know it's funny with uh

1598
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:02,960
with him that um i've got friends that

1599
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:05,440
had used him as good good friend and

1600
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,400
librarian and holder of keepers trains

1601
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,119
and

1602
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,000
he is he is the further i

1603
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,798
see his got his hands all over and you

1604
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,719
know

1605
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:17,679
i've got a really good friend that uh

1606
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,199
knows him but that's who held

1607
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:20,078
el hafiz

1608
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,838
uh

1609
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,400
that hayes cat piss

1610
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:25,679
and el jefe did not have it and during

1611
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,639
the fire

1612
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,399
lost everything so uh

1613
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:33,199
they thought it was gone forever but not

1614
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:37,039
so dog held it and uh

1615
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:39,199
sativa seed stash uh leaf he was able to

1616
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,599
go snatch that that thing up get the

1617
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:44,480
cutting up so now oh happy's got his uh

1618
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,400
cat piss either coming back home or has

1619
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,798
it back and

1620
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,680
it's it's so valuable to have somebody

1621
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:53,920
like not so dog holding

1622
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:56,399
you know might be years later but when

1623
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,200
it comes into play

1624
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,920
it's it's an incredible value to

1625
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:04,719
everybody involved

1626
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:07,280
yeah most certainly and so him and bob

1627
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:09,519
hemphill i think in my mind are the two

1628
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,400
really notable librarian figures so to

1629
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:12,559
speak

1630
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,400
if we just jump over to bob for a minute

1631
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:18,240
um i noticed on your instagram feed

1632
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,920
you've got some mtf cross nl1 and i

1633
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,078
think you mentioned in the comments it

1634
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,559
was given to you by bob was that the

1635
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,920
case or was it like you did he make it

1636
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,359
and give it to you or did you make it

1637
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,079
and do something with it how does that

1638
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:30,078
all tie together

1639
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:36,960
no on that

1640
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:40,000
that's my mtf in my nl1 i uh

1641
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,599
i have given bob my mtf

1642
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,798
and uh

1643
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,119
he could certainly have my nl1 or close

1644
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:49,679
to the standing what i have right now to

1645
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,280
it with no problem but

1646
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:54,000
that's just something that i made up i

1647
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,640
had to use nl1 to uh

1648
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,199
i had to do something to

1649
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,558
get seeds for matanuska [ __ ] and

1650
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,480
there's really

1651
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,920
probably no better choice so that's what

1652
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,480
i used

1653
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,920
yeah okay so i mean on that same kind of

1654
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,400
train of thought your feed it's

1655
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,920
essentially like a gold mine in terms of

1656
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,000
all the different genetics on there and

1657
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,159
the next thing which popped up to kind

1658
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,480
of sprink my ears up was the northern

1659
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,960
lights haze hybrids i think they were tk

1660
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,400
northern lights haze hybrids

1661
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,358
what's the backstory behind that and

1662
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,119
what do you want to kind of do with

1663
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:27,519
those

1664
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:30,160
i'm glad you're that observant i know if

1665
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:32,000
i knew what you know at your age like

1666
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:35,519
you're an incredible you know human

1667
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,760
being especially for your age i i uh i

1668
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:40,159
value you a lot so

1669
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,520
just you have insight beyond a lot of

1670
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,318
others

1671
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:47,519
and that being said uh

1672
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:49,759
that's that's a real real real special

1673
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:51,440
thing right there that the t channel 5

1674
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,039
hayes

1675
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,679
we've been able to work with it for a

1676
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,680
long time

1677
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:02,078
my original waco in the 80s

1678
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:03,199
we never knew what it was it's a local

1679
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,039
plant

1680
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:07,919
but it has to be

1681
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,440
nl5 haste and we never knew it looks

1682
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,440
looks every single thing about it like

1683
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,559
the cover photo of the

1684
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:18,400
8990 scentsy catalogs and

1685
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,480
we didn't buy it from novell because uh

1686
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,798
it looks so ratty on the cover photo

1687
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,599
funnier than [ __ ] that we would pass on

1688
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:28,079
something due to looks but uh

1689
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,760
i've been able to get

1690
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,880
nl5

1691
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:36,480
haze from uh

1692
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:39,358
i think uh mean gene grew

1693
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,599
some in 98 from uh a

1694
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:43,759
friend of his in england so

1695
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,880
might have been his first breeding or

1696
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,240
first

1697
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,240
it could have been his first breeding i

1698
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,759
know it was his first nl kind of cross

1699
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:51,759
so uh

1700
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,839
he did a seed increase and he gave me

1701
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,640
some of that seed and then when i grew

1702
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:56,639
on i

1703
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,719
i thought they were pretty cool they're

1704
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:04,720
super nl5 dominant but i just recently

1705
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:08,399
crossed that tkno5 haze male

1706
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:11,519
to that nl5 haze to

1707
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,920
kind of do a back cross on it and

1708
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:18,318
go that route but uh

1709
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,318
as it stands tkno5 haze is

1710
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,680
and this is going to go on record but

1711
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:22,798
this is the

1712
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:24,719
uh

1713
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,199
the finest

1714
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:28,558
and best and strongest cannabis that i

1715
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,798
have come across

1716
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,240
in two decades

1717
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:34,239
wow that's a big claim

1718
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:40,159
yeah i hate to i hate to uh

1719
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,640
go around and keep repeating myself but

1720
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:45,199
i have told

1721
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:47,440
all my local old heads

1722
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:50,639
my partners and and

1723
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,679
all my uh testers all are on board and

1724
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,679
100 don't they

1725
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,519
they're not taking anything for granted

1726
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,759
on the deal but uh

1727
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:01,038
i've sent it out to a bunch of people

1728
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,319
that are

1729
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,319
they need to be amazed

1730
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,960
and if you did

1731
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:11,439
get sent the tkno5 haze i don't care if

1732
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,400
it was the nl dominant or the tk haze

1733
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:18,079
dominant or a cross of it i wouldn't

1734
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,079
sleep on it because it

1735
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:23,679
oh man going out on the limb here but i

1736
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:26,640
do believe it's all of what kim ever was

1737
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:29,118
and uh it tastes better

1738
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,159
yeah well that's exciting just quickly i

1739
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,599
just want to say thanks so much for

1740
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,239
those kind words i really appreciate

1741
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:36,798
that um but i guess does it go without

1742
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:38,558
saying that this is the next type of

1743
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:41,358
line you're looking to work more or has

1744
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,359
already been done

1745
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:45,920
you know what's been done but i just

1746
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,960
don't see where this bottleneck that's

1747
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,119
created with 1000 cookie strains is

1748
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,199
going to go from here it's not going

1749
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,599
anywhere it's uh

1750
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,558
it's going to revert back to

1751
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,200
uh

1752
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:02,079
a lot of heirloom and

1753
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:04,318
i say even a lot of land race genetics

1754
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:06,480
are going to get re-added back for a lot

1755
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:08,880
of different reasons

1756
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,798
might not be uncontrollable hard to grow

1757
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,559
wild strains but there's going to be a

1758
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:15,280
lot more need to uh

1759
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,200
to try to you know break the bottleneck

1760
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:20,240
and

1761
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:23,519
it has been done ten ways to sunday for

1762
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:25,679
sure nl5 haze but if you consider it

1763
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,759
like this uh

1764
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:28,960
one of the one of the most knowledgeable

1765
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,200
and uh

1766
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,639
trustworthy and uh

1767
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,199
old heads that are out there be ed

1768
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:38,318
rosenthal you know he he had a good

1769
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:40,318
opinion of uh nl5 hayes being the most

1770
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:42,079
potent uh

1771
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,239
smoke that he'd ever come across and it

1772
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,480
was like his favor you know and then if

1773
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:49,598
you go on facts like

1774
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:52,079
dynasty relic seeds has uh

1775
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,640
he has a yeah it has a 27

1776
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,960
19 year old cut of the cough and i'm i'm

1777
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:59,279
imagining it it's the fort collins cough

1778
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,039
or the you know it was it was named the

1779
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,880
cough but it was uh

1780
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,480
i think in uh

1781
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,400
probably uh

1782
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,039
produced right out of fort collins but

1783
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,639
i've heard it called the texas cough and

1784
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,960
other things too but it is the same

1785
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:14,639
thing and

1786
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,480
it's an outstanding

1787
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:22,159
nl5 hay so i was able to send pollen

1788
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:24,960
of my tkn05 haze to

1789
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:27,519
relic and he got a breeding done and

1790
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:31,199
being the gentleman that he is he sent

1791
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:34,159
me one over half of all of the seeds

1792
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,679
which just you know totally amazes me i

1793
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:38,558
probably uh

1794
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:40,318
i could probably shout out to him uh

1795
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,960
as being one of the uh

1796
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:46,000
more heartfelt uh people that i've come

1797
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:48,639
across in the industry so uh

1798
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:52,798
uh he's he's a really good guy but we

1799
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:55,358
created a monster right there that uh

1800
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:57,038
it's something else so uh that's

1801
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:58,000
something in the works

1802
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,799
but

1803
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,239
the tkno5 haze i'm going to work it 10

1804
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:04,239
ways to sunday right now and

1805
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:09,038
it's going to be

1806
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:11,359
the next thing if you if you got a high

1807
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:14,000
if you have a high tolerance to most

1808
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:16,719
profiles right now

1809
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,238
this will take care of the problem

1810
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,640
it's uh

1811
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:23,838
you know it's a 20-second onset type of

1812
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:27,039
a plant that hits you like a brick and

1813
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:27,920
it's not that dizzy spacey uh high like

1814
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,640
the

1815
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:33,520
durban tie high flyer or tie or durbin

1816
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,159
or any of the uh super heady

1817
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,480
like flying your head on a kite string

1818
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:41,358
type of thing this stuff hits you like

1819
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,358
way different it's an anti

1820
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:46,759
it's a diavasculator

1821
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:49,039
very very very heavily as like a medical

1822
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:50,319
diavascular so you get zero blood

1823
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:53,039
pressure

1824
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,759
in your brain so if you're smoking a big

1825
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:58,000
head event hold it it could uh it could

1826
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:01,920
floor you many many many people busted

1827
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,798
their heads on coffee tables or

1828
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:07,520
uh whatever hard object that's nearby

1829
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,278
it's it's a dangerous animal you know

1830
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,960
it's no joke i've told this to like a

1831
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,480
bunch of people and they just like in

1832
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,158
one ear and out the other because they

1833
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,358
don't think such things exist but i

1834
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:19,679
think that

1835
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:22,239
in in navel's uh description of the nl5

1836
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,079
he said experienced smokers were

1837
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:27,198
you know having uh urination and

1838
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:29,519
defecation and they lose bodily control

1839
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:32,838
over smoking this [ __ ]

1840
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,640
yeah um it's a fact this stuff does

1841
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:39,278
medical uh

1842
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,719
properties beyond any normal weed so uh

1843
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,839
it is definitely something that i'm

1844
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:45,838
gonna dig dig a 10 foot ditch

1845
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:49,119
into

1846
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:51,198
yeah i can 100 attest to

1847
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:52,158
some of those claims certainly certainly

1848
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:54,238
not the

1849
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:56,559
the loss of bodily function but i mean

1850
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:59,198
when i was at bodies place most recently

1851
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,120
i was lucky enough to try some c5 haze

1852
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:03,759
which is the neville's keeper cut of

1853
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:05,840
northern lights haze and jesus i've

1854
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,760
never been that high before it's truly

1855
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,520
something special so i'm gonna have to

1856
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,679
chase you up on your one because that's

1857
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,000
that's truly interesting but

1858
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:16,319
now is the time for us to shower our

1859
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
buddy dr p and some love you know how

1860
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,279
did you first get introduced to dynasty

1861
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,719
genetics and what's your favorite strain

1862
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:22,000
by them

1863
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:25,119
wow that's

1864
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,119
that's a good one uh

1865
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:28,640
i

1866
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:29,640
was

1867
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,520
totally

1868
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:34,480
disconnected from internet for 20 years

1869
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,040
so

1870
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:39,919
i was anti and uh

1871
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:42,319
when i did realize

1872
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,800
well let's see about 12 or 13 years ago

1873
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:46,799
really i realized that there was so many

1874
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,440
forums and that there was

1875
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,520
on those forums there was like seed bank

1876
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:54,238
information and once i started like i

1877
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,080
had a dozen favorites and all of it was

1878
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:56,839
i started to be getting addicted to it

1879
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:59,840
and

1880
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,840
uh it's it's something that happens to

1881
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,239
everybody right but then uh

1882
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,400
i i started to see

1883
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:07,519
opinions on what was what and i did buy

1884
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,839
some old

1885
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:14,000
seed stock right then but the professor

1886
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,000
priyan dynasty came along about

1887
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,640
maybe three maybe about four years ago

1888
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:20,000
but rocky mountain seed bank i just saw

1889
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,079
that they had

1890
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,479
a release of of

1891
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:26,479
platinum huckleberry cookies and

1892
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,238
i'd never seen cookies

1893
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,759
i heard about it and i thought i would

1894
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:31,759
never want to have nothing to do with it

1895
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,679
because uh

1896
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:36,640
people are saying it's a low yielding

1897
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:38,480
super elite and uh you know i'd like to

1898
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,560
let it go it's uh run its course i'd

1899
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:41,919
like to you know ten years later i might

1900
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,120
pick it up

1901
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,920
so uh

1902
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:47,279
but that one sounded real interesting

1903
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,520
and uh

1904
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,759
i i just got a pack of that from the

1905
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,600
rocky mountain uh

1906
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,440
seed bank i don't even

1907
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,159
know that that's an existing seed bank

1908
01:11:55,439 --> 01:12:00,079
right now it was a little tiny uh

1909
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:02,399
man and wife operation i think but they

1910
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:04,000
treated me super right and

1911
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,238
seeds made it

1912
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,479

kb

1916
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,039
dominant uh

1917
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:17,839
versions a super male and a super female

1918
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:19,439
the male like turned super black

1919
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:24,880
tons of resin

1920
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:27,919
uh probably the nicest uh ogb tape uh

1921
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,679
i mean kb uh type of uh plant that i've

1922
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,600
come across for a male

1923
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:34,480
and then the females were just like

1924
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:37,360
super good so for three or four years i

1925
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:38,959
i just been in love with the

1926
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:40,799
i don't even know how i might have

1927
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,800
shouted him out one time and he hit me

1928
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,039
back on a friday night and told me to

1929
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,960
you know chill and have a good weekend

1930
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:50,719
and

1931
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:53,840
slowly we kind of talked and um

1932
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:56,560
he no whatever boiled down to we became

1933
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,360
friends and

1934
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:01,840
he's a stand-up guy so

1935
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:03,679
not enough can be said about him being a

1936
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,840
good guy

1937
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,760
yeah no i agree i've got so much love

1938
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,480
for that guy i probably can't put it in

1939
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,000
words but i guess uh kind of by virtue

1940
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:15,119
of what you said the platinum huck is

1941
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,119
your favorite strain from them

1942
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,079
i i can't say that now um

1943
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:22,079
you know uh his

1944
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:25,519
the pineapple fields is outstanding

1945
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:28,158
everything that he's made has got

1946
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,840
something special going on uh the blue

1947
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:34,079
magoo was uh really

1948
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:36,159
nice i know that the um

1949
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:39,039
huckleberry the um

1950
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:40,879
the what is it i've got about a pack of

1951
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,800
everything that he has he has sent me in

1952
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,359
but the vanilla

1953
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:48,079
cherry cookies is is off the hook

1954
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,198
really a good keeper really good smoking

1955
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:50,880
um

1956
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,359
so i don't i don't think that i really

1957
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:56,239
have a favorite of his i think that he

1958
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:59,039
has proven all of his to be really well

1959
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:01,119
there's not like no duds in it so each

1960
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:04,238
one has a pretty good

1961
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:06,000
uh thing going for even

1962
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:09,279
you know everything he crosses is pretty

1963
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,359
well thought out and done upright so

1964
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:15,359
his males are outstanding and then his

1965
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:17,279
females you know speak for themselves so

1966
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:18,799
but i tend to smoke a lot of that i do

1967
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:20,479
smoke a lot of the platinum uncle berry

1968
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,640
cookies

1969
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:24,158
of course of course just as a little

1970
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,760
personal thing i've i've grown the plat

1971
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:28,479
huckleberry cookies out before and i

1972
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,880
loved it something i noticed was it it's

1973
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:32,879
such a short stocky plant you know did

1974
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,480
you have any tips to how to get around

1975
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,319
that because i just i could never get it

1976
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:39,198
to stretch at all you know that cookies

1977
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:41,279
were so dominant

1978
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:44,158
we have the opposite with one of ours

1979
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:46,800
it's has to be caged it'll have 20

1980
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:49,359
20 and 30 uh tentacle branches that want

1981
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,440
to go it'll go off like nuts so i've

1982
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:52,319
crossed it with things like lemon tree

1983
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:54,639
and

1984
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:56,399
central core with strong centers and

1985
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,719
slower growing to

1986
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:59,920
to just slow it down but we have one

1987
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:01,760
that

1988
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,119
it's og

1989
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,760
kb

1990
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:07,760
dominant it just grows

1991
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,760
nice central

1992
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,000
you can make it to be six and eight tops

1993
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,560
easy enough and uh it's real easy to

1994
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,158
grow and fast growing so now is that was

1995
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:21,520
the version one the v3 now is a stockier

1996
01:15:18,158 --> 01:15:24,079
slower growing one at bush here

1997
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,560
but he says that it dominates more

1998
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:28,800
towards the oregon huckleberry so it's

1999
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,120
faster in flower

2000
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,760
and a little bit better flavor towards

2001
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:35,920
the uh the huckleberry

2002
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,239
but it's slow i have some four month

2003
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,359
olds that are just stocky as hell

2004
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:44,079
they're wanting to look like um

2005
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:45,839
like little trees

2006
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:48,399
so it's slower if you think yours was

2007
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,600
slow i'm i don't know that it was the b3

2008
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,158
it's

2009
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,679
it's uh you can you can hang ornaments

2010
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:55,599
on it when it's christmas time though

2011
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,600
because it's that sturdy

2012
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,760
oh yeah no i definitely definitely had

2013
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,679
that nice strong branching for sure and

2014
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,360
i should clarify i didn't mean that in a

2015
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:05,199
particularly negative way i just was

2016
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,519
kind of wondering if you had any tips or

2017
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:10,079
tricks for it but on that same line of

2018
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,239
topic i noticed you have a little sub

2019
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,519
forum on matt riot's forums that's an

2020
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,039
interesting one how do you strike up

2021
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,400
your friendship with matt we love matt

2022
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:20,079
on the show we're always interested to

2023
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:22,559
hear how people met him

2024
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:25,600
that is a good one too because i didn't

2025
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:28,400
know who he was and uh

2026
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:31,039
you know i think he uh oh i know how is

2027
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:32,238
that i had uh you know i had offered a

2028
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:35,198
little bit

2029
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:37,039
on the instagram of the old seed catalog

2030
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:38,399
collections and uh

2031
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:40,560
he

2032
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:43,359
you know being that he's got the history

2033
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:47,039
and at least like i'd say 14 going back

2034
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:50,639
15 years even working with navel and and

2035
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:52,000

it uh

2037
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,359
he hit me up for them catalogs and it's

2038
01:16:54,079 --> 01:17:00,319
like wow old head i imagine this this

2039

2040

2041
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:06,239
you know when you when you meet him face

2042
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:08,719

2065
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,279
auction it off or something

2066

2068
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,880
he'll uh he'll stand up for the right

2069
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:09,198
and um

2070
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,560
and that's it if if your [ __ ] needs to

2071
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:14,399
go on blast that's the guy to

2072
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,560
talk to because he's knowledgeable and

2073
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:16,559
and

2074
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,719
he's a dick but man he's a dick in a

2075
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,880
good way

2076
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,480
yeah i love i love bodhi's analogy he

2077
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,920
says he's like the pit bull and we need

2078
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:30,319
the people to go off at people sometimes

2079
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,158
yeah people that's the best analogy and

2080
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:33,198
from a good guy too because you think

2081
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:36,079
about it

2082
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:36,799
bodhi is too nice of a guy and people

2083
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:38,279
might

2084
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,159
i'm not going to say that he's

2085
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:42,238
non-confrontational he might know he

2086
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:44,399
might be a seventh degree black belt

2087
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,718
brawl i know and like

2088
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:48,559
kill you in two seconds but

2089
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:51,039
he i don't think that he's gonna go

2090
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,199
busting somebody's balls because they

2091
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:55,760
did him wrong and then you know matt

2092
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:58,559
ain't gonna let that [ __ ] happen so

2093
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:01,760
um he'll go out of his way

2094
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,280
to you know make [ __ ] right and i i know

2095
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,180
for sure there's another side of that

2096
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:06,479
and a p a lot of people um

2097
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:07,920
[Music]

2098
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:10,158
take it or leave it i don't give a [ __ ]

2099
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,960
what they think about me uh

2100
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:13,839
so

2101
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,840
i just kind of like to uh

2102
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,079
stay straight with everybody but [ __ ]

2103
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,000
matt's a good guy to go to for knowledge

2104
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:22,640
and uh

2105
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,719
he's way more into the uh

2106
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,719
breeding knowledge for femmes and stuff

2107
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:28,640
so if i have any kind of questions and

2108
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,319
[ __ ] like that that i need to know i

2109
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,920
would be right to him on that

2110
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:35,599
yeah i definitely wanted to add we

2111
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,440
definitely get matt back on the show for

2112
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,840
a catch up he's always got some funny

2113
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,759
anecdotes to say but just looking back

2114
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,640
to a different post i saw on your

2115
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:47,280
instagram i noticed that professor p had

2116
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:49,360
sent you some kind of cbd stuff from new

2117
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,800
relic lines and i noticed that you

2118
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:52,559
mentioned you've got your own kind of

2119
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,840
cbd thing going on would you mind

2120
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,600
telling us a bit about your cbd project

2121
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,199
yes it's uh

2122
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,600
it's pretty uh

2123
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:03,359
it's pretty ongoing and

2124
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,840
you know getting to be widespread

2125
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:05,839
because

2126
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:08,879
basically

2127
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,399
about march of

2128
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,400
17

2129
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:17,359
i was like

2130
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:18,879
affected very badly by

2131
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:20,559
something i didn't know what it was

2132
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,159
we've done you know

2133
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,840
literally

2134
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:26,399
a thousand tests i thought i might be

2135
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,800
dying from heavy metal poisoning from

2136
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,960
painting cars for 30 years or i thought

2137
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,760
i might just be dying from whatever i

2138
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:36,319
was dying so um

2139
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,239
we got it diagnosed after

2140
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:41,319
tons of trying and it just turned out to

2141
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:43,439
be a form of r a and it's called

2142
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:45,599
polyarthritis so it's like

2143
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:49,359
one of the worst forms of ra it just

2144
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:51,840
hammers your joints so

2145
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:53,119
i was about 80 percent disabled it was

2146
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,600
it was

2147
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:58,719
it was ugly i mean no putting on i

2148
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,400
couldn't do my belt or put on socks or

2149
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,319
[ __ ] that was it was bad

2150
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:03,920
i'd rather just about uh

2151
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,439
roll up in a ball and [ __ ] die

2152
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,760
because of pain

2153
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:10,879
and we ended up getting it into

2154
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,719
remission i went to a

2155
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,880
specialist and

2156
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:18,158
first my doctor just put me on you know

2157
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,480
opiates and [ __ ] uh

2158
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:22,000
methotrexate

2159
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:23,279
not methotrexate at that point just

2160
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,960
gonna be steroids because he's like a

2161
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:29,679
general practitioner yeah so uh

2162
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:32,319
we got i went to the um rheumatologist

2163
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:35,520
and he gets me straightened out off of

2164
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:36,960
uh tell me to suffer it out swell up

2165
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,360
like he'll come back in pain and then

2166
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,760
he'll tell me what's up and we did go

2167
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:44,238
straight for uh he tried two or three

2168
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,079
different little concoctions and

2169
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:48,879
nothing worked he instantly gets me on

2170
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:50,559
an injection of methyltrexate and then a

2171
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,639
diloxatine

2172
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,960
which is like a uh

2173
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:57,119
pain blocker but it's more

2174
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,840
it's diagnosed for um

2175
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:01,840
depression so

2176
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,319
it just makes you happy about your

2177
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,239
[ __ ] arthritis so it's um

2178
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:10,319
it might be the better drug but yeah

2179
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:12,638
methyltrexate puts i got that and i get

2180
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:14,719
it in remission to where i could go back

2181
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:17,039
to work and uh i worked through the

2182
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,880
whole time but it was brutal you know it

2183
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,560
was it was truly one of the harder

2184
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,079
things i've done in my life

2185
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,000
and

2186
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:27,359
i realized that cbd could take that

2187
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,679
swelling out like crazy so i was buying

2188
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:30,719
and checking out different cbd flowers

2189
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:33,760
and

2190
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,198
we ended up trying ac dc and pennywise i

2191
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,560
think that um

2192
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:38,719
northstar

2193
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,480
might been who was breeding it for a sub

2194
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,158
cool but i tried a couple different ones

2195
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:45,119
and it turned out that the stuff had an

2196
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:47,679
actual medical effect to it and um my

2197
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:50,158
wife has crohn's disease fierce and has

2198
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,359
had ileostomy so if she has like a

2199
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:53,439
terrible

2200
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:57,198
flare up the stuff could work wonders

2201
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:58,799
for um internal inflammation reduction

2202
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:01,839
and uh

2203
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,920
such a good thing cbd so i realized that

2204
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:06,560
it's some road that we have to go down

2205
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:09,279
and then i started collecting

2206
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,840
a bunch of the best examples that i

2207
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:13,439
could get so you know ac dc

2208
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,440
i uh

2209
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:19,119
got a decent 20 to one i got a i got a

2210
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:22,559
couple from the nature farm uh his api

2211
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:25,279
apathetic purple indica to 15 uh 3 to

2212
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:27,600
15. everybody always says 15 to 1 and

2213
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:28,479
you know they got it backwards so

2214
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,079
um

2215
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:33,599
i generally say it the way it's supposed

2216
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:36,559
to be his is a 3 to 15 and

2217
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:39,280
i got can of montana from uh

2218
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:41,280
king jay out of uh

2219
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:44,238
out of montana there uh his cannon

2220
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:47,439
montana is a really nice one um

2221
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:49,839
but we probably got 15 different ones so

2222
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:52,638
willie g's lebanese

2223
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,000
the thing can go um easy

2224
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,199
one to twenty

2225
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,639
and uh

2226
01:23:55,198 --> 01:24:01,119
you know monster uh lebanese plants that

2227
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:04,480
can just be crazy uh have all the good

2228
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:06,479
things of the wild uh lebanese

2229
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:09,439
and uh i don't know if it'll adapt well

2230
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:11,599
to the indoor gardens but uh that and

2231
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:13,599
that charlotte's gift from relic that

2232
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,800
you mentioned that charlotte's gift is

2233
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,719
uh

2234
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,960
you know charlotte's web and ringo's

2235
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,560
gift i think he has it to an f3 when he

2236
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,880
gave it to me so

2237
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,960
i asked him if he minded that um you

2238
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,920
know we use the males and you know he's

2239
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,119
100

2240
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,800
doesn't uh doesn't care and

2241
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:32,559
again he's the best guy in the world but

2242
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:35,199
that's going to be uh

2243
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,120
one of the components so

2244
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,759
my goal is to just make something that's

2245
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:41,679
about 10 to 20. that'd be to me a one to

2246
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,039
two uh

2247
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,679
and then

2248
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:48,238
i want it to be

2249
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,679
something that makes me happy

2250
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:51,198
which would be the main goal with most

2251
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,760
people smoking flower right you

2252
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:56,319
definitely want something pleasurable

2253
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:58,880
yeah of course so what do you predict

2254
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,719
will be the future of the cbd orientated

2255
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,880
strains especially given there's this

2256
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:04,639
sentiment within the community that the

2257
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,639
kind of the patients who are really in

2258
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,560
need of the cbd have kind of been left

2259
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:10,639
behind now that legalization has come

2260
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,440
and passed

2261
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:16,319
that's a that's a real uh problem

2262
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:21,198
because it has come to that uh

2263
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:22,880
cbd flowers not something that uh people

2264
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:24,479
you know i always think indoor growing

2265
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,319
but down

2266
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:28,079
down in a lot of areas it's legalizing

2267
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,319
now that they're not relying on indoor

2268
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:32,559
growing they're relying on um

2269
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:34,880
light depth or greenhouse or outdoor

2270
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,480
growing and

2271
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,800
they won't blow

2272
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:41,039
much or any of their time and genetics

2273
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:44,000
or garden or or whatever it takes to

2274
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:46,960
make a decent amount of medicine

2275
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,639
so it's going to just boil down to

2276
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:52,800
large industrial hemp type of operations

2277
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,239
for people to get medications i'm not

2278
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,239
thinking that it's the worst thing in

2279
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,718
the world because it's come a long way

2280
01:25:56,238 --> 01:26:01,039
and the cbd

2281
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,560
plants that uh i'm going to give another

2282
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,519
shout out right now and this is a good

2283
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:08,480
one to do it too it's a cloud cove farms

2284
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,880
on instagram has a

2285
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:13,519
full spectrum cbd that's available and

2286
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,039
they have their own products it is uh

2287
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,560
it's all

2288
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:19,760
packaged

2289
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:22,159
and for sale in individual doses and at

2290
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,920
retail shops but they're also a company

2291
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:26,719
that's willing to sell

2292
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:29,520
at the wholesale level and then

2293
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:32,480
fairly small doses you can buy

2294
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,480
a 100 gram uh

2295
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,479
that's probably the lowest um

2296
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:37,839
price break that you get but 100 grams

2297
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:39,599
of their full

2298
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,440
spectrum distillate

2299
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,760
is ten dollars a gram

2300
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:45,279
and it's one of the best medicines i've

2301
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,000
ever come across

2302
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:50,158
it it actually has a fairly high amount

2303
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,479
of thc in it where if you're not a

2304
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,799
smoker you're going to be

2305
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:56,638
much more

2306
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,600
recreationally medicated than you're

2307
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,039
wanting

2308
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,280
and

2309
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:03,279
it is just enough to make the cbd work

2310
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:05,599
and it also has every other cannabinoid

2311
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:07,519
in it and the terpenes so

2312
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,199
their uh product is one of the best i've

2313
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,800
ever come across they're not they're not

2314
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:13,198
out to be

2315
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,600
you know the corporate king and uh

2316
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,359
they've expanded from one size operation

2317
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,960
to the next without

2318
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:21,839
killing the little guy

2319
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:25,520
and leaving the opportunity open

2320
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:28,639
and i do believe last year he planted

2321
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,400
almost 100 acres it went from a small

2322
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,920
deal but he still has his indoor

2323
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:35,920
greenhouses over the winter and he's

2324
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:38,000
showing 100 love 100 of the time so uh

2325
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,440
as long as he can sustain that guys like

2326
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,479
that are

2327
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:44,238
that's where all of the uh

2328
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:46,000
i think medical benefits are probably

2329
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:47,839
going to end up it's not going to be

2330
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,760
flour for the people but it's still

2331
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,199
going to be a high quality full wide

2332
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,960
spectrum

2333
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:56,960
cannabinoid uh distillate he has isolate

2334
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,960
also but you know isolate

2335
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,880
doesn't work the same as distillate in

2336
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,399
the full spectrum is better than

2337
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,239
anything so

2338
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:06,000
there's a lot of value to people like

2339
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:07,919
that

2340
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,198
yeah well you just banged out my next

2341
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,440
question which was going to be what do

2342
01:28:09,198 --> 01:28:13,198
you think is the most medicinal of all

2343
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:17,599
the uh the type of you know full

2344
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:19,519
spectrum extract et cetera et cetera

2345
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,600
that uh that thing contends with

2346
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,440
anything because you can uh it's such a

2347
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,760
good high quality product to say that

2348
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:28,559
you're into extracts and you might do

2349
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,560
dabs on a on a quartz dab rig or

2350
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:34,800
something uh

2351
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:36,800
it tastes really good and uh

2352
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,920
it's a very quick onset medically when

2353
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:42,400
you're doing a dab the the length of it

2354
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,319
isn't going to last you as long but his

2355
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:46,158
products are so good that it it tastes

2356
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,399
great and

2357
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:49,519
you near grab the wall it's it's very

2358
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,759
potent so

2359
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,159
i wouldn't say you could comfortably

2360
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,159
uh most people wouldn't want to work and

2361
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:58,960
and be doing a bunch of dabs of it it's

2362
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:01,359
that potent on the white cannabinoid

2363
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:04,319
you know full spectrum side of it so

2364
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:07,279
it's the best medicine but it's also

2365
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:09,599
it's a really good uh mixture to where

2366
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:11,599
it really does work it's it's it's a

2367
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,280
real i wouldn't say a perfect because

2368
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,280
somebody in a lab is definitely going to

2369
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:18,000
make something that could be

2370
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,960
get right past the blood brain barrier

2371
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,880
and uh

2372
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,119
and be the top of the line through you

2373
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,279
know through lab work and

2374
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:27,599
engineering but for just a natural

2375
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:29,039
product his is is

2376
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,960
it's pretty top of the line i've never

2377
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:33,840
met anybody that doesn't get on board

2378
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:36,719
when they find out about it

2379
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,800
yeah okay sounds like good advice so

2380
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:41,039
if we just loop back to a

2381
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,639
topic we were talking about before i

2382
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:43,920
remember you were you're talking about

2383
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:45,840
cookies you know where do you think

2384
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,840
it'll go i noticed that you've been

2385
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,279
working with this f3 durbin and my

2386
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,760
thoughts are now that you've played with

2387
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:53,759
the durban a bit do you are you more

2388
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,679
convinced or less convinced that it's

2389
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,079
actually a part of the cookie genetic

2390
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:58,079
makeup

2391
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:01,198
i'm

2392
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:03,439
you know

2393
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:04,839
i'm convinced that it's nothing to do

2394
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:08,319
with it

2395
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:11,039
um my durbin is not there durbin for

2396
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:13,279
sure so um and there's plenty of uh

2397
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:16,399
different durbins but

2398
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:18,000
this is original sssc's durbin stock and

2399
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,000
uh

2400
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,600
i could breed it 10 ways to sunday and i

2401
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,600
don't believe i'm getting cookies

2402
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,079
so uh

2403
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,079
i i think that maybe uh

2404
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:36,879
cookies is probably just like

2405
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:39,279
hindu kush and northern lights

2406
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:42,560
and

2407
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:42,559
that's probably really all it is

2408
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:46,880
yeah certainly that hindu kush ideas

2409
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:49,279
been thrown around a bit especially

2410
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:52,079
given that you can get these kind of

2411
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:55,439
real savory bakery shop type of things

2412
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:58,399
out of hindu kush easily

2413
01:30:55,439 --> 01:31:00,000
that and my nl1

2414
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,679
leaf pattern

2415
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,840
in its extreme form is identical to

2416
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:10,000
the most extreme og kbb leaf pattern

2417
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,679
so if i can go back

2418
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,679
to 1985

2419
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:16,639
and have a leaf pattern with [ __ ] loads

2420
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:18,719
of [ __ ] photographic evidence

2421
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:20,880
and i can reproduce it right now on an

2422
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:23,840
og kb

2423
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:25,760
it tells me a lot

2424
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:28,639
yeah most certainly most certainly i

2425
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:30,159
mean i think inspector from csi has said

2426
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:33,920
something along those lines about when

2427
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:35,519
you do s1s of mendo perps you likewise

2428
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,079
get that same phenotype and you know

2429
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,840
mendo purposes sorry not mendo purple

2430
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:42,960
urkel my apologies when you when you s1

2431
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:45,840
purple urkel you get that ogkb pheno and

2432
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:48,000
i don't think anyone would deny that uh

2433
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:51,840
purple urkel's probably got some nail or

2434
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,840
you know some pure afghanica in it right

2435
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:56,319
i would say it has to i've never been uh

2436
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,719
i could think of ten

2437
01:31:56,319 --> 01:32:00,158
strains straight up um that i didn't

2438
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,719
have experience with because it never

2439
01:32:00,158 --> 01:32:03,839
made it up here during the uh

2440
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:07,359
i'd say

2441
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:09,039
85 to 2005 so

2442
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:10,319
if it wasn't in my hands i didn't need

2443
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:13,279
it i'm that kind of guy that doesn't

2444
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:15,599
look for a greener pasture and

2445
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:18,319
very happy with what i'm working with so

2446
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:20,719
i never saw a purple oracle until i mean

2447
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:23,119
the very first time i had anything to do

2448
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:24,158
was 12 years ago with quirkle and that's

2449
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:26,158
half

2450
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:28,158
purple urkel and then since then i've

2451
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,079
heard stories that have been you know

2452
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:31,519
put out that it wasn't even half purple

2453
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:32,800
oracle that it was

2454
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,760
it was a

2455
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,760
a lavender hybrid so uh

2456
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:42,400
i had no experience with purple urkel

2457
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:44,800
but recently i did and do have and

2458
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:47,279
it's a really unique lamp the leafs one

2459
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:50,000
mine want to point upwards all the time

2460
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:51,679
it has a very uh nl uh

2461
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
dominant leaf pattern even though it'll

2462
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,679
go to like easily go to 11 fingered

2463
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,840
leaves and i never got 11 fingered

2464
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:00,079
leaves ever off of nl

2465
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,079
and

2466
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:03,759
but it's a super unique type of plant so

2467
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:08,159
it's uh

2468
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:11,119
it's coming down from that line uh

2469
01:33:08,158 --> 01:33:14,479
it's crossed to something though so uh

2470
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:18,158
and it happens to be that mine is a f2

2471
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:20,559
of uh the csi's purple oracle too so but

2472
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:22,799
it it's a fantastic thing that he

2473
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,159
preserved and has passed on too

2474
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,920
it's um

2475
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:28,319
it smells good in veg it's one of the

2476
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:31,600
things like like i'll go back to i like

2477
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:33,840
weed that it's pleasurable that's like

2478
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:36,880
most of the reason that i make flour and

2479
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:39,760
love flour because i love to be pleased

2480
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:42,480
by good flour i love smoking so

2481
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,320
i can't wait until uh

2482
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:45,919
i have big piles of that purple oracle

2483
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:48,000
flower

2484
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,600
yeah yeah definitely the that end

2485
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,719
feeling of consuming the flower is

2486
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,120
definitely

2487
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:54,480
definitely worth the effort but uh you

2488
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:57,039
brought up an interesting point you know

2489
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:59,439
as time goes by there's certainly been

2490
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:02,560
at least in the past year or so a bit of

2491
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:04,559
controversy surrounding tga

2492
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,320
and our buddy sub cool but with that

2493
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,560
being said you know i think most people

2494
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:10,639
have a strain that they hold somewhat

2495
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:13,039
near and dear that comes from tga like

2496
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:15,359
for me personally i got a brilliant i

2497
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:17,519
got two brilliant cuts of chernobyl that

2498
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:18,880
i just adore i'll never never give them

2499
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,639
up no matter how much controversy

2500
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,239
surrounds the name do you have anything

2501
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:25,119
like that that you know near and dear to

2502
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:28,399
your heart from tga

2503
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:31,279
you know i do i have a lot of love for

2504
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:33,359
old tga because they uh

2505
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,800
they put some really good combinations

2506
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,960
together

2507
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,880
i think that blood wreck was probably

2508
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,600
the best thing that they made and things

2509
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,359
down from blood wreck are off the hook i

2510
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,440
was uh

2511
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:47,920
i was completely blown away when i was

2512
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:50,960
able to get a crazy train

2513
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,960
original crazy train about um

2514
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:55,279
it was about 11 years ago

2515
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,679
and i think i got it from the

2516
01:34:55,279 --> 01:35:01,920
the hemp depot of all places because

2517
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:06,000
that place is as shady as [ __ ] and uh

2518
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:08,719
the uh what i got was good and um i fell

2519
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,118
in love with tga because of that i also

2520
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:12,639
had space jill at the time the actual

2521
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:15,039
what they called space jill and that's

2522
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:17,520
what they were selling it as and

2523
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:18,560
it was exactly like their description

2524
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,560
uh

2525
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,960
it's a little bit too much of a biomass

2526
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:25,600
for me but still

2527
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:28,880
it was a great uh

2528
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:31,600
producer so i crossed it to chocolate

2529
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,359
this this is a long time back now um

2530
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:37,199
going on

2531
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:39,679
at least 11 years and uh

2532
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:41,519
i crossed that to chocolate that space

2533
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:42,399
jail and i call it tropolo that's a

2534
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,440
fantastic

2535
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:48,719
thing that i've made i just recently uh

2536
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:51,279
passed that down to miss jill and uh

2537
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:52,800
she didn't want it when she was with tga

2538
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:54,319
and uh

2539
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,840
you know they were doing their own thing

2540
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:59,679
but um another really really impressive

2541
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,800
uh

2542
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,079
thing that tga they had a limited

2543
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,000
release

2544
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:07,760
of

2545
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,118
locomotion it was called by heroes of

2546
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,600
the farm

2547
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:14,639
uh pat did a really good job making that

2548
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,400
it's blue city diesel bret ii

2549
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:18,400
time wreck

2550
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:21,039
and i don't know how many packs went out

2551
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:21,039
but um

2552
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:25,919
i guess quite a bit

2553
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:29,039
i was at subpool's house at uh

2554
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:32,079
in 17 in the summer and uh he was open

2555
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:35,920
in a box that came in from pat

2556
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:38,960
and had 20 one ziploc bag had 20 000

2557
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:41,199
locomotion seats in it but he also had

2558
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,520
quite a few backups of a couple others

2559
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:45,678
but the total uh at two dollars a seat

2560
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,000
it was a

2561
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:50,158
sixty thousand dollar uh check he had to

2562
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,920
cut over to pass so i mean that's his

2563
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:54,238
personal business i shouldn't be talking

2564
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:57,039
about it but i know that

2565
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:59,118
quite a bit of that locomotion seed was

2566
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:00,079
produced and still is getting produced

2567
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:02,238
but

2568
01:37:00,079 --> 01:37:04,399
they had it understated on their on

2569
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:06,638
their uh profile

2570
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:10,399
and i instantly told subcool that that

2571
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:14,079
thing had to be changed to over the top

2572
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:15,839
over the top uh terps and uh

2573
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:17,840
i don't know if it's uh

2574
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,679
all good coming from the blue city

2575
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,119
diesel or if it's the mix with the time

2576
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:23,279
wreck but uh

2577
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:25,759
that's uh that's something that i can't

2578
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:27,759
live without on a daily basis too i keep

2579
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,920
it at all points in time since i've got

2580
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,600
it and

2581
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,600
i breathe

2582
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,400
it quite a bit because it's one of my

2583
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:38,159
only true purples i get uh i get insane

2584
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:40,479
color from it

2585
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,319
but the the flavor and the high it only

2586
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:43,759
tested out it uh

2587
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:46,158
i had a couple of them i tested

2588
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,280
analytically one was 13.8 that's the one

2589
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:49,439
i keep

2590
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:52,238
but the terpenes were very high on it

2591
01:37:49,439 --> 01:37:55,039
and uh with the pro the profile of the

2592
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:56,319
terpenes and that that cannabinoids the

2593
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:59,039
way they are

2594
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:03,359
it hits like a 25 of anything that just

2595
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:03,359
has that that thc spike and

2596
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:10,000
it's it's a pretty great thing so tj's

2597
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:12,638
put in their time whether they've uh

2598
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,560
you know whether they've kind of

2599
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:16,400
gone and done different things than

2600
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,159
they've done in the past and you follow

2601
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:20,319
them or not there was a lot of good

2602
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:22,638
value to it if you found an old package

2603
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:24,639
of like oh five third dimension i would

2604
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:27,440
certainly crack it so

2605
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:30,480
there was a lot of good stuff

2606
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:33,118
oh yeah some of that uh apollo work they

2607
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:35,439
did was definitely of value but while

2608
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:37,198
we're on the topic what are some of your

2609
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:39,118
favorite old school seed companies

2610
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:40,719
whether they be around anymore you know

2611
01:38:39,118 --> 01:38:42,319
it doesn't matter you know they might be

2612
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:43,760
defunct they might be still operating

2613
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:46,079
but what are some of the old ones you

2614
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,079
loved

2615
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:51,118
that's that's kind of weird for me

2616
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:53,599
because for 20 years i didn't know that

2617
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:56,479
they existed and when i did find out

2618
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:59,360
about 12 years ago that the internet was

2619
01:38:56,479 --> 01:39:02,079
you know available i mean i was like

2620
01:38:59,359 --> 01:39:05,198
i could give a [ __ ] about the um the

2621
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:06,960
internet i i basically want to uh

2622
01:39:05,198 --> 01:39:08,079
live my life and never have to ever go

2623
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,840
on it

2624
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:12,559
and now i'm uh

2625
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,800
i utilize it for uh instagram and if i

2626
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:17,199
had to order something off of amazon

2627
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:19,039
it's it's pretty handy or uh you know

2628
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:21,118
look up a strain review you can find out

2629
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:23,760
some instant information other than that

2630
01:39:21,118 --> 01:39:26,238
i don't need it so when i did find out

2631
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:28,560
there was companies available and i i

2632
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:30,879
dipped into it a little bit

2633
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:32,320
one of the first things i liked was uh

2634
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,079
dna

2635
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:35,920
because of their chocolate here i like

2636
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:37,039
the idea of that pure sativa and it

2637
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,560
turns out you know whether people

2638
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:40,560
there's controversy behind that like

2639
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,800
crazy too saying they stole their looked

2640
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,159
lines and lied about what it was and

2641
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,560
this and that and

2642
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:48,000
makes me want to have to you know

2643
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,320
discount them

2644
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,158
and then now what they're doing

2645
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:53,759
you know they've blown up so big now

2646
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:57,279
that i can't follow somebody like that

2647
01:39:53,760 --> 01:40:00,320
or even um i can't give them any love i

2648
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:02,079
still have a ton of chocolate i mean

2649
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:03,920
thousands of seeds of it and then

2650
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:07,118
projects of it that are i still keep

2651
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:09,440
them cut for them 10 12 years

2652
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:10,880
uh my crazy train i mean my skunk

2653
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,678
cabbage is

2654
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:15,760
you know tga and dna that's crazy train

2655
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:18,239
and chocolate and it's the thing that i

2656
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,719
i go to it's my go-to to get stoned when

2657
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:22,479
other things wouldn't get me high

2658
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:26,399
and um

2659
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:28,319
so that question's hard for me um

2660
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:30,799
i go back to seed companies that i love

2661
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:31,519
it would only probably be ssfc and you

2662
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:33,279
know

2663
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,239
the seed bank

2664
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:38,719
i didn't have no contact for a long time

2665
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:40,479
after that and then modern guys i love

2666
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,319
dominion

2667
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:45,039
um he doesn't put anything out that

2668
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:46,719
isn't worthy and i love uh

2669
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:48,639
you know dynasty and i can think of

2670
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:51,760
probably 20 you don't mean gene those

2671
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:54,400
guys they just don't cut corners

2672
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,480
and that's who i'd say i love as as uh

2673
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:59,359
seed producers but uh

2674
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:02,000
that's that's a hard question for me

2675
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:04,559
yeah okay so i guess if i'm gonna play

2676
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,479
devil's advocate here how do you feel

2677
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:08,400
european genetics in general have

2678
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:10,079
influenced the world stage and how do

2679
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,359
you feel about them now in terms of

2680
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:17,118
their overall state of affairs

2681
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:19,920
well i think that through

2682
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:21,519
the very first uh

2683
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,399
wave of it

2684
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:26,480
it was really good influence

2685
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:28,879
for the whole entire world the best

2686
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:30,879
influence that could be but within 10

2687
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:34,079
years there was more

2688
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:36,000
industry um infiltration from they've

2689
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:38,000
taken proprietary

2690
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,520
genetics back and forth stealing them

2691
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,800
and backstabbing because everybody was

2692
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,320
trying to

2693
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,199
to get something in the only legal

2694
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:47,840
market in the world so uh

2695
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,960
through that they'd either misbred

2696
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:51,279
lied

2697
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:54,719
and you know it came about to water down

2698
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:57,599
their genetics severely so uh the state

2699
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:59,439
of european genetics was a gold mine

2700
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:02,000
that could have been tapped and still

2701
01:41:59,439 --> 01:42:04,319
there are some holdouts of it

2702
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,880
but i do believe that it's uh

2703
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:08,719
it's not compared to uh

2704
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:11,359
it's never been compared to alaskan

2705
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:13,279
genetics there's no there's no possible

2706
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:17,039
what it ever could because the morals

2707
01:42:13,279 --> 01:42:19,840
were just like completely different and

2708
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:22,000
we were breeding for ourselves and

2709
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,199
though they were supplying the world so

2710
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,079
they didn't give a [ __ ] they were making

2711
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:28,799
money and i think it weakened the world

2712
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:31,118
state of cannabis fiercely over the last

2713
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,440
decade especially for at least from

2714
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:36,319
oh five i mean it was garbage you know

2715
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:37,919
five euro trash i hate to say it and be

2716
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:39,198
so harsh on the people because you know

2717
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,520
there's some good breeders and they're

2718
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:43,359
still putting in good work

2719
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:46,000
and there are guys that are still doing

2720
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:48,399
some pretty good out there i uh

2721
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,679
i personally know them and um

2722
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:51,279
or i know some companies that are

2723
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,039
working like through

2724
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:54,000
spain just because it's the only legal

2725
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:56,238
outlet

2726
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
and they're putting in a lot of love and

2727
01:42:56,238 --> 01:43:00,319
i could say that they

2728
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:03,118
they're trying to clean up what europe

2729
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:03,920
watered down and spread out

2730
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:06,158
so

2731
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:07,840
how do you feel about kind of some of

2732
01:43:06,158 --> 01:43:09,839
the european breeders most notably

2733
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:11,920
strain hunters having gone into these

2734
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:15,520
land race areas and traded european

2735
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,520
genetics for the indigenous ones

2736
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:21,919
oh i gotta say franco was uh on the

2737
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:24,639
right path and um

2738
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,319
i think they did a lot of uh

2739
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:28,960
bad along with good they certainly

2740
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:31,118
didn't hunt in the very good spots they

2741
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,319
didn't do a real thorough uh

2742
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,479
selection

2743
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:36,880
and um

2744
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:38,879
did not hunt in the right spot so

2745
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,560
if they watered down stuff by bringing

2746
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,480
in european stuff they

2747
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,440
they probably didn't like

2748
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:46,238
do so much detrimental

2749
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:48,479
uh

2750
01:43:46,238 --> 01:43:51,039
you know alteration because they never

2751
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:54,319
were in the right spots in my opinion

2752
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:56,238
and um half of that team was all about

2753
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:59,118
money the other one was all about you

2754
01:43:56,238 --> 01:44:01,279
know cannabis

2755
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:03,359
yeah okay and and how do you feel

2756
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:05,519
smoking cannabis in conjunction with

2757
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:07,039
tobacco affects it do you feel it really

2758
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,719
doesn't make too much of a difference or

2759
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:11,920
do you feel like it does

2760
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:14,000
kind of detract or add to things

2761
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:16,880
that's a good question because um

2762
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,158
it's so popular with people making uh

2763
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,840
you know using tobacco wraps and i've i

2764
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:22,719
think i've smoked three of them in my

2765
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,920
life

2766
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:27,600
um i don't go straight up for um tobacco

2767
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,039
wraps and

2768
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,400
i got a lot of respect for the people

2769
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:33,039
that do i don't see a problem with it

2770
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:35,839
makes my throat kind of harsh and tickle

2771
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:39,600
a little bit and i am an i'm an

2772
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:42,239
i'm an anti-tobacco advocate so

2773
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:43,920
i'd say natural wholesome good

2774
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:46,399
old-fashioned

2775
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,118
heirloom indian tobacco that's a whole

2776
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:50,238
different um thing and i know in

2777
01:44:49,118 --> 01:44:51,599
different parts of the world they

2778
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:53,039
certainly do just straight up mixed

2779
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:55,840
tobacco

2780
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:57,359
and hash or tobacco and cannabis and

2781
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,800
that's just their system and that's

2782
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:01,039
their style but i wouldn't be able to

2783
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,679
hang with those guys [ __ ] that should

2784
01:45:01,039 --> 01:45:05,039
make it i'd be greener in hell

2785
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:08,480
and uh

2786
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:10,639
tobacco just doesn't do me any good

2787
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:12,879
yeah no i can i can relate on that one

2788
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:14,560
i'm i'm fairly anti-tobacco myself but

2789
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,800
something i do like to point out to try

2790
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:18,800
to show that it's not a one-sided view

2791
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,880
is like there's actual studies done

2792
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:23,600
which show that when you mix tobacco

2793
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:26,239
with cannabis it actually results in a

2794
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:28,400
greater amount of thc being released and

2795
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,238
essentially not combusted so it's

2796
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:32,079
scientifically proven you get more high

2797
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:33,599
from smoking with tobacco so i always

2798
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:35,118
try to keep that in mind whenever i get

2799
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,800
on my high horse

2800
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:39,599
you know i don't uh i don't want to

2801
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:41,600
discount anybody that does roll once i

2802
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:43,920
could say i've been

2803
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:46,960
floored by [ __ ] that bust out the

2804
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:51,118
blunts you know one of them is uh

2805
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:53,359
uh down at emerald uh tony he has um

2806
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:56,639
oh man it's slipping my mind is extract

2807
01:45:53,359 --> 01:46:00,399
company uh he's hooked up with the uh

2808
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:02,079
pharmacy factory a little bit but um

2809
01:46:00,399 --> 01:46:04,799
[ __ ] that cat

2810
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:06,960
uh he'd roll up a blunt that the weed

2811
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:09,039
was just super really good but it was

2812
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:11,920
the right kind of blunt because

2813
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:13,840
it wasn't super annoying to me and we

2814
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:16,560
had super pleasurable time smoking it

2815
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:18,480
but then i've smoked some bad

2816
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,920
a couple of like i don't know if it was

2817
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:22,319
what it is

2818
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:24,719
the the wrap or whatever but man

2819
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:26,079
not as pleasurable so

2820
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:28,239
i certainly don't have nothing against

2821
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:30,880
it i'd grow my own tobacco in a second

2822
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:34,079
if i um just for the look of it it's a

2823
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:36,800
cool looking plant and i know a lot of

2824
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:38,639
i love plants so we are so limited on

2825
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,480
[ __ ] i might even grow a big patch of

2826
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:42,319
tobacco this summer right next to like a

2827
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:45,678
batch of hops

2828
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:47,840
haha yeah nice nice the old backwoods

2829
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:49,760
they're um they're an interesting kind

2830
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,440
of phenomena taking over but you touched

2831
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,320
on the perfect point i wanted to go to

2832
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:54,479
next

2833
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:56,319
given you live in this rather remote

2834
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:58,559
place and it's hard to grow things

2835
01:46:56,319 --> 01:47:00,799
outdoors what type of things do grow

2836
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,360
well outdoors like i mean and in terms

2837
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,800
of cannabis do you still see ruderalis

2838
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:06,399
on the side of the road type of thing or

2839
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,600
was that more of like a myth than a

2840
01:47:06,399 --> 01:47:09,920
reality

2841
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:13,280
no i don't think there was ever wild uh

2842
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:15,520
root or alice up here ever i

2843
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:16,960
i came across plants in the 90s that we

2844
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:19,280
don't know where the root oralist gene

2845
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:23,198
came from because i had bought in the

2846
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:24,479
you know 90 i bought uh the skunk one

2847
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:26,960
and the uh

2848
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:28,638
indica root or alice from uh scentsy

2849
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,760
seed bank and we tried to grow it up

2850
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:31,520
here it was like smoke you know it was

2851
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,920
like at this first stages it was root or

2852
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,920
alice skunk so you're gonna get

2853
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:38,560
one or two that tasted with some decent

2854
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:40,639
uh smells and rust for cardboard but

2855
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,719
there was never a wild strain up here

2856
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:45,118
we've uh we've been able to do a lot of

2857
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:46,960
in environmental kind of studies by

2858
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:49,279
pushing plants to the end of the year

2859
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,960
and where i'm at at this exact latitude

2860
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:53,118
we know

2861
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:54,800
a mild winter we can get five weeks into

2862
01:47:53,118 --> 01:47:56,960
flower and

2863
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:59,679
[ __ ] it's just that close to finishing

2864
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:01,600
so if somebody was to tweak it

2865
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:04,000
or say

2866
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,320
use an auto not an autoflower because

2867
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,359
i'm friends like crazy with mofastos and

2868
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:10,559
i grow a lot of his autoflowers his uh

2869
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:12,319
his stuff's a whole different thing and

2870
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,720
it does work up here but they just get

2871
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:14,960
done super quick and

2872
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,960
[Music]

2873
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,880
they're not like other places they they

2874
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,158
just do their thing uh i want to have

2875
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,440
something like

2876
01:48:20,158 --> 01:48:24,719
a semi

2877
01:48:21,439 --> 01:48:26,799
auto that would uh flower before the

2878
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:29,840
light is telling it to maybe start

2879
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:32,719
triggering at 16 hours instead of the

2880
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:34,560
slowly 14 hour trigger

2881
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,239
and then we'd have two weeks advance on

2882
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,000
it and um because i think maybe the

2883
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:40,079
iranian auto something like that it's a

2884
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,760
pseudo auto and

2885
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:44,399
i've got some blueberries like that too

2886
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:47,679
so we're experimenting and who knows we

2887
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:50,079
we might alter the course of uh

2888
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:53,039
of the cannabis to meet our environment

2889
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:54,719
here if we keep playing with it

2890
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:56,719
yeah i mean it's it's interesting that

2891
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,079
you bring up blueberry because i see

2892
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:00,480
that you've worked with it you and gave

2893
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:01,920
me a pack of seeds as a blueberry hybrid

2894
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:03,359
and i'm interested what's your

2895
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,880
impression of the strain and are you

2896
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:10,319
kind of a dj short fan in general

2897
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:13,199
you know i'm not an anti-dj short

2898
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:17,198
but i have never

2899
01:49:13,198 --> 01:49:18,799
never grown his streams ever we've uh

2900
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:21,118
i think what i gave you was a blueberry

2901
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:23,520
nine pound hammer and we we proved that

2902
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:26,158
pretty well in the uh a growing la that

2903
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:28,800
was for avid which was um you know a

2904
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:30,960
pretty big aeroponics company they were

2905
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,800
on the stock exchange and they were

2906
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:36,079
building up uh

2907
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:39,679
for selling the idpo and um

2908
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:41,279
crazy [ __ ] happened the cfo and the ceo

2909
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:43,599
had like hostile

2910
01:49:41,279 --> 01:49:45,519
takeover [ __ ] happened to each other and

2911
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:48,079
there was about 60 million dollars in

2912
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,840
accounts that got froze up and i was

2913
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:51,599
doing test growth for those guys and

2914
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,760
that nine pound hammer blueberry not

2915
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:55,760
hammer was in there doing

2916
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:57,920
a lot of videos of it so it did

2917
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:01,199
excellent and

2918
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:02,880
everybody kind of loved it but the uh

2919
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:04,479
i got off track to what the hell was the

2920
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,880
question

2921
01:50:04,479 --> 01:50:09,279
he indeed into dj show it

2922
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:11,440
oh dj short yeah we've uh we just always

2923
01:50:09,279 --> 01:50:14,880
been thick with blueberry up here and

2924
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:17,079
nobody's ever said the word dj short man

2925
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:19,679
the blueberry was so common up here in

2926
01:50:17,079 --> 01:50:22,079
1995 that everybody grew up on it and

2927
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:25,118
they're sick as [ __ ] a blueberry you

2928
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:28,158
can't get people to even like it up here

2929
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:29,759
yeah okay very very interesting there so

2930
01:50:28,158 --> 01:50:31,198
it's interesting because a lot of people

2931
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,840
will say that you know like maybe they

2932
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:35,439
read an article from dj short in the

2933
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,119
early years and maybe that helped them

2934
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:38,960
with their breeding or whatever did you

2935
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:41,439
ever read any articles be it from

2936
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:44,000
various authors or were you just very

2937
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:46,319
much kind of self-taught oh mostly

2938
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,880
self-taught but i definitely uh read and

2939
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:52,639
got told a lot

2940
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,639
like my little partner ak rizzo

2941
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:59,679
he's a stay-at-home dad so he can

2942
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:02,079
you know find those articles and if it's

2943
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:03,599
something that that is even

2944
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:05,840
curious to me which seems to be

2945
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:07,119
everything is he relays it straight to

2946
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:09,840
me so

2947
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:11,598
i get a lot of good information and i've

2948
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:14,000
read and found and read as much as i

2949
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:15,840
could and certainly do follow

2950
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,719
i like the idea of

2951
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:20,960
like dj shorts had regenerative

2952
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:23,198
practices of um getting full summer

2953
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:25,279
growth and i like the practices of his

2954
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:28,479
kid and i think that you've got it

2955
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:30,000
you've got it going on for his uh

2956
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:32,879
thing that he's got there they're both

2957
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,279
doing really well

2958
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,920
one thing of our our blueberry is uh

2959
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:38,880
mostly always been just sativa up here

2960
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:41,199
so

2961
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:44,480
a lot of other blueberries in the world

2962
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:48,000
turn purple and are indica and we have

2963
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:49,439
some mean mean mean blueberry sativa

2964
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,560
like indoor

2965
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:55,919
average easy one pound per plant

2966
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:58,880
sativas that stack up finish good fast

2967
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:00,480
and over the top blueberries

2968
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,319
but it's just our common it's ak

2969
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:04,479
blueberry there's like so many there's

2970
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:06,158
fairbanks blueberry salsa blueberry

2971
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:08,479
goose babe blueberry

2972
01:52:06,158 --> 01:52:10,158
um a couple others one called arctic

2973
01:52:08,479 --> 01:52:11,759
blue

2974
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:13,439
the arctic blue and the dean's beans

2975
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,360
blueberry are both the same they're

2976
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:16,960
about a 25

2977
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:18,079
plus year old

2978
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:19,198
cutting

2979
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:21,359
and

2980
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:23,759
i i have i've run that arctic blue and

2981
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:26,479
bred the [ __ ] out of it to

2982
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:28,000
just preserve it because it's so old but

2983
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:30,079
you know those type of plants with the

2984
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
generational drift they want to be hard

2985
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:34,079
as hell to root

2986
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,840
uh hard to get to going into beds you

2987
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:37,359
have to completely shave their legs and

2988
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,400
give them like a

2989
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:41,198
you know

2990
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:43,920
10 times oversized potter to get them to

2991
01:52:41,198 --> 01:52:46,158
encourage the hormones to go into the

2992
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:47,679
growth tip and start producing

2993
01:52:46,158 --> 01:52:51,439
vegetative and they want to stay in the

2994
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:54,719
flower all the time if they shock from

2995
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:56,399
anything over feeding not keeping the

2996
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:58,960
bottoms cleaned or

2997
01:52:56,399 --> 01:53:00,559
small roots they just laid a straight up

2998
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:02,158
autoflower

2999
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,280
which is a good house plant because in

3000
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:05,519
the middle of summer you can have the

3001
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:07,599
most beautiful uh smell on blueberry

3002
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,119
plant like in the kitchen window

3003
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:11,360
a little breeze blowing in and just

3004
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:13,359
blows blueberry smell all over they

3005
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:15,279
really do nice as a

3006
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:16,960
a pseudo auto

3007
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:18,479
but that has something that's happened

3008
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:21,520
to them from

3009
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:24,079
you know just being old gals

3010
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:26,400
yeah the idea of genetic drift or kind

3011
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:28,479
of loss of vigor is is an interesting

3012
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:31,679
topic and recently we've seen a lot of

3013
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:33,359
people engaging in this meristem tissue

3014
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:35,520
culturing which kind of is said to

3015
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:37,279
rejuvenate clones is that something

3016
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,599
you've heard about and maybe possibly

3017
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:42,238
interested in yourself

3018
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:44,000
have heard about it and i uh i approve

3019
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:46,399
of the uh

3020
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,760
regenerative uh

3021
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:50,079
practices

3022
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:51,199
i think that's gonna be uh

3023
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:52,719
helpful

3024
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:55,519
to a lot of people i don't have any

3025
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:57,520
duding or slow uh

3026
01:53:55,520 --> 01:54:00,000
something that's not

3027
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:01,119
they can't be rooted i have no problem

3028
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,560
um

3029
01:54:01,118 --> 01:54:04,319
it's just basically if you have

3030
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:07,119
something that's that old and

3031
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:10,238
kind of a pain in the butt

3032
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:12,399
make it grow faster to get the roots um

3033
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:15,039
you know makes a looser cellular

3034
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:17,759
formation stuff that real tight cellular

3035
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:20,560
formation that almost turns to wood

3036
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:22,480
there's a lot of ways around uh

3037
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:24,400
making plants like that grow

3038
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:26,079
and uh

3039
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:28,879
i've been just curious just now if i can

3040
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:31,359
like give light doses of gibberellic

3041
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:32,960
acid and 30 to 50 parts per million to

3042
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:35,279
plants like

3043
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,920
the lemon tree you know it grows

3044
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:39,840
you have to grow it under a 65k to get

3045
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:42,960
it to stretch or it'll grow if you put

3046
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:45,360
it under 4 000 it'll sit down on itself

3047
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,760
and have 20 internodes at three feet

3048
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:49,118
tall and

3049
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:52,960
that thing will be four or five months

3050
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:55,279
in veg and uh little tricks like 6 500 k

3051
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:58,079
and maybe 30 to 50 parts per million of

3052
01:54:55,279 --> 01:55:00,639
some gibralic acid you can get internal

3053
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:02,719
length to come up from a quarter inch to

3054
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:04,560
you know one or two inches and then make

3055
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:05,920
that thing move

3056
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:09,440
that's kind of things that run through

3057
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:12,000
my mind a whole lot nowadays

3058
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:13,839
yeah okay and so this brings us to a

3059
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,520
perfect little segue do you grow

3060
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:18,639
organically or are you more of a

3061
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,639
synthetic base grower

3062
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:24,239
that's really a good one because i have

3063
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:26,319
uh forever done crazy um

3064
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:30,079
we've always had animals a lot of them

3065
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:32,399
for for 20 25 years long time ago we had

3066
01:55:30,079 --> 01:55:34,880
way over 100 wild boar that i was buying

3067
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:36,879
them from like the bronx zoo

3068
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:38,800
you could get them from mike

3069
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:40,800
the san diego wildlife conservation

3070
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:43,520
would sell their extra piglets and they

3071
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:46,239
had uh you know 36 chromosome wild boar

3072
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,119
from uh black uh the black forest line

3073
01:55:46,238 --> 01:55:49,279
and

3074
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:51,359
the bronx who had the zygote line which

3075
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:53,920
was from sweden and

3076
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:57,920
we had all of these uh

3077
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:59,520
the like lima uh ohio would have wild

3078
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:02,239
exotic auctions you could just straight

3079
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:04,560
up by polish imports and we were picking

3080
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:05,839
up all of these 36 chromosome wild boars

3081
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,760
so

3082
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,360
we would have regular animals too but we

3083
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:11,039
had to have

3084
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:12,479
something exotic so

3085
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:15,279
we would

3086
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:19,039
always have corn mash or corn oats and

3087
01:56:15,279 --> 01:56:21,118
barley generally uh soaked or molasses

3088
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:23,039
coated we'll soak it in barrels for a

3089
01:56:21,118 --> 01:56:25,519
week before we feed it

3090
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:29,279
and 20 years ago i realized that stuff

3091
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:31,199
will grow imo on the top of it and

3092
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:32,880
sometimes we tap a little bit of the

3093
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:34,879
water off of it you can either brew it

3094
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:37,920
and make like you know some really good

3095
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,359
hooch or you could uh

3096
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,679
give it to the animals and they get a

3097
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:44,238
little bit buzzed off of it but i would

3098
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:45,599
uh i never knew to put lactic acid into

3099
01:56:44,238 --> 01:56:47,439
it

3100
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:49,920
and turn it to like a

3101
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:52,158
acetic acid so i would

3102
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:53,599
just lightly water the plants with it as

3103
01:56:52,158 --> 01:56:55,118
like a nutritional boost thinking that

3104
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:57,440
the starches would definitely be good

3105
01:56:55,118 --> 01:56:59,198
for the plants and if you let it sit too

3106
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:00,399
long you'd grow an imo on the top of it

3107
01:56:59,198 --> 01:57:01,839
that made me

3108
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:04,319
you know for a long time i've been doing

3109
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:06,960
that we'd always get uh

3110
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:09,279
tons up to you know up to tons at a time

3111
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:12,560
of food from connections for our animals

3112
01:57:09,279 --> 01:57:14,800
so if i would let certain things ferment

3113
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:17,039
and i realized about the uh

3114
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,480
like the korean natural farming

3115
01:57:17,039 --> 01:57:20,399
practices i didn't know that's what it

3116
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:21,678
was called but we would

3117
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:24,638
you know i'd seen the value of

3118
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:25,679
fermenting things because i've i've

3119
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:28,480
worked

3120
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:30,158
for 30 plus years for a korean and

3121
01:57:28,479 --> 01:57:32,158
we eat a lot of kimchi i know what

3122
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:33,679
fermentation does for you know it's very

3123
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:34,399
good a lot of different things fermented

3124
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:36,079
are good so

3125
01:57:34,399 --> 01:57:38,079
[Music]

3126
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:39,840
we've always kind of ate natural diets

3127
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:41,679
and tons of fermented stuff so i figured

3128
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:43,520
the plants are going to benefit by it

3129
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:45,440
and then i found out later the whole

3130
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:47,679
time that we've just been doing you know

3131
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:50,000
natural practices

3132
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:51,599
of all these organic styles

3133
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,079
i can't say i haven't bought a lot of

3134
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:57,039
bottles of uh

3135
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:58,479
of uh pre-made uh foods but the ones

3136
01:57:57,039 --> 01:58:00,639
that i did buy

3137
01:57:58,479 --> 01:58:03,519
i would say

3138
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:05,199
35 years ago we used eco-grow

3139
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,760
and uh

3140
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:09,519
it it's not soluble so you'd have to mix

3141
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,360
it for a damn hour before you could use

3142
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:13,440
it and um

3143
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:15,759
it kind of went away and i used

3144
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:19,198
something called uh esu

3145
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:21,039
which was energy sun university and uh

3146
01:58:19,198 --> 01:58:23,118
for about 10 years that product was

3147
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:25,760
around and it changed its name

3148
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:27,839
to nsr and it has since gone off the

3149
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:29,520
market but if i ever had to go to a

3150
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,800
bottled nutrient that's what i would go

3151
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:33,040
to because it

3152
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,199
never built salt up

3153
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:37,519
never burnt the plants it had a uh you

3154
01:58:35,198 --> 01:58:39,919
know an indicator for ph in it so it was

3155
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,040
real real easy to use but

3156
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:42,560
i have

3157
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:44,800
you know we'll take like

3158
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:46,840
a lot of our fermented fruit for our

3159
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,920
animals and i'll just straight up been

3160
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:50,719
forever making ffj

3161
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,800
so

3162
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:57,039
in my garage i probably have

3163
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:59,599
25 5 gallon buckets of ffj in multiple

3164
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:02,880
forms and then maybe five gallons of

3165
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:03,079
ffa the the fish amino acid

3166
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,159
and

3167
01:59:03,079 --> 01:59:06,800
[Music]

3168
01:59:04,158 --> 01:59:08,479
i have got some barrels of uh

3169
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,400
you know seaweed collected from the

3170
01:59:08,479 --> 01:59:13,198
ocean just straight up right off the

3171
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:15,198
shoreline massive collections of uh

3172
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:16,399
seaweed now i'll ferment that and then

3173
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:18,479
put

3174
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:21,039
lactic acid on it let it brew and then

3175
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:21,839
i'll put an imo that i grow

3176
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:24,800
and

3177
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:26,079
you know let it inoculate

3178
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:28,159
and then

3179
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:30,479
go from there and i try to keep like

3180
01:59:28,158 --> 01:59:32,960
good live soil i mean all the time i'll

3181
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:35,519
recycle my soil and refurbish it then

3182
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:37,760
you know kick it to the side using em1

3183
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:40,159
or any of my imo's

3184
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:42,800
i would just uh refurbish it real good

3185
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:44,559
let it sit in tubs

3186
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:47,119
sometimes over the whole winter indoors

3187
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:49,280
in the garage and

3188
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:51,439
if i use it too much or don't want it

3189
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:53,118
i'll put it into my outdoor gardens one

3190
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:55,759
thing you asked earlier what does grow

3191
01:59:53,118 --> 01:59:58,238
up here barely anything grows up here so

3192
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:59,719
berries i have a lots of berries black

3193
01:59:58,238 --> 02:00:02,559
currants

3194
01:59:59,719 --> 02:00:05,679
raspberries and

3195
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:06,560
tons of curry just different uh bushes

3196
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:09,199
and

3197
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:11,599
apple trees and any of the stuff i grow

3198
02:00:09,198 --> 02:00:14,238
i put any of my old nutrient dirt that's

3199
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:15,599
living right right into my uh gardens

3200
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:17,519
and generally

3201
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:19,760
it'll any leaf that hits it it'll just

3202
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:22,000
eat it up the imo would just drop gobble

3203
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:24,880
it up into a pure white uh you know my

3204
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:28,238
cilia it's really some pretty nice live

3205
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:29,599
soil yeah definitely so i mean

3206
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:31,359
now that we know how you grow we've got

3207
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:32,960
to ask the other end of the spectrum

3208
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:34,079
what type of lighting technology do you

3209
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:37,760
like to use and what do you think will

3210
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:39,679
be the future of lighting technology

3211
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:41,280
that's funny um i was thinking about

3212
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:42,880
that you know the other day when i saw

3213
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:44,719
the uh

3214
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:47,440
high times about 15 years ago

3215
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:49,118
advertising 6 000 watt plasma lights and

3216
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:51,118
i think they're landing craft lights and

3217
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:52,158
that was going to be the future way back

3218
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:53,359
when

3219
02:00:52,158 --> 02:00:55,759
and

3220
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:58,319
now i see a change about every year

3221
02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:00,719
there's an advancement in light

3222
02:00:58,319 --> 02:01:02,319
i use uh

3223
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:06,079
four

3224
02:01:02,319 --> 02:01:06,079
1000 watt 500

3225
02:01:06,319 --> 02:01:11,519
watt emitters they're they're 1000 watt

3226
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:13,920
uh double enders but they're 500 watt

3227
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,840
you know cmh they call it i always call

3228
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:20,880
them lec's

3229
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:23,360
and um those are really nice does

3230
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:25,679
the plants are just loving the the uh

3231
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:28,079
like a 3000 r spectrum they're like

3232
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:30,639
super pimp lights but i also like some

3233
02:01:28,079 --> 02:01:34,000
uh you know good out sally leds i use

3234
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:36,800
quite a bit of leds i like um

3235
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,039
i like california light works

3236
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:41,440
uh they make really good product i've

3237
02:01:39,039 --> 02:01:43,118
had real good success i like uh

3238
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:44,158
the spider lights

3239
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:46,559
they're uh

3240
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:47,359
you know the biofluorescence spider lice

3241
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,280
uh

3242
02:01:47,359 --> 02:01:51,439
they're a little bit expensive it comes

3243
02:01:49,279 --> 02:01:54,000
up to being

3244
02:01:51,439 --> 02:01:55,839
about three dollars a watt so

3245
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,359
they're kind of prohibitive

3246
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:59,279
and now the price is finally coming

3247
02:01:57,359 --> 02:02:01,920
around and the quality is about

3248
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:03,279
the same on multiple manufacturers

3249
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:05,840
so they're coming down to about a

3250
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:07,759
thousand dollars for those 600 and 650

3251
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:10,719
watt units and

3252
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:12,079
but i also big on uh

3253
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:14,399
timber grow light

3254
02:02:12,079 --> 02:02:17,840
shout out to timber grow lights uh

3255
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:20,399
you know his 480 sams are

3256
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:22,400
very inexpensive he uses meanwhile

3257
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:24,559
drivers uh

3258
02:02:22,399 --> 02:02:27,279
they cover really good they'll replace

3259
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:30,159
uh the 480 sams will replace the 1000

3260
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:32,559
and they really are a good light i i use

3261
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:35,118
a bunch of his cobs also

3262
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:37,039
you know hundred watty meter cob some 50

3263
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:40,000
watt emitter columns because he'll sell

3264
02:02:37,039 --> 02:02:42,639
those uh kits just wire it yourself if

3265
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:45,439
you buy like a clone cabinet or a

3266
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:47,279
revenging cabinet or a breeding

3267
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:49,198
you know i've i've got the craziest

3268
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:50,719
grows because i'll have 100 projects

3269
02:02:49,198 --> 02:02:52,960
going on so

3270
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:55,279
i've got re-vegetative state going on

3271
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:57,279
and i've got multiple breeding you draw

3272
02:02:55,279 --> 02:02:58,719
them i'm all over

3273
02:02:57,279 --> 02:03:00,639
so

3274
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:04,319
i like leds for that purpose you can't

3275
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:08,000
just stick a i have quite a few uh 630

3276
02:03:04,319 --> 02:03:09,679
this the 315 watt leds too and those are

3277
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,439
really nice

3278
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:15,760
they uh

3279
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:17,759
they are not something that i would uh

3280
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:20,960
recommend you're better off i think with

3281
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:23,599
the 315s and spreading them out every uh

3282
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:26,639
two two feet two and a half feet

3283
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:29,279
versus like the twin six thirties

3284
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:31,039
i mean the twin 315s because you're just

3285
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:33,118
concentrating too much light in a little

3286
02:03:31,039 --> 02:03:37,679
central focal point

3287
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:40,479
so um i quit using those uh the 630s

3288
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:42,158
yeah okay so i mean we've talked about

3289
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:44,399
kind of genetic drift as well as

3290
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:46,479
lighting so it's it's almost inevitable

3291
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:48,960
we get to this topic but how do you feel

3292
02:03:46,479 --> 02:03:50,879
re-vegging affects a plant do you feel

3293
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,880
like there's a lasting difference

3294
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:54,639
thereafter re-veging a plant or it's

3295
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:58,239
just essentially a very time and

3296
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:58,239
efficient way of keeping a clone

3297
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:06,159
there's a lot of opinion on that and it

3298
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:08,560
it does have multiple answers um

3299
02:04:06,158 --> 02:04:11,598
i don't think that it hurts most strains

3300
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:13,440
because some strains come from

3301
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:15,760
equatorial

3302
02:04:13,439 --> 02:04:17,839
land race and you're going to see 11 to

3303
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:20,079
14 hour

3304
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:21,360
time periods that sumbitch will go into

3305
02:04:20,078 --> 02:04:24,479
uh

3306
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:26,479
it'll veg it like 14 hours and flower at

3307
02:04:24,479 --> 02:04:28,319
11 and there's a fine line in between

3308
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:30,319
there so uh

3309
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:32,799
if you're going up more towards the 36

3310
02:04:30,319 --> 02:04:37,039
parallel and you're talking about

3311
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:38,639
uh either highland or lowland indica

3312
02:04:37,039 --> 02:04:41,359
they do a different thing they they

3313
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:42,719
never do revenge their their life cycles

3314
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:44,479
over at the end of their life so they're

3315
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:45,279
genetically programmed to pretty much

3316
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:48,559
die

3317
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:51,279
i don't think re-veging any plant

3318
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:53,760
hurts it i i mean i've heard i've had

3319
02:04:51,279 --> 02:04:55,840
bunch of people that are older than me

3320
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:58,159
try to educate me and tell me these

3321
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:59,119
other things and what it will do

3322
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:02,078
um

3323
02:04:59,118 --> 02:05:05,198
i utilize it quite a bit uh re-vegging a

3324
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:07,599
plant i i found out males revenge much

3325
02:05:05,198 --> 02:05:09,919
faster than females

3326
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:11,679
ivory veg a ton of plants i don't think

3327
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,399
it hurts anything but i do believe that

3328
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:16,158
each plant's genetics are where it

3329
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:18,839
varies for if it if it is going to

3330
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:21,359
change it or hurt it it's where it came

3331
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:24,400
from yeah okay

3332
02:05:21,359 --> 02:05:26,399
and so you did mention earlier that um

3333
02:05:24,399 --> 02:05:28,479
putting plants outside is a way of

3334
02:05:26,399 --> 02:05:30,799
rejuvenating them are you ever able to

3335
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:34,638
do that in alaska or it's it's still

3336
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:36,960
rather limited the time frame

3337
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:38,880
no we have four months of solid uh

3338
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:41,198
summer we'll

3339
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:43,840
our light gains about

3340
02:05:41,198 --> 02:05:45,839
five minutes and 50 seconds a day so

3341
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:48,078
every 10 days you're looking at an hour

3342
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:49,599
of gain you know so we have this massive

3343
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:53,359
light swing

3344
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:54,880
and it's 22 and 23 hours where i'm at is

3345
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:56,799
that that's my time if you go any

3346
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:59,520
further north it's straight up 24 hours

3347
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:01,760
a light and the damn uv index is so high

3348
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:03,599
in the middle of summer it's equivalent

3349
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:05,679
of uh

3350
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:08,319
oh [ __ ] there's people that come up here

3351
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:11,199
from phoenix and san diego and it'll be

3352
02:06:08,319 --> 02:06:13,198
75 and they're telling us [ __ ] at 75

3353
02:06:11,198 --> 02:06:15,198
they're going it's at least 95 it's a

3354
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:17,519
hundred and they're dying man

3355
02:06:15,198 --> 02:06:20,158
and it's just our sun it's the angle of

3356
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:22,000
that thing and it's the uv index so you

3357
02:06:20,158 --> 02:06:24,319
have four months to where you can you

3358
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,479
can definitely regenerate a plant and

3359
02:06:24,319 --> 02:06:28,238
you oh man you can make some crazy

3360
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:30,559
bushes you won't be able to move the

3361
02:06:28,238 --> 02:06:33,039
thing and you won't have nothing don't

3362
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:34,800
have a place big enough to flower

3363
02:06:33,039 --> 02:06:36,639
yeah well okay so is that something

3364
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:38,480
you've done yourself or just thinking

3365
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:42,159
about

3366
02:06:38,479 --> 02:06:45,759
no i will um if i had a mother that

3367
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:47,679
i hammered the [ __ ] out of and uh you

3368
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:48,880
know they're so poor at that point if

3369
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:50,639
you were to put them into flower you

3370
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:52,078
will get nothing on it even if you you

3371
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:54,078
know were to seed it to do a little

3372
02:06:52,078 --> 02:06:56,559
last-ditch effort to save the genetics

3373
02:06:54,078 --> 02:06:58,399
you still really are in a bad shape so i

3374
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,440
would take like a mother that's been

3375
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:01,839
over

3376
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:03,759
cut and then give it a full four months

3377
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:05,760
and let it get to the five and six foot

3378
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:07,840
point and that it'll be almost as fresh

3379
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:10,079
as it was if it had never been beat to

3380
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:12,400
[ __ ] so that's an advantage there i do i

3381
02:07:10,078 --> 02:07:15,439
do that every summer

3382
02:07:12,399 --> 02:07:17,598
yeah okay so something i noticed on the

3383
02:07:15,439 --> 02:07:19,839
alternative end of the spectrum to the

3384
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:22,000
sun is i seen a post or two about you

3385
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:23,360
germinating plants around the moon cycle

3386
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:26,158
is that something you do frequently and

3387
02:07:23,359 --> 02:07:27,920
what type of effect do you think it has

3388
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:29,759
you know i've been told

3389
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:30,800
told by a lot of people that it's real

3390
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:32,960
proper

3391
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:35,119
and i've uh

3392
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:37,118
i've even said it's come out of my mouth

3393
02:07:35,118 --> 02:07:39,118
that i don't practice that hippie [ __ ] i

3394
02:07:37,118 --> 02:07:41,598
mean it's crazy what i've said but i've

3395
02:07:39,118 --> 02:07:44,719
contradicted myself because i

3396
02:07:41,599 --> 02:07:47,039
i do believe that the pull of the uh

3397
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:48,719
the ocean

3398
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:51,279
it has a lot to do with everything in

3399
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:53,439
nature so the magnetic fields that we

3400
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:55,198
have no understanding of period look how

3401
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:56,879
animals you know get around the whole

3402
02:07:55,198 --> 02:07:59,279
world it's it's due to that they have

3403
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:01,599
knowledge wave past our knowledge and if

3404
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:03,519
i'm dealing with old seeds that are 25

3405
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:05,920
and 30 years old some of them never were

3406
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,199
put up correctly at all

3407
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:10,078
so um

3408
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:12,399
you are uh praying to god and hoping

3409
02:08:10,078 --> 02:08:14,960
that the moon's pull will anything to

3410
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:16,638
get you through on old genetics so i

3411
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:20,158
practice that quite a bit and it's just

3412
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:22,319
a good timing a lot of time you know you

3413
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:24,638
stray fox is real aware of all the moon

3414
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:26,000
cycles i am too because i'm you know i'm

3415
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:27,840
into the uh

3416
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:29,198
farmer's almanac and fishing i know what

3417
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:31,679
every tide is because i have to know

3418
02:08:29,198 --> 02:08:33,919
where my tide book is i'm a i'm a freak

3419
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:35,599
about getting into the water and i know

3420
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:39,118
what the tide's doing at all points in

3421
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:42,000
time so the moon cycle means a lot to me

3422
02:08:39,118 --> 02:08:44,399
i mean it's it's it's a real uh

3423
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,399
important thing to know

3424
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:48,078
yeah okay so before we jump into some

3425
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:50,719
fishing stuff which we are going to get

3426
02:08:48,078 --> 02:08:52,960
to just got to quickly ask you are

3427
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:54,719
notorious for having these you know 20

3428
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:56,560
plus year old seeds that you're able to

3429
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:58,000
get to germinate what are some of your

3430
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:00,560
little tips and tricks for getting these

3431
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,560
bad boys to hatch

3432
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:04,800
you know what it all uh it just was a

3433
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:07,440
matter of luck when i first started

3434
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:09,440
putting up seeds we had no idea when we

3435
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:11,678
were going to use them i imagined a year

3436
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:14,158
or two years and

3437
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:16,319
i used 35 millimeter film containers

3438
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:17,679
which turned out to be air proof and

3439
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:19,359
waterproof

3440
02:09:17,679 --> 02:09:21,760
i'd put a little bit of a

3441
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:24,319
decanter which at the time um people

3442
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:27,039
would say and put in rice or

3443
02:09:24,319 --> 02:09:29,599
a small wadded up piece of uh like a

3444
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:31,279
paper towel so i just opted for a small

3445
02:09:29,599 --> 02:09:32,639
piece of paper towel

3446
02:09:31,279 --> 02:09:34,559
and i would generally even write the

3447
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:36,400
genetics right on the paper towel so it

3448
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:37,840
would be labeled inside maybe labeled on

3449
02:09:36,399 --> 02:09:40,000
the outside in

3450
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:42,480
a black permanent marker but

3451
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,920
one or two years i i never used them and

3452
02:09:42,479 --> 02:09:47,198
[Music]

3453
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:50,239
you know i am not one for change uh

3454
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:52,960
i've worked the same job since 87

3455
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:54,638
i've had the same house the same i raise

3456
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:57,039
american bulldogs and i've read them

3457
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:59,118
since late 80s i've never changed

3458
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:01,118
anything i like to just like keep it all

3459
02:09:59,118 --> 02:10:03,198
the same and

3460
02:10:01,118 --> 02:10:05,519
i have changed a little bit but it's

3461
02:10:03,198 --> 02:10:06,960
easy to get 30 year old genetics you

3462
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:08,250
just put them in the freezer and 30

3463
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,599
years goes by and

3464
02:10:08,250 --> 02:10:11,198
[Music]

3465
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:13,039
it

3466
02:10:11,198 --> 02:10:14,238
tends to be if you don't thaw them out

3467
02:10:13,039 --> 02:10:15,920
you're going to retain all the

3468
02:10:14,238 --> 02:10:18,718
germination

3469
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:20,639
properties i i might lose 10 percent

3470
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:22,158
germination if i thaw them out but i

3471
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:24,319
never have to thaw them out because when

3472
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:25,679
i dig through them

3473
02:10:24,319 --> 02:10:27,759
for one thing i have a commercial

3474
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:30,399
freezer and i can almost stand in the

3475
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:32,159
son of a [ __ ] and key it's 20 below so

3476
02:10:30,399 --> 02:10:33,759
i can uh

3477
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:35,039
you know i can get in there and pick

3478
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,400
[ __ ] out without thawing at the middle

3479
02:10:35,039 --> 02:10:38,000
of summer but in the middle of winter we

3480
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:39,279
got we have seven eight months to where

3481
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,118
you can just straight up grab your

3482
02:10:39,279 --> 02:10:44,078
collection and start digging through it

3483
02:10:41,118 --> 02:10:46,238
it's frozen it never does fall out so

3484
02:10:44,078 --> 02:10:48,078
people that i've sent uh you know good

3485
02:10:46,238 --> 02:10:49,919
old seeds to

3486
02:10:48,078 --> 02:10:51,679
mean jeans and

3487
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:53,520
just a bunch of them they just they're

3488
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:55,359
like instantly going

3489
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:57,199
how old did you say they were because i

3490
02:10:55,359 --> 02:10:58,559
had 100 it's better than what i just

3491
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:01,039
produced

3492
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:03,199
and it's like well they just happened to

3493
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:04,639
all fall together they were healthy ass

3494
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:05,678
good seeds

3495
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:07,679
and

3496
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,399
people didn't know the time frame on

3497
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:12,639
frozen seeds most people assume 20 years

3498
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:15,598
on marijuana seed and i've heard 30 is

3499
02:11:12,639 --> 02:11:17,920
the window but it's way way way longer

3500
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:19,920
than 30 years because i have 100

3501
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:22,639
germination at 30 years

3502
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:24,960
so um it is a it's something right there

3503
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:27,440
that needs to be explored

3504
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:29,679
it's uh exciting too because you if you

3505
02:11:27,439 --> 02:11:32,559
think about it um the joe rom cuts

3506
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:34,719
saliva 50 years well

3507
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:36,800
here shortly 20 more years i'm going to

3508
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:40,239
have 50 year old seeds that just have

3509
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:41,840
never been cracked and still ready to go

3510
02:11:40,238 --> 02:11:44,799
yeah well that's that's the real

3511
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:47,199
treasure trove there so i guess my final

3512
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,440
kind of question about alaska in general

3513
02:11:47,198 --> 02:11:51,359
is overall would you consider it a good

3514
02:11:49,439 --> 02:11:53,279
environment to be growing indoors given

3515
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:54,559
that it's got that really nice cold

3516
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:58,078
temperatures or do you think it just

3517
02:11:54,560 --> 02:12:00,079
kind of comes with its own challenges

3518
02:11:58,078 --> 02:12:03,279
yeah we're a lot more advantageous we're

3519
02:12:00,078 --> 02:12:05,118
are lucky i should say um uh

3520
02:12:03,279 --> 02:12:06,639
because you're fighting heat and every

3521
02:12:05,118 --> 02:12:09,439
every uh

3522
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:11,039
every place in america but here

3523
02:12:09,439 --> 02:12:12,719
it gets real hot in the interior here

3524
02:12:11,039 --> 02:12:14,238
it'll get to 90 and you're fighting heat

3525
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:16,480
there but

3526
02:12:14,238 --> 02:12:18,638
i know people that grow in texas it's

3527
02:12:16,479 --> 02:12:20,479
it's a pig

3528
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:21,920
the law enforcement's going to stand on

3529
02:12:20,479 --> 02:12:23,839
your head and treat it like you're a

3530
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:25,760
meth head and the [ __ ] heat you're

3531
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:27,760
going to fight there's just no way you

3532
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:29,280
could be comfortable grow in a grow room

3533
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:30,639
in texas and

3534
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:32,960
if you were cool on it you're going to

3535
02:12:30,639 --> 02:12:34,480
run a fortune in moving air or

3536
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:36,319
cool in the air so

3537
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:38,078
we have really good ambient air

3538
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:40,960
temperature

3539
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:43,039
most of the time so uh we're able to run

3540
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:45,039
a little bit hotter lights and just run

3541
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:46,238
you know run a

3542
02:12:45,039 --> 02:12:47,039
air box

3543
02:12:46,238 --> 02:12:49,439
and

3544
02:12:47,039 --> 02:12:51,279
bring in a little bit of fresh cool air

3545
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:52,319
which is generally our summer air might

3546
02:12:51,279 --> 02:12:55,439
be

3547
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:57,039
60 degrees to where

3548
02:12:55,439 --> 02:12:59,039
you can swap out your summer here and

3549
02:12:57,039 --> 02:13:01,599
keep a grow room without any big deal

3550
02:12:59,039 --> 02:13:02,560
keep it at about 75

3551
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:04,719
so

3552
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:07,199
as an advantage to growing up here we

3553
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:09,118
also never had the uh

3554
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:11,759
i'd say until two years ago we never had

3555
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:14,639
powder mildew in alaska

3556
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:16,239
never ever ever never

3557
02:13:14,639 --> 02:13:18,639
so that was a nice thing we were

3558
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:20,718
isolated but now you know with modern

3559
02:13:18,639 --> 02:13:23,359
day people trucking clones back and

3560
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:25,118
forth from pm fest uh

3561
02:13:23,359 --> 02:13:26,719
it's it's uh

3562
02:13:25,118 --> 02:13:29,439
it's common that now we're all

3563
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:31,679
infiltrated and

3564
02:13:29,439 --> 02:13:34,399
um now i imagine next will be the

3565
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:37,440
dudding disease did you hear about uh

3566
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:40,238
dark horse nursery just found a cure uh

3567
02:13:37,439 --> 02:13:42,879
a viral a viroid that is uh

3568
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:45,919
the name of the bud the deading

3569
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:48,319
is figured out it's a hops disease i

3570
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:49,920
thought that it was and

3571
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:52,559
they actually know how to eradicate it

3572
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:55,279
now so there's tests for it and

3573
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:56,719
people with all that dudding or

3574
02:13:55,279 --> 02:13:58,078
there's a couple other names that they

3575
02:13:56,719 --> 02:13:59,520
call it you know they're figuring that

3576
02:13:58,078 --> 02:14:01,679
out so

3577
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,159
right about the time that [ __ ] hits here

3578
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:06,399
we'll actually have a cure for it

3579
02:14:04,158 --> 02:14:07,920
yeah yeah i saw that post it's

3580
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:09,839
interesting because i think what they

3581
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:11,840
were trying to say was that it's some

3582
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:14,400
you know specified way of doing

3583
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:16,319
essentially a meristem culture which is

3584
02:14:14,399 --> 02:14:18,479
interesting because i mean having spoken

3585
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:20,158
to a few people a few guys have got

3586
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:22,000
dotted clones that they're still hanging

3587
02:14:20,158 --> 02:14:24,238
on to because they're so old like you

3588
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,039
know the original calio and stuff like

3589
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:27,118
that

3590
02:14:25,039 --> 02:14:29,920
just to just to sidestep that point for

3591
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:32,000
one sec overall what do you think is the

3592
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:34,319
most important factor in a grower out of

3593
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,279
the three possibilities genetics

3594
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:39,519
environment or the growers skill

3595
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:40,719
environment

3596
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:42,639
yeah

3597
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:44,639
because uh

3598
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:46,800
you know you can make shitty genetics

3599
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:51,199
shine if your environment's perfect and

3600
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:51,199
it doesn't take much skill to uh to grow

3601
02:14:51,359 --> 02:14:55,759
yeah definitely i would like to have

3602
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:57,118
perfect genetics for sure because

3603
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:58,719
you could have the best genetics but

3604
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:00,399
what if you just stick it in the [ __ ]

3605
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:01,679
whole environment and then everything's

3606
02:15:00,399 --> 02:15:03,598
gone

3607
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:06,880
uh and you could still just like be an

3608
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:09,760
um you know idiot and grow i think it's

3609
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:11,679
a weed it's it's um

3610
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:13,920
that's one of the advantages of growing

3611
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:16,078
cannabis is that it's resilient and it

3612
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,319
gives you hundreds of breaks

3613
02:15:16,078 --> 02:15:20,238
lets you like live a very complacent

3614
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:21,519
life and you don't even realize how much

3615
02:15:20,238 --> 02:15:24,078
it's given you

3616
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,880
yes certainly certainly

3617
02:15:24,078 --> 02:15:27,118
so

3618
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:28,960
just to kind of loop back to your

3619
02:15:27,118 --> 02:15:31,359
breeding for a moment the topic of

3620
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,639
feminized seeds has certainly come up

3621
02:15:31,359 --> 02:15:35,039
is that something you're looking to

3622
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:36,719
explore more and which of the various

3623
02:15:35,039 --> 02:15:38,800
feminization methods would you want to

3624
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:42,800
pursue out of like the colloidal silver

3625
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:44,800
the sts or like the gibberellic acid

3626
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,679
that's cool that you brought that up too

3627
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:50,480
because in uh

3628
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:54,319
in 88 we uh

3629
02:15:50,479 --> 02:15:56,319
i was growing tomatoes and

3630
02:15:54,319 --> 02:15:58,880
at the time we had waco

3631
02:15:56,319 --> 02:16:01,599
and uh we

3632
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:03,118
i was growing the tomatoes and the

3633
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:06,159
cannabis together

3634
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:08,078
and i was trying to get the tomato

3635
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:09,039
blossoms to set so

3636
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:11,679
one

3637
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:13,679
of the tomato sets is just a

3638
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:16,319
um gibralic acid just straight up

3639
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:19,199
hormone they sell as it's called um set

3640
02:16:16,319 --> 02:16:20,880
spray or something and

3641
02:16:19,198 --> 02:16:22,799
i spray that [ __ ] all over my tomato

3642
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:24,960
plants no more blossoms hit the ground

3643
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:27,520
the tomatoes stretched you know

3644
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:29,520
three feet and the spray got onto a

3645
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:31,440
couple of uh

3646
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:33,760
jamaican plants of all things let's grow

3647
02:16:31,439 --> 02:16:36,079
them in a greenhouse [ __ ] jamaican

3648
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:39,359
gets against brelic acid on it so the

3649
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:41,200
thing goes to a vine and

3650
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:43,439
i thought it was cool it changed the

3651
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:45,359
leaf structure and turned the stems red

3652
02:16:43,439 --> 02:16:47,200
like like

3653
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:50,719
zero uh

3654
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:52,960
like a magnesium deficiency and uh

3655
02:16:50,718 --> 02:16:54,638
low phosphorus it was like

3656
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:57,199
how wild so i started spraying it on

3657
02:16:54,638 --> 02:17:00,000
everything and my waco plants

3658
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:01,280
uh reversed and we made a big batch of

3659
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,879
seeds

3660
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:04,000
and we grew out we thought it was the

3661
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:05,839
coolest thing in the world because we

3662
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,439
knew at that point in time you could

3663
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:10,159
find a little bit of information i think

3664
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:12,639
ed rosenthal had some [ __ ] about uh

3665
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:14,959
feminized seeds and uh

3666
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:18,478
nothing about chemically induced though

3667
02:17:14,959 --> 02:17:20,558
it was always about just natural uh

3668
02:17:18,478 --> 02:17:21,840
you know late season flowers when the

3669
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:23,199
things trying to save its own life and

3670
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:24,880
it generally come from equatorial

3671
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:27,519
varieties which at the time that's what

3672
02:17:24,879 --> 02:17:30,558
a lot of our genetics were at over 50

3673
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:31,760
percent 75 percent had thai or colombian

3674
02:17:30,558 --> 02:17:34,318
or

3675
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:35,519
burmese or any of the equatorial even

3676
02:17:34,318 --> 02:17:37,599
africans

3677
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:38,880
uh and those things

3678
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:41,439
will always start that late season

3679
02:17:38,879 --> 02:17:44,000
banana to save their own life and

3680
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:44,800
that's what i knew as to be female seeds

3681
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,959
so

3682
02:17:44,799 --> 02:17:49,039
i saw these and figured it out we grew

3683
02:17:46,959 --> 02:17:50,879
them they were all females and

3684
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:53,439
you know it didn't reverse it didn't

3685
02:17:50,879 --> 02:17:55,679
feminize as good it was not as good i

3686
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:57,439
should say as the mother so

3687
02:17:55,679 --> 02:17:59,359
while it was all female we didn't see a

3688
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:01,200
value in it and we never looked back

3689
02:17:59,359 --> 02:18:04,000
from 88 on

3690
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:06,479
i never looked back period and then

3691
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,519
you know five ten years about five years

3692
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:12,478
ago that um feminized movement just

3693
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:14,239
crazily took off and

3694
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:15,760
i just watched and watched well man

3695
02:18:14,239 --> 02:18:17,920
these guys are [ __ ] up everything

3696
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:20,239
because i know that um

3697
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:22,000
unless everything's tracked you can't

3698
02:18:20,239 --> 02:18:25,599
generally breed to any of this stuff

3699
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:27,439
past s1 you're screwed so uh

3700
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:29,120
i realized that it was watering down

3701
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:30,800
everything badly i didn't really want to

3702
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,359
get into it i kind of followed people

3703
02:18:30,799 --> 02:18:35,599
doing it but um recently i did grab some

3704
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:38,239
sts spray sprayed a durvan down and i

3705
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:41,200
was gonna just do a derby female

3706
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:42,000
reversal or make german feminized and

3707
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:44,639
just

3708
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,718
just for the shits and grins i guess but

3709
02:18:44,638 --> 02:18:48,558
it took five weeks for the uh

3710
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:51,119
pollen to actually come out so i just

3711
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:55,119
feminized a lemon tree and an orange

3712
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:57,519
tree the 17 high times san bernardino uh

3713
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:59,920
sativa winner was the orange tree and

3714
02:18:57,519 --> 02:19:02,478
nobody disputes the lemon tree as being

3715
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:04,398
like over the top of lemon skunk with

3716
02:19:02,478 --> 02:19:07,039
that you know the [ __ ] sour diesel

3717
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:08,718
back it's it's one of the best

3718
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,280
and i just figured it'd be like cool

3719
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:13,438
with the terps of the durbin mixed in

3720
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:15,599
with those and

3721
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:17,439
i did mess with it but you know i don't

3722
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:18,639
put too much value in it the seeds are

3723
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:20,639
sitting there i never thought about

3724
02:19:18,638 --> 02:19:22,000
crack and i'd give them to anybody or

3725
02:19:20,638 --> 02:19:23,759
something if somebody wanted to play

3726
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,679
with it because i'm not

3727
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:27,120
i'm not thinking it's helping the

3728
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:28,960
the genetics

3729
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:30,079
at all

3730
02:19:28,959 --> 02:19:30,879
yeah okay

3731
02:19:30,079 --> 02:19:33,200
so

3732
02:19:30,879 --> 02:19:35,358
touching on that topic how important is

3733
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:38,240
it in your mind for a breeder to give

3734
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:39,760
away seeds and i guess specifically when

3735
02:19:38,239 --> 02:19:42,959
they're kind of starting out do you feel

3736
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:45,120
like that's a part of paying your jews

3737
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:47,598
yeah that should be a

3738
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:49,760
good way to build a um you know a

3739
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:51,280
clientele and uh

3740
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:52,960
you make a lot of friends out of it i'll

3741
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:55,600
tell you that much and you get a lot

3742
02:19:52,959 --> 02:19:57,438
more love back than you would ever think

3743
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:59,359
so it's a it's

3744
02:19:57,439 --> 02:20:01,520
a real good thing

3745
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:03,200
as an extension of that idea what would

3746
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:04,960
be your advice for someone who's just

3747
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:08,319
starting out wants to kind of get a bit

3748
02:20:04,959 --> 02:20:11,919
more established in terms of a breeder

3749
02:20:08,318 --> 02:20:13,519
i would say do their homework and get

3750
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:17,439
a line

3751
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:19,520
or or or collect genetics that can be

3752
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:22,398
advanced

3753
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:25,120
and can go somewhere not just

3754
02:20:22,398 --> 02:20:27,079
another uh

3755
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:30,640
another poly hybrid that is

3756
02:20:27,079 --> 02:20:32,478
multi-generational poly hybrid they're

3757
02:20:30,639 --> 02:20:34,719
they're actually at a point of a

3758
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:37,358
bottleneck so tight right now with 10

3759
02:20:34,719 --> 02:20:40,079
years of that going on that

3760
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:42,640
a new breeder should gear up and try to

3761
02:20:40,079 --> 02:20:45,200
select

3762
02:20:42,639 --> 02:20:46,799
something that is unique and different

3763
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:48,960
if it can be done

3764
02:20:46,799 --> 02:20:50,398
and uh if not you're just jumping on the

3765
02:20:48,959 --> 02:20:51,519
bandwagon with everybody else you're

3766
02:20:50,398 --> 02:20:54,478
going to be left in the dust because

3767
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:56,399
it's been done 10 000 times

3768
02:20:54,478 --> 02:20:58,959
and as kind of a final thought to wrap

3769
02:20:56,398 --> 02:21:01,599
this topic up what's your thoughts on

3770
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:04,559
the exponential rise in breeders we see

3771
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:05,920
collectively within the community

3772
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:08,879
well i don't know everybody has the

3773
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:11,600
right to breed so

3774
02:21:08,879 --> 02:21:13,599
if everybody had the same goals it would

3775
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:17,680
be uh

3776
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:20,000
it'd be a huge advantage but um

3777
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:23,439
that's never going to happen so

3778
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:28,559
we are humans and we are all like um

3779
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:29,920
on our own path so i see it going

3780
02:21:28,559 --> 02:21:31,119
you know

3781
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:36,079
between

3782
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:38,079
corporate and maybe trademarking and

3783
02:21:36,079 --> 02:21:40,159
that the way it could go that direction

3784
02:21:38,079 --> 02:21:42,478
i'd rather see independent people doing

3785
02:21:40,159 --> 02:21:44,079
it and just everybody do it at that

3786
02:21:42,478 --> 02:21:45,438
point

3787
02:21:44,079 --> 02:21:47,520
yeah definitely

3788
02:21:45,439 --> 02:21:51,040
so what type of breeders would you like

3789
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:51,040
to work with going forward

3790
02:21:52,318 --> 02:21:57,600
just the guys that i work with right now

3791
02:21:55,040 --> 02:22:00,319
librarians that um

3792
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:02,880
they paid their dues and they were there

3793
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:05,279
at the time uh

3794
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:06,639
and uh they put in their

3795
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:09,359
you know 100

3796
02:22:06,639 --> 02:22:11,439
to get us where we are right now

3797
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:15,359
that's people that i value the most old

3798
02:22:11,439 --> 02:22:17,920
heads and people that saw the value

3799
02:22:15,359 --> 02:22:22,000
you know 50 years ago

3800
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:24,398
and then all the people with heart

3801
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:26,799
that's all i don't need to uh

3802
02:22:24,398 --> 02:22:29,920
i work for a living and you know i could

3803
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:31,679
retire anytime i don't give a [ __ ] uh

3804
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:33,840
about trying to make a bunch of money

3805
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:35,359
because i've worked a steady day job you

3806
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:36,639
know that old saying don't quit your day

3807
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:38,079
job well

3808
02:22:36,639 --> 02:22:40,559
i'm [ __ ]

3809
02:22:38,079 --> 02:22:43,840
august of uh

3810
02:22:40,559 --> 02:22:46,879
august of this year's like 34

3811
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:48,478
years working down there so uh

3812
02:22:46,879 --> 02:22:49,679
i've always had a different view than

3813
02:22:48,478 --> 02:22:51,920
everybody else people are growing and

3814
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:54,559
selling their buds i've never sold my

3815
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:56,719
buds i did i might sell a cover a light

3816
02:22:54,559 --> 02:22:58,478
bill but i grew for myself and only to

3817
02:22:56,719 --> 02:23:01,679
further my genetics and that was my only

3818
02:22:58,478 --> 02:23:03,438
my mindset for 30 and 35 years

3819
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:05,200
so um i don't think the same way

3820
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:07,680
everybody else thinks

3821
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:08,960
but i'd go with anybody with heart mean

3822
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:12,159
gene

3823
02:23:08,959 --> 02:23:13,438
dirt farmer um

3824
02:23:12,159 --> 02:23:16,159
dynasty

3825
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:19,359
mafestos these are all people that are

3826
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:21,119
like they got your back and uh

3827
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:22,960
there's a shitload of them way too many

3828
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:24,960
to mention i would i

3829
02:23:22,959 --> 02:23:26,239
would hurt i'd be a total ass if i

3830
02:23:24,959 --> 02:23:27,679
didn't just come up with 20 of them

3831
02:23:26,239 --> 02:23:29,199
right now

3832
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:30,398
because they're all like i want to work

3833
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:32,720
with every one of them because they're

3834
02:23:30,398 --> 02:23:34,159
just good people

3835
02:23:32,719 --> 02:23:36,000
yeah certainly it's always one of those

3836
02:23:34,159 --> 02:23:38,559
things we don't want to leave anyone out

3837
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,959
but something i do want to greatly echo

3838
02:23:38,559 --> 02:23:42,879
the sentiment you just expressed is

3839
02:23:40,959 --> 02:23:44,959
especially in australia please guys have

3840
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:47,039
a day job you know it don't make this

3841
02:23:44,959 --> 02:23:48,239
your full-time gig because

3842
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:50,560
frankly you're going to have to

3843
02:23:48,239 --> 02:23:51,760
compromise things to make money instead

3844
02:23:50,559 --> 02:23:53,199
of following the passion and i think

3845
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:55,280
that's where the best results come from

3846
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:57,840
when you're pursuing passion and not

3847
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:58,880
necessity-based things but to get back

3848
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:01,359
on track

3849
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:03,039
i wanted to quickly ask you what land

3850
02:24:01,359 --> 02:24:06,559
race is your favorite and do you have

3851
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:08,479
any plans to work with it going forward

3852
02:24:06,559 --> 02:24:11,439
i would have to say tai because i said

3853
02:24:08,478 --> 02:24:12,398
it's just that one crazy ass good memory

3854
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:14,639
and

3855
02:24:12,398 --> 02:24:17,199
i know the potential that's there and

3856
02:24:14,639 --> 02:24:19,760
i'm at a point where

3857
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:22,079
i've been offered so many things and

3858
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:23,520
i've passed up on opportunities i should

3859
02:24:22,079 --> 02:24:25,680
have took up

3860
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:28,960
and i do have a shitload of um you know

3861
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:30,639
good land race and uh

3862
02:24:28,959 --> 02:24:31,679
definitely need to dig into a bunch of

3863
02:24:30,639 --> 02:24:33,439
it but

3864
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:35,200
i would say thai is what i would try

3865
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:37,520
i've tried really cool things and might

3866
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:40,399
dig i've got some 77 himalayan that's

3867
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:42,159
single stocked sativa and it's uh one of

3868
02:24:40,398 --> 02:24:44,799
the few single stocks that i've been

3869
02:24:42,159 --> 02:24:46,879
able to come across except nl1

3870
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:49,679
and it's a sativa too so that's one

3871
02:24:46,879 --> 02:24:50,959
thing that i think is pretty unique uh

3872
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:52,559
and uh

3873
02:24:50,959 --> 02:24:54,079
i like to

3874
02:24:52,559 --> 02:24:58,478
i like those unique

3875
02:24:54,079 --> 02:25:00,318
uh genetics uh stray fox made up some uh

3876
02:24:58,478 --> 02:25:02,639
used black affy i think which which was

3877
02:25:00,318 --> 02:25:05,359
bodhis and um

3878
02:25:02,639 --> 02:25:08,159
uh iraqi indica and when i grew that out

3879
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:10,640
it was all like 13 finger fan leafs with

3880
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:12,959
single stock growth and super dominant

3881
02:25:10,639 --> 02:25:14,959
so those are the things that i want to

3882
02:25:12,959 --> 02:25:16,559
work with right there

3883
02:25:14,959 --> 02:25:18,159
yeah okay and generally speaking would

3884
02:25:16,559 --> 02:25:20,159
you consider yourself more of an indica

3885
02:25:18,159 --> 02:25:23,760
or a sativa guy

3886
02:25:20,159 --> 02:25:26,559
you know i'd probably say 50 50 because

3887
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:28,159
i like knock down drag out um indicas

3888
02:25:26,559 --> 02:25:31,119
but they're not going to let you get

3889
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:34,239
anything done you better have a

3890
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:36,720
[ __ ] couch to nap on or a four shot

3891
02:25:34,239 --> 02:25:38,639
espresso waiting after you smoke some

3892
02:25:36,719 --> 02:25:40,559
mac you know because uh

3893
02:25:38,639 --> 02:25:43,279
you're not gonna be doing a whole lot

3894
02:25:40,559 --> 02:25:46,079
you smoke some chocolope or my uh

3895
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:48,319
tropolope that that space jill and

3896
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:51,120
chocolope some things like that

3897
02:25:48,318 --> 02:25:52,799
you'll be way ripping ass high and still

3898
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:56,800
get everything done

3899
02:25:52,799 --> 02:25:56,799
and then maybe uh sing a little bit and

3900
02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:02,560
groove to the music a little more

3901
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:06,159
i love it sounds right up my alley so

3902
02:26:02,559 --> 02:26:08,879
it's uh it's funny you mention that um

3903
02:26:06,159 --> 02:26:10,879
the mac you know it it's interesting

3904
02:26:08,879 --> 02:26:12,398
because max not only like the flavor of

3905
02:26:10,879 --> 02:26:15,039
the month but you know there's that kind

3906
02:26:12,398 --> 02:26:17,199
of story of we're not really a story but

3907
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:19,040
there's the incidence of you you're not

3908
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:20,479
only collecting like a really impressive

3909
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:22,479
amount of pollen but you know you kind

3910
02:26:20,478 --> 02:26:24,398
of sent it out far and right far and

3911
02:26:22,478 --> 02:26:26,719
wide which in my opinion really quite

3912
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:28,799
noble and our buddy organically enhanced

3913
02:26:26,719 --> 02:26:30,559
here in australia even he managed to

3914
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:32,000
make some crosses with that pollen so i

3915
02:26:30,559 --> 02:26:34,079
guess my question is

3916
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,639
what made you decide to share it because

3917
02:26:34,079 --> 02:26:38,959
you know it's such high demand and um

3918
02:26:36,639 --> 02:26:39,680
you know the explosive popularity of cap

3919
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:42,000
is

3920
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:43,359
you know just you can't even deny it at

3921
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,879
the moment so what's your thoughts on

3922
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:47,600
the mac and why do you decide to share

3923
02:26:44,879 --> 02:26:49,199
the pollen with people

3924
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:51,840
that's super cool you brought that up

3925
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:54,479
for a couple reasons i did that because

3926
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:56,880
i had already been in contact with mac

3927
02:26:54,478 --> 02:26:59,438
i mean cap and uh

3928
02:26:56,879 --> 02:27:01,279
i wasn't gonna buy no i mean it's

3929
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:02,800
i've never been in a rec store i'll kind

3930
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:04,399
of go down this road i've never been in

3931
02:27:02,799 --> 02:27:07,279
a rec store up here or in any other

3932
02:27:04,398 --> 02:27:08,959
place and i i have bought seeds like i

3933
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:11,120
did i bought you know the platinum

3934
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:14,318
huckleberry

3935
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:16,000
from uh a seed bank and then i bought i

3936
02:27:14,318 --> 02:27:17,920
might have bought a dozen packs of seeds

3937
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,520
but i've been given maybe a thousand

3938
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:21,600
packs of seeds from

3939
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:23,120
the best breeders in the world and it's

3940
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:24,399
the top of their line where it's the

3941
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:25,920
best dash

3942
02:27:24,398 --> 02:27:28,840
and uh

3943
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:32,879
that right there is like so heartfelt so

3944
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:34,799
uh when i seen how cap was giving that

3945
02:27:32,879 --> 02:27:36,799
away and it already run for a year and a

3946
02:27:34,799 --> 02:27:38,239
half [ __ ] and talk about you're the mac

3947
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:40,559
right i

3948
02:27:38,239 --> 02:27:42,559
i was kind of like a little bit spiteful

3949
02:27:40,559 --> 02:27:43,359
and i was like

3950
02:27:42,559 --> 02:27:45,600
uh

3951
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:47,920
i got it given to me and i figured i'd

3952
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:50,000
read with it and offer any extra so i i

3953
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:52,639
ended up you know putting a shout out to

3954
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:54,318
locals only and i ended up getting hit

3955
02:27:52,639 --> 02:27:55,358
up by everybody in the world i sent that

3956
02:27:54,318 --> 02:27:58,959
to

3957
02:27:55,359 --> 02:28:00,479
thailand india australia canada

3958
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:03,039
um

3959
02:28:00,478 --> 02:28:04,799
i think nine uh eight or nine countries

3960
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:06,800
i sent that to and then sent it to a

3961
02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:09,279
dozen places in america got like 20

3962
02:28:06,799 --> 02:28:11,039
grams of the of the pollen it was crazy

3963
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:13,520
wanting to dump pollen

3964
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:15,520
and i figured i was being a wise ass i

3965
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:17,439
put a post up said

3966
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:18,720
um end of the year with a mac or

3967
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:20,000
something just giving it out and people

3968
02:28:18,719 --> 02:28:22,159
are going there always has to be that

3969
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,439
one guy that has to ruin everything good

3970
02:28:22,159 --> 02:28:24,959
and i was like

3971
02:28:23,439 --> 02:28:27,359
you know if you ain't had your run with

3972
02:28:24,959 --> 02:28:29,438
mac at this point [ __ ]

3973
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:32,318
i mean it's for free anybody can get it

3974
02:28:29,439 --> 02:28:34,079
for free um the main cut so

3975
02:28:32,318 --> 02:28:35,920
i thought because everybody was going

3976
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:38,639
man i'll never ever get in line you have

3977
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:40,000
to get on his list and you have to wait

3978
02:28:38,639 --> 02:28:41,760
and wait if you're lucky enough to ever

3979
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:43,439
get it or get in mine at an event that

3980
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,520
he might release something and they just

3981
02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:47,600
go i'll never ever see it in our

3982
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:48,479
lifetime over here and i'd love to try

3983
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:50,720
it

3984
02:28:48,478 --> 02:28:52,318
and i just like you know what

3985
02:28:50,719 --> 02:28:54,239
if you're not the guy that would help

3986
02:28:52,318 --> 02:28:56,478
out those people you're a dick i don't

3987
02:28:54,239 --> 02:28:58,318
care uh that [ __ ] i think i lost my ass

3988
02:28:56,478 --> 02:29:00,318
sending that out it's like 30 40 bucks a

3989
02:28:58,318 --> 02:29:01,680
pack to send international even if it's

3990
02:29:00,318 --> 02:29:02,639
pollen you know

3991
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:05,359
but

3992
02:29:02,639 --> 02:29:07,119
whether i got love back or not i uh

3993
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:08,960
i figured i helped them people out

3994
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,439
unless it was like going to india and

3995
02:29:08,959 --> 02:29:12,799
getting bred to you know land race [ __ ]

3996
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:14,398
but

3997
02:29:12,799 --> 02:29:16,079
they they promised me they're keeping it

3998
02:29:14,398 --> 02:29:17,599
for their own personal you know

3999
02:29:16,079 --> 02:29:20,159
collection because they can never get

4000
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:22,239
their hands on the back

4001
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:24,478
it's certainly one of those very sought

4002
02:29:22,239 --> 02:29:26,478
after ones with that being said though

4003
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:28,879
you know we see things like the gmo

4004
02:29:26,478 --> 02:29:30,719
having run its course and the skittles

4005
02:29:28,879 --> 02:29:32,799
and even mac appears to be kind of

4006
02:29:30,719 --> 02:29:34,239
reaching the end of its life cycle

4007
02:29:32,799 --> 02:29:35,759
what's your prediction for the newest

4008
02:29:34,239 --> 02:29:37,840
flavor of the month and would you ever

4009
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:41,600
try to kind of get ahead of the curb and

4010
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:41,600
cash in on the correct prediction

4011
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:46,398
you know i don't think i care to ever

4012
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:49,200
chase a dollar i would

4013
02:29:46,398 --> 02:29:52,719
i'd rather go fishing and uh

4014
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:56,319
i i think what the next biggest thing is

4015
02:29:52,719 --> 02:29:58,559
is going to be exotics flavors um

4016
02:29:56,318 --> 02:30:00,559
some of the spice island type of flavors

4017
02:29:58,559 --> 02:30:03,119
man if we could ever get a cinnamon girl

4018
02:30:00,559 --> 02:30:06,159
back or some of the polynesian flavors

4019
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:07,760
there's some really good spicy nutmeg

4020
02:30:06,159 --> 02:30:10,478
flavors and

4021
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:13,920
another one i would be nuts about and uh

4022
02:30:10,478 --> 02:30:15,039
passion fruits and hawaiian exotic

4023
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:16,239
fruits

4024
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:18,479
and i do believe there's going to be a

4025
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:20,639
huge resurgence of blueberry i mean

4026
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:23,519
orange is so

4027
02:30:20,639 --> 02:30:26,159
roadkill run over and burnt out some

4028
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:28,319
people still dig the terp but uh you

4029
02:30:26,159 --> 02:30:30,799
know it was orange and then it was lemon

4030
02:30:28,318 --> 02:30:32,239
and uh i still really dig the lemon tree

4031
02:30:30,799 --> 02:30:34,000
something fierce i'm growing like lemon

4032
02:30:32,239 --> 02:30:35,760
ice pucker and it's like a quarter of

4033
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,520
the good what uh

4034
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:40,880
the lemon tree is and then i've heard

4035
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:43,600
the lemon royale from swamp boys is like

4036
02:30:40,879 --> 02:30:45,679
off the hook good so i'm super tempted

4037
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:47,760
to uh you know check that out but i

4038
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:50,079
think i would love to get ahead of the

4039
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:53,120
game in the curve and produce passion

4040
02:30:50,079 --> 02:30:55,359
fruit or any of the guava

4041
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:57,760
something that's new and exotic not just

4042
02:30:55,359 --> 02:31:00,000
that um

4043
02:30:57,760 --> 02:31:01,680
flipping cookie you know what there's a

4044
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:03,200
hundred cookie crosses and you taste the

4045
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:05,840
cookie and every one of them and it's so

4046
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:07,439
[ __ ] blah i mean i was turning people

4047
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:09,120
on that never seen it before and they go

4048
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:11,680
is that the same as that other one we

4049
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:13,200
just tried i said well it's half the

4050
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:15,439
same and then the next would be the same

4051
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:17,680
answer it's half the same it's cause i

4052

cabbage pollen and he knocked his

4073
02:32:06,239 --> 02:32:11,760
666 up and made the 777 and i guess

4074
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:13,200
that's also symbol for heaven and hell

4075

which i don't follow any of that

4076

get into some uh sours

4083
02:32:30,559 --> 02:32:33,199
and uh

4084
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:36,000
mix turks too

4085
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:38,240
i want to have a front of one flavor and

4086
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:40,079
heavy back of another but i think all

4087
02:32:38,239 --> 02:32:42,559
weed should have equal alpha and beta

4088
02:32:40,079 --> 02:32:45,439
terpenes if you cannot produce this

4089
02:32:42,559 --> 02:32:46,959
quit growing weed

4090
02:32:45,439 --> 02:32:48,800
definitely that diversity within

4091
02:32:46,959 --> 02:32:51,358
terpenes is huge

4092
02:32:48,799 --> 02:32:54,000
you you said the golden words in the

4093
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:55,520
midst of a description you said

4094
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,799
orange has been

4095
02:32:55,520 --> 02:33:00,319
ran over it's the road kill gotta ask

4096
02:32:58,799 --> 02:33:02,639
about it do you have any experiences

4097
02:33:00,318 --> 02:33:05,039
with the roadkill skunk

4098
02:33:02,639 --> 02:33:07,039
um we didn't ever call it roadkill but

4099
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:10,000
we had a shitload of scout because we

4100
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:12,399
bought you know big skunk from uh from

4101
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:15,280
sense he was half real skunk and whether

4102
02:33:12,398 --> 02:33:17,279
some were sweet phenos there was still

4103
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:20,560
a quarter of a more skunk phenos and

4104
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:23,120
then in 91 we bought the super skunk so

4105
02:33:20,559 --> 02:33:24,239
super skunk to me to this day is still

4106
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:25,520
the

4107
02:33:24,239 --> 02:33:27,680
um

4108
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:29,680
the only plant i think you can go back

4109
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:32,159
to that has the old what people call

4110
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:35,359
road kill skunk but true scum

4111
02:33:32,159 --> 02:33:36,559
i call it true spunk but yes i have old

4112
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:38,399

4113
02:33:36,559 --> 02:33:39,920
that's crazy as [ __ ] how i might have

4114
02:33:38,398 --> 02:33:42,318
old genetics but

4115
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:44,318
i've got original uh

4116
02:33:42,318 --> 02:33:45,359

4117
02:33:44,318 --> 02:33:49,760

02:34:52,239 --> 02:34:55,840
i love scoring the [ __ ] that it'll turn

4149
02:34:54,398 --> 02:34:58,239
her nose

4150
02:34:55,840 --> 02:35:00,719
that's that's a great description so

4151
02:34:58,239 --> 02:35:02,398
while we're kind of on the skunk topic

4152
02:35:00,719 --> 02:35:04,318
tell us a little bit about your skunk

4153
02:35:02,398 --> 02:35:06,719
cabbage or cabbage however you want to

4154
02:35:04,318 --> 02:35:07,920
pronounce it yeah it's cabbage but

4155
02:35:06,719 --> 02:35:10,478
everybody in the world is going to call

4156
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:12,079
it cabbage i it's a funny thing so i

4157
02:35:10,478 --> 02:35:14,159
just let him let him be you know

4158
02:35:12,079 --> 02:35:15,680
whatever you want to call it

4159
02:35:14,159 --> 02:35:17,520
um

4160
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:20,479
it's just um

4161
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:22,800
crazy training chocolate but

4162
02:35:20,478 --> 02:35:24,639
it's off the hook it puts what it's like

4163
02:35:22,799 --> 02:35:26,398
if you were to breed the 91 white and it

4164
02:35:24,639 --> 02:35:28,719
puts white on anything

4165
02:35:26,398 --> 02:35:32,239
this [ __ ] will put white on anything

4166
02:35:28,719 --> 02:35:34,159
but it uh it has really rotten uh skunky

4167
02:35:32,239 --> 02:35:36,159
terps plus because there's a plant

4168
02:35:34,159 --> 02:35:37,680
called skunk cabbage that's up here real

4169
02:35:36,159 --> 02:35:39,439
prevalent and it's the first thing that

4170
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:41,760
grows in the summer and it produces its

4171
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:43,840
own heat melts the snow bank around it

4172
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:45,760
and then the bears come along and the

4173
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:47,680
deer and the bear we have we have like

4174
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:49,200
implanted deer that have made it up here

4175
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:51,359
since uh

4176
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:52,479
it's been 90 years or 80 years they've

4177
02:35:51,359 --> 02:35:54,318
been up here

4178
02:35:52,478 --> 02:35:56,000
but um first thing they can find to eat

4179
02:35:54,318 --> 02:35:57,760
is that skunk cabbage but it melts its

4180
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:59,920
own way out of a snow bank from

4181
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:01,840
producing its own fire so when we

4182
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:02,879
you know kind of put that together the

4183
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:05,680
fire

4184
02:36:02,879 --> 02:36:07,599
side of it and the rank-ness of it

4185
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:09,040
people actually smell skunk cabbage and

4186
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:10,800
have come back and told me is that how

4187
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:12,479
you name that it's like that is half of

4188
02:36:10,799 --> 02:36:15,119
why i named it that yes i didn't know

4189
02:36:12,478 --> 02:36:17,119
that tom hill had a skunk cabbage so

4190
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:19,600
just embarrassing for me to you know

4191
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:21,680
call it that for years and then find out

4192
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:23,520
i seem like bean hoarder or something

4193
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:25,280
that has like all these tom hill things

4194
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:26,720
and it's like oh skunk cabbage i'm an

4195
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:28,319
idiot

4196
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:30,079
but that's why i changed it with the

4197
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:33,279
cube because it was out of crazy train

4198
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:35,680
from the tga side of it and uh

4199
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:36,880
i i've separated it that way

4200
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:39,200
but

4201
02:36:36,879 --> 02:36:41,519
it's my go-to if i want to get stoned

4202
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:43,920
you know if i'm smoking 15 this satin

4203
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:45,840
the other all day long and

4204
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:47,280
i can take three hits of that and it'll

4205
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:48,239
over

4206
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:50,640
ride

4207
02:36:48,239 --> 02:36:52,639
all 15 joints of the 15

4208
02:36:50,639 --> 02:36:55,199
but it's it's probably my uh

4209
02:36:52,639 --> 02:36:57,519
my cannabinoid system my endocannabinoid

4210
02:36:55,200 --> 02:37:00,159
system is probably

4211
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:02,640
just geared up for that terp cross and i

4212
02:37:00,159 --> 02:37:04,959
did have the highest in-state terp test

4213
02:37:02,639 --> 02:37:05,840
ever about three or four years ago and

4214
02:37:04,959 --> 02:37:08,000
also

4215
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:09,280
i was told in canada at the biggest lab

4216
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,318
up there it's hit the third highest

4217
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:11,280
terpene

4218
02:37:10,318 --> 02:37:12,559
uh

4219
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:14,720
um

4220
02:37:12,559 --> 02:37:15,600
chirping numbers on the biggest lab up

4221
02:37:14,719 --> 02:37:17,519
there

4222
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:18,960
but you know saying that doesn't make a

4223
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:21,280
lot of sense because canada's five or

4224
02:37:18,959 --> 02:37:23,759
six or seven provinces and

4225
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:26,720
[ __ ] one million labs so

4226
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:28,880
yeah i was told by somebody it hit top

4227
02:37:26,719 --> 02:37:30,318
three out of the biggest lab up there

4228
02:37:28,879 --> 02:37:33,599
so

4229
02:37:30,318 --> 02:37:35,199
wow very impressive got some funk to it

4230
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:36,800
uh and

4231
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:38,240
i kind of just dig it it's something

4232
02:37:36,799 --> 02:37:40,398
that i probably won't ever go without

4233
02:37:38,239 --> 02:37:42,398
i've sent it to people like

4234
02:37:40,398 --> 02:37:45,599
a bunch of people i gave it to bodie and

4235
02:37:42,398 --> 02:37:47,119
uh um i think story and doc and somebody

4236
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:49,680
give it to me and gene i know i gave it

4237
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:51,040
to pharmacy factory and i give it to

4238
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:53,120
ever i don't give i don't care if you

4239
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:55,520
like their hate or whatever throw it

4240
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:57,120
away grow it don't matter but it hits me

4241
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:58,960
just right

4242
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:00,720
yeah okay sounds like that one which is

4243
02:37:58,959 --> 02:38:03,279
hopefully vibing with more people than

4244
02:38:00,719 --> 02:38:05,840
just you with that being said what's

4245
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:07,359
your favorite strain that often maybe

4246
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:08,719
gets a bit of hate or just doesn't get

4247
02:38:07,359 --> 02:38:11,280
as much love

4248
02:38:08,719 --> 02:38:12,719
from other people

4249
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:14,479
[ __ ] i don't know because the ones that

4250
02:38:12,719 --> 02:38:16,799
everybody uh

4251
02:38:14,478 --> 02:38:18,959
um you know you get you get slapped in

4252
02:38:16,799 --> 02:38:21,920
the face or a lot of a lot of memes and

4253
02:38:18,959 --> 02:38:23,199
[ __ ] about aj sour diesel and a lot of

4254
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:25,680
memes and

4255
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:28,240
you know backhands from uh

4256
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:30,639
uh the blue dream and uh i've never

4257
02:38:28,239 --> 02:38:32,079
smoked any of the real [ __ ] so i have no

4258
02:38:30,639 --> 02:38:34,398
idea uh

4259
02:38:32,079 --> 02:38:37,840
what's good and people call

4260
02:38:34,398 --> 02:38:42,478
bad or give a bad rap too i uh

4261
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:44,239
i kind of only smoke my own flower

4262
02:38:42,478 --> 02:38:46,959
yeah i've never been to that sorry i've

4263
02:38:44,239 --> 02:38:48,879
never been to that wreck thing and uh

4264
02:38:46,959 --> 02:38:50,478
you know they have like gummy bears up

4265
02:38:48,879 --> 02:38:52,959
here somebody smoked that with me it's a

4266
02:38:50,478 --> 02:38:54,959
31 local thing at the rec market and

4267
02:38:52,959 --> 02:38:56,239
somebody's growing it in their home deal

4268
02:38:54,959 --> 02:38:58,159
the guy that gave it to the wrecker

4269
02:38:56,239 --> 02:39:00,719
whatever and i just thought it was such

4270
02:38:58,159 --> 02:39:02,799
poor weed so

4271
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:05,599
i don't know i'm a picky ass dick and i

4272
02:39:02,799 --> 02:39:07,358
like my own weed

4273
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:09,760
no it sounds like a man after my own

4274
02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:10,559
heart i can certainly relate to that

4275
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:12,800
so

4276
02:39:10,559 --> 02:39:14,318
how do you like to make your concentrate

4277
02:39:12,799 --> 02:39:16,398
a little bit of kefir on top of the bong

4278
02:39:14,318 --> 02:39:19,680
heater are you more of like a bho and

4279
02:39:16,398 --> 02:39:22,478
concentrates type of guy

4280
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:26,000
you know near zero uh

4281
02:39:22,478 --> 02:39:28,318
concentrates i make a lot of

4282
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:31,520
keef a shitload because well i might

4283
02:39:28,318 --> 02:39:33,840
like even on the tk nl5 this last run

4284
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:36,640
that i seeded out 16

4285
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:38,960
16 or 17 different strains and every bit

4286
02:39:36,639 --> 02:39:41,199
of it went to that pollen and

4287
02:39:38,959 --> 02:39:43,519
i had no flour at all so all i had was

4288
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:46,159
uh you know keef after i have de-shocked

4289
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:47,920
that i can separate the keep and then

4290
02:39:46,159 --> 02:39:49,840
only thing i do with it is just put it

4291
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:54,559
on a rosin press

4292
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:58,079
so um low low uh heat rosin at about uh

4293
02:39:54,559 --> 02:40:00,478
65 celsius which is i think 160 or

4294
02:39:58,079 --> 02:40:03,039
something on fahrenheit and

4295
02:40:00,478 --> 02:40:04,879
just press it and i have i have i don't

4296
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:07,120
smoke a shitload of concentrates and

4297
02:40:04,879 --> 02:40:09,279
never ever really ever smoke bho i'll

4298
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:12,079
smoke some eho and people up here kind

4299
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:14,159
of tag me for that and people go i know

4300
02:40:12,079 --> 02:40:15,840
you i've heard you don't do no vho or

4301
02:40:14,159 --> 02:40:17,840
whatever what this is real good now come

4302
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:20,559
and bring me a sample which is real cool

4303
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:23,359
but i hardly ever would ever smoke

4304
02:40:20,559 --> 02:40:25,359
eho tends to be better but

4305
02:40:23,359 --> 02:40:27,520
i have about a half a pound of rosin at

4306
02:40:25,359 --> 02:40:29,680
all points in time just because i squish

4307
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:32,000
all the keef it's very common to get

4308
02:40:29,680 --> 02:40:33,040
eight ounce jars of kefir two at a time

4309
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,159
you know

4310
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:36,800
and then what are you going to do with

4311
02:40:34,159 --> 02:40:39,359
that you either had to make eho bho or

4312
02:40:36,799 --> 02:40:42,799
some rosin and to me rosin's wide

4313
02:40:39,359 --> 02:40:44,880
spectrum and a little bit better way

4314
02:40:42,799 --> 02:40:46,559
better high i think

4315
02:40:44,879 --> 02:40:47,519
yeah definitely

4316
02:40:46,559 --> 02:40:49,760
so

4317
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:51,680
in terms of where the market's heading

4318
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:54,159
towards the end of last year we saw the

4319
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:56,880
rise of the uh the very controversial

4320
02:40:54,159 --> 02:40:59,520
100.8 from big al

4321
02:40:56,879 --> 02:41:01,039
and how do you feel like this affects

4322
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:03,120
the market do you feel like there's a

4323
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:05,200
place within the market for the ultra

4324
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:06,960
premium products and the the high-end

4325
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:08,640
consumers or do you feel like the fact

4326
02:41:06,959 --> 02:41:10,318
that cannabis has this medicinal

4327
02:41:08,639 --> 02:41:13,680
component to it that we shouldn't allow

4328
02:41:10,318 --> 02:41:13,680
things to creep up like that

4329
02:41:14,719 --> 02:41:19,438
oh i see both sides of that uh that

4330
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:22,398
thing there's people that want to feel

4331
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:26,159
special and i actually have

4332
02:41:22,398 --> 02:41:26,159
you know liquid assets

4333
02:41:28,398 --> 02:41:33,199
my dumb bulldogs are gonna go off

4334
02:41:31,439 --> 02:41:36,318
um

4335
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:38,079
but um i don't think it's certainly not

4336
02:41:36,318 --> 02:41:39,840
good for the normal guy i think it's

4337
02:41:38,079 --> 02:41:41,920
unfair for the uh

4338
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:44,398
the grower because they're getting

4339
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:46,879
hammered on the low end of it and then

4340
02:41:44,398 --> 02:41:48,478
it's like rubbing it in their face

4341
02:41:46,879 --> 02:41:50,478
you know if you can

4342
02:41:48,478 --> 02:41:53,119
get a hundred dollars for an eighth and

4343
02:41:50,478 --> 02:41:55,679
and you're paying 500 for a pound that's

4344
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:55,680
not right

4345
02:41:55,920 --> 02:42:00,960
yeah it it puts an interesting spin on

4346
02:41:58,799 --> 02:42:02,879
like what does the grower get out

4347
02:42:00,959 --> 02:42:04,318
because i mean big out to his credit

4348
02:42:02,879 --> 02:42:06,079
used to be a grower but i believe for

4349
02:42:04,318 --> 02:42:09,359
the most part now he's actually more of

4350
02:42:06,079 --> 02:42:10,799
a kind of like a middleman

4351
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:12,800
i think there's a you know there's a

4352
02:42:10,799 --> 02:42:15,278
situation for everything and because

4353
02:42:12,799 --> 02:42:17,199
we're so diverse as humans there's uh

4354
02:42:15,279 --> 02:42:19,840
there's people in the world who would

4355
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:21,200
never consider they never consider um

4356
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:25,200
you know

4357
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:26,800
first world problems like that so

4358
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:27,920
if you look at the whole scheme of

4359
02:42:26,799 --> 02:42:29,358
things

4360
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:30,559
everybody has a right to do what they

4361
02:42:29,359 --> 02:42:32,318
want and if there's somebody that

4362
02:42:30,559 --> 02:42:34,719
there's an if there's a need build a

4363
02:42:32,318 --> 02:42:37,680
void

4364
02:42:34,719 --> 02:42:39,679
as much as i may have some personal

4365
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:41,439
questions about the situation i just my

4366
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:43,359
mind immediately always wanders to the

4367
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:45,040
fact that you know there are people who

4368
02:42:43,359 --> 02:42:47,120
pay hundreds of thousand dollars for

4369
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:49,359
cars and you know

4370
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:51,840
people don't criticize that and so i

4371
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:54,640
feel like there's got to be some

4372
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:57,760
congruency and consistency within

4373
02:42:54,639 --> 02:42:59,760
within our thought process at least

4374
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:01,200
yeah you will you won't see anybody

4375
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:02,800
giving somebody grief over that car

4376
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:04,800
they're going to give them 100

4377
02:43:02,799 --> 02:43:06,478
of congratulations that they made it to

4378
02:43:04,799 --> 02:43:08,719
that point right

4379
02:43:06,478 --> 02:43:10,959
and not not even be butt hurt over it or

4380
02:43:08,719 --> 02:43:13,840
jealous unless it's your hard work from

4381
02:43:10,959 --> 02:43:16,318
your brow sweat that uh got that car for

4382
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:16,318
your boss

4383
02:43:16,879 --> 02:43:21,278
yeah that's that's maybe a whole nother

4384
02:43:18,719 --> 02:43:22,799
conversation in itself so

4385
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:24,479
one last thing i wanted to bring up

4386
02:43:22,799 --> 02:43:25,519
before we jump onto some fishing stuff

4387
02:43:24,478 --> 02:43:27,679
because we're going to get there don't

4388
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:29,120
worry after this one i noticed on your

4389
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:30,880
feed you've got some dungeon vault

4390
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:32,960
genetics i'm a big fan of eric and

4391
02:43:30,879 --> 02:43:34,799
dungeon vault genetics what are you most

4392
02:43:32,959 --> 02:43:36,398
looking looking forward to popping out

4393
02:43:34,799 --> 02:43:38,398
of those seeds and do you have any

4394
02:43:36,398 --> 02:43:40,159
experience with brandywine or more

4395
02:43:38,398 --> 02:43:41,920
specifically the pink champagne which is

4396
02:43:40,159 --> 02:43:43,439
the mother of it

4397
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:45,920
another really good question you're

4398
02:43:43,439 --> 02:43:48,079
nailing it because i had not known him

4399
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:50,079
too long i

4400
02:43:48,079 --> 02:43:51,760
i met him through the catalogs i sent

4401
02:43:50,079 --> 02:43:52,478
him catalogs

4402
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:55,040
up

4403
02:43:52,478 --> 02:43:56,159
because i think his genetics stood stood

4404
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:57,439

him and um he's given me his genetics i

4424
02:44:37,279 --> 02:44:41,680

absorb that [ __ ] at this point in my

4429
02:44:48,398 --> 02:44:52,639
life a very little room left in my brain

for new information so i'm not going to

4431
02:44:52,639 --> 02:44:56,959
absorb all

4432
02:44:54,318 --> 02:44:57,680

interact with these things do you like

4466
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:06,399
to do them while sober or is it just

4467
02:46:04,879 --> 02:46:08,639
like the perfect time to get high for

4468
02:46:06,398 --> 02:46:08,639

life i ain't smoking i i did get i did

4504
02:47:25,279 --> 02:47:30,000

4505
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:32,399
died once i was like you know 106 and a

4506
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:33,760
half fever

4507
02:47:32,398 --> 02:47:35,278
i had

4508
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:36,639
something

4509
02:47:35,279 --> 02:47:38,640
it was a

4510
02:47:36,639 --> 02:47:40,639
staph infection on my epiglottis that's

4511
02:47:38,639 --> 02:47:43,278
a little flap in the back of your throat

4512
02:47:40,639 --> 02:47:46,719
right it uh it's 30

4513
02:47:43,279 --> 02:47:48,640
uh survivability rate if you get this so

4514
02:47:46,719 --> 02:47:50,159
i waited the last minute like i normally

4515
02:47:48,639 --> 02:47:51,680
would and i went in almost dead i'd

4516
02:47:50,159 --> 02:47:54,239
already passed out and i woke back up

4517
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:56,318
alive so i went to the hospital

4518
02:47:54,239 --> 02:48:00,398
and they innovated me and put me on

4519
02:47:56,318 --> 02:48:01,840
anesthesia for like four days so

4520
02:48:00,398 --> 02:48:04,959
there was another four days i didn't

4521
02:48:01,840 --> 02:48:07,040
smoke weed but i have no choice

4522
02:48:04,959 --> 02:48:10,478
yeah wow and and what type of fishing

4523
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:10,479
and hunting do you like to do most

4524
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:15,520
you know i i like to hunt just about

4525
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:18,398
everything but our opportunities are

4526
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:20,800
limited we try to fill our freezer on

4527
02:48:18,398 --> 02:48:22,239
moose and deer so we hunt

4528
02:48:20,799 --> 02:48:25,278
i don't do a lot of bird hunting because

4529
02:48:22,239 --> 02:48:27,600
it's not as much opportunity up here if

4530
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:29,520
i had a lot of upland game bird

4531
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:31,680
i'd do that a lot more we only have like

4532
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:32,720
a couple we have a grouse and a spruce

4533
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:35,439
hen and

4534
02:48:32,719 --> 02:48:37,438
i'll do that too i love bird hunting but

4535
02:48:35,439 --> 02:48:39,680
we deer hunt moose hunt a little bit of

4536
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:41,520
bird hunt but fishing we just get

4537
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:43,200
whatever comes up

4538
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:45,600
as soon as we can get it

4539
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:47,600
i would have been

4540
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:50,239
like i mentioned earlier i would be out

4541
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:52,079
right now getting crab because uh

4542
02:48:50,239 --> 02:48:57,199
federal crabbing for subsistence

4543
02:48:52,079 --> 02:48:57,200
crabbing goes from october 15 to

4544
02:48:57,279 --> 02:49:02,159
march 31st so they let us just as soon

4545
02:49:00,079 --> 02:49:03,840
as the weather has freezing spraying

4546
02:49:02,159 --> 02:49:06,000
you're gonna die trying to get this

4547
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:08,639
substance uh your

4548
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:10,318
your subsistence crab

4549
02:49:08,639 --> 02:49:11,760
it's the weather just won't let you get

4550
02:49:10,318 --> 02:49:14,079
it but right now there's a little bit of

4551
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:16,159
a break the last three weeks but a storm

4552
02:49:14,079 --> 02:49:18,559
came through just now and uh it's ten

4553
02:49:16,159 --> 02:49:21,200
foot in the ocean with snow

4554
02:49:18,559 --> 02:49:22,879
and and we'd be out right now because my

4555
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:24,800
my partner went out last weekend and

4556
02:49:22,879 --> 02:49:26,959
caught a 15 pound king crab he got a

4557
02:49:24,799 --> 02:49:29,039
bunch of littler ones but he caught a 15

4558
02:49:26,959 --> 02:49:32,478
pound king crab

4559
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:35,520
i mean that that is where you want to be

4560
02:49:32,478 --> 02:49:37,599
yeah wow that's really impressive and so

4561
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:40,079
the other thing i noticed from your feed

4562
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:41,920
is that you know you appear to have a

4563
02:49:40,079 --> 02:49:44,879
little bit of a sweet tooth so tell me

4564

i don't know but jelly uh good good

4569
02:49:52,879 --> 02:49:56,639
gummies uh from european countries tend

4570
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:58,720
to be very good

4571
02:49:56,639 --> 02:50:00,159
they don't have a lot of um they have no

4572
02:49:58,719 --> 02:50:02,719
corn

4573
02:50:00,159 --> 02:50:04,478
syrup they don't have any preservatives

4574
02:50:02,719 --> 02:50:05,519
so all gummies from every country i've

4575
02:50:04,478 --> 02:50:08,799
ever had

4576
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:10,399
minus like america or are pretty good

4577
02:50:08,799 --> 02:50:12,318
fresh gummies are a big thing you can go

4578
02:50:10,398 --> 02:50:14,000
from place to place and there's like you

4579
02:50:12,318 --> 02:50:16,639
know shops that are

4580
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,760
specializing in it so

4581
02:50:16,639 --> 02:50:20,079
i've had

4582
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:22,800
my friend jolly glass send me back you

4583
02:50:20,079 --> 02:50:24,318
know ton of stuff from spanibus and

4584
02:50:22,799 --> 02:50:27,679
i've had a couple of friends that hooked

4585
02:50:24,318 --> 02:50:29,840
me up like that so but i i i got a sweet

4586
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:31,920
tooth you got that right we're only here

4587
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:33,439
once so uh

4588
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:35,359
you better take advantage of whatever

4589
02:50:33,439 --> 02:50:38,159
you're given

4590
02:50:35,359 --> 02:50:40,318
and so does that extend into edibles or

4591
02:50:38,159 --> 02:50:43,039
purely just a you know a sober

4592
02:50:40,318 --> 02:50:46,318
confectionary type of deal

4593
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:48,960
edibles hit me like a uh ton of bricks

4594
02:50:46,318 --> 02:50:52,159
so um i'm big time into edibles because

4595
02:50:48,959 --> 02:50:53,759
i love good edibles but i generally

4596
02:50:52,159 --> 02:50:57,760
would make

4597
02:50:53,760 --> 02:51:00,639
like uh virgin coconut oil and

4598
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:03,279
maybe one jar of virgin coconut oil a

4599
02:51:00,639 --> 02:51:04,478
big size jar and a half a pound of like

4600
02:51:03,279 --> 02:51:08,239
uh

4601
02:51:04,478 --> 02:51:09,840
xj13 pennywise is a nine to 12 percent

4602
02:51:08,239 --> 02:51:11,920
uh cbd

4603
02:51:09,840 --> 02:51:13,680
and i would take all that flour and put

4604
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:15,040
it in uh you know hydrate it so you

4605
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:17,200
don't get no chlorophyll after it's

4606
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:19,279
dried i'd rehydrate it and then just

4607
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:21,760
melt off all the keef and make some real

4608
02:51:19,279 --> 02:51:23,040
good can of coconut oil

4609
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:24,880
and then uh

4610
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:27,840
my other biggest thing is

4611
02:51:24,879 --> 02:51:30,159
are we berry pick in prince william's

4612
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:32,000
town where i fish a lot there are

4613
02:51:30,159 --> 02:51:34,239
there's a

4614
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,920
there's a lot of berries cloud berries

4615
02:51:34,239 --> 02:51:38,159
um

4616
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:40,159
there's black currant there's another

4617
02:51:38,159 --> 02:51:42,799
type of a black currant and there's

4618
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:45,039
blueberry and there's salmonberry so i

4619
02:51:42,799 --> 02:51:46,959
can and then in my yard generally i have

4620
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:50,479
a lot of berry bushes

4621
02:51:46,959 --> 02:51:52,000
so i will pick about 50 pounds of wild

4622
02:51:50,478 --> 02:51:53,679
berry every year

4623
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:55,600
and freeze it

4624
02:51:53,680 --> 02:51:58,479
and sometimes more than 50 pounds i

4625
02:51:55,600 --> 02:52:00,720
might get i might get

4626
02:51:58,478 --> 02:52:03,358
sometimes way more [ __ ] buckets and

4627
02:52:00,719 --> 02:52:05,920
buckets of it but i'll make uh natural

4628
02:52:03,359 --> 02:52:09,439
wild berry syrup and put my rosin from

4629
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:11,920
all of the rosin that i make from kefir

4630
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:13,920
and just make a wide spectrum of natural

4631
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:15,520
wild berry syrup and i'm kind of famous

4632
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:17,439
for it now

4633
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:19,920
so

4634
02:52:17,439 --> 02:52:21,279
i i do like that as an edible but i

4635
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:24,239
would promote

4636
02:52:21,279 --> 02:52:26,319
anybody that wants edible green goddess

4637
02:52:24,239 --> 02:52:28,318
delights is the best edible producer

4638
02:52:26,318 --> 02:52:31,119
that i've come across she's a friend of

4639
02:52:28,318 --> 02:52:33,760
mine and she makes gummies that wicked

4640
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:35,920
cherry gummies wicked uh

4641
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:38,398
green apple or wicked watermelon wicked

4642
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:42,398
pineapple or they have uh

4643
02:52:38,398 --> 02:52:44,799
you know jolly ropes they won the the

4644
02:52:42,398 --> 02:52:46,478
mid uh the east the new england high

4645
02:52:44,799 --> 02:52:48,398
times cup last year with their blue

4646
02:52:46,478 --> 02:52:50,239
raspberry funk juice and they're famous

4647
02:52:48,398 --> 02:52:52,318
for their funk juice

4648
02:52:50,239 --> 02:52:53,840
and uh their products yesterday i had a

4649
02:52:52,318 --> 02:52:55,920
friend come by and said he doesn't get

4650
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:58,239
high on edibles and man i instantly

4651
02:52:55,920 --> 02:53:00,478
broke out a 500 milligram bottle of the

4652
02:52:58,239 --> 02:53:03,119
funk juice and said try this tonight i

4653
02:53:00,478 --> 02:53:05,278
had to eat a 200 milligram jolly rogue

4654
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:07,600
and then we split a package of the

4655
02:53:05,279 --> 02:53:10,560
wicked

4656
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:12,800
wicked watermelon gummies and they taste

4657
02:53:10,559 --> 02:53:14,719
so good as a candy that

4658
02:53:12,799 --> 02:53:17,278
you're not going to stop eating them my

4659
02:53:14,719 --> 02:53:18,879
boss is 60s almost 70 year old korean

4660
02:53:17,279 --> 02:53:20,159
and a [ __ ] he'll start eating them and

4661
02:53:18,879 --> 02:53:22,318
then

4662
02:53:20,159 --> 02:53:25,760
could it taste like candy and then you

4663
02:53:22,318 --> 02:53:27,278
know be hammered shortly after

4664
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:29,439
even though uh

4665
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:30,399
they're only hundred milligram packages

4666
02:53:29,439 --> 02:53:31,920
uh

4667
02:53:30,398 --> 02:53:33,760
they're they're they're they've got it

4668
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:36,960
down just right

4669
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:39,600
i've probably never had a better edible

4670
02:53:36,959 --> 02:53:42,318
uh no question 100 milligrams would

4671
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:44,720
definitely put my dick in the dirt so my

4672
02:53:42,318 --> 02:53:46,318
question though out of all the meat you

4673
02:53:44,719 --> 02:53:49,278
hunt or just everything in general

4674
02:53:46,318 --> 02:53:49,278
what's your favorite food

4675
02:53:50,159 --> 02:53:56,318
wow um i love halibut but i uh

4676
02:53:56,398 --> 02:54:00,799
there is really no favorite food because

4677
02:53:58,159 --> 02:54:04,398
we get all unlimited amount of spa

4678
02:54:00,799 --> 02:54:06,559
shrimp like every friday night and uh

4679
02:54:04,398 --> 02:54:08,559
that's a pretty pretty premium thing no

4680
02:54:06,559 --> 02:54:10,079
matter where you're at cold water shrimp

4681
02:54:08,559 --> 02:54:12,398
is probably one of the best things in

4682
02:54:10,079 --> 02:54:15,600
the world and uh

4683
02:54:12,398 --> 02:54:17,840
good fish but good moose meat or a goat

4684
02:54:15,600 --> 02:54:20,399
of a mountain goat

4685
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:21,439
man that stuff is the mildest best

4686
02:54:20,398 --> 02:54:22,719
tasting

4687
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:24,000
i mean they live on cliffs and you

4688
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:25,119
wouldn't think that they'd be edible

4689
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,959
because a

4690
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:29,279
barnyard billy goat tastes like grass

4691
02:54:26,959 --> 02:54:31,039
and piss and it's harsh man

4692
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:32,800
these things got a big ass nasty set of

4693
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:34,880
balls on them and they're super mature

4694
02:54:32,799 --> 02:54:36,959
they're solid muscle but it's like far

4695
02:54:34,879 --> 02:54:38,879
contender mildest meat in the world

4696
02:54:36,959 --> 02:54:42,000
milder than veal

4697
02:54:38,879 --> 02:54:43,599
and uh [ __ ] that that stuff besides it's

4698
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:46,959
impossible to get

4699
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:49,439
so uh you put all that together i'd say

4700
02:54:46,959 --> 02:54:50,318
mountain goat doll sheep might be next

4701
02:54:49,439 --> 02:54:52,159
to

4702
02:54:50,318 --> 02:54:53,199
you got to climb five six thousand feet

4703
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:55,439
and uh

4704
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:58,399
they can see for miles man you're just

4705
02:54:55,439 --> 02:55:00,318
not gonna get one so when you do

4706
02:54:58,398 --> 02:55:04,959
one of the best flavored animals in the

4707
02:55:00,318 --> 02:55:07,199
world of anything i've ever had and

4708
02:55:04,959 --> 02:55:10,000
the uh accomplishment of it makes it

4709
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:13,600
taste even twice that good

4710
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:15,520
hell yeah goat curry is where it's at so

4711
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:16,880
to move on to our next subject many

4712
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:18,479
people and you've mentioned it a few

4713
02:55:16,879 --> 02:55:20,478
times probably familiar with you as

4714
02:55:18,478 --> 02:55:22,719
being the guy with the old school seed

4715
02:55:20,478 --> 02:55:24,639
magazine collections so how did this

4716
02:55:22,719 --> 02:55:26,398
collection initially begin i know that

4717
02:55:24,639 --> 02:55:28,159
bodhi's mentioned in the past he's

4718
02:55:26,398 --> 02:55:29,840
traded you some magazines and i'm

4719
02:55:28,159 --> 02:55:33,680
certainly grateful to have a few copies

4720
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:37,200
from you but how did this all originate

4721
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:39,200
it just started because we

4722
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:42,479
were buying seeds from

4723
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:45,040
the scentsy seed bank and sssc

4724
02:55:42,478 --> 02:55:47,679
i just had my original catalogs from 89

4725
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:49,520
90 in 91

4726
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:52,000
and 30 years later i didn't really look

4727
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:53,520
at them and uh

4728
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:55,680
when i finally did look at them i was

4729
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:58,159
just going holy [ __ ] they're in perfect

4730
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:59,520
shape and it was like reliving glory

4731
02:55:58,159 --> 02:56:01,039
days

4732
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:03,040
really

4733
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:04,479
hard and uh

4734
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:06,960
oh my god every feeling you ever had

4735
02:56:04,478 --> 02:56:08,559
came back the the sending off your 60

4736
02:56:06,959 --> 02:56:10,959
bucks and waiting three months and

4737
02:56:08,559 --> 02:56:12,318
paranoia like crazy like

4738
02:56:10,959 --> 02:56:14,318
like we're all going to go to prison

4739
02:56:12,318 --> 02:56:16,079
over this damn package of seeds and

4740
02:56:14,318 --> 02:56:16,959
we're all pooling our money together you

4741
02:56:16,079 --> 02:56:18,799
know

4742
02:56:16,959 --> 02:56:20,239
for not one of us had enough money to

4743
02:56:18,799 --> 02:56:22,079
actually buy seeds back then it's

4744
02:56:20,239 --> 02:56:24,318
funnier than [ __ ] so

4745
02:56:22,079 --> 02:56:26,799
when i saved them and realized how how

4746
02:56:24,318 --> 02:56:29,199
cool it was uh i kind of just looked for

4747
02:56:26,799 --> 02:56:31,199
more and uh saw that bodhi had a bunch

4748
02:56:29,200 --> 02:56:33,680
of them his friend was a photographer

4749
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:35,520

uncirculated coffee

4753
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:42,079

4755
02:56:42,079 --> 02:56:47,520
i mean what can you say about him but um

4756
02:56:45,680 --> 02:56:49,359

4757
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:51,439

4771
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:19,680
back to him at emerald in 17

4772
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:21,439
and um you know thanked him a hundred

4773
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:23,200
times i mean it's such a valuable

4774
02:57:21,439 --> 02:57:24,639
history uh

4775
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:26,399
sitting in your hands and you can just

4776
02:57:24,639 --> 02:57:28,318
cater it's all categorized and you can

4777
02:57:26,398 --> 02:57:31,439
just look it up even the information

4778
02:57:28,318 --> 02:57:32,959
that's in there is still viable today

4779
02:57:31,439 --> 02:57:34,639
yeah definitely there's nothing i get

4780
02:57:32,959 --> 02:57:36,719
more of a kick out of than going back

4781
02:57:34,639 --> 02:57:38,799
and looking at some of the strains and

4782
02:57:36,719 --> 02:57:41,199
being like oh this is the exact stock

4783
02:57:38,799 --> 02:57:42,879
skelly came from

4784
02:57:41,200 --> 02:57:45,040
well their technical information on

4785
02:57:42,879 --> 02:57:47,119
growing was immense it was like

4786
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:48,640
at least the ssscs

4787
02:57:47,120 --> 02:57:50,720
they have a mini book in there they get

4788
02:57:48,639 --> 02:57:52,398
more technical than i ever wanted to for

4789
02:57:50,719 --> 02:57:54,318
30 years

4790
02:57:52,398 --> 02:57:55,920
yeah definitely well you know huge shout

4791
02:57:54,318 --> 02:57:57,519
out to stephen olivia they're two

4792
02:57:55,920 --> 02:57:58,960
amazing people who everyone in the

4793
02:57:57,520 --> 02:57:59,840
community loves

4794
02:57:58,959 --> 02:58:02,159
so

4795
02:57:59,840 --> 02:58:03,680
next one i wanted to ask you about

4796
02:58:02,159 --> 02:58:05,439
what do you feel is the future for the

4797
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:06,639
emerald cup can we expect to see you

4798
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:08,800
there this december or are you

4799
02:58:06,639 --> 02:58:10,959
considering going elsewhere the general

4800
02:58:08,799 --> 02:58:12,559
sentiment last year was that things felt

4801
02:58:10,959 --> 02:58:14,559
a little different would you agree with

4802
02:58:12,559 --> 02:58:17,199
that

4803
02:58:14,559 --> 02:58:18,959
things felt a lot different from the

4804
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:20,640
first emerald cup and they're a hundred

4805
02:58:18,959 --> 02:58:23,358
percent different than the original

4806
02:58:20,639 --> 02:58:25,840
emerald cup so it it said you know it's

4807
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:27,040
evolved and um

4808
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:29,520
i

4809
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:32,640
and alaska in general we

4810
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:34,800
had our very first time ever real event

4811
02:58:32,639 --> 02:58:36,318
which was a high times cup up here this

4812
02:58:34,799 --> 02:58:39,039
year and it was like

4813
02:58:36,318 --> 02:58:41,680
no public display of cannabis no smoking

4814
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:42,560
of cannabis no nothing

4815
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:45,040
and

4816
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:46,799
it was so shitty and harsh that it was

4817
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:49,200
like the biggest turn off in the world

4818
02:58:46,799 --> 02:58:51,920
so in my view

4819
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:55,040
emerald was 100 success even though it

4820
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:56,559
wasn't the same as it was in prior years

4821
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:59,040
you know the feeling is still right

4822
02:58:56,559 --> 02:59:01,119
there and as long as people are still

4823
02:58:59,040 --> 02:59:02,399
able to relay their message which i did

4824
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:03,920
see a lot of that you know we're right

4825
02:59:02,398 --> 02:59:04,879
there in that circle of love the whole

4826
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:05,680
time

4827
02:59:04,879 --> 02:59:06,879
and

4828
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:08,479
um

4829
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:09,920
you still can

4830
02:59:08,478 --> 02:59:11,920
be right there with the people that

4831
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:13,359
really mean something in this industry

4832
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:15,439
and

4833
02:59:13,359 --> 02:59:17,680
and doing right for the community so in

4834
02:59:15,439 --> 02:59:19,920
that sense emerald was successful did

4835
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:23,120
people make as much money no i don't

4836
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:25,279
think so damn i know dungeon vault uh

4837
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:27,680
his dad died that morning that saturday

4838
02:59:25,279 --> 02:59:29,600
morning and uh he held a

4839
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:30,880
a booth there and ten thousand dollars

4840
02:59:29,600 --> 02:59:32,159
he didn't want to just piss it away or

4841
02:59:30,879 --> 02:59:33,679
he would have just walked away from the

4842
02:59:32,159 --> 02:59:34,959
whole thing but he said he covered his

4843
02:59:33,680 --> 02:59:36,800
bases and

4844
02:59:34,959 --> 02:59:38,879
said it was worth it so

4845
02:59:36,799 --> 02:59:40,799
you know there's an opinion right there

4846
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:42,879
actually i feel a little bad eric if you

4847
02:59:40,799 --> 02:59:45,358
listen to this i had no idea man i spoke

4848
02:59:42,879 --> 02:59:47,438
to you that day and i feel bad for not

4849
02:59:45,359 --> 02:59:49,359
saying anything about it but yeah you

4850
02:59:47,439 --> 02:59:50,239
know you hit it on the head right i

4851
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:52,559
remember

4852
02:59:50,239 --> 02:59:54,719
you were kind of out front um the booth

4853
02:59:52,559 --> 02:59:57,600
i was at there was an awesome little

4854
02:59:54,719 --> 03:00:00,478
crew there like it was you bob hemphill

4855
02:59:57,600 --> 03:00:01,920
skunk va duke just every name you could

4856
03:00:00,478 --> 03:00:03,358
think of just kind of congregate and

4857
03:00:01,920 --> 03:00:05,439
have little chats out the front it was

4858
03:00:03,359 --> 03:00:07,439
kind of surreal you just sit there and

4859
03:00:05,439 --> 03:00:09,120
to just be like this is this is it right

4860
03:00:07,439 --> 03:00:10,479
here this is the little circle you want

4861
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:14,160
to be in

4862
03:00:10,478 --> 03:00:16,478
it it truly was i felt um

4863
03:00:14,159 --> 03:00:18,398
i felt honored to be able to stand there

4864
03:00:16,478 --> 03:00:21,278
with every one of those guys including

4865
03:00:18,398 --> 03:00:23,278
you so um to me

4866
03:00:21,279 --> 03:00:25,840
i think it's still about

4867
03:00:23,279 --> 03:00:28,560
community and uh everybody that was

4868
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:29,840
there that that's the sentiment 100

4869
03:00:28,559 --> 03:00:32,639
they're not one of those guys that

4870
03:00:29,840 --> 03:00:34,478
didn't have each other's back

4871
03:00:32,639 --> 03:00:36,719
yeah definitely as well as having the

4872
03:00:34,478 --> 03:00:39,119
community's back which is the big part i

4873
03:00:36,719 --> 03:00:41,119
think which linked us all

4874
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:43,120
that too it's um it's a different world

4875
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:45,520
boy i mean

4876
03:00:43,120 --> 03:00:47,520
10 and 15 and 20 years every single plot

4877
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:50,319
everything has gone by it's been just a

4878
03:00:47,520 --> 03:00:52,239
crazy world where as much as separation

4879
03:00:50,318 --> 03:00:54,159
as there is right now with uh you know

4880
03:00:52,239 --> 03:00:56,478
people trying to get greedy and stuff

4881
03:00:54,159 --> 03:00:58,000
there's just as much uh

4882
03:00:56,478 --> 03:00:59,920
ties being made and i think it made the

4883
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:01,359
community a lot stronger and it's

4884
03:00:59,920 --> 03:01:03,200
amazing

4885
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:05,279
definitely definitely so

4886
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:06,800
getting towards our little quickfire

4887
03:01:05,279 --> 03:01:08,880
questions the last question or two

4888
03:01:06,799 --> 03:01:11,039
before those though i wanted to quickly

4889
03:01:08,879 --> 03:01:12,559
ask what's your feeling about the rise

4890
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:14,399
of the vape pen i'm not sure if you've

4891
03:01:12,559 --> 03:01:16,318
seen the south park episode mocking it

4892
03:01:14,398 --> 03:01:19,439
it's pretty funny but

4893
03:01:16,318 --> 03:01:21,439
essentially how do you feel they affect

4894
03:01:19,439 --> 03:01:23,040
the community in the sense that they're

4895
03:01:21,439 --> 03:01:25,600
trying to bridge the gap between like

4896
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:26,960
casual consumer and the general market

4897
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:28,318
do you feel though they're having more

4898
03:01:26,959 --> 03:01:30,799
of a detrimental effect than a

4899
03:01:28,318 --> 03:01:32,639
beneficial effect overall

4900
03:01:30,799 --> 03:01:36,398
you know you're right it's it's a way to

4901
03:01:32,639 --> 03:01:38,478
bridge um you know complete different um

4902
03:01:36,398 --> 03:01:40,159
generations there's good things about

4903
03:01:38,478 --> 03:01:42,478
them and bad things about them it's

4904
03:01:40,159 --> 03:01:45,520
funny that they got names like you know

4905
03:01:42,478 --> 03:01:47,760
[ __ ] stick and douche flute and

4906
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:50,159
the people that um it's a different

4907
03:01:47,760 --> 03:01:52,159
generation that tends to use them it's a

4908
03:01:50,159 --> 03:01:53,760
convenient type of thing i can't say i

4909
03:01:52,159 --> 03:01:55,359
haven't used them

4910
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:57,200
uh my buddy falconer bought one of the

4911
03:01:55,359 --> 03:01:59,120
cookie pens which was uh i guess

4912
03:01:57,200 --> 03:02:00,640
refillable only locally so he had it

4913
03:01:59,120 --> 03:02:02,640
engraved with his name and just tossed

4914
03:02:00,639 --> 03:02:04,159
the sumbitch when it ran out but you

4915
03:02:02,639 --> 03:02:06,159
know it was a very good product i

4916
03:02:04,159 --> 03:02:08,318
thought and uh

4917
03:02:06,159 --> 03:02:11,600
i don't see it being a horrible thing

4918
03:02:08,318 --> 03:02:12,959
i'm so neutral about everything that um

4919
03:02:11,600 --> 03:02:14,399
there's good things in it and there's

4920
03:02:12,959 --> 03:02:17,199
bad things in it i don't like the heavy

4921
03:02:14,398 --> 03:02:20,559
metals cheap ass chinese

4922
03:02:17,200 --> 03:02:23,680
you know materials being made and uh

4923
03:02:20,559 --> 03:02:25,600
untested shitty products being put into

4924
03:02:23,680 --> 03:02:27,439
it that is where i have problems with

4925
03:02:25,600 --> 03:02:29,279
the whole thing

4926
03:02:27,439 --> 03:02:31,920
so how do you feel about the kind of the

4927
03:02:29,279 --> 03:02:34,479
introduction of the non-cannabis derived

4928
03:02:31,920 --> 03:02:36,398
terpenes to these concentrates or even

4929
03:02:34,478 --> 03:02:39,039
the reintroduction of them after they've

4930
03:02:36,398 --> 03:02:40,639
been separated out

4931
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:43,439
i am a

4932
03:02:40,639 --> 03:02:46,559
big fan of cannabis terpenes i don't

4933
03:02:43,439 --> 03:02:48,239
care um if you put them back in do them

4934
03:02:46,559 --> 03:02:51,519
uh

4935
03:02:48,239 --> 03:02:54,398
you know as a aromatherapy or whatever

4936
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:57,600
but i'm not a fan of vegetable and fruit

4937
03:02:54,398 --> 03:02:58,719
derived terps being added to anything

4938
03:02:57,600 --> 03:03:01,040
yeah

4939
03:02:58,719 --> 03:03:02,318
you know uh you can get real like

4940
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:04,720
terpenes

4941
03:03:02,318 --> 03:03:07,039
for flavor and add it to your brewing

4942
03:03:04,719 --> 03:03:08,719
supply and it's a whole different thing

4943
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:11,200
there's a hundreds of terpenes that are

4944
03:03:08,719 --> 03:03:13,119
just straight up natural 100 natural

4945
03:03:11,200 --> 03:03:15,520
terpenes just in liquid form ready to go

4946
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:16,960
back into anything you're brewing

4947
03:03:15,520 --> 03:03:19,279
and um

4948
03:03:16,959 --> 03:03:21,519
it's 100 good thing but i don't view

4949
03:03:19,279 --> 03:03:22,960
marijuana being flavored we've recently

4950
03:03:21,520 --> 03:03:25,359
had uh

4951
03:03:22,959 --> 03:03:26,959
terpene tests at the lab that i'm you

4952
03:03:25,359 --> 03:03:28,800
know i go through and i'm friends with

4953
03:03:26,959 --> 03:03:30,799
the workers there uh they have eight

4954
03:03:28,799 --> 03:03:33,358
plus percent terpenes

4955
03:03:30,799 --> 03:03:35,039
being tested at that lab with you know

4956
03:03:33,359 --> 03:03:37,520
only a half a dozen terpenes being

4957
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:39,359
tested and it's an impossibility

4958
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:41,359
and it tells you these people are only

4959
03:03:39,359 --> 03:03:43,680
trying to cur they're doing whatever

4960
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:47,439
they can to sell the wreck weed and uh

4961
03:03:43,680 --> 03:03:48,800
that's that's a very wrong thing

4962
03:03:47,439 --> 03:03:50,559
yeah certainly when you when you

4963
03:03:48,799 --> 03:03:51,438
initially said eight percent i was like

4964
03:03:50,559 --> 03:03:53,680
what

4965
03:03:51,439 --> 03:03:55,120
um but but yeah i guess that makes sense

4966
03:03:53,680 --> 03:03:56,639
right there they're trying to game the

4967
03:03:55,120 --> 03:03:59,439
system

4968
03:03:56,639 --> 03:04:02,559
yeah and if um you know it it kind of

4969
03:03:59,439 --> 03:04:05,040
boils down to where it's uh with people

4970
03:04:02,559 --> 03:04:08,318
smoking electronic uh

4971
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:09,680
cigarettes the flavors have been um you

4972
03:04:08,318 --> 03:04:11,920
know so

4973
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:13,359
pussified that

4974
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:14,719
everybody's sucking on stuff though i

4975
03:04:13,359 --> 03:04:16,318
mean i'll walk through cloud of it it

4976
03:04:14,719 --> 03:04:17,760
actually smells good to me and they're

4977
03:04:16,318 --> 03:04:19,600
actually just getting their nicotine so

4978
03:04:17,760 --> 03:04:21,200
it makes it so much less offensive than

4979
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:23,200
a cigarette

4980
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:25,200
but um you know you still got to deal

4981
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:27,279
with the

4982
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:29,200
other things with it i don't i don't

4983
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:32,159
think it's the smartest thing to breathe

4984
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:33,439
glycol or glycerin or any of that [ __ ]

4985
03:04:32,159 --> 03:04:35,920
so uh

4986
03:04:33,439 --> 03:04:38,000
i'm like a natural flower guy my god you

4987
03:04:35,920 --> 03:04:40,478
can't really i don't know how old school

4988
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:42,478
i am but it goes very straight back to i

4989
03:04:40,478 --> 03:04:45,199
want a damn joint

4990
03:04:42,478 --> 03:04:46,799
yeah definitely i i can't go past the

4991
03:04:45,200 --> 03:04:49,359
cheeky bong hit

4992
03:04:46,799 --> 03:04:51,119
yeah that too i i mean i love

4993
03:04:49,359 --> 03:04:53,760
right before you called like i scrubbed

4994
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:55,920
my bong out with alcohol and filled it

4995
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:56,880
with nice cold water and it's like oh

4996
03:04:55,920 --> 03:04:58,639
man

4997
03:04:56,879 --> 03:04:59,679
i was smoking that purple

4998
03:04:58,639 --> 03:05:02,239
um

4999
03:04:59,680 --> 03:05:04,000
wookie v2

5000
03:05:02,239 --> 03:05:05,680
and um you know it's really unique

5001
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:07,920
purple profile is different than other

5002
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:10,960
ones man there's nothing like that

5003
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:13,279
flavor you're altering it with uh

5004
03:05:10,959 --> 03:05:14,398
five different forms of distillation and

5005
03:05:13,279 --> 03:05:16,800
then re

5006
03:05:14,398 --> 03:05:20,318
configuring it to your tastes that's

5007
03:05:16,799 --> 03:05:22,719
good for you but that's not good for me

5008
03:05:20,318 --> 03:05:23,519
yeah no i can agree with that sentiment

5009
03:05:22,719 --> 03:05:25,920
so

5010
03:05:23,520 --> 03:05:27,840
that brings us to our last few questions

5011
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:30,159
which are kind of quick fire questions

5012
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:33,200
so first one up what's your favorite

5013
03:05:30,159 --> 03:05:37,119
strain of all time it's one that nobody

5014
03:05:33,200 --> 03:05:39,840
knows about it's waco just a um

5015
03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:41,760
just a local stream

5016
03:05:39,840 --> 03:05:44,000
but everybody that ever knew of waco

5017
03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:45,920
will agrees

5018
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:48,478
and what do you suspect is the genetics

5019
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:51,760
behind that one

5020
03:05:48,478 --> 03:05:54,639
uh nl5hs

5021
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:56,318
haha it pops its head up again so flip

5022
03:05:54,639 --> 03:05:58,478
side of the spectrum what's your least

5023
03:05:56,318 --> 03:06:01,840
favorite strain of all time

5024
03:05:58,478 --> 03:06:01,840
oh my god that's so easy

5025
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:05,840
it's uh

5026
03:06:03,439 --> 03:06:07,760
dynafem purple power

5027
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:10,559
[ __ ] a friend of mine he he just thought

5028
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:12,079
it'd be smart to grow femmes about 15 10

5029
03:06:10,559 --> 03:06:14,079
15 years ago

5030
03:06:12,079 --> 03:06:15,520
and it was a clandestine grow basically

5031
03:06:14,079 --> 03:06:17,200
his wife didn't want him to grow he dug

5032
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:18,720
out the dog got the basement under the

5033
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:20,960
house and

5034
03:06:18,719 --> 03:06:22,959
he gets that [ __ ] and

5035
03:06:20,959 --> 03:06:25,919
man it was poor weed

5036
03:06:22,959 --> 03:06:28,159
it was dark purple or real pretty purple

5037
03:06:25,920 --> 03:06:30,239
lots of uh

5038
03:06:28,159 --> 03:06:33,439
violet and magenta and then a lot of

5039
03:06:30,239 --> 03:06:34,799
dark purple too but it was a no high

5040
03:06:33,439 --> 03:06:38,398
pig

5041
03:06:34,799 --> 03:06:38,398
and it tasted like shitty purple

5042
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:43,040
yeah i think we've all had an experience

5043
03:06:41,520 --> 03:06:44,159
or two like that

5044
03:06:43,040 --> 03:06:46,000
so

5045
03:06:44,159 --> 03:06:47,760
what would be your desert island strains

5046
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:50,159
you can take three with you what would

5047
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:50,159
they be

5048
03:06:52,318 --> 03:06:54,639
um

5049
03:06:55,520 --> 03:06:59,840
purple hindu kush that i got from uh

5050
03:07:00,159 --> 03:07:03,760
the nature farm

5051
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:07,200
it it's it's

5052
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:09,920
it's really the one and uh i would say

5053
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:11,680
tkno5 haze the one that we are just now

5054
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:13,279
digging through

5055
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:14,159
and for the other one it's gonna have to

5056
03:07:13,279 --> 03:07:15,520
be

5057
03:07:14,159 --> 03:07:16,398
that

5058
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:19,120
my old

5059
03:07:16,398 --> 03:07:19,119
dream time

5060
03:07:19,520 --> 03:07:22,880
chocolate tie that

5061
03:07:21,040 --> 03:07:25,439
you know

5062
03:07:22,879 --> 03:07:26,959
truly had me going i would say the high

5063
03:07:25,439 --> 03:07:29,120
was so high that it could have been damn

5064
03:07:26,959 --> 03:07:31,519
opm dipped you know but i was still you

5065
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:33,279
know 12 so

5066
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:37,200
but uh there are no highs like that

5067
03:07:33,279 --> 03:07:37,200
anywhere in the world today except opium

5068
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:41,439
yeah wow definitely definitely

5069
03:07:39,439 --> 03:07:43,600
definitely so

5070
03:07:41,439 --> 03:07:45,520
uh next question is if you could only

5071
03:07:43,600 --> 03:07:47,279
recommend one of your strains for

5072
03:07:45,520 --> 03:07:49,279
someone to grow out or let's say give

5073
03:07:47,279 --> 03:07:50,640
them a packet just so that it's there in

5074
03:07:49,279 --> 03:07:53,840
their hands which one pack would you be

5075
03:07:50,639 --> 03:07:53,840
given to people

5076
03:07:55,359 --> 03:08:00,479
right now i would go with the tk905

5077
03:07:58,559 --> 03:08:01,439
uh haze f2

5078
03:08:00,478 --> 03:08:02,478
but

5079
03:08:01,439 --> 03:08:04,398
until i

5080
03:08:02,478 --> 03:08:07,119
you know just rediscovered that i would

5081
03:08:04,398 --> 03:08:10,000
have said skunk cabbage i gave out

5082
03:08:07,120 --> 03:08:11,920
over 3 000 seeds of it hundreds of packs

5083
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:14,000
of it and then sold hundreds of packs

5084
03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:15,520
and i've never had one person ever say

5085
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:18,000
bad about it

5086
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:20,800
so um

5087
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:23,200
pretty damn good one

5088
03:08:20,799 --> 03:08:25,519
hell yeah sounds like a solid one so if

5089
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:27,040
you could go back in time to any place

5090
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:29,040
anywhere throughout history to

5091
03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:31,439
presumably collect some land race seeds

5092
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:32,800
where would you be heading

5093
03:08:31,439 --> 03:08:35,040
you know this

5094
03:08:32,799 --> 03:08:36,639
tell me you tell me because you know the

5095
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:38,240
answer

5096
03:08:36,639 --> 03:08:40,879
gonna get some tie

5097
03:08:38,239 --> 03:08:44,959
well it'll be there but i'm going to the

5098
03:08:40,879 --> 03:08:47,358
castle right to the cannabis castle

5099
03:08:44,959 --> 03:08:51,199
you look at the collection at that point

5100
03:08:47,359 --> 03:08:53,920
in time what was available to the layman

5101
03:08:51,200 --> 03:08:56,240
oh my god this like

5102
03:08:53,920 --> 03:08:58,000
a hundred years worth of work done

5103
03:08:56,239 --> 03:09:00,318
waiting for you

5104
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:02,959
yeah definitely definitely go uh steel

5105
03:09:00,318 --> 03:09:04,398
neville's collection

5106
03:09:02,959 --> 03:09:06,719
yeah because you're gonna hit it on

5107
03:09:04,398 --> 03:09:09,840
every note

5108
03:09:06,719 --> 03:09:12,000
including the uh you know g13 in its

5109
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:14,880
purest form and just like everything in

5110
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:17,200
its purest form

5111
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:19,599
yeah yeah yeah sounds like a plan i will

5112
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:22,000
uh i will join you on that one yeah if

5113
03:09:19,600 --> 03:09:24,399
we can get a time machine um

5114
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:25,920
we're going there first

5115
03:09:24,398 --> 03:09:28,159
i love it so

5116
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:29,600
what are you most excited about that's

5117
03:09:28,159 --> 03:09:32,398
going to come from the community in the

5118
03:09:29,600 --> 03:09:33,760
near future as far as you can tell

5119
03:09:32,398 --> 03:09:34,879
i guess just the

5120
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:37,600
overall

5121
03:09:34,879 --> 03:09:40,079
legislation that's being put in

5122
03:09:37,600 --> 03:09:41,680
for nationwide legalization i don't

5123
03:09:40,079 --> 03:09:43,359
think it's fair for people that live in

5124
03:09:41,680 --> 03:09:46,720
arkansas and

5125
03:09:43,359 --> 03:09:48,640
texas and um georgia and

5126
03:09:46,719 --> 03:09:50,639
the nebraska you know there's

5127
03:09:48,639 --> 03:09:55,278
anti-states that it's not fair at all

5128
03:09:50,639 --> 03:09:57,760
for medicinal users uh especially them

5129
03:09:55,279 --> 03:09:59,600
but and it's a super legitimate thing

5130
03:09:57,760 --> 03:10:02,880
they are they're

5131
03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:04,880
treating them as outcasts and heavy drug

5132
03:10:02,879 --> 03:10:06,000
users and won't give them an opportunity

5133
03:10:04,879 --> 03:10:07,599
to uh

5134
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:09,359
you know get any relief from something

5135
03:10:07,600 --> 03:10:12,159
that's going to help them without you

5136
03:10:09,359 --> 03:10:14,238
know have adverse effects to anybody

5137
03:10:12,159 --> 03:10:16,719
it's going to be a good biomass producer

5138
03:10:14,238 --> 03:10:20,639
and help the earth as opposed to

5139
03:10:16,719 --> 03:10:22,879
you know destroying the earth so

5140
03:10:20,639 --> 03:10:24,959
the movement should spread

5141
03:10:22,879 --> 03:10:27,278
i don't like the idea of marlboro you

5142
03:10:24,959 --> 03:10:29,199
know producing packs of

5143
03:10:27,279 --> 03:10:30,560
marijuana cigarettes and then that's

5144
03:10:29,200 --> 03:10:33,680
going to be the mainstream thing would

5145
03:10:30,559 --> 03:10:35,519
be like you know concentrate pens and

5146
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:37,359
i like it

5147
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:39,600
my dream would be that

5148
03:10:37,359 --> 03:10:41,120
have both sides available like what we

5149
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:43,840
do up here we're able to still have a

5150
03:10:41,120 --> 03:10:46,160
medical permit up here and i can grow

5151
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:48,960
with my wife i can have 60 plants i can

5152
03:10:46,159 --> 03:10:51,359
have a six plant count plus a 24 plant

5153
03:10:48,959 --> 03:10:53,839
extended medical account and she can

5154
03:10:51,359 --> 03:10:55,920
also so if you could have a happy medium

5155
03:10:53,840 --> 03:10:57,359
in all the states of

5156
03:10:55,920 --> 03:10:59,439
you know say

5157
03:10:57,359 --> 03:11:01,040
i'd like to see 12 plants

5158
03:10:59,439 --> 03:11:02,960
because they're harsh now going down to

5159
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:05,359
six and three and then completely

5160
03:11:02,959 --> 03:11:08,559
blocking in other places so

5161
03:11:05,359 --> 03:11:10,960
the the legalization movement is bound

5162
03:11:08,559 --> 03:11:12,799
to happen and the decriminalization and

5163
03:11:10,959 --> 03:11:14,079
the rescheduling

5164
03:11:12,799 --> 03:11:15,920
of cannabis

5165
03:11:14,079 --> 03:11:17,600
uh from schedule one

5166
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:20,318
that is they're going to be the biggest

5167
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:23,279
and best thing in the cannabis movement

5168
03:11:20,318 --> 03:11:25,119
it might you know help out corporate

5169
03:11:23,279 --> 03:11:27,680
way more than it'll help out the

5170
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:30,399
mom-and-pop but um it'll give relief to

5171
03:11:27,680 --> 03:11:31,840
the people that couldn't get it

5172
03:11:30,398 --> 03:11:34,478
yeah certainly

5173
03:11:31,840 --> 03:11:37,439
certainly so final question for the

5174
03:11:34,478 --> 03:11:39,679
interview can we expect to ever see your

5175
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:42,159
seeds available via some seed banks kind

5176
03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:43,760
of more commercially available

5177
03:11:42,159 --> 03:11:46,879
i'm not against

5178
03:11:43,760 --> 03:11:49,920
selling through seed banks but i am

5179
03:11:46,879 --> 03:11:51,920
still working a nine to five job even

5180
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:55,200
though the earthquake had destroyed the

5181
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:58,238
body shop and we're at a low point we

5182
03:11:55,200 --> 03:12:00,079
are you know fixing to go back online

5183
03:11:58,238 --> 03:12:04,238
and i don't really want to walk away

5184
03:12:00,079 --> 03:12:06,639
from what i've done for a very long time

5185
03:12:04,238 --> 03:12:06,639
and

5186
03:12:06,959 --> 03:12:10,318
i will probably

5187
03:12:08,478 --> 03:12:12,559
pick up a couple seed banks just because

5188
03:12:10,318 --> 03:12:14,000
i've been offered and

5189
03:12:12,559 --> 03:12:16,719
it just makes me have to work harder

5190
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:18,398
though to make the commitment and keep

5191
03:12:16,719 --> 03:12:20,398
everything happy

5192
03:12:18,398 --> 03:12:22,238
so if i didn't uh

5193
03:12:20,398 --> 03:12:23,599
so it's either quit working quit fishing

5194
03:12:22,238 --> 03:12:24,959
and hunting

5195
03:12:23,600 --> 03:12:27,120
oh um

5196
03:12:24,959 --> 03:12:28,238
and i don't want to

5197
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:30,079
i don't want to do either one of those

5198
03:12:28,238 --> 03:12:32,719
yet i like to work

5199
03:12:30,079 --> 03:12:34,079
crazy but yeah i would say yeah i'm

5200
03:12:32,719 --> 03:12:35,599
gonna

5201
03:12:34,079 --> 03:12:38,318
i'm not i'm not the kind of guy that's

5202
03:12:35,600 --> 03:12:39,359
gonna jump on everything either so uh

5203
03:12:38,318 --> 03:12:42,719
it's coming

5204
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:45,520
coming to the future near you

5205
03:12:42,719 --> 03:12:46,879
hell yeah so with that being said did

5206
03:12:45,520 --> 03:12:48,399
you have any comments or shout outs you

5207
03:12:46,879 --> 03:12:50,238
wanted to make

5208
03:12:48,398 --> 03:12:51,278
to uh

5209
03:12:50,238 --> 03:12:52,159
you

um

5211
03:12:52,159 --> 03:12:57,200
all australians i think uh they're

5212
03:12:55,040 --> 03:12:58,239
probably the next best people

5213
03:12:57,200 --> 03:13:01,200
um

5214
03:12:58,238 --> 03:13:04,478
next to alaskans and uh

5215
03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:07,040
my partners of 35 years

5216
03:13:04,478 --> 03:13:09,438
for not ever having a problem with what

5217
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:11,520
i've done and said and we've just always

5218
03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:14,479
