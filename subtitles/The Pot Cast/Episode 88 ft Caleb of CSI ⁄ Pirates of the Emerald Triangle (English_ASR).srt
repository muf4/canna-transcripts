129
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:37,199
all the original lines I reproduced you

know seven eight nine 10 years ago um as

131
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,800
far as the the regular pirate stuff and

132
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:46,918
then just keeping busy uh trying to make

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,639
you know a whole catalog of you know

134
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,680
s1's for preservation and you know some

135
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,800

tastes so let's let's touch on both the

138
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,120
most recent regular line you've done if

139
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,160
I'm not mistaken is that the DC hybrid

140
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,280
or or do you consider that still in

141
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:14,039
progress um oh I uh reproduced the DC uh

142
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,478

143
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:20,759
pinear the Christmas pintar is actually

144
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:25,000
coming up soon um and then uh the

145
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:29,960
Burmese uh I think the Burmese

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is one I I don't know it's it's

147
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:38,519
one one of the most uh um difficult ones

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,598
you know because sativas are not easy um

149
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,120
pure

150
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:47,839
sativas um and then uh then I U I have

151
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,360
Panama on Deck so you know wow you

152
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,719
starting to tap into your sativa side of

153
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,520
things oh yeah well I've always had it

154
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,879
it's just and they're a

155
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:02,318
pain you know any any of these uh you

156
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,560
know pure pure sativas that take 20 24

157
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,000
weeks they don't even start flowering

158
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,639
for six weeks you know I mean come on

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,680
you don't have a seed set until eight

160
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,160
weeks deep yeah I was about to say I saw

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,079

162
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,879
burmes you posted up and could have been

163
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,000
week two in my garden but I think you

164
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,560
said it was week six or seven or eight

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,800
maybe yeah oh it was probably close to

166
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,360
eight yeah yeah wow what's that burmes

167
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:35,400
like and where did it come from

168
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,800
so the burmes uh I rep I reproduced that

169
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,799
oh I don't know maybe eight or nine

170
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,720
years ago something like that I forget

171
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:48,240
um but uh um the the seeds my buddy had

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,919
been given were from the late 90s and

173
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,000
they had sat in his fridge forever and

174
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:56,279
he passed them to me there was like 70

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,800
seeds or something um and he had gotten

176
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:03,478
them um from you know through the grap

177
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,240
Vine from this dude uh who went by the

178
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:10,038
handle preservation dude or colonel

179
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,840
colonel Cosmic I think um but this dude

180
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:15,399
was you know really well known around

181
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:19,799
like you know Central California the Bay

182
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:23,478
Area um and you know he preserved a lot

183
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,800
of stuff and so I don't know exactly how

184
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:29,279
far back they date before him but

185
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,519
they're at least you know mid 90s if not

186
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:35,120
you know he probably had him for quite a

187
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:38,679
while you know but he he passed on o

188
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,560
probably damn near 20 years ago maybe 15

189
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,038
but you know it's been a while yeah wow

190
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,958
and you mentioned it's like one of those

191
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,639
like really really long flowering

192
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,039
sativas what what do you think you could

193
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,679
compare it to like is it is the effect

194
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,599
and the smell like not dissimilar to

195
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,919
other plants that go that long or is

196
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,639
like how would you describe it for

197
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,719
someone I guess it's definitely like a

198
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,879
tie plant

199
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,680
you know wow it's a it's an old school

200
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:06,720
tie type of

201
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,559
plant damn and and does it have that

202
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,639
same sort of effect like real

203
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:15,039
uplifting oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's

204
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,720
it's it's right in line with all that

205
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,958
kind of stuff for sure oh that's

206
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,519
beautiful we actually had a fan submit a

207
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,000
question and they said they were

208
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,480
thinking about pulling the trigger on

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,120
the Burmese and they wanted to ask you

210
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,519
how many packs do you think they should

211
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,679
run through to find like what you would

212
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
consider one of the better

213
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,559
plans I

214
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,800
mean you know I'm not going to go all

215
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:43,599
Tom Hill and say you need a

216
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:46,078
hundred but I I I'd say you know um just

217
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,040
my personal recommendation just just do

218
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:54,199
one and then you know give it a try and

219
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:59,199
because they're they're not easy to grow

220
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:01,040
uh just by themselves you know I mean as

221
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,320
especially if you haven't grown sativas

222
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,240
before I mean you you can flower out a

223
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,720
little 6inch sativa and end up with an 8

224
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,799
foot tall plant you

225
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,079
know before it even starts putting

226
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,078
flowers on you know totally totally

227
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,120
maybe just yeah maybe just get over the

228
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,559
initial hurdle before we go to Tom Hill

229
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,039
on it that makes sense for sure yeah you

230
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,039
know I guess as a followup I'd be

231
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,519
interested in general when you offer

232
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,919
your preservation lines I love how you

233
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,759
do like 21 seeds or more in a pack is

234
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,799
that because you are trying to encourage

235
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,559
people to like do a little digging or is

236
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:41,000
it just because you get more seeds or

237
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:43,439
something like that so you know I was I

238
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,480
was a member of you know plenty of these

239
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,480
like preservation groups you know land

240
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,320
race groups you know online for years

241
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,159
and you always would see people

242
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,079
sprouting four seeds or 10 seeds and I'm

243
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:59,600
like no no no no no I mean hell honestly

244
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:02,719
i' I'd like to you know just do 100

245
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,120
packs you know minimum 100 packs but the

246
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,000
reality is not everybody has the space

247
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,399
or the time to do 100 at a time so I do

248
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,039
21 because I'm like well at least make

249
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,278
your selection from you know a bigger

250
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,559
amount or if you're going to open

251
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,679
pollinate you know do it from a bigger

252
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,039
amount you know and I know I know a

253
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:26,719
hundred's not perfect you know a

254
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:29,078
thousand's better but you know I

255
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,720
mean you know we're just trying to pre

256
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:32,519
preserve as many of the genes as

257
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,879
possible for future Generations

258
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,440
essentially you know yeah hugely hugely

259
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,919
and I I can definitely get on board with

260
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,800
the sentiment of you know you see people

261
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,759
doing three or four seed open poles and

262
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,719
you're like oh

263
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,000
no I mean you

264
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,519
know uh that'll that'll definitely

265
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,559
narrow it down to what you want or don't

266
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,278
want that's it that's it right okay I

267
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,359
mean while you mentioned the Burmese you

268
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,240
know it's like a tie type plan and we

269
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,278
just quickly touched on Tom I'd love to

270
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,879
ask would you have any interest in

271
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,240
running Tom's

272
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:09,679
Hayes um I mean I think Tom's doing a

273
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,560
pretty damn good job with with that you

274
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,198
know I'd really like to you know see him

275
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,278
after he gets his open pollination his

276
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:18,679
most recent open pollination done I'd

277
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,958
like to see him actually get in there

278
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,239
and you know directionally go somewhere

279
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,399
with it and get that ratio of one and

280
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,799
100 you know maybe a little little lower

281
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,360
one in 10 that'd be nice I would be

282
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,319
appreciative I'm looking for that

283
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,720
mythical Haze clone and I just sadly

284
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,560
don't have enough

285
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,600
space yeah yeah yeah but uh I I listened

286
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:45,319
to your interview with him and I really

287
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,560
liked it and I I I relate it a lot

288
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,440
because uh it seems you know Tom and I

289
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:54,479
we we've always tended to preserve but

290
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,560
we've we've never done a whole lot on

291
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,879
like directionally just narrowing it

292
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,719
down and you know making something

293
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,519
that's just you know you know really

294
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,480
high quality out of the things we've

295
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,399
preserved you know we're always on to

296
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,839
the next thing you know so you

297
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,600
know I'm I'm trying to take

298
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,399
notes oh you're too kind thanks for for

299
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,959
listening to that one and and look you

300
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,399
know what I I feel like you touched on a

301
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,559
really focal feeling that a lot of

302
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,399
Growers have which I try to relate to

303
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,359
people and I say sometimes as you're

304
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,720
getting towards the end of a project or

305
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,440
like a Harvest or whatever you're almost

306
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
like checked out of those plants and

307
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,560
you're more invested in like what's

308
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,679
about to you're like I'm about to flip

309
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:41,958
these other things they're going to be

310
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,958
bomb Oh especially if it's 24 weeks

311
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:49,639
later oh where' the year

312
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:51,799
go wow so yeah that's cool that's cool

313
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,919
okay I mean and you know we're talking

314
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,679
about Tom you did you did the Deep chunk

315
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,319
project any any interesting takeaways or

316
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,758
observations you made while doing that

317
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,720
one

318
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:07,278
um I definitely found some some uh some

319
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,959
plants I didn't really um you know I

320
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,919
hadn't noticed before in previous

321
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:15,518
reproductions um I think I just you know

322
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:19,278
in my old age I'm paying more attention

323
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,639
moving a little slower you know and

324
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,320
there there was some there were some uh

325
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,240
some sniffs that I wasn't expecting just

326
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,800
you know a little little skunky to them

327
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,399
and I was like hm you know I don't

328
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:35,198
know it could blend well with some

329
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,958
things that's exciting to hear I I would

330
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,319
love to ask you specifically I know

331
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,119
you've been posting some really

332
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,000
impressive looking photos of some deep

333
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,519
chunk males you've been playing around

334
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,759
with I think you've narrowed them down a

335
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,278
little bit were there any specific

336
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,560
traits or things you were looking for

337
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:52,720
with that selection or how did you

338
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:55,439
Whittle them down I was looking for

339
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,040
stinky ones and you know of course

340
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,399
Frosty ones you know I mean I I asked

341
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,559
Tom you know what do you go for in those

342
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,399
males and he's like I like the frosty

343
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,758
ones so you

344
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:12,120
know you know I was I was you know

345
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,278
making sure I got those ones beautiful

346
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,720
beautiful beautiful and do you think

347
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,720
that like people are are Keen for the

348
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,959
Deep chunk or do you think that it's

349
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,040
sort of a bit difficult for a lot of

350
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,599
people to

351
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:28,719
grow oh yeah I mean in its own it's own

352
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,120
regard it's it's just as difficult as

353
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,600
like you know the sativas you know it's

354
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:39,440
a short Stumpy super slow growing you

355
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,800
know inbred inbred Indica you know and I

356
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,800
mean anytime you get anything inbred you

357
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,439
know whether it's indica or

358
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:51,679
sativa you know it's not they're not the

359
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,800
easiest to grow you know so certainly

360
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,000
and and how would you like compare and

361
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,519
contrast it to say the maah line cuz

362
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,198
I've been eyeing that one off and I'm

363
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,399
like oo I kind of think I want to run

364
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,359
the Mazar how are they different how are

365
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:07,519
they the

366
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:10,600
same um the Mazar it tends to like grow

367
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,078
a little little little faster or a bit

368
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,240
faster really have have more distance

369
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:19,000
between the nodes and more be like a a

370
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,839
traditional type of just

371
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,720
um kind of like a Hindu Kush type of

372
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,839
thing um definitely uh you know not the

373
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,839
monster you know fan leaves of the Deep

374
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,560
chunk and the super stoutness and all

375
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,160
that you know it's it's more of a

376
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:39,439
regular indicia type versus deep deep

377
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:43,000
chunks yeah

378
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,759
super super Inda I don't know yeah no I

379
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,039
definitely get yeah I can understand

380
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,600
that um I can't remember who it was but

381
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,198
someone was on the show and they were

382
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:56,440
saying that like The Afghani sort of

383
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:59,198
archetypal structure and flavors and

384
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,519
effects that people in say America and

385
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:05,000
and all over the world think of is sort

386
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,720
of a Mazar type plan would you say you

387
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,240
agree with that in general yeah I think

388
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,519
so I think so uh it it's definitely you

389
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,400
know more of the norm type you know

390
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:20,679
Afghan indicia type plant um there were

391
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,600
there was even a a couple of them in

392
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:27,400
there when I reproduced them last um

393
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,319
that uh were a little bit reminiscent of

394
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,320
say like a a Kush

395
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:35,879
you know you know not not Bubba for sure

396
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,319
you know but definitely you know and you

397
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,440
see that a lot with you know some of the

398
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:45,639
you know Hindu Kush you know um Afghani

399
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,400
indicas and all that you know you know

400
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,038
that that look of a plant

401
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,880
so yeah nice and and I mean like if

402
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,480
we're talking about say the ma or the

403
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,400
Deep chunk or really any of the lines

404
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,798
we've touched on so far have you found

405
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,400
any like really standout Keepers or are

406
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:02,879
you more just looking to open pollinate

407
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,840
and you're not looking to find a keeper

408
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,360
per se oh there's definitely been been

409
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:13,519
ones that you know if I had more time

410
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:15,158
more space more help I'd definitely you

411
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,440
know be keeping some of these I'm

412
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,360
terrible at keeping stuff like I'll keep

413
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,200
them for I don't know two months six

414
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:25,158
months and then it's just like you know

415
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,400
my my mother rooms are already

416
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:30,159
overflowing I I got to make decisions

417
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:34,720
and if I have SE you know I tend to let

418
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:36,280
let a lot of these Keepers go so yeah no

419
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,960
it makes sense and you sort of touched

420
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:41,279
on a question I wanted to ask you which

421
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,960
is that I can't count how many breeders

422
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,399
have just like offhandedly made the

423
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,840
comment being like godamn the amount of

424
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,038
work Caleb does is insane I I wanted to

425
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,558
ask how do you do it with just on your

426
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,679
own because I know you don't have a ton

427
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,319
of help like how many sites you got how

428
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,000
do you how do you like get

429
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:02,439
sleep

430
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I do have a very small crew of dedicated

431
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:10,000
helpers um you know I've I've got I'd

432
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,519
say three three helpers that you know

433
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,480
put in some serious time and uh you know

434
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,798
uh I

435
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,720
run five right now I I downscaled it a

436
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,679
couple years ago but I run

437
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,440
five um breeding rooms um two rags and

438
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,440
three

439
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,360
fam um and uh you know I try to stay up

440
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,279
on it I do pretty good most of the

441
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,240
time yeah truly it it it really is

442
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:40,960
honestly inspiring to see how much work

443
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,000
you put out and you know cuz I feel like

444
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,960
sometimes it's easy to drag your feet on

445
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,038
projects and to like you know just dick

446
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,679
around and there have been times in my

447
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,279
life where I've been more productive

448
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,200
than maybe I am currently and then I I

449
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,678
look at you and I'm like damn that's

450
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,519
that's honestly the

451
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:03,038
goal right right uh would be nice if you

452
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,599
know I only had one or two projects that

453
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,919
that kind of sounds good to me lately we

454
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,319
need a crowd fund some help so you can

455
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,320

really nice CS Cuts floating around

461
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:28,240
Australia like the one that jumps to

462
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:32,279
mind immediately is I know that there's

463
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,319
a really nice lemon tree headband cut

464
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,158
that my buddy found and oh my God

465
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:40,480

467
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,200
big fan of that lemon tree yes and the

468
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,360
headband well before we get there I want

469
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,159
to quickly ask because we've sort of

470
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,599
been talking about some of the older

471
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,799
projects you've been doing can you give

472
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:59,719
me any insights on the uz Becky stand

473
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:02,079
line so that um that came from Charlie

474
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,759
Garcia um

475
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:10,000
and um that was from the original seeds

476
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:12,440
he reproduced before he outcrossed it to

477
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,519
the Northern Lights

478
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,000
um and

479
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,400
um I got those uh or or we got those um

480
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,480
I think through

481
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:29,200
bod um so Charlie had given them to um

482
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,519
this this one cat who had then given

483
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,400
them to Bodie and then I ended up

484
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,158
getting them from bod and reproducing

485
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,720
them gave a bunch to Bodie gave a bunch

486
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:44,039
to Charlie you know um but it's just a

487
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,480
it's another old school you know indicia

488
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:50,200
um kind of a leggier indicia plant but

489
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,960
just super super Frosty hash plant style

490
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,240
like like when when you hear people talk

491
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,400
about hash plant and then you get these

492
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,519
hash plant clones that have no Frost

493
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,278
it's like why are you calling a hash

494
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:04,000
plant but the US Becky you could call it

495
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,000
a hash plant because it's a frosty hash

496
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,038
plant so you

497
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,119
know but yeah that that's awesome it's

498
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,599
definitely one of the more rarer ones I

499
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,639
think and so it definitely has a bit of

500
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:19,278
Allure to it it almost like touches on

501
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,400
that same interesting Vibe when people

502
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:24,759
see bod's ancient OG and they're like oo

503
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,000
Iranian that sounds intriguing it's like

504
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:29,240
from a part of the world that you just

505
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,359
never hear from you know right right

506
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,038
right right yeah yeah there you go well

507
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,359
the last sort of mutant one I was hoping

508
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,158
to quickly touch on because I know you

509
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,199
got a bit of experience with it is over

510
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,600
the past few years you've um done SL

511
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,000
collabed on some cool um Australian

512
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,839
bastard cannabis stuff what what's that

513
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,519
experience been like has that changed

514
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,359
your outlook on things at

515
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:55,599
all you you know

516
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:59,079
uh I I I did a lot of work with it for a

517
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:01,319
few years there and

518
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,319
um it actually it taught me a lot it

519
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:08,519
taught me more about breeding than

520
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:11,278
anything um in the fact that um

521
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:15,440
basically anything ABC is going to be a

522
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:19,119
recessive genetic and you can breed you

523
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,400
know these recessives on ev Everything

524
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:26,519
You know you you grow out 100 you know

525
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:29,480
F1 F2 F3 them and you can breed those

526
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,679
recessives but the end of the day uh

527
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:37,159
most of those recessives aren't aren't

528
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:40,480
the best uh plants you know and ABC is a

529
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:42,440
tough one I mean the only the only one

530
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,679
I've ever seen that you know really

531
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,080
looks like a halfway decent plant is you

532
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,360
know um you know homeboy over in your

533
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,480
neck of the woods you know who I'm

534
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,839
talking about I was going to give him a

535
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,558
shout out bin chicken shout out

536
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:00,439
doua yeah yeah I mean he has a he has a

537
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:03,759
Navy see that looks like a damn normal

538
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,679
plant you know yeah and there's a lot of

539
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:09,038
like interesting genetics in there as

540
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:13,840
well right it's a hybrid of a hybrid of

541
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:16,158
a hybrid yeah so okay and like I mean as

542
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,839
a followup you made like a bunch of cool

543
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,799
hybrids I remember there was like a TK

544
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,240
hybrid there was a cheese hybrid there

545
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,119
was there was a number of them I don't

546
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,880
want to do a disservice by forgetting

547
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,839
one or two so we'll just cap it there

548
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,880
but did any of them end up doing what

549
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,278
you hoped where like you got a lot of

550
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,880
influence from that regular mother on

551
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:36,240
the ABC type plant or it was more harder

552
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,360
than just doing the

553
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:45,319
cross I mean so I I honestly think I

554
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:49,719
chose wrong uh at least with the ones I

555
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:54,319
did um I took a TK um you know times ABC

556
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:58,798
to F4 and I found in the F2 Generation I

557
00:24:54,319 --> 00:25:04,000
found uh you know a a plant that um um

558
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:06,519
was an OG Kush ABC plant right um but

559
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,159
then when I BR it to the

560
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,879
F3 you you C you couldn't even find any

561
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,640
of that OG

562
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,440
cush you know as far as TPS go you could

563
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,520
find the look sure but you couldn't

564
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,519
there there I didn't get any of the TPS

565
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,200
you know

566
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,240
so um and there's a few ways you know I

567
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,319
could Backtrack on that um one of them

568
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:35,278
would be uh to uh make a feminized you

569
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,879
know with an OG Kush you know type and

570
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:41,440
then breed into the the problem with ABC

571
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:45,520
is it's always been Tor pentalene Dom

572
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,519
like many many many sativas and you know

573
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,720
even indicas but it's hard breeding

574
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:54,038
terpinolene

575
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,399
out yeah I've often wondered why that is

576
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,240
like it it is such a dominant gene isn't

577
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:01,398
it I wonder if it's just

578
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,038
maybe it was like one of the first Tes

579
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:05,359
to ever be expressed by cannabis and

580
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,079
it's just so deep seeded in the genome

581
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,798
or

582
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:11,398
something right I mean back in back in

583
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:13,720
the day Hy hyp told me good luck

584
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:16,439
breeding the tarpening out of

585
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,000
ABC and he worked with it for 20 years

586
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,000
so you know that that's that's

587
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,599
experience right

588
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,839
there wow that that's really cool to

589
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,000
hear it taught you so much I I I

590
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:28,879
wouldn't have guessed but then when you

591
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,960
said it out loud I was like oh I guess

592
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,360
that that makes sense actually right I

593
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,880
mean don't get me wrong though I do like

594
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,639
tentene um I'm just not the hugest fan

595
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,640
of smoking terpinolene like I like the

596
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,080
sniff but I

597
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,200
mean the smoke just never hits I don't

598
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:51,558
know well I mean before I forget what is

599
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:56,558
your favorite sort of tpine profile oh I

600
00:26:51,558 --> 00:27:00,678
I love uh limonin uh pinin um you know

601
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:04,480
even like Limon Lun uh

602
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:08,038
aamin uh any any of those just I I think

603
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,960
though the the the the loning and pining

604
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:13,839
are probably pretty close to my

605
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,840
favorites yeah beautiful I mean I guess

606
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:19,158
you must love like the lemon lime OG's

607
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,839
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and the the lemon

608
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,720
tree turps even Skittles

609
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:28,240
o that I mean you know that's a whole

610
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,120
another topic well going to get there

611
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,200
don't worry I I wanted to I wanted to

612
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,839
ask you so we've spoken about some of

613
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,600
the regular projects you've been doing

614
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:40,038
recently let's now talk about the fem I

615
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,278
know that the community is absolutely

616
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:44,398
bursting at the seams to get their hands

617
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:46,278
on these F1 Durban hybrids you've been

618
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:49,038
making right tell us a little bit about

619
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,839
this one how did this project come about

620
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,720
I mean uh you know I've always kind of

621
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,839
wanted to test

622
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,600
theories and you know see if certain

623
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:02,038
claims are you know what they what they

624
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:04,359
are um I mean you know most folks know

625
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:09,558
that you know [ __ ] you know claimed

626
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:13,158
that you know uh What uh cherry pie was

627
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:14,759
F1 derb times granddaddy purple and then

628
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:21,480
Girl Scouts

629
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:23,440
was um uh Flo flowa OG times F1 derb now

630
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,038
you know you got other folks like Kenny

631
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,558
Powers being like nah uhuh and then you

632
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:34,079
got you know other cats like s flux

633
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:35,440
capacitor being like yeah no so you know

634
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,038
you got a lot of these folks in the

635
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,720
cookie fam you know who actually were

636
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:44,640
more into the breeding side of things or

637
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,600
accident side of things I don't

638
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,640
know saying we don't think so but you

639
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:55,199
know uh it doesn't hurt to try out the

640
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:59,080
F1 derb uh itself grows like Girl Scout

641
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,159
cookies but it doesn't smell like Girl

642
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:04,759
Scout

643
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:06,679
cookies so that's very interesting what

644
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:10,960
what does it smell like had of

645
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:13,759
curiosity h a stem rub um I I was

646
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,640
hitting old uh Noto dog up and being

647
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,640
like the stem rub smells like a Mendo

648
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,880
purple

649
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,640
hybrid and S flux

650
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,640
capacitor he he was alluding I think

651
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,080
don't quote me but he was alluding to

652
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,480
you know that F1 dur being a Mendo

653
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,278
purple hybrid of

654
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,839
sorts you know I don't I don't know but

655
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:38,519
that seub it was just like because

656
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,639
anybody who smelled meno purple on the

657
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,919
stem rub it is one of the most pungent

658
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,640
just o wee plants you've ever smelled in

659
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,880
your life and that F1 derb has that same

660
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,960
thing but then it it it produces kind of

661
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,679
a a cookie is kind of nugget you know a

662
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,519
flower um and and then that Sim up

663
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,440
doesn't really translate so much to the

664
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:07,000
flower which you know it

665
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,960
happens yeah wow that's that's so so

666
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,519
interesting and I mean out of curiosity

667
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,759
does the F1 derb does it smoke just like

668
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:21,200
a regular durb what what's it like on

669
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:26,480
its own okay um I'm mostly familiar with

670
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:29,480
uh the uh this cut that goes around

671
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,599
Colorado Oregon California yeah as

672
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:37,240
Durban Poison and it's just a a super

673
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:40,599
strong it it tests it like five% or

674
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,759
4.5% uh pure

675
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:49,359
terpinolene and so the F1 derb I I don't

676
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:54,200
smell any t pentalene in it you know

677
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:57,439
so but then uh you know there might be a

678
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,480
aspects of like uh black licorice Anis

679
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,480
to it which you know uh most people

680
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,880
associate that with Durban Poison you

681
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,200
know the original old school Urban

682
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:12,240
Poison um but Mendo purple like

683
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,000
especially in the s1s there's all kinds

684
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,000
of black licorish and Anis in that stuff

685
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,919
so I associate it more with the meno

686
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,919
purple whereas other people might

687
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,320
associate with you know an old school

688
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,080
Durban

689
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:30,638
Poison yes okay okay this is all very

690
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,599
interesting cuz it all it definitely

691
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:35,319
checks out in your head cuz the meno per

692
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,719
structure is also probably not too

693
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:41,079
different to a cookie structure in a

694
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,200
sense it's a it's a lanky indicia type

695
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,480
yeah yeah I was going to say you

696
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,240
mentioned earlier that there's long been

697
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,240
these speculations uh from uh from

698
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,440
Powers up jiger you know Cherry Pie has

699
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,839
F1 derb in it in GDP do you have any

700
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,440
thoughts on that do you think that's

701
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:02,038
more likely or less likely than the

702
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:05,600
cookies climb ah man I

703
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:10,720
mean I I I could go either way um you

704
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:12,439
know on that um you know maybe yes maybe

705
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,839
no you

706
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,798
know I I don't want to over speculate

707
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,359
quite yet what it makes me think is if

708
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:24,038
it was true he like jiger would have had

709
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:26,719
to have somehow been connected to like

710
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:28,240
either their crew made GDP cherry pies

711
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,038
cookie made it all and that's how he

712
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,440
knows or he was somehow tied into all of

713
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,359
the crews that did it and they're all

714
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,519
like oh yeah we all use this same clone

715
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:38,839
like it does just even from a logistics

716
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:42,159
point of view it's sort of a bit

717
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:44,759
doubtful right I think a lot of it is

718
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,799
just you know they had this plant this

719
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:50,240
plant and this plant in the room these

720
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:52,038
plants Herm you know and you know they

721
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,240
got seeds out of it and then when they

722
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:56,319
grow them out it's usually if you know

723
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,798
your plants you can you you can kind of

724
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:02,240
tell you know what might have pollinated

725
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:04,720
what you know etc etc I mean that that's

726
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,558
what got me into feminized breeding you

727
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,399
know 25 years ago you know a little Herm

728
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,038
in a room finding a seed in your sensey

729
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:15,278
crop and being like o growing that seed

730
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:17,158
out that seed don't harm grows something

731
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:21,079
fantastic like a little bit of this a

732
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,799
little bit of that it's like oh shoot

733
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:26,599
you know these femin seeds can't be as

734
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,720
bad as some people say they is you know

735
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:30,240
truly

736
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,960
truly so I mean I know you've done

737
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,159
extensive work with the kle have you had

738
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,759
any change of mind do you think kle

739
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,639
might still be in cookies or are you

740
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,879
more now leaning to the Mendo perss as

741
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:43,839
you've alluded

742
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,120
to I mean if there's GDP in there at any

743
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:50,119
step you know that's that's going to be

744
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:53,558
you know Ural right there

745
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:55,558
um I still think it has to have it there

746
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:59,240
because there's the whole OG Kush breath

747
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:02,638
thing and anytime you double up on a a

748
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,720
cookie type genetic like if you cross uh

749
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:07,119
cookies with fritters or cookies with

750
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,720
wedding cake or wedding cake with

751
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:13,559
fritters you get these

752
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:16,398
ogkb the OG Kush breath uh you know Girl

753
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,519
Scout cookie uh types and that's always

754
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,000
a doubling up on the genetic it's the

755
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,918
recessive trait coming back through in

756
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,960
any form of an

757
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:31,480
F2 and so it it's got to have that that

758
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:34,280
urle trait in there from from some way

759
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,639
somewhere you know I mean because I

760
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,480
haven't seen that that that phenotype or

761
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,800
genotype or whatever of plant you know

762
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,199
on anything but you know URL and Girl

763
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,200
Scouts going forward you

764
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,838
know yeah definitely I tend to agree

765
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,759
that I mean I guess the question then is

766
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:56,000
do you think we'll ever Truly find out

767
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,280
the lineage or do you think the best

768
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,159
we'll get is what you're doing just

769
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,640
making similar sorts of things and just

770
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,838
seeing what the seeds

771
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:07,519
produce I mean if the hybrids are

772
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:11,239
similar the same I mean uh you know I

773
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,719
think I think we can find out but you

774
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:16,159
know

775
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:19,199
um yeah yeah I don't

776
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:21,799
know it's trying yeah I mean well I was

777
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,639
gonna ask have you found that like the

778
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,039
most popular line from the F1 hybrids

779
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,519
you did with sorry the F1 Durban hybrid

780
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,599
you did is the flow r at F1 der like

781
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:35,920
people wanting to test it yeah I think

782
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,519
that's that's the one that definitely

783
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,159
holds the most

784
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,838
potential yeah H la la and have you have

785
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:47,039
you popped any of those yourself so far

786
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:49,279
is it just two early days oh no no um uh

787
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,519
they're they're they're in the ground

788
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,400
now I should have

789
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:57,920
known that's brilliant cool cool okay

790
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,519
well I mean I mean while we're on the

791
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,200
topic of the K I wanted to ask you know

792
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:04,759
have you got any urle projects in the

793
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:06,239
future because I know that like I mean k

794
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,720
work in general is pretty interesting to

795
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,239
me cuz I really like the plant I like

796
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:13,598
the effects the the flavors the smells

797
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,959
but you've also done a Twist in that

798
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,160
you've done like S2s and I think that

799
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,599
work is really quite novel among a lot

800
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,000
of breeders do you plan to take it to

801
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,838
S3s what what's your thoughts on the S2s

802
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,199
where are you at with the urle project

803
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:31,239
overall um so that that ties into you

804
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:36,399
know the whole ABC kind of recessive

805
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:39,519
inbred blah blah blah um so when when

806
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:44,559
when you grow the URL s1's out um you

807
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:47,079
get like 10% mutant which is that ogkb

808
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,400
type of plant and then you get like I

809
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,440
don't know 40 or

810
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,119
50%

811
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:57,599
crap and then then you get you know 20%

812
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,358
that you know are are pretty nice decent

813
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,880
representations and then you get maybe

814
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:05,039
10% that's just like o wee you know

815
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,119
these are high quality you know Urkle

816
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:13,279
type plants now when I took uh and you

817
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,640
know made uh Sister Sister S2s where I

818
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,319
took one sister and pollinated another

819
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:19,039
sister with it I grew a bunch of

820
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:23,079
different ones of those out and they

821
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:26,920
were all phenomenal they were like

822
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:29,839
90% uh just excellent plants you got rid

823
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,800
of all that nastiness that was in the

824
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,400
URL

825
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,359
s1s

826
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,559
Unfortunately they grow half as half as

827
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:44,159
slow or half as fast they grow twice as

828
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:46,559
slow as URL there we go and anybody

829
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:50,879
who's grown urel is like Urkel is slow

830
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:53,239
as [ __ ] and these things grow even more

831
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,640
slower well R of Snow's pce at that

832
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:59,838
point yeah but their their quality is

833
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:03,559
through the roof you know and so it's

834
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:07,639
just like as as a standalone they're

835
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:10,400
there you can't give this to any you

836
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:14,159
know it can't be grown

837
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,838
commercially you know so it's just like

838
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:20,960
well the quality is super high but the

839
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:24,318
economics of it is super low so it it

840
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,280
would be great as an

841
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:31,759
outcross um to something but not as just

842
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,560
a a a standalone type of

843
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,599
plan that's perfect cuz I wanted to ask

844
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,679
you know you've you've done a few

845
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,960
remakes of lines you've done using the

846
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,118
update like you know the KL S1 that

847
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,358
you've selected over the original when

848
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,200
you do these revised crosses do you find

849
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,400
that you get significantly different

850
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,199
results or it's just minorly different

851
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,318
but maybe a little better in certain

852
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:59,078
ways they're they're definitely

853
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:01,559
different um so uh like the 103 times

854
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:05,000
Urkel I've done it both ways I've done

855
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:11,239
uh Urkel times 103 and then 103 times

856
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:14,719
Urkel um those plants don't have the

857
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:19,199
they're like twice as big you know twice

858
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:20,639
as fast growing as the sister sister so

859
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:24,719
you know it's because it has all the

860
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:29,400
Urkle genetics and then you know um you

861
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:31,639
know the the S1 where the S1 S1 you know

862
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,920
it it doesn't have all that wide so

863
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:36,879
those those plants grew way better than

864
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,039
you know than the S1

865
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,480
s1s but their quality was way more

866
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:44,400
variable as

867
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,838
well you know they were higher C quality

868
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,639
than an S1 just by itself an URL

869
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:54,799
S1 but you know um they weren't as high

870
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:57,239
a quality as just the Sister Sister s

871
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,519
ones wow do you you think that that sort

872
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:00,118
of thing is what you're going to do

873
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:02,119
going forward like looking to hunt

874
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,280
through some s1's and then do those

875
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,200
pairings yeah no that that's that's

876
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,119
that's my favorite part that that's why

877
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:12,559
I make s1's you know I mean you know and

878
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,280
and eventually you know like you know

879
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:18,279
breed them into S2s and then and then

880
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,400
hybridize you know this F S2 population

881
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,359
with this S2 population you know and th

882
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,960
those plants those plants can really be

883
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,119
phenomenal if you make the right

884
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,720
selections that's really exciting to

885
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,880
hear I'm I'm Keen to see where it goes

886
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,759
you you've touched on a deeper sort of

887
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,680
point that I was hoping to ask you which

888
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,520
was that I was wondering have you made

889
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:44,519
any observations about the way traits

890
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:46,039
are passed on when you f one plant

891
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,880
versus the other like as you said you

892
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:50,039
reverse the 103 onto the original and

893
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,318
you reverse the original onto the 103 do

894
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,079
you find that the act of reversing a

895
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:55,920
plant and making it the pollen donor

896
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,760
changes the way it passes on genes or

897
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,358
it's Lely the

898
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:06,880
same it seems like it's different um so

899
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:10,759
um the main one I have uh example of

900
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,838
that is I grew up um let me make sure I

901
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,240
got this right I grew up I think a

902
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:21,239
hundred of um meno purple times

903
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:26,399
Urkel and the meno purple itself in s1's

904
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:28,679
is extremely variable you know um flower

905
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,720
wise smell wise I mean the plants you

906
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:36,159
know all look almost the same but once

907
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:39,239
they flower it it's all over the map um

908
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:42,159
now in the Mendo purple times Urkel it

909
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:43,439
was like all kinds of different uh meno

910
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:49,480
purle type

911
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:53,760
variations um but then I grew 20 24 25

912
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:56,599
out of the uh Urkel times meno purple

913
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:02,200
and every single plant was an URL type

914
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:05,480
plant you know um so it's almost like

915
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:07,960
you know they depending on if they are

916
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,838
used as a male or female they push

917
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,519
different things

918
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:15,519
forward you know I don't know I still

919
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,679
have a lot more experimentation to go on

920
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:21,199
all that but it definitely seems like

921
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:24,199
you know you you create different things

922
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:27,000
um depending on which one you reverse ah

923
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:28,799
you know and I remember in the past I I

924
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,639
can't remember if it was subcool or

925
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,640
someone used to say you know whatever's

926
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:36,000
the pollen donor is going to impart like

927
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:38,000
structure and potency do you think it's

928
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,880
as clearcut as that or do you think it's

929
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,679
like it's more variable and it just it

930
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:46,559
might vary I think it's real variable

931
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:49,199
especially I think it really depends on

932
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,400
you know you know what your pollen donor

933
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:56,358
is and how much you know stuff is in

934
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:59,160
that um you know I I uh had phos run up

935
00:42:56,358 --> 00:43:02,519
a bunch of stuff you know over the years

936
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:04,519
you know for better or worse and um a

937
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:10,199
lot of their data

938
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:13,519
is yeah not factual um but my main thing

939
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:17,000
for doing doing that um having things

940
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:20,318
tested is I really want to know what the

941
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,559
you know um what the stability is what

942
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:28,079
the um you know I'm having a brain fart

943
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:28,079
on the words I ain't a scientist

944
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:34,599
um you know whenever you get into an S1

945
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:38,558
S2 population you know everything

946
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:42,400
becomes more and more stable and so it

947
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,160
really depends on what you're using as

948
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,039
your

949
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:51,639
male um how how it passes forward I

950
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:53,119
think you know on on that topic I mean

951
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:54,799
it was one of the fan submitted

952
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,760
questions people were wondering you know

953
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,640
obviously the phos the way it all played

954
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,280
out and the Fallout from it left a lot

955
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:05,318
of people quite skeptical of genomic

956
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,960
companies and data collection companies

957
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:09,480
the like M do you think there's any

958
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,039
companies that are currently around that

959
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,679
you would trust with it or you're just

960
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:13,800
not really engaging in that sort of

961
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:16,879
thing at the

962
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:21,920
moment I haven't uh entertained it too

963
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:24,240
much just because um you know uh F's

964
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,680
kind of left a sour taste in my mouth

965
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:30,879
and I don't I don't know

966
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:33,480
if any of these other um you know

967
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,680
companies can do what we want them to do

968
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,838
or if it's just going to be more of the

969
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:41,239
same filos type of blah blah blah you

970
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:43,799
know yeah I think that's a pretty

971
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,959
understandable approach a few questions

972
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,079
ago you when you were talking about The

973
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:52,599
KES being really slow growing and like

974
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:55,559
not not good commercial picks at all I

975
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,599
did want to ask you out of the seeds you

976
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,040
offer

977
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:01,240
what are your top three recommendations

978
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,480
for someone who maybe has a facility or

979
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:05,439
a bigger space they're working with and

980
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,400
they're like I want to run your stuff

981
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,200
but you know it does need to lend itself

982
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,358
a little bit towards the things that a

983
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:14,078
commercial operation would need you know

984
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:16,519
maybe a little better yielding and maybe

985
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,200
some good TPS what are maybe some things

986
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:21,440
you might recommend for those folk oh

987
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:25,519
usually anything in the like uh

988
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,720
T1000 uh you know catalog th those you

989
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:31,519
know were really good when you know I

990
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:33,759
ran them um you know I I like the KMD

991
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,639
hybrids you know they make really high

992
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,280
quality you know plants and big yielders

993
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:43,078
you know stuff that you know people can

994
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,240
you know get potency and yield because

995
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:46,640
that's that's another thing too uh when

996
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,039
when you're doing commercial you need

997
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,879
you know yields and you need High tests

998
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,920
because everybody's obsessed with you

999
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,280
know something that has got to be 30 35%

1000
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,079
testing you know none of the

1001
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,240
dispensaries you know are going to pay

1002
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,359
money for something that don't test

1003
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:09,719
High yeah it's a sad truth right I feel

1004
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:12,400
like you know the real hardcore cannabis

1005
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:15,239
Community the the sort of the space that

1006
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,400
we exist in so to speak like generally

1007
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,279
speaking I just say anyone who's

1008
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,358
listening to this show you're probably

1009
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,519
like in the top 0.1% of passionate about

1010
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,960
CU like who else would sit here and

1011
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:28,280
listen for hours about this stuff and um

1012
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,639
feel like our community is starting to

1013
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,920
accept very much that like you know the

1014
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,480
chem 91 you know maybe it tests like 18

1015
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,639
19% but it's it's good smoke you know do

1016
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,599
you think we'd ever get there

1017
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,480
commercially where we get more of a

1018
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,838
general education among the public or do

1019
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,880
you think the numbers will still

1020
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:49,480
dominate they it needs to get to a point

1021
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,400
where the numbers don't mean you know uh

1022
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,519
anything because real realistically if

1023
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,318
you think about it the numbers are an

1024
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:58,559
equation you know

1025
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:02,199
every plant or most plants have like a

1026
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:05,000
ceiling right and you know if you take

1027
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:06,960
one puff you know two puff three puff

1028
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,760
you know you keep going up well some

1029
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,720
plants might have a ceiling of two two

1030
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:15,200
Puffs whereas another 10 another 100 you

1031
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:17,159
know and so you know something with 18%

1032
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,239
10 pffs Deep you're like whoa I

1033
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:21,358
shouldn't have taken those last three

1034
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:23,799
you know where has you know something

1035
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:27,078
with a ceiling of like you know three or

1036
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,880
four Puffs uh you can't get higher so

1037
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:32,760
it's just like you know that 30% you

1038
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,680
know a ain't really doing you much much

1039
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,800
favors when you can't get higher than

1040
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:42,000
that three or four Puffs so you

1041
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:45,519
know have you got any thoughts on what

1042
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,599
it is that actually contributes to the

1043
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,239
ceiling effect I think I I Rel listened

1044
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,440
to the DJ Short episode not long ago and

1045
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:54,358
he said oh I think maybe there's like a

1046
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,920
tiny bit of CBD in the background or

1047
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:57,440
something it just sort of like limits

1048
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,240
how high you can get I'd be interested

1049
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,440
to hear do you have any thoughts on what

1050
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:06,279
might be that ceiling we talk

1051
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,280
about oh I don't know if I think that

1052
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,599
deep good Smoke's good

1053
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:16,719
smoke yeah yeah I'm I'm a pretty simple

1054
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:20,480
fell you know if it sniffs good you know

1055
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:23,118
and does the trick you know I'm okay

1056
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,280
that works for me as well I mean on that

1057
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,680
topic have you got any plants or crosses

1058
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,119
that you would recommend to people if

1059
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:30,679
they are looking for something that has

1060
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,720
a higher ceiling cuz I actually get a

1061
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:34,399
lot of messages from people who are

1062
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:35,679
probably only used to the more modern

1063
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,480
stuff and they're like I don't really

1064
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:40,879
get what people mean by this ceiling

1065
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,079
thing right right I mean I swear the the

1066
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,599
the cams uh you know the whole chem

1067
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:48,519
family you know tends to do really well

1068
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:51,920
and like you mentioned about that chem

1069
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:55,400
91 um you know it generally does only

1070
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:59,480
test around like 18 19% you know every

1071
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:02,519
time we have it tested and yet it will

1072
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,318
in hybrids it will almost double a lot

1073
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,358
of you know if you cross it with

1074
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:09,119
something weak it almost doubles the you

1075
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:13,239
know the numbers with whatever you cross

1076
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,358
it to so you know I mean chem 91's not

1077
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:18,318
even remotely my favorite as a

1078
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:21,279
standalone but just what it can do you

1079
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,880
know in hybrids and everything you know

1080
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,760
there's no arguing it's it's an

1081
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,160
excellent plant ideally you know more so

1082
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,559
for

1083
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:31,039
breeding let's let's go down this path

1084
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:32,839
because I got a few questions about the

1085
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:35,159
chem I'd love to ask you and and the

1086
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:38,838
first one is what is your personal

1087
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:44,000
favorite of the chem 91 hybrids you've

1088
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:47,838
done um I've had a few I've had a few uh

1089
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,760
I I definitely smoked all of uh all of

1090
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:55,000
this uh slacked plant of uh uh Sour

1091
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,559
Diesel times chem 91 that thing was

1092
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,400
amazing um and then there was there was

1093
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:03,599
just a regular old chem 91 times Girl

1094
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:08,798
Scouts that I smoked all that one too

1095
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:10,720
was really good um so um I don't I don't

1096
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:14,679
know how many I've grown in in the last

1097
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:16,838
year or two oh uh no no there I I grew a

1098
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:19,279
few but they were like triple hybrids I

1099
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:21,519
think they were uh Kim 91 times Girl

1100
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,480
Scouts crossed with you know like

1101
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,199
ruthless runts and uh you know some of

1102
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,679
these other things

1103
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:32,000
um and you know th those all came out

1104
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,639
really nice as well

1105
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,920
so that's interesting I I was talking to

1106
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:39,558
Noto dog recently and he he mentioned

1107
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,079
that you and him were talking about it

1108
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,319
and you'd said you know the chem it just

1109
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,920
really passes on potency quite

1110
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:48,798
consistently when I heard that I started

1111
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,760
thinking do you view it in that sense as

1112
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:53,679
essentially a breeding tool more than

1113
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,160
like its own unique thing or how do you

1114
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,639
use it in breeding projects

1115
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:01,719
oh definitely definitely I mean you know

1116
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:07,318
it it's definitely a tool to to increase

1117
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:09,919
potency and you know all that um yeah

1118
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:12,719
and and most recently you've done the

1119
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,880
really interesting and novel chem 91

1120
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:18,598
hybrids I think a lot of people super

1121
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,400
interested in them um for the chem1 how

1122
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,039
would you describe it to people what's

1123
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:29,160
its effect like what's it like as a

1124
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:31,679
plant so one um it it it tests you know

1125
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:33,960
on par with you know a lot of the other

1126
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:40,039
chems uh roughly usually around

1127
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:44,599
20% um but uh it uh it hased like 5%

1128
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:48,318
Tarpin and um the bulk of that is all

1129
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:51,519
mirene it's like one of the highest just

1130
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:55,119
you know pure miren plants that you know

1131
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:58,759
have in the catalog um it's like a oh I

1132
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:02,280
don't know know 11 or 12 week type of

1133
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,799
plant and she's pretty ugly you know by

1134
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,760
you know today's standards you know I

1135
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:09,759
mean everybody wants that pretty pretty

1136
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:13,000
looking you know flower but she she's an

1137
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:16,599
ugly girl and she kind of tends to pass

1138
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,838
that ugly on oh no you know but you know

1139
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,480
I

1140
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:22,798
mean that's a tough one as especially

1141
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,639
today everybody loves Girl Scout cookies

1142
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:26,880
and all the poly hybrids you know with

1143
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:29,798
that they like them CU they're pretty

1144
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:33,519
but you know half the time if you like

1145
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:33,519
smoke and cardboard they're all right

1146
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:38,759
too you know that is a common tur

1147
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,280
profile we've seen a lot of hype strains

1148
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,760
the old cardboard

1149
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,480
T I mean while we're talking about the

1150
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,280
chem1 I think as time's gone by I've

1151
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,519
been able to appreciate more that it cuz

1152
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,920
to me I always thought the chem1 it was

1153
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,719
just out in the field on its own and

1154
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,159
then the more I look at photos of say

1155
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:01,838
the chem 4 I'm like actually I can see a

1156
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:04,118
lot of relation here the question is do

1157
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:06,199
you think it's from the same seed stock

1158
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,039
as the chmd and the chem 91 or do you

1159
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:11,199
think it just has to be

1160
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:13,239
different okay so you know you you you

1161
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:16,879
might you know uh get different

1162
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:20,679
information from different people's you

1163
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:24,880
interviews but uh I I still uh stand

1164
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:27,639
strong on the fact that I think chem 91

1165
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,680
you was the only you know seed that was

1166
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:34,000
really kept from I mean there was the

1167
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:36,838
original chem sister from 91 and I think

1168
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,760
she was kept for a while too um but for

1169
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:41,759
the most part it was the 91 that was

1170
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,960
kept and I think the D is a hybrid with

1171
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,319
the 91 and then I think the one through

1172
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:51,760
four are all the same hybrid or not the

1173
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:55,279
same hybrid as the chmd but all you know

1174
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,440
um a hybrid of 91 cuz you know I got

1175
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,480
those those uh I got clones of those

1176
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,639
from Joe bran seed plants you know of

1177
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,880
the one through four and they they were

1178
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:09,199
almost identical sisters you know but

1179
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,440
then their flowers you know segregate

1180
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:13,719
out and they they look a lot you know

1181
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,318
different you know to each other the

1182
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:21,039
number three was like the 91 but bigger

1183
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:24,358
chunkier better better plant um but it

1184
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:26,880
was like you know a match on the the you

1185
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:31,960
know the the look and the smell and all

1186
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:34,240
that um the four was like amazing

1187
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,679
compared to all of them except for the

1188
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,439
fact that you know it was It was kind of

1189
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,279
terrible you know three or four weeks

1190
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,200
after you harvested it because it just

1191
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,040
went

1192
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:47,399
Brown yeah I I've heard that a bit I

1193
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,519
mean I'd be curious to ask you know I'm

1194
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,880
sure we're going to do a lot of

1195
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:53,679
questions about this but like the chem 1

1196
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,358
and the chem 4 visually at least have

1197
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,798
always struck me as looking like like

1198
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,239
there's like an nl5 Haze in the mix what

1199
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:02,639
do you suspect the pollen donor onto the

1200
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:06,479
chem 91 might have been to make

1201
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:08,838
those I I think somewhere in that realm

1202
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,159
you know it definitely something

1203
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:15,159
something sensey and you know

1204
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:18,719
the the the the question I've always had

1205
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:24,558
is you know um it for for for Greg you

1206
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:26,879
know Kim dog Greg um is uh what was he

1207
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,960
growing in the rooms because I know he

1208
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:34,880
only had chem 91 in for maybe four or

1209
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,000
five years at best before he lost it

1210
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,680
right and

1211
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,400
so what was in his rooms you know during

1212
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:46,639
those years where something might have

1213
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:49,039
harmed and you know that's where he

1214
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:51,598
would have gotten those seeds he swears

1215
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:55,880
they came from that same Original Seed

1216
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:58,400
bat but it's highly unlikely

1217
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,440
you know I don't I don't believe it you

1218
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,480
know but you know that better question

1219
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,200
is what was in his rooms at those times

1220
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:09,400
and he's posted what you know over the

1221
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:11,279
years what was but you know uh I think

1222
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,079
some of the posts uh from like Planet

1223
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,319
ganja and IC mag aren't aren't there

1224
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,400
anymore you know Planet ganja's gone and

1225
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:21,159
IC mag you know he deleted his account

1226
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,160
I'm sure and so a lot of his posts that

1227
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:25,879
weren't like you know you know copied

1228
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:28,920
and you know

1229
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,400
um blah blah blah are gone you know and

1230
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,559
it's hard for most people to find out

1231
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,639
who said what you know because it's just

1232
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,440
going to say guest you know and uh you

1233
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,078
know somebody like me who was there is

1234
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,039
like I know who that guest

1235
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:46,680
was you

1236
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:48,240
know okay so I mean the followup you

1237
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:49,759
sort of alluded to it but I just wanted

1238
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,639
to nail down on it you know there's a

1239
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,680
lot of focal discussion recently when

1240
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:57,519
Matt put up a post saying that you know

1241
00:56:54,679 --> 00:57:00,078
he's suspects the chem D is the 91 by

1242
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:02,000
Super Skunk is that the lineage you

1243
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:07,920
think is what's behind the

1244
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:12,159
D it could be it could be um or uh I

1245
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,400
mean uh I've I've always almost thought

1246
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:15,358
uh you know it could be like maybe a

1247
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,440
Shiva

1248
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:20,199
skunk because I swear I swear I swear

1249
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,400
Greg was growing some Shiva skunk back

1250
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:24,519
then but you

1251
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:28,200
know it could have been any of those

1252
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:30,960
types you know yeah Shiva almost see

1253
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:34,399
feels right you

1254
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,798
know yeah now that you say I I do get

1255
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,400
what you mean a bit of that skunk

1256
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:41,159
influence in there as well like the not

1257
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,200
the uh Virginia Super Skunk but just the

1258
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:45,480
sensey

1259
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:47,919
skunk right right right

1260
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,719
yeah yeah no that that certainly makes

1261
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,280
sense and then so look we as I did when

1262
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:53,919
I was chatting to Noto we've spoken

1263
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,480
about the one and the four the D the

1264
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:59,000
question has to be asked

1265
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:02,519
any ideas on the 91's lineage then I

1266
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,119
mean for one I think the just by you

1267
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:07,038
know breeding with it s1's predominantly

1268
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,240
because you know I've grown out the

1269
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:14,200
better part of a couple hundred you know

1270
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:17,118
s1's with me and you know the homies and

1271
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:21,199
it it it's so stable I swear you know

1272
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:24,838
the s1's I've made I I think the chem 91

1273
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:27,399
itself is an S1 and so you know

1274
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:32,880
technically I think you know what I made

1275
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:36,880
are probably S2s you know and then

1276
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,318
um I think uh whatever plant the chem 91

1277
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,680
came from

1278
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:44,679
um yeah there's there's a little bit of

1279
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:47,318
debate on it but uh I I don't I don't

1280
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:49,679
think some people are too wrong with the

1281
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:51,599
the whole tie in with hash

1282
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:53,838
plant yeah well that was what I was

1283
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,240
going to ask where do you feel Skelly

1284
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:59,279
fits in the picture cuz I I really

1285
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:02,439
believe that the smell and the effect

1286
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,440
are very similar but I will happily

1287
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,119
acknowledge that the structures are so

1288
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,798
different I'm happy to entertain the

1289
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:10,119
debate that maybe they're not related

1290
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:11,920
but it is it is a very uncanny

1291
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:12,798
resemblance in smell and effect I've

1292
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,318
always

1293
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:19,199
thought so you know I have I have Skelly

1294
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:22,199
um I also have

1295
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:24,798
hp13 they both have a similar look

1296
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:27,519
between each other you know not not any

1297
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:29,719
where close to you know like identical

1298
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,920
but you know there's a lot of

1299
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:35,519
similarities between those two and then

1300
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:39,599
those two kind of got me thinking well I

1301
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:42,920
grew hash plant one back in the day um

1302
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:46,880
from the devil's Harvest crew and that

1303
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:51,599
plant has some very strong uh

1304
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:54,920
similarities to not only the uh hp13 and

1305
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:58,440
the and the Skelly but it almost almost

1306
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:01,720
looks more like the chem 91 you know

1307
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:05,358
because it has those dark dark leaves it

1308
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:10,118
has a similar Leaf shape and it actually

1309
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:14,358
grows like a a bigger uh chem 91

1310
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:17,119
Outdoors um than you know chem 91

1311
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:19,480
itself so I don't know I don't know

1312
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:22,720
there there there could be something to

1313
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:25,280
the whole hash plant you know

1314
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:27,358
theories yeah totally I mean you touched

1315
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,240
on the hash plant 13 I think it's one

1316
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,558
where people hear about it but it's hard

1317
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:34,000
to get a lot of info about it what's

1318
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:36,160
your thoughts on it is it is it cuz I I

1319
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,199
mean I've only seen the plant in veg one

1320
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:40,159
time at Bob hemp Hill's house and I was

1321
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:42,759
like oh this is a very thin leaf plant

1322
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:43,920
and he was like yeah um what what's your

1323
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:48,119
take on

1324
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,838
it um I think it's a hash plant hybrid

1325
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,440
you

1326
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:54,038
know definitely retains a lot of you

1327
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,079
know the hash plant to it which you know

1328
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:58,039
anytime you have an indicia sativa

1329
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,359
hybrid a lot of times those indicas can

1330
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:04,520
be dominant in the structure it seems

1331
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:06,279
you know um I've got a ton of experience

1332
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:08,960
going right now where I'm trying to go

1333
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,798
both ways you know Indica sativa and

1334
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,318
then sativa times Indica I I I just want

1335
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:16,719
to see how all those pan out with the

1336
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:20,358
you know using the different different

1337
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:25,480
ones for male and female but uh um the

1338
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:27,318
hp13 um you know it uh

1339
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:30,240
yeah yeah

1340
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:33,038
um I don't know I don't want to even

1341
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:35,879
speculate on that one well I mean I was

1342
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:38,200
going to say you know I think uh JJ has

1343
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,480
put up some posts talking about how he

1344
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:42,838
thinks there's like some burmes and some

1345
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,760
stuff in there given your experience

1346
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:46,318
with the Burmese have any thoughts on

1347
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,440
that speculation because just based off

1348
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:50,318
what I'm hearing it sounds like the

1349
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,440
Burmese is like maybe way too long

1350
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:55,679
flowering right but you know the the

1351
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:59,358
right Inda you know it'll it'll shorten

1352
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:02,519
that flower time down pretty good and uh

1353
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:06,078
I don't think the hp13 is a a really

1354
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:11,038
quick flow I mean you know maybe a 10

1355
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:12,440
weer so yeah um you know yeah I don't

1356
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,240
know I don't

1357
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:18,240
know some of those tur profiles do kind

1358
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:20,598
of match up you know with that that

1359
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:23,318
sweetness of of the Burmese it's

1360
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:25,640
definitely not Doesn't Remind me of like

1361
01:02:23,318 --> 01:02:27,960
the Indica type of tur

1362
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:30,679
yeah interesting interesting okay and

1363
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:33,159
then a nice little segue into the NL

1364
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:35,598
work you did was for the longest time

1365
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:38,239
people have speculated that like sort of

1366
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,760
the backbone of chem dog may have some

1367
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:43,719
NL in it now that you've done your NL

1368
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,400
work do you see that at

1369
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:50,038
all

1370
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:52,160
um if if there is any NL in it um I

1371
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:54,160
don't think it's going to be the five

1372
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,879
and the only you know one I've I've run

1373
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:57,838
out

1374
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:01,278
was is the five um there were some

1375
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:04,278
similarities uh on you know uh at least

1376
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:06,559
one plant specifically when I first ran

1377
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:08,000
them out to the old norn lights I got

1378
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:14,039
from my dad back in

1379
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:16,798
94 um but overall it it was more of a a

1380
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:19,240
a different type of you know Norm light

1381
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:22,199
that you see in a lot of hybrids you

1382
01:03:19,239 --> 01:03:25,278
know out there um I don't think you know

1383
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:28,558
I had the nl5 you know back in the day

1384
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:31,079
we just had it as Northern Lights so you

1385
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:35,240
know I'm not entirely sure you know what

1386
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:37,640
we had one two 10 I don't

1387
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:39,519
know and and like what what's your

1388
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:41,639
takeaway been from the project you've

1389
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,199
done with Matt and you know the seeds

1390
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:46,278
from Greg mallister have you had any

1391
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:48,439
cool insights into that all and and tell

1392
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:50,119
us a little bit about what the NL seed

1393
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:54,119
line is like in

1394
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:57,000
general um I mean it it's like a you

1395
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:59,880
know know uh the nl5 of course is you

1396
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,440
know essentially supposed to be a pure

1397
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:06,039
indicia crossed with a Hawaiian

1398
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:09,798
sativa um so um it's definitely hash

1399
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:13,200
plant esque you know um you know super

1400
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:16,159
Frosty you know um some some of the

1401
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:20,239
plants lean towards that um you know

1402
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:22,239
that Hawaiian type um you know but you

1403
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:25,118
know most of them most of them are just

1404
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:27,639
kind of like that that Amsterdam thing

1405
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:31,838
you know that was wild and crazy all the

1406
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:33,920
way through the early mid 90s you know

1407
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,119
and uh you know def definitely a

1408
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,838
throwback that's for sure you know to

1409
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:41,318
those that era and do you think it

1410
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:42,679
stands up to what a lot of people

1411
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:44,759
remember or do you think there is an

1412
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:47,639
element of like rose shade

1413
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:51,440
glasses

1414
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:54,960
uh I mean as as much as I'm you know I I

1415
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,760
love preservation and you know I mean

1416
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:02,440
you you you take all the you know the

1417
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:04,559
land races land races are not you know

1418
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:07,000
they're they're they're not great for a

1419
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,160
whole lot of things you know you can't

1420
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,159
grow in commercial you

1421
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,358
know oftentimes they're they don't

1422
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:16,679
they're not great for Standalone plants

1423
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:19,960
like you know head stash you know

1424
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:22,078
they're like building blocks and it kind

1425
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,880
of feels like the NLS you know might be

1426
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:28,680
great for building blocks but they they

1427
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:30,440
really don't stand up to you know the

1428
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:33,038
the designer weed of

1429
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:35,639
today yeah certainly I can understand

1430
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,278
that I mean as a follow on having had

1431
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:39,759
that experience with the

1432
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:42,079
nl5 is there a part of you that would be

1433
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,799
Keen to grow out the purest Inda if you

1434
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:49,039
had like good

1435
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:52,318
source um I mean uh Matt uh Matt rot uh

1436
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:54,960
he's he's got some of those seeds and he

1437
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:57,798
um he tried to give them to me a few

1438
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,838
months back and um I think I got too lit

1439
01:05:57,798 --> 01:06:02,480
and forgot

1440
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:05,159
him I'll shoot him a message and bump

1441
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,440
him I like do it oh no no no it's not on

1442
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:11,318
him at all shoot all I have to do is say

1443
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:14,240
yes and yeah we'll gets to Kraken I

1444
01:06:11,318 --> 01:06:17,960
don't I don't know uh you know the the

1445
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:20,679
the Pierce is a is an interesting one um

1446
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,838
it could be you know probably closer to

1447
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:27,879
the the northern lights that you know I

1448
01:06:22,838 --> 01:06:30,759
grew back in the the mid 90s um but uh I

1449
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,400
mean I'd like to grow it I got so many

1450
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,520
things though on the plate it's like

1451
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,440
damn it I'm not trying to overload you

1452
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,079
so I mean look if you had to guess what

1453
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,559
do you think the NL you were growing

1454
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:43,359
back in the 90s was do you think it was

1455
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,839
maybe more like a one or something

1456
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:49,960
that's my guess that's always been you

1457
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:52,519
know kind of my hunch um yeah because I

1458
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:55,039
I never from everything I've seen of the

1459
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:59,358
five it definitely you know didn't seem

1460
01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:02,920
like that was that was the hybrid um but

1461
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:05,199
uh yeah yeah yeah that's cool and I mean

1462
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,838
you know to tie it on up you you also

1463
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:09,000
did the work with the Hawaiian lights

1464
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:11,558
which was really cool you know how did

1465
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,400
that differ to the nl5 and and what sort

1466
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:16,640
of the general description you give for

1467
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:21,119
that one they were extremely similar to

1468
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:24,598
the nl5 but there was just a ton of that

1469
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:28,000
super you know sweet pineapple just

1470
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:31,960
fruity you know just Hawaiian turps on a

1471
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,079
lot of those ones you know um there

1472
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:38,199
there was like hints of that stuff in

1473
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:41,079
the uh in in the nl5 but it was it was

1474
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:43,318
almost prominent and dominant on on a

1475
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:46,200
lot of the ones in the Hawaiian

1476
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:48,558
lights yeah wow wow and I know that you

1477
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:50,919
had selected keepers of the ANL and the

1478
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,000
Hawaiian do you plan to breed with them

1479
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:55,920
going

1480
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,920
forward oh well you know

1481
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:03,278
uh the mother room got a little full

1482
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:07,920
again and uh I had to make some harsh

1483
01:08:03,278 --> 01:08:12,239
decisions so I I I have I think I have

1484
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:16,679
two two keepers held of the nl5 and then

1485
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:18,798
everything else um oh maybe I I might

1486
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:20,798
have kept one Hawaiian Life my my mother

1487
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,119
room is ridiculous

1488
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:26,119
so sometimes I don't even know what's in

1489
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:27,479
there do I dare ask how many plantss do

1490
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:30,079
you have in your mother

1491
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:31,119
room uh well let's not talk about that

1492
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,479
on

1493
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:38,079
TV too hot for TV I love

1494
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:39,599
it okay well look we we did have a fan

1495
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:42,158
submitted question and they were

1496
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,838
wondering uh they sort of reading into

1497
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,119
where we were going with this discussion

1498
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:47,600
they were saying you know I can only

1499
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:50,238
imagine that maintaining a mother room

1500
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,480
the size you have is almost a full-time

1501
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:54,399
job in itself do you have any tips or

1502
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:56,718
tricks for maintaining a big big library

1503
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,079
and as a further followup do you have

1504
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,520
any IPM tips cuz I can only imagine

1505
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:05,719
that's something you're having to keep

1506
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:12,359
on top of right right um I

1507
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:15,480
mean I'll admit right now um I I uh um

1508
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:17,440
try to do as minimal as I can just to

1509
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:19,959
keep everything alive I try to grow

1510
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:22,838
things I underfur things a lot not so

1511
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:25,039
can vouch for this I underfur things a

1512
01:09:22,838 --> 01:09:29,679
lot just to slow down so they don't grow

1513
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:31,920
fast I I give very very limited nitrogen

1514
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,279
you know because otherwise you know

1515
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,520
they're always up in the lights if I

1516
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:42,759
don't you know slow them down as for IPM

1517
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:46,319
uh my favorites are pyganic spinoid and

1518
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:49,399
uh liquid sulfur you know that tends to

1519
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:51,719
you know keep most of the bugs you know

1520
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:54,359
that could potentially come through you

1521
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:56,679
know down and out

1522
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:59,679
we we always have uh the thrips flying

1523
01:09:56,679 --> 01:10:02,199
in through the through the open doors

1524
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,679
and you know that kind of good stuff

1525
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:07,839
definitely there's always powdery mildew

1526
01:10:04,679 --> 01:10:09,279
growing on everything outdoors so yeah I

1527
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,880
can only imagine up your neck of the

1528
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:14,279
woods cuz I think like a lot of people

1529
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,319
who have never been to mesino or you

1530
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:19,198
know Northern California in general

1531
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:21,079
probably can't appreciate how what the

1532
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:23,439
climate is like there cuz it's only

1533
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:26,679
recently I've really like you're like it

1534
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:28,799
is really foggy in the mornings and most

1535
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:31,279
of the day like it's hard to

1536
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,600
appreciate yeah and I'm I'm pretty much

1537
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:37,519
entire mostly most entirely Coastal

1538
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:40,480
based with all all my stuff uh I I still

1539
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:43,159
grow my you know six California you know

1540
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:45,919
personal legal plants uh you know out

1541
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:47,158
out out in my place in the Hills but you

1542
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,560
know that's a totally different

1543
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:52,799
environment out there you know it's 100

1544
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:54,880
115 degrees you know all summer long out

1545
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,640
there um and you

1546
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:00,760
know total total opposite of the coast

1547
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,760
wow I mean on that point what sort of

1548
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,679
plants would you run for yourself both

1549
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,159
from like things that you like but also

1550
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:07,480
that would do well in those conditions

1551
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:12,599
because it sounds pretty

1552
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:14,799
hot yeah um I mean uh one of my old

1553
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,800
school favorites out there um that

1554
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:20,760
always really did well was old Betsy you

1555
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:24,360
know and that's something that you know

1556
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,760
90% of people are just like what but you

1557
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:29,519
know people around this general area are

1558
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:34,119
like yeah old bets's what's up you know

1559
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:37,800
so she she was always a good one um my

1560
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:40,359
uh my uh bomb threat Bubba um my bubba

1561
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:44,600
S1 selection she she actually does

1562
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:46,359
really well out there you know um for

1563
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,360
for whatever reason I've got one of her

1564
01:11:46,359 --> 01:11:52,399
growing this year and uh Irene Irene

1565
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:57,399
tended to do pretty okay um when I grew

1566
01:11:52,399 --> 01:12:02,279
her so I've got a on Irene this year um

1567
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:04,920
kimd did good and uh um you know she's a

1568
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:08,000
late one but you know really good

1569
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:11,679
quality so I broke down put a KMD out

1570
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,359
this year just for just for fun so and a

1571
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:17,520
few few others I'm just trying out this

1572
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:20,399
year that's a a beautiful mixture I

1573
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,560
would be feeling very pleasured to smoke

1574
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,399
any of those strains so I guess the

1575
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,840
question is are we going to see you do

1576
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:28,638
hybrids with some of those ones like a

1577
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:31,239
project maybe with like cuz I know

1578
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:32,520
you've pollinated old Betsy and some of

1579
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:34,158
the other ones you mentioned would you

1580
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,440
ever in the Irene would you consider

1581
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:37,559
doing a project like reversing Irene or

1582
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:42,000
reversing

1583
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:46,199
Betsy so uh I reversed Irene

1584
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:49,560
and um I think I had a half half a bed

1585
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:55,519
half a light of Irene to pollinate and I

1586
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:57,760
got 20 seeds oh no yeah uh Irene was um

1587
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:01,520
like what I call a one percenter like

1588
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:04,440
she like I got so few seeds on my IR

1589
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:07,000
like a four light Irene reversal that I

1590
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:08,638
grew a bunch of them out immediately

1591
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,319
just to make sure it wasn't like pollen

1592
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:13,039
contamination or like something else

1593
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:16,158
hmed in the room and they were all Irene

1594
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:20,760
plants so I was like yeah yeah okay but

1595
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:23,799
the the yeah it was the pollen was not

1596
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:28,560
very viable um and there wasn't much of

1597
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:31,119
it to begin with um and then Betsy uh

1598
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:36,679
she produced zero pollen I I reversed

1599
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:39,399
her and nothing so I'm a yeah I'm a

1600
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:45,158
little sketched to do Betsy again I

1601
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:47,759
don't know um but yeah yeah yeah that's

1602
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:51,198
beautiful segue for me it's my favorite

1603
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,440
saying beautiful segue because we had a

1604
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,839
question about like failed reversals

1605
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:58,879
like one of the listeners is currently

1606
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,560
trying to reverse a chem dog D S1 they

1607
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,760
got from you they found like a nice one

1608
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,120
they really like and they're like for

1609
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,199
the life of me I I he's I've seen the

1610
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:09,880
photos he's reversed it two or three

1611
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:12,119
times he'll get the nanas but there's no

1612
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:13,880
pollen in them ever you got any tips or

1613
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:18,079
tricks for stubborn

1614
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:21,960
reversals I I kind of wish I did but it

1615
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:24,559
it's it's tough and you know uh it gets

1616
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,719
tougher in each gener

1617
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,520
um like you know s1's you're going to

1618
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:33,600
have less plants that will actually you

1619
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:36,639
know give you viable pollen um when you

1620
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:41,159
hit S2s it's even fewer um I've heard

1621
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:44,159
Sam the skunkman say that once you hit

1622
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:45,238
S5 it's terminal you you don't you don't

1623
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:48,039
go past

1624
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:50,119
S5 you know but just seeing how plants

1625
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:52,319
do you know from the S1 to the S2 you

1626
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:54,840
know I'm like I don't know if I don't

1627
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:58,479
even want to deal with it S4 or five

1628
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:02,800
plant little shrubby little

1629
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:05,119
mutants wow but I I honestly I I don't

1630
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,159
have any tips for that because

1631
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:09,760
uh

1632
01:15:07,158 --> 01:15:14,000
um the the the few times I've made a

1633
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:16,039
bunch of selections um with s1s and I I

1634
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,719
I've gone through and I've sprayed all

1635
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:22,399
of these uh different s1s um you know

1636
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,198
I'll have some that produce lots of

1637
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:28,359
pollen some that produce a little bit of

1638
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:32,839
pollen and then a lot that produced no

1639
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:35,960
pollen so you know it's not easy it's

1640
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:37,920
not easy sure sure we had another

1641
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,719
question that was was very similar just

1642
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,600
talking about you know you you change

1643
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:43,760
dilutions do you apply the spray more

1644
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,960
frequently if it if I'm interpreting

1645
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,159
this correctly it sounds like you've

1646
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:51,079
just got to reverse a lot of plants and

1647
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:55,679
and maybe one of them will work is that

1648
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:59,519
right uh yeah it it can be like that too

1649
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:01,199
um that that's the thing too uh um i'

1650
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,120
I've experimented a lot with you know

1651
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:05,439
different

1652
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:08,079
dilutions uh multiple you know frequency

1653
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:13,079
you know Springs uh you know this that

1654
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:15,920
other um and so i' I've mentioned this

1655
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:18,238
before um generally when I just reverse

1656
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:22,079
you know a a plant I'll I'll take uh

1657
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:23,919
like eight plants is my usual and you

1658
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,639
know they'll be in like five gallon pots

1659
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,920
and they'll be you know nice two to

1660
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:33,000
three foot you know plants you know

1661
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:35,719
round and tall and uh often times with

1662
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,119
uh some of these you know even moderate

1663
01:16:35,719 --> 01:16:41,239
you know reversal plants I'll only get

1664
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,238
out of eight I'll only get like two that

1665
01:16:41,238 --> 01:16:47,479
produce decent pollen and then I'll have

1666
01:16:43,238 --> 01:16:49,519
a couple put on you know midy pollen and

1667
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:51,879
then I'll have a bunch of them put on no

1668
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:56,840
pollen so if you have somebody reversing

1669
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:59,279
just one plant or two plants I mean that

1670
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:01,159
you know you're you're going to have you

1671
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:02,759
can imagine you know there's there's

1672
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:05,719
going to be like you know three four

1673
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,360
five fails and then you might get one to

1674
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:10,359
kind of hit and then another time you'll

1675
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:12,559
get one to really hit you know and

1676
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:16,479
that's off just the same exact plant

1677
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:19,280
same dilution same spraying you know so

1678
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:23,559
I mean i' I've definitely done this a

1679
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:26,519
lot but I you know I I still can't you

1680
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:31,199
know tell you oh this is what works you

1681
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:34,320
know because it's so variable and why I

1682
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:36,238
mean my question is why can you spray

1683
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:39,359
eight plants with the same exact

1684
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:42,319
dilution same time same everything and

1685
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:45,759
yet you know two are great pollen two

1686
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:52,000
are midy and four don't even give you

1687
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:54,199
pollen I I'm like uh I got questions

1688
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
too

1689
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:57,919
look yeah I have to acknowledge the

1690
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,960
first time I ever did a reversal I think

1691
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,760
I got one of the midy ones and and I

1692
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,840
thought that was like the Baseline and

1693
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,079
uh I'll acknowledge I've been caught out

1694
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,000
the next time I did it I got no pollen

1695
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:12,198
and I was like what the [ __ ] is going on

1696
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,439
right

1697
01:18:12,198 --> 01:18:18,439
right happens to everyone it's so

1698
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:21,399
variable uhuh it's like uh it's like the

1699
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:25,279
chem dog it's up to the

1700
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:27,439
Stars yeah yeah yeah so I wanted to ask

1701
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,359
you you know you have been doing these

1702
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:31,599
Wicked grows in these Planters I think

1703
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:33,479
everyone should go look at your

1704
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,880
Instagram you do like you know these

1705
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:39,158
really cool feno hunts in the beds um

1706
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,359
really gorgeous looking plants can you

1707
01:18:39,158 --> 01:18:42,839
give us a quick rundown of your style

1708
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:45,079
when you're doing that because I got to

1709
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,560
give you a shout out I remember first

1710
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:49,800
time I came to the emerald cup I came

1711
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,920
and saw you at the booth and uh you you

1712
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,400
were mentioning that um the Girl Scout

1713
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,600
reversal you were trying to do it didn't

1714
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:58,479
work so you ended up with all this

1715
01:18:54,600 --> 01:19:00,880
sensey crop and um the cookies and the

1716
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,399
patient zero bud you gave me was so

1717
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,039
memorable and you were like yeah I grew

1718
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:07,638
it in like the the Planters and um oh my

1719
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:09,719
God so Superior really memorable stuff

1720
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:13,520
how do you do it what's the run

1721
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:17,399
down uh pretty basic I just use like a a

1722
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,480
a cocoa Pete blend uh you know um around

1723
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:22,079
here it's called Black Gold but you know

1724
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:24,959
um there's tons of different types and

1725
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:27,399
then uh I just uh put in a bunch of uh

1726
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:33,560
bunch of amendments um I think my base

1727
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:37,599
is mostly fish frass insect frass and uh

1728
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:40,280
um you know trace minerals

1729
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,880
and yeah i' I've got like 20 different

1730
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:45,119
organic ingredients I kind of I try to

1731
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,440
give the plants a buffet of quick

1732
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:50,599
release uh medium release and slow

1733
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:53,599
release stuff and then I try to just

1734
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:57,320
give them plain water for the duration

1735
01:19:53,600 --> 01:20:01,760
that they're in in those beds just super

1736
01:19:57,319 --> 01:20:04,158
simple you know um yeah beautiful stuff

1737
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,360
beautiful stuff I'd love to ask you

1738
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:08,039
normally we we start with this one but

1739
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:11,119
uh we've been a bit sidetracked having

1740
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:15,319
fun what have you been smoking on

1741
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:22,399
recently um I've still been smoking on a

1742
01:20:15,319 --> 01:20:26,158
ton of like the um uh the Family Feud

1743
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:29,479
Family Feud times uh um or wait yeah

1744
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:31,158
Family Feud times like ruthless runs um

1745
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:36,238
Family Feud

1746
01:20:31,158 --> 01:20:42,638
times uh the punch one was okay

1747
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:46,599
um uh the triangle cush uh arle 103 s1's

1748
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:50,920
um those were really nice um bunch of Z

1749
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:55,199
s1's A bunch of sherbet s ones um

1750
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:57,960
basically uh uh I I I did a a feno hunt

1751
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:00,599
a handful of months back and so I've had

1752
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:03,279
like 500 plants

1753
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:05,719
hanging we we go up and like just you

1754
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:07,599
know pull pull you know three or four

1755
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:10,639
you know samples every every night or

1756
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:14,600
two then we'll smoke through you know

1757
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:16,159
the the different ones um but uh yeah

1758
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:20,320
pretty much uh you know just been

1759
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:23,719
smoking on that last 500 seed run

1760
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:25,519
so yeah just a bunch of bunch of stuff

1761
01:21:23,719 --> 01:21:29,279
it's it's a tough job but someone's got

1762
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:31,679
to do it that's right that sounds

1763
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:34,279
amazing I mean a lot of questions to

1764
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:37,239
jump into there I I think the first one

1765
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:38,319
is do you feel like when you're testing

1766
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:40,959
that many

1767
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:43,158
phenotypes it it can almost become a bit

1768
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,039
more difficult to discern the clear

1769
01:21:43,158 --> 01:21:47,879
winners cuz I'm sure at the end of a 500

1770
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:49,359
seed feno hunt you've got like 10 plants

1771
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,880
of the same variety and they're all

1772
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:52,319
really good like how do you how do you

1773
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:56,279
Whittle them down or do you just end up

1774
01:21:52,319 --> 01:22:00,238
with a few cap is it starts like that

1775
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:03,198
like it starts you know initially like

1776
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,638
it's it's difficult it seems and it

1777
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,678
probably you know is the whole time but

1778
01:22:05,639 --> 01:22:10,840
um eventually you you start you know

1779
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:13,158
Finding ones that really stand out right

1780
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:15,440
and then you know you go back to those

1781
01:22:13,158 --> 01:22:17,198
and you go back to those and then you

1782
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:22,119
get sad when there's no more of that

1783
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:23,519
plant left uh we had a a a skittles 85

1784
01:22:22,119 --> 01:22:26,198
S1

1785
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,679
and uh that one stood out and we kept

1786
01:22:26,198 --> 01:22:30,158
trying to smoke all these other Skittles

1787
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:32,840
ass ones and it was just like H eh and

1788
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:37,000
then we just chiefed through the whole

1789
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:38,960
z85 plant and now we have no more z85 we

1790
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,479
don't even want to smoke the

1791
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:44,520
others you know you become

1792
01:22:41,479 --> 01:22:47,359
spoiled yeah yeah yeah but um I actually

1793
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:51,239
am uh trying uh I've I've got a reversal

1794
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:54,158
going with that z85 right now and uh I'm

1795
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:57,959
not crossing my fingers too too too much

1796
01:22:54,158 --> 01:23:00,920
because Z is a hard one you know to

1797
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:03,760
reverse yeah interesting what's what is

1798
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:07,600
the 85 phenotype

1799
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:11,440
like uh well it it has like all the

1800
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:15,280
turps of of Z and it's

1801
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:18,919
potent wow because Z itself ain't ain't

1802
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:23,399
the strongest smoke in the shop um when

1803
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:26,920
when uh when I uh um had a

1804
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:31,920
um had uh the ABCs

1805
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:35,319
tested um they came in pretty low and Z

1806
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,319
came in 2%

1807
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:43,840
higher so B bastard cannabis is almost

1808
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:46,238
as strong as Z wow I never would I never

1809
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:49,920
would have thought that there you

1810
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:52,479
go so you know so so when you've done

1811
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:54,158
this massive Skittles feno hunt what

1812
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:56,399
what sort of insights have you gotten

1813
01:23:54,158 --> 01:24:00,679
from that have you got any more ideas

1814
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:02,559
about what might be the lineage of it oh

1815
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:05,520
I I think well for one I think it's

1816
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:10,039
probably an S1 uh Z is an S1 to start

1817
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:14,120
with um and then um I'm pretty sure it's

1818
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:18,000
just some some type of like a Girl Scout

1819
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:19,760
cookie hybrid um Girl Scout cookie OG

1820
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,960
type you

1821
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:25,119
know something along those lines it

1822
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,840
doesn't even have to be an OG type it it

1823
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:29,439
could just be a Girl Scout cookie hybrid

1824
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,920
type and the OG is you know you know

1825
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:35,479
from the Girl

1826
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:37,079
Scouts so yeah wow okay so and then you

1827
01:24:35,479 --> 01:24:40,678
know you you sort of touched on it

1828
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:43,559
Loosely you did the sherb S1 project did

1829
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:46,480
that help solidify any thoughts about

1830
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:49,600
the possible relationship I mean there

1831
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:52,919
was definitely some Z types in there for

1832
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:56,079
sure um or Z leaners let me put this way

1833
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:59,679
but um I only ran 70 of them out I think

1834
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:01,039
it was 70 only and yeah that's like more

1835
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:04,560
than anyone

1836
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:07,880
does but I I I didn't find a plant that

1837
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:10,520
was like that right there is z you know

1838
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:13,600
so um I did find one plant that was

1839
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:16,639
freaking amazing and it was the best

1840
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:20,679
smelling plant out of 500 plants

1841
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:23,000
freaking off of that seed run um and on

1842
01:25:20,679 --> 01:25:25,199
the sherbet s1s it was just absolutely

1843
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,158
amazing and it was just one of those

1844
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:31,399
sure best ones but it was amazing and of

1845
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:34,359
course you know I went to the Clone room

1846
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:35,599
and yep that was the one that was dead

1847
01:25:34,359 --> 01:25:38,319
oh hot

1848
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:40,159
breaking yeah so I kind of want to dip

1849
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:43,399
into the sure best ones again and run

1850
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:47,359
out at least a 100 or maybe even 200 see

1851
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:49,198
if I can't find Z and that one so

1852
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:51,559
interesting interesting and I mean from

1853
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:53,399
like sort of a commercial point of view

1854
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,840
what do you think we'll be able to

1855
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:58,000
Dethrone the Skittles turps because it

1856
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,480
feels like for something to be really

1857
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,679
popular these days it's got to be like

1858
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:05,759
gassy Skittles purple that's sort of the

1859
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:09,118
general combo do you think anything is

1860
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:11,679
going to help us Break Free of that

1861
01:26:09,118 --> 01:26:15,319
mold

1862
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:17,199
uh maybe maybe a a new flavor but just

1863
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:20,840
as just as

1864
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:22,599
pungent yeah yeah so just some yeah I

1865
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,840
guess it's almost ushered in this wave

1866
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:28,760
of like it has to be insanely loud or

1867
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,520
it's just it just can't stand up yeah

1868
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:32,719
yeah cuz there's there's tons of just

1869
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:35,280
average out there you know it it just

1870
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,520
has to be something just really really

1871
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:40,439
pungent and

1872
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:43,280
strong yeah wow okay I mean in that same

1873
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:45,118
Lane of thought indicas are just

1874
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:47,439
absolutely dominating the market and I

1875
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:49,679
know that there's a small but growing

1876
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:52,319
movement of people who are like you know

1877
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:54,359
we really need to show The General

1878
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:56,118
public that sativas have a lot to offer

1879
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:58,639
and it doesn't need to be like a pure

1880
01:26:56,118 --> 01:27:00,238
tie but you know super silver Hayes did

1881
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,159
really well for a reason right like it

1882
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:04,158
was sort of that middle ground do you

1883
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:06,479
think that we'll ever get more traction

1884
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:08,759
with sativas and the general public or

1885
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,559
do you think that inder is just too

1886
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:12,679
prevalent and when most people think of

1887
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,440
weed they think of like getting a bit

1888
01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:16,319
zoned out in your chair at the end of

1889
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:20,839
the day as opposed to like an uplifting

1890
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:24,238
energetic thing right right I

1891
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:27,639
mean it's should it should become more

1892
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:30,559
prevalent um you you'd think more people

1893
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:33,960
would would be entertaining it you

1894
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:39,760
know during the day and stuff I don't

1895
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:41,359
know uh it it's just uh I don't know

1896
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,719
even the sativas that are available

1897
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:46,639
they're just kind of so hybridized out

1898
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:49,840
you know I don't even know if you're

1899
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:52,639
you're really getting that sativa sativa

1900
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:55,440
experience from you know

1901
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:58,118
uh a lot of the sativa offerings you

1902
01:27:55,439 --> 01:28:00,238
know that's true would you ever want to

1903
01:27:58,118 --> 01:28:03,359
focus on doing like a sativa line or

1904
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:06,919
it's just not really your passion oh no

1905
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:09,399
no I I definitely would they're just I

1906
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:12,359
mean indicas are way easier than they

1907
01:28:09,399 --> 01:28:15,439
are that's I'm sure yeah the time

1908
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:17,799
constraints makes it hard doesn't it

1909
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:20,599
yeah I'm I'm definitely trying to cross

1910
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:24,199
kind of uh going back um you asked about

1911
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:28,079
Tom's Hayes and um I'm I'm entertaining

1912
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:32,039
some uh you know uh some of the kind of

1913
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:34,479
how they built Hayes right um you know

1914
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:39,198
hybridizing you know different sativas

1915
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:41,759
Al together you know so I mean you know

1916
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:44,719
cross the Burmese with you know a

1917
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:49,000
Colombian with a you know a Mexican with

1918
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:50,279
a you know so on and so on I mean if if

1919
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,118
you start making you know good

1920
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:55,840
selections of each one and then you know

1921
01:28:53,118 --> 01:28:59,479
you know combining them and then you

1922
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:03,639
know I can even you know combine those

1923
01:28:59,479 --> 01:29:06,118
uh you using feminized techniques which

1924
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:09,159
you would really speed things along and

1925
01:29:06,118 --> 01:29:10,839
you know kind of you know get to finish

1926
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:13,479
product a lot sooner than if you're just

1927
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:17,319
doing rag braiding once a year type of

1928
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:18,599
thing yeah we we got uh a good um fan

1929
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:21,118
submit a question which was they were

1930
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:23,280
saying are there any Mexican varieties

1931
01:29:21,118 --> 01:29:24,759
that uh stand out to you that you would

1932
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:26,198
consider to be some of the better ones

1933
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:28,239
cuz I think there is a growing movement

1934
01:29:26,198 --> 01:29:30,960
of people who are realizing that

1935
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:33,198
Colombians Mexicans maybe some of these

1936
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,880
were the real unsung heroes of like the

1937
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:36,719
land race sativas because you just

1938
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:39,560
mostly hear about Thai and Southeast

1939
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:43,158
Asia but Colombians go to big

1940
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:46,199
following yeah I mean any of the older

1941
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:49,759
ones you know I I wouldn't I personally

1942
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:52,719
wouldn't trust anything you know uh

1943
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:55,280
that's that's come up in the last 20 20

1944
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:57,840
plus years but you know the older W

1945
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:02,039
Hawkins Mitchell K you know all that

1946
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:05,239
kind of stuff um anybody who's preserved

1947
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:07,639
you know uh lines that came came out

1948
01:30:05,238 --> 01:30:10,118
because anything that's really I'm I'm

1949
01:30:07,639 --> 01:30:12,760
talking maybe 25 30 years anything

1950
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:14,599
that's come from Mexico since then has a

1951
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:17,679
good good chance of being you know

1952
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:20,840
contaminated with you know modern

1953
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:24,079
Amsterdam genetics whatever whatever you

1954
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:26,719
know I mean and that's the same to be

1955
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:29,279
said anywhere where land races come from

1956
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:31,560
I mean I don't think you could go to

1957
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:36,079
Afghanistan or praan or anything without

1958
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:38,280
running across a bunch of DNA genetic

1959
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:40,399
contamination of course I like the pun

1960
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:41,800
as well DNA genetic contamination that's

1961
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:45,000
good that's

1962
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:46,800
good shout out Arian it wasn't a

1963
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:52,479
purposeful

1964
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:54,480
pun yeah um I mean you know

1965
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:55,959
while we're on the topic I would love to

1966
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:58,158
ask you know how do you go about

1967
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:59,679
sourcing this material like if someone

1968
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:01,399
messages you and says hey I got this

1969
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:03,279
killer old stuff like do you have to

1970
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:05,960
sort of approach that with an element of

1971
01:31:03,279 --> 01:31:08,519
Suspicion or do you have like a set way

1972
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:12,158
you go about vouching stuff what's your

1973
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:14,639
process I mean most of the stuff I've

1974
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:17,519
you know worked with is you know all

1975
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:21,319
either older stuff or you know you can

1976
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:24,360
kind of uh you can kind of vet where it

1977
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:26,880
came from you know follow the trail back

1978
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:28,719
um you know if somebody's like I just

1979
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,319
got it from my cousin you know last year

1980
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:35,600
you know blah blah blah I'm like yeah

1981
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:39,238
well you know might not be the best

1982
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:41,360
source yeah but uh you know in in in the

1983
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:44,519
land race Community you

1984
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:47,118
know a lot of them a lot of folks in it

1985
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:50,840
you know tend to you know Trace Trace

1986
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:53,198
things back you know pretty well so and

1987
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:55,159
then bottom line is is you know uh I

1988
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:56,158
always grow you know grow these things

1989
01:31:55,158 --> 01:32:00,000
out

1990
01:31:56,158 --> 01:32:03,439
beforehand and if I like them I'll use

1991
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,679
them but if it's there there's been

1992
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:11,879
plenty like I grew out a a purple yaron

1993
01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:13,600
line uh years ago and it was absolutely

1994
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,560
horrible and tons of people are talking

1995
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:19,079
it up but man uhuh I didn't even make

1996
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:22,400
one seat of that no thank

1997
01:32:19,079 --> 01:32:25,238
you yeah so you know

1998
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:27,439
wow that I mean just to quickly you know

1999
01:32:25,238 --> 01:32:29,678
wrap up that school of thought with the

2000
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:32,519
land Racers do you think where quickly

2001
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:35,319
slash have already got to a point where

2002
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:37,560
land races essentially will only exist

2003
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:40,279
in people's seed cataloges and like

2004
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:44,080
they're not really indigenous to places

2005
01:32:40,279 --> 01:32:46,519
anymore oh yeah I mean there there might

2006
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:51,639
be little tiny Pockets here in

2007
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:55,040
there but I mean uh land races generally

2008
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:58,159
stem from areas where a decent amount of

2009
01:32:55,039 --> 01:33:01,840
people were you know growing you know

2010
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:05,000
for some kind of commercial you know

2011
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:07,360
right reasons and that's you know why

2012
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,840
they have seeds that's why you know

2013
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:13,839
seeds became available one way or

2014
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:17,639
another so but now you know there's

2015
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:19,719
either not that happening or you know I

2016
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:22,560
I I don't see a whole lot of people you

2017
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:25,760
know keeping things going

2018
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,080
you know outside of little tiny Niche

2019
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,679
Pockets you

2020
01:33:27,079 --> 01:33:31,960
know yeah look it makes sense and it's

2021
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:35,560
certainly a bit concerning I I have to

2022
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:37,880
sort of hope that in the next 20 so

2023
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:40,280
years like people realize what's going

2024
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:43,239
on and especially when you see Thailand

2025
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:44,840
opening the floodgates to cookies it's

2026
01:33:43,238 --> 01:33:46,799
like I don't think they're going to be

2027
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:49,480
growing Thailand

2028
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:52,320
races no they're

2029
01:33:49,479 --> 01:33:54,319
not uh uh uh uh

2030
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:56,439
well yeah well okay while we're on the

2031
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:59,039
topic of old school stuff that's been

2032
01:33:56,439 --> 01:34:00,839
preserved I know you've got the Kush 4

2033
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:03,639
cutting which is one that you really

2034
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:07,319
don't hear mentioned very much what can

2035
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:10,679
you tell us about it or you could say I

2036
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:13,439
had the fish for

2037
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:15,639
cutting that one fell through the crack

2038
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:16,919
uh it was a it was a cool plant it was a

2039
01:34:15,639 --> 01:34:20,279
cool Plant

2040
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:22,079
um I don't know if I can't remember how

2041
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:26,519
if I'm supposed to talk about that or

2042
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:29,880
not um I I I got that through

2043
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:31,840
bod maybe maybe I'll hit bod up and be

2044
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:35,960
like can I talk about that you can

2045
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:38,800
censor it but uh got I got that through

2046
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:41,239
bod and he got it directly from Jim

2047
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:45,000
Ortega right

2048
01:34:41,238 --> 01:34:48,678
and um one one of the stories was uh the

2049
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:52,198
Hindu Kush um you know that was

2050
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:56,399
available back in the day was kush 4

2051
01:34:52,198 --> 01:35:00,319
crossed with norn lights 2 right which

2052
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:05,319
was the cushiest of the norn lights um

2053
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:09,880
so I mean you know it it's a nice plant

2054
01:35:05,319 --> 01:35:12,359
um you know has a nice insy turp um it

2055
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:16,639
smells very Bubba

2056
01:35:12,359 --> 01:35:21,920
esque on a different structured uh style

2057
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:24,239
of a plant um but you know um

2058
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,000
past past you know it coming from Jim

2059
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:29,359
Ortega

2060
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,760
um I don't know a whole lot about

2061
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:33,439
it yeah that look that's that's the

2062
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,199
story I'd heard from bod that it was

2063
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:38,000
like one of the parents sents he used

2064
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:40,079
and it meant to be really good so that

2065
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,118
that all kind of checks out I know you

2066
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:44,439
did some hybrids with it with like the

2067
01:35:42,118 --> 01:35:46,319
T1000 have you had a chance to see how

2068
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:49,238
any of those have turned out or you just

2069
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:51,799
got your plate full already no no I I I

2070
01:35:49,238 --> 01:35:53,718
ran a I ran a couple of the Kush hybrids

2071
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:58,159
out um definitely the

2072
01:35:53,719 --> 01:36:00,600
t1000s and uh they they were good

2073
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:03,158
um they they weren't as turpy as you

2074
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:05,159
know I mean Ju Just like we've talked

2075
01:36:03,158 --> 01:36:08,479
you know there's one two three different

2076
01:36:05,158 --> 01:36:11,359
things that everybody wants and you know

2077
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:14,118
everything else you know people are like

2078
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:16,639
eh and so it kind of falls into that

2079
01:36:14,118 --> 01:36:18,679
category it made some beautiful flowers

2080
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:20,199
they smelled good blah blah blah but

2081
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:22,039
yeah they weren't that overthe toop

2082
01:36:20,198 --> 01:36:25,000
turpy so

2083
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:27,399
you know kind of to the

2084
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,560
Wayside yeah that that is interesting

2085
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:30,079
how you talk about it you know like

2086
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:33,199
there's things we want there's things

2087
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:35,479
other people want if you if you were

2088
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:38,118
just left to your own devices and could

2089
01:36:35,479 --> 01:36:40,279
pursue just purely passion projects you

2090
01:36:38,118 --> 01:36:42,118
know you you win the lotto and so now

2091
01:36:40,279 --> 01:36:43,960
you're just breeding for just shits and

2092
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:46,039
giggles it's what you want to do what

2093
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:47,639
sort of stuff would you be focusing

2094
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:50,079
on

2095
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:53,279
h Huh maybe I should start thinking

2096
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,279
about that all the time

2097
01:36:53,679 --> 01:37:00,920
um I always um I think I'm kind of

2098
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:04,920
already doing that um but uh I don't

2099
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:07,239
know uh that's a good

2100
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:08,560
question I love the answer man that you

2101
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:10,919
you're living the dream already you're

2102
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,119
pursuing the passion it's a good answer

2103
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:15,719
right because I tell people a lot of

2104
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:17,519
people have this sort of dire straight

2105
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:19,639
view of the modern breeding landscape

2106
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,840
and they say you know how am I meant to

2107
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:23,359
establish myself everything's the same

2108
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,560
and I sort of allude to what you just

2109
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:26,118
said it's like pursue what you're

2110
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:28,840
interested in if you're interested in it

2111
01:37:26,118 --> 01:37:32,118
people will probably be interested in it

2112
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:36,440
right right I mean uh honestly you know

2113
01:37:32,118 --> 01:37:39,479
uh stuff that was just purely uh passion

2114
01:37:36,439 --> 01:37:43,118
was you know plan around with the ABCs I

2115
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:47,439
mean uh surprisingly enough there wasn't

2116
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:50,079
barely a single Dollar in in the ABCs so

2117
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:52,118
uh yes uh I I had a lot of fun with

2118
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:56,079
those and I'd like like to revisit them

2119
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:59,039
too you know um but yeah it it it

2120
01:37:56,079 --> 01:38:01,599
