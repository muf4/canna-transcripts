further ado

let's get into it

82
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:43,979
I guess it sort of just speaks to that

83
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:45,598
idea of like how sort of the hazy longer

84
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,079
flowering sativa stuff it seems like

85
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:51,479
it's really got a home in New York

86
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,180
yeah well you know in New York you know

87
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,939
people have always you know wanted the

88
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,680
best weed so

89
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,500
um and they want stuff that's different

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,959
that not everyone else has so you know

91
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,098
look at yourself with a product That's

92
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,280
Unique uh you you're able to do that and

93
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:12,719
almost build your own customer base off

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,360
of that

95
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,220
yeah definitely definitely

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,560
you know I was talking to Bob Hemphill

97
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,720
recently yet again and he mentioned how

98
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,418
grateful he was that you had gifted him

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,100
an old Scentsy star cutting that you had

100
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,159
and he was saying how much he loved it

101
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,560
and um it made me think you know will we

102
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,840
see any more Sensei star crosses from

103
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,879
you and is it one you like to smoke and

104
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,359
breed with

105
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:42,199
uh well I had I was given a cut from a

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,000
friend of mine uh from Washington

107
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,759
and I think you know he told me it was

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,439
one of the old-time Scentsy Star Cuts

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,720
and it was the more uh stretchy one

110
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,959
I guess I guess there was a couple

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:03,060
different ones that were around

112
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:06,000
so um yeah so he gifted me that and I

113
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,759
did a little bit of work with it and

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,519
then I lost it unfortunately yeah I gave

115
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:15,360
it to Bob and

116
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:19,620
um my friend I think he brought it back

117
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,919
to an F3 or something or F4 F3 I'm not

118
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,759
sure I he I I have some of the some of

119
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,159
his

120
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,740
um seed stock that he made with that

121
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,639
original so I think that he had gotten

122
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:37,500
that cutting and then got some original

123
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:41,939
Scentsy store seeds and then I started

124
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:45,000
to um F1 and F2 you know went back with

125
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:48,779
for a couple Generations so that's what

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,240
he based it off of that cutting and so

127
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:56,819
yeah I just got to cutting and you know

128
00:05:51,240 --> 00:06:00,180
I crossed it out to uh the star dog and

129
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:02,639
I think a cam Crow another cam cross I I

130
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,579
can't quite remember but I did a couple

131
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,079
breedings with it and then I lost it and

132
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:13,079
it was nice it's kind of I mean an old

133
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:17,939
school Amsterdam

134
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:22,198
um kind of peppery uh

135
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:24,418
yeah it was you know it's only it kind

136
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,538
of reminded me of the star dog a little

137
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:31,139
bit but without the chem you know but it

138
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:35,459
was kind of peppery and you know back in

139
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:38,400
the day it definitely was a special cut

140
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:41,399
um but you know if you put it up to

141
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,459
today's standards I don't think it would

142
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:48,060
really uh make the cut in most people's

143
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:51,180
book but you know um if you're in more

144
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,560
of a Nostalgia type of a guy and breeder

145
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,600
like Bob is then you know uh then yeah

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,360
that's something that that's going to

147
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,720
interest you and you know I think you

148
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,080
know a lot of the stuff you know

149
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,539
um you know our our past is our future

150
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:12,959
you know referencing some of these older

151
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:15,978
cuts and older streams and you know

152
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:19,019
trying to bring them back uh

153
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:22,860
revitalizing them and out Crossing them

154
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:25,258
and you know uh yeah so I think you know

155
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,319
you know that's what I always say is our

156
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,598
past is our future so I'm one of those

157
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,598
guys that kind of like to that that

158
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:36,538
looks back on on on some of these older

159
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:39,240
strains as they not might not be

160
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:42,659
significant to most of the people you

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,060
know on in today's world uh it it did

162
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,180
mean something at some point for a

163
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,538
reason so I still think that they're

164
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,418
still you know a lot of uh things that

165
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:57,120
could could come out good out of those

166
00:07:54,418 --> 00:08:00,299
genetics and especially something that's

167
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,098
different compared to today's designer

168
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,340
genetics

169
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:07,740
yeah great rundown thanks for giving us

170
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,478
your answer to that one one of our

171
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,639
listeners asked a really interesting

172
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,318
question and they were wondering when

173
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,800
you're in the process of creating

174
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,598
stardog for example and you maybe grew

175
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,360
out the seeds or they were tested via

176
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,819
whatever means did you find like the

177
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,800
quality and the potency to like surprise

178
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,479
you at all because I think a lot of

179
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,579
people would probably agree you know

180
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,860
they've got to be up there with some of

181
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,319
the best and greatest seeds ever

182
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,300
commercially produced did you have any

183
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,320
idea like how big it was going to take

184
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:42,120
off or was it all a bit of a surprise

185
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,640
no I was a little bit of surprised I

186
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,220
mean I I mean I knew like the genetics

187
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,458
that I was using were you know were

188
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,940
special and so uh

189
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:57,000
but really they kind of took a life of

190
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,339
of their own like you know I like I said

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,620
you know I when I first popped those

192
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,899
seeds you know I don't know how many man

193
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,919
maybe four or six seeds I might have

194
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,039
popped

195
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:12,479
because you know I you know back then

196
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:14,519
you know I I was growing 99 plants for

197
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,200
you know uh

198
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:22,259
production you know and so 50 would be

199
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,860
vegging and 49 would be flowering so

200
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,379
like so if so if I take you know if I

201
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,778
was going to pop you know four or six

202
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:33,600
seeds that means like four or six

203
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:37,259
production plants we're gonna be able to

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,399
be grown so I wasn't able to you know do

205
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:44,580
huge you know seed pops for selection so

206
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,639
when I first did that first you know uh

207
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,759
seed pop and found the the Quarry star

208
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:54,600
dog I was you know pretty impressed on

209
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:58,559
you know what it was you know and so uh

210
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,959
once I started to uh you know get that

211
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,979
out there uh I think one of the first

212
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:07,919
few people I gave it to was uh was Joe B

213
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,920
uh because he had given me this chem 4

214
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,139
so I wanted to give you know give him

215
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,259
you know something for giving it back so

216
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:19,139
I was like here's the Quarry so once the

217
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:21,838
Quarry got out there and humbled it kind

218
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:23,879
of took a life of its own you know and

219
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,580
really started to become really popular

220
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,159
out there and

221
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,500
um yeah I mean that's really the only

222
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,559
way I could explain it is it kind of

223
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,179
took a life of its own you know and a

224
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,079
lot of these things happen that way

225
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:42,719
where I might make something and you

226
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,120
know it takes you know and I can test it

227
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
like I just explained and I knew I had

228
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,078
something really good and started

229
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:53,159
getting you know passing that clone

230
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:56,458
around and and and until people you know

231
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:59,458
got the Clone and was able to grow it

232
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:02,219
and finish it in the people that bought

233
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:04,500
the seeds and bought the seeds and were

234
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,180
able to grow them and finish them by the

235
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,740
time they get to them and by the time

236
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:10,439
you get a final product you're talking

237
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,620
like a year later you know by the time I

238
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,240
first made it a year or two later by the

239
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,459
time you know it starts getting into

240
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,519
people's hands starts getting passed

241
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:23,518
around starts making taking a life of

242
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,220
its own then I mean that's you know so

243
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,320
you know and that's basically like all

244
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,959
my work is always been like that like

245
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,540
it's not like me telling you how great

246
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,939
it is and you going and buying it it's

247
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:39,120
people buying it and telling everyone

248
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,120
else how great it is so a lot of the

249
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,539
times that takes it takes time for that

250
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:49,620
to happen and so um you know it's

251
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:51,179
happened numerous times and so uh that's

252
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,419
the only way that I can really explain

253
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:56,099
it to where you know you make something

254
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:58,319
you know you can test it you know your

255
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,740
friends and all but it's really the

256
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,200
general Public's perception of of what

257
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,419
it is

258
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,160
yeah I I guess it you know must have to

259
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,259
have been a little bit surprising but

260
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,179
yeah I guess great to get that feedback

261
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,980
even if it does have a bit of a lag time

262
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:16,199
before it gets to you

263
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,940
something I was hoping you could answer

264
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,820
for me was that

265
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,820
I think it's undeniable you know Tres

266
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,920
dog as a male has made a number of

267
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,959
killer strains out there but

268
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,000
interestingly enough we really don't see

269
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,099
a lot of Tres dog females out there

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,078
clone only there is one which I believe

271
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,659
stray fox has a cut of one which he

272
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,639
really likes and um maybe another one or

273
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:40,379
two floating around there but do you

274
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,600
have any thoughts on why maybe we don't

275
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,700
see Tres dog as much and how did you

276
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,100
find the females

277
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,440
well the the reason why that is because

278
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,220
we never I never real there was never

279
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,079
really commercially like released there

280
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:01,320
were there were some small releases but

281
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:04,078
generally like that was really made for

282
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,040
to be a breeding male

283
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,239
so a lot of the times you know I just

284
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,480
made

285
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:17,039
it was just one breeding so like I did

286
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,759
the initial Afghan chem d as per se

287
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:24,958
um I think most of those seeds were sold

288
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:27,539
on uh seed Bay and not a lot of them you

289
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:32,699
know uh I still have some of those

290
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:34,980
original uh Afghan chemd uh seeds so out

291
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,519
of that seed stock I would you know pop

292
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:41,940
and find another male and then I did the

293
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:44,339
back cross into the into the KMD again

294
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,040
and made the double dog now the double

295
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:50,279
dog became a little more

296
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:54,299
um accessible and um

297
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:56,820
I uh you know I got I let some of those

298
00:13:54,299 --> 00:14:00,419
seeds some of those seeds did get out

299
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,260
and and I think on seed Bay also and I

300
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:04,500
think

301
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:07,559
those those ones were I remember taking

302
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,259
a picture of one of my original packs

303
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,479
and it was just in a small little

304
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:17,458
plastic

305
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:20,339
Ziploc baggy with uh a hand printed uh

306
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:23,399
pen uh on on the

307
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:27,060
um on the plastic itself there so there

308
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:30,778
was no label or anything it was just uh

309
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:34,078
a pen printed on the on the plastic

310
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:37,259
itself and you know I said double dog

311
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:40,019
and those were my original that's how

312
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:44,220
those original packs were sold they were

313
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:47,639
just unsealed in a little Ziploc baggie

314
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,060
with 10c 10 or 12 seeds in it and it

315
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:54,060
might have said you know a double dog 12

316
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:56,759
seeds on it or something like that so

317
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,219
you know then you know obviously I took

318
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,639
a mail out of that and made the Tres dog

319
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,240
so when I made the Tres doll dog

320
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,778
um

321
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,360
that was just one breeding I took a

322
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:12,179
double dog male and I made like a

323
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,879
certain amount of those seeds which I

324
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:18,778
still have some of those original stock

325
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:22,980
of so really at that point I decided

326
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:24,899
that I was going to uh that would that

327
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,139
was gonna be it that was going to be

328
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:34,320
this was going to be my my mail stream

329
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:38,639
the trade dog and uh so there was very

330
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,639
few seeds that that that we released

331
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,139
that I that I let go and because I want

332
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,579
you know because that was gonna be you

333
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,759
know I wanted to get a little bit of

334
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:50,099
feedback from it I think and then you

335
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,439
know I wanted to be that I wanted that

336
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,259
to be exclusive from that was my

337
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,079
exclusive strain you know so really

338
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:00,600
that's like one of the reasons why like

339
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,479
no one else really has it because we

340
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,500
know I never really worked it really Pat

341
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:10,139
past that you know uh I had given you

342
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:14,339
know we've um you know I've passed some

343
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:17,820
seeds off to money he has made some uh

344
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:21,300
chemd back cross threes and I think some

345
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:24,000
fours uh but we've never released them

346
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:26,519
or we've never worked any of those seats

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,820
he he you know we have them for a future

348
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:33,060
for future use but

349
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:36,300
um yeah it was never the trade dog was

350
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:39,299
never intended to be a production uh

351
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:43,319
seed strain it was really supposed to be

352
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:45,838
my exclusive uh male that you know no

353
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,120
one else was going to be able to have

354
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,980
yeah interesting like that's a brilliant

355
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,560
answer as to why we don't see much tray

356
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,899
dog females out there and really you

357
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,778
know and really if you look at it like

358
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:01,019
you know the people now that are copying

359
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:04,558
me and ripping me off you know uh you

360
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:07,380
know they could only use the seeds made

361
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:11,399
from that where they can't get that

362
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,140
Original Seed stock yeah so you kind of

363
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,759
segued into the next question we had

364
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,679
which was from one of our listeners but

365
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:19,259
I'll admit I too was interested in this

366
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,179
one uh sort of along the lines of what

367
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:24,240
you just mentioned what's the story

368
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:26,579
behind goo from Green Point seeds using

369
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,279
star dog it seems like I've heard rumors

370
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,440
that it was like your cut exactly or is

371
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,298
it just from your seed stock what's the

372
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,240
backstory there

373
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:38,579
well you know I'm just going back a

374
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,720
little bit when I had my my legal

375
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:44,939
troubles and my absence of the internet

376
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:49,079
during during that and that was right an

377
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:52,759
Inception of um Instagram I would say so

378
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,759
I think that we were talking like

379
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:01,200
2014 maybe I think 2014 so you know I

380
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,839
had you know I had like I mentioned I

381
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,058
had gotten to a jammed up a little bit

382
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,058
there and I had to close down so I was

383
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:11,339
absent from the internet for for a

384
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:15,240
little bit a while but during that time

385
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:17,639
like unknown to me during that time my

386
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,519
stuff was blowing up like I had gotten

387
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,940
in trouble and I had kind of dropped out

388
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,220
of the scene a little bit and so uh

389
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,200
during that time every I was just

390
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,600
blowing up you know my seeds were

391
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,259
blowing up like we were getting really

392
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:38,579
popular but we were nowhere to be found

393
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:43,019
so uh and that's when uh Green Point uh

394
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:47,460
they had gotten some of my original uh

395
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:51,119
star dog stock and so they decided you

396
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,179
know since I wasn't around that you know

397
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:57,418
they made some kind of a statement

398
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:00,900
saying that I was retired and that they

399
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:04,140
were you know going to further on the

400
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,298
genetics and so on and so forth and just

401
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,179
kind of took advantage of the situation

402
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:12,240
and I was kind of down and out at the

403
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:14,820
time and you know I you know at the time

404
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,279
I kind of you know I think you know I

405
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,079
rebelled with some posts and stuff like

406
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,839
that there wasn't really much I could do

407
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,819
because I wasn't growing at the time and

408
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,418
so really just really

409
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:27,240
um

410
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,460
you know uh gave me more incentive to

411
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,538
get my [ __ ] together and to and to

412
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:36,480
really you know and and really uh widen

413
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:40,500
my perspective of the possibility of

414
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:43,200
this really being uh something uh uh

415
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,319
something because you know back back

416
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,419
then you know uh the the only really big

417
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,359
breeders back then were kind of some

418
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:53,580
Amsterdam you know and so those were

419
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,399
those guys were only the real those guys

420
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:58,399
were really legitimate and you know they

421
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,160
were you know obviously working under

422
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,940
you know uh easier conditions that we

423
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,220
were

424
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,160
but you know the thing about you know

425
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,440
the difference between uh Dutch breeders

426
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,320
and American breeders is we have so much

427
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,080
more passion uh you know you go over to

428
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:19,079
Amsterdam and you know these guys are

429
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:22,019
smoking spliffs with [ __ ] tobacco in

430
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,899
it because the weed is too strong and

431
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:27,119
[ __ ] whatever and you know we show up

432
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,980
over there and we're smoking bombs of

433
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,959
[ __ ] Street [ __ ] Diesel and

434
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,900
they're looking like that that does like

435
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,460
work [ __ ] crazy you know so you know

436
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:41,280
the Americans have always had much more

437
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:45,298
passion for uh for stronger the

438
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:47,819
strongest weed you know and so uh and

439
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:50,279
and basically the Dutch is up the Dutch

440
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:53,220
have everything they got over there

441
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,079
they've got from us originally you know

442
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,259
it's just that they were you know

443
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,538
working you know not under prohibition

444
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:02,460
like we were so that's really why the

445
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:04,919
reason why a lot of those genetics wound

446
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,279
up and in Amsterdam because they were

447
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,740
able to work there so I mean you know so

448
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:14,819
the the Americans always had a strong

449
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:18,000
passion for the the best of the best you

450
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:19,918
know so you know you know when when we

451
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,558
you know when I first was coming up and

452
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,559
doing doing what we were doing and doing

453
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:28,500
what I was doing you know I never you

454
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:32,178
know you know would you know uh try to

455
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:36,839
compare myself to a Neville or a Scentsy

456
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:38,460
seeds or Shanti Bob or or or any of

457
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,859
these guys you know because you know

458
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,500
they were just uh you know such a high

459
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:45,599
level and you know we were just you know

460
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,019
a bunch of people on the internet just

461
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:51,959
trying to you know figure things out and

462
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,538
you know make our own way so to speak

463
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,120
not knowing that you know the the

464
00:21:54,538 --> 00:22:00,119
genetic the genetics that we were

465
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,759
working with were you know you know some

466
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,359
of the best in in the whole wide world

467
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,279
you know and you know

468
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,199
it's you know it's it's just really kind

469
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,839
of hard to explain you know the reason

470
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,179
why that is you know in in some of it's

471
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:18,240
just kind of pure luck because you know

472
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:20,759
we're only given the stuff that we had

473
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,620
access to you know so we didn't have

474
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,179
access to any of that stuff we never

475
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:26,759
would have been able to have it

476
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:29,038
obviously you know so you know a lot of

477
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,579
places are kind of

478
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,700
um

479
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:36,899
you know uh you know everyone every

480
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:40,798
place in the world Khan has their own uh

481
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:44,460
kind of like home strains that were

482
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,558
popular at the time you know and and

483
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,298
that and that's and that's all that they

484
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,940
know because that's what they grew up

485
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:54,179
around you know so you know like you

486
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,720
know fortunately for us you know uh you

487
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,600
know the chems were around and and you

488
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,480
know not knowing that they would be you

489
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:06,000
know the strains that they are today you

490
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,279
know you know in going back to you know

491
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,740
some of the uh you know the older stuff

492
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:13,319
that I had seeing the hash plants the

493
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,359
ties and stuff like that you know back

494
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,418
then you know I didn't really have a

495
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:22,019
really full full grasp of the whole

496
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:24,480
genetic uh pool you know like I do today

497
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:26,940
you know the you know the knowledge and

498
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,679
the experience just wasn't there you

499
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,200
know so you know you see all these

500
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,919
different streams you know that you know

501
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,440
come out of Amsterdam and you know uh

502
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,960
you know and you know and looking back

503
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,080
like you know how how many of them are

504
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,179
still relevant today uh in today's world

505
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:48,058
you know we're in when back then they

506
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,580
were super popular you know so you know

507
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,558
you know it you know it was never you

508
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:54,839
know

509
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:57,779
it's it's hard to believe that you know

510
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:01,019
we've built up you know a a genetic

511
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:03,720
diversity in the states here that just

512
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,759
kind of just lead the world you know

513
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,798
it's you know and it's just from

514
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:14,460
people's passion for the flower itself

515
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:16,500
and for taking risks and just traveling

516
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,679
and just you know

517
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,798
um you know we we you know stand on the

518
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:26,460
shoulders of giants you know of people

519
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:29,058
that you know or initial initially you

520
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,860
know went out and took those risks

521
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:34,859
hugely hugely agree

522
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:37,859
so when you were developing the Tres dog

523
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:39,839
line I'm wondering what how are you

524
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,058
making your selection were you just

525
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,399
selecting a mail that you felt best

526
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:46,798
looked like the chemd sort of each time

527
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,140
and what would be your general tips for

528
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,019
listeners who are hoping to get better

529
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,120
at selecting males

530
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:56,460
yeah I mean that's really you know

531
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,178
pretty much you know

532
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,038
um

533
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:03,960
yeah I mean early on you know it was you

534
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:08,099
know and I was really I guess the the

535
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:11,058
concept of back Crossing you know uh was

536
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:15,658
just really trying to like tighten up

537
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:17,819
the gene pool you know around uh you

538
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,799
know around the chemd you know I you

539
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:23,519
know I had I've had you know a little

540
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:26,220
bit of breeding knowledge just from uh

541
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,859
from dogs uh from pit bulls and stuff

542
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,980
and I used to study the the the the the

543
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:35,699
breeding lines and how they would you

544
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:40,319
know do things and how a certain dog

545
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:43,860
would would become a a a line in itself

546
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:47,819
and how that was done meaning like a one

547
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:50,519
male almost almost kind of like you know

548
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:52,980
a string you know like it's the same

549
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:53,940
thing with cannabis a strain within the

550
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,058
Stream

551
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,038
so um yeah so I had a little bit of

552
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:01,259
knowledge of that and a lot of it had to

553
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:04,980
do with you know

554
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:07,619
um just going back to the original

555
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,720
um genetics is uh you know and it's

556
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:12,959
really just a theory of back Crossing

557
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,940
and stuff and and also I had read a

558
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,900
little bit you know on the Mel Frank

559
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:21,000
stuff and uh the concept of cubing and

560
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,278
back Crossing in Cuban and stuff like

561
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,798
that so uh you know I thought that would

562
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:29,700
you know be the best way to really just

563
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:33,599
you know try to tighten up the the gene

564
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:37,140
pool of the of the cam D so

565
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,480
um you know and so you know initially

566
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,419
you know I would probably say there was

567
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,099
no real selection when I first took my

568
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,380
first you know

569
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:48,418
um initial mail and I just really you

570
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,778
know just it was just really a donor

571
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,700
mail and you know and just really just

572
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,919
really really that's really the only

573
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,819
thing thing it was really donating was

574
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:04,320
the male part of it because my my vision

575
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:06,960
was to just to keep bringing it back you

576
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,899
know until you know a certain point and

577
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,019
then testing you know not really testing

578
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,120
as I went along you know in in the very

579
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:15,778
beginning and

580
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,119
um

581
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:21,839
yeah so I mean once you know you know

582
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:26,639
once I got to uh you know to to the

583
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:29,579
trade dog and then that's when I

584
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,980
um you know because I I've used a lot of

585
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:35,759
different males of that and initially

586
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:38,700
like I would just you know I had I would

587
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,339
do a breeding and then kill the male you

588
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,558
know and so you know so really you know

589
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:45,359
and at that point it really wasn't

590
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:50,940
really like

591
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:53,579
my vision to continuously breed it was

592
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,120
just because I had a certain

593
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,339
um

594
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,278
clone at the time that I wanted to

595
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:02,639
preserve so I would just you know I

596
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,679
would just pop a new mail and and do it

597
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,900
bam you know I mean then I'd go back to

598
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,720
production you know and then I'd get

599
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,480
another new clone sometime and be like

600
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,819
well I don't have to keep a mail and

601
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,460
I'll just start new new seeds and find a

602
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:20,819
new mail and you know so that was really

603
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,919
you know uh the way I did it in the very

604
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,139
beginning you know because I you know I

605
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,480
you know I didn't really have a lot of

606
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,820
you know breeding experience and I was

607
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,880
just kind of learning as I go along

608
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:34,200
you know whereas now you know I do a lot

609
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,520
more

610
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,120
um uh more selections on the mail and

611
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,859
um looking for certain characteristics

612
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,259
and kind of like

613
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:49,259
one good example would have been like

614
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:53,400
the trade dog times a sour diesel which

615
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:58,140
made the sour dog so what so when I did

616
00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:01,019
those when I did that initial cross you

617
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:04,080
know um you know my thing was all right

618
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:08,038
you know I want to produce a sour diesel

619
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:11,699
you know uh Sour Diesel line so

620
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:15,240
um it was quite easy to pick the mail

621
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:18,778
for the next batch because the um the

622
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:22,440
trade dog you know it it grew short you

623
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:24,839
know so any of those short phenos

624
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,580
obviously would have been more tree dog

625
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,699
leaning

626
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:33,418
so if I wanted a more shower leaning one

627
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:37,019
I was looking for a more stretchier uh

628
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:40,020
sour leaning type of structure you know

629
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:42,960
so you know that's one way of doing it

630
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:45,599
is like you get two different opposite

631
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,880
of of the spectrum you got a tall plant

632
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,339
and short plant well you want you want

633
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,740
to breed for the tall plant but you use

634
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:55,199
a short plant for the male donor and

635
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,359
then so you do that initial cross and

636
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,919
then just select for the tall plants

637
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:04,798
going there there onward after so you

638
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,720
know um and then you know uh you know

639
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,359
then there's another way of doing it

640
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,419
where you actually grow out your males

641
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:16,139
and females and then you know you see

642
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:19,320
the the male or the female that you like

643
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:22,380
and then you try to pick a male that's

644
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,599
that grows similar to that

645
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,340
so you know so you would be like all

646
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:29,158
right you know these things both look

647
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:31,019
same one to male one's a female so you

648
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,419
know you would know that that man would

649
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,639
kind of show the same characteristics as

650
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,440
that female but that's doing a little

651
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,240
bit more work you know and that's really

652
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,360
something that people don't want to do

653
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,700
nowadays you know and this is one of the

654
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:46,740
things that kind of makes me mad and

655
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,278
it's not that you know I don't get mad

656
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,740
that people use my genetics in in and

657
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:55,019
outcross them to other things you know

658
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,240
which I don't have no problem is with

659
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,639
you know and I don't get mad that people

660
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,380
are you know they cross you know they

661
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,360
are gonna they want to work with the

662
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,860
chem dog or whatever but if they're

663
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,219
going to work with the chem dog whatever

664
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:10,678
well why don't you use make your own

665
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,538
mail use your own genetics your own

666
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:15,059
outcross what they want to do is they

667
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:17,879
just want to take my stuff that I work

668
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:20,700
and cross it into a chem and make it

669
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:25,140
their chem instead of going and getting

670
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,058
their own Afghan their own Hindu Kush or

671
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,380
whatever the outcross that they want to

672
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:33,480
do make their own mail do all that work

673
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,820
and you know and a lot of that takes a

674
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,339
lot of time you know and and that's what

675
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:41,819
people do not want to do nowadays they

676
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:44,939
just want to steal people's work make a

677
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:48,058
quick Cross put it on Instagram and try

678
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:50,519
to make a quick buck and you know and so

679
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:53,639
a lot of people they'll sell their stuff

680
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,579
for half your price or what whatever

681
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,919
fifty dollars a pack and you know I'm

682
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:00,898
selling my stuff for double or triple

683
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,720
that price because I put that amount of

684
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:06,119
work in I have years of work in that

685
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,140
cross and someone just takes that now

686
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:12,778
and F2 is it in you know so that that's

687
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,640
that's the stuff that I don't like if

688
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:16,740
people want to take my stuff and out

689
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,980
cross it and use it for something

690
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,778
different I mean I'm happy that they do

691
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,240
it but you know the people that just

692
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:26,099
want to you know kind of pray off of

693
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,200
your work you know and then there's

694
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:31,379
always the argument well if you don't

695
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,179
like it don't sell regular seeds or once

696
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,520
you sell them then you know so there's

697
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,679
all these different arguments and you

698
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,319
know it just really

699
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,840
um on how you want to you know conduct

700
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,538
yourself and be known as you know if you

701
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,859
want to be one of those people and you

702
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:48,599
know there's always going to be people

703
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,398
that are going to support them because

704
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:54,480
you know some people you know they just

705
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,859
want to buy cheap seeds or you know you

706
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,259
know there's a there's a you know just

707
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:00,359
like you know going back to you know the

708
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:01,798
res dog thing you know there's always

709
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:03,898
going to be someone out there that's

710
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:04,918
going to you know uh that's going to

711
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,278
support

712
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,538
them and it's the same thing with me you

713
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,980
know there's there's people that are

714
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:12,538
always going to support you and there's

715
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,278
always been the people that are going to

716
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:16,379
hate you and those that's one thing that

717
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:18,778
you gotta you come to grips with no

718
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,480
matter who you are you can think of

719
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:24,659
anything in the world the best singer

720
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,919
the best soccer star whatever you're

721
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,960
always going to be someone that's going

722
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,700
to be like you know I don't like that

723
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,399
person because of this or that or

724
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,860
whatever so that's fine I could live

725
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,619
with that just as long as you have more

726
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:39,959
people that support you than that don't

727
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:42,839
that don't like you

728
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,880
yeah some wise words right there

729
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:46,980
what was interesting about that answer

730
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,200
was how you were mentioning that like

731
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,298
you know each sort of breeding is like

732
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,759
its own unique offering because it's

733
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:56,339
you're using the mail like one time only

734
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,798
is that still the case or have you been

735
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:03,178
keeping males more lately

736
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:06,599
no I keep males now yeah I mean um yeah

737
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,460
you know uh one of our last you know I

738
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:11,219
kind of learned because one of the the

739
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,500
tree log one of the last ones I used was

740
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:16,138
was one of the purple we called the

741
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,418
purple Fino and that one you know

742
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,358
everything that that was that meal was

743
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:24,779
bred to came out kind of purplished we

744
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:27,000
had the sour dog the uh original New

745
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,839
York City Diesel

746
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,898
um there was a a few other strains too

747
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:36,719
uh that that that came out like that and

748
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:39,000
um so after that yeah you know after

749
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,199
that you know I decided that you know

750
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,398
it's it's

751
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:48,658
it's better for me to try to keep one

752
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:50,759
male and to to to keep reusing that and

753
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,940
you know since I'm not you know uh

754
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,399
growing for production anymore

755
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:59,519
um so that you know that whole formula

756
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:02,880
now is you know is different so

757
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:07,199
um really it's more about uh the amount

758
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,260
of uh different strains that I have and

759
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:13,019
uh yeah just in just the overall plant

760
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,760
count overall so you know I'm able to

761
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:17,099
keep a lot more different type of

762
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,720
funerals I think right now I have I

763
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,059
don't know maybe like four or five

764
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:24,059
different males that I'm sitting on

765
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:26,279
nice nice it must be you know sort of

766
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:28,679
relaxing nowadays that you're able to do

767
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,440
that as opposed to in the past whereas

768
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:33,059
maybe a bit more harder to do that but

769
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,280
another question we got from one of our

770
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:37,320
listeners was how would you describe

771
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,160
stardog for someone who's never been

772
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,160
able to try it

773
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,500
uh

774
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:51,980
yeah I mean it it's got like it's kind

775
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:58,679
of uh it's kind of piney you know uh

776
00:35:51,980 --> 00:36:02,519
Cami uh uh yeah uh

777
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:07,019
it's very unique you know in um

778
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:10,380
yeah it I mean it's kind of it's really

779
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:13,559
a good blend between the chem 4 and the

780
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,320
cam D you know so you know there's a

781
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:18,239
little bit of like Piney dirtiness in

782
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,240
there I guess that's really what I'm

783
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:24,838
looking to looking to looking for a

784
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:28,019
Piney dirtiness and a cami you know and

785
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,639
and so it's kind of almost a layered a

786
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,400
little bit of a layered palette and

787
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,920
that's really uh one of the things about

788
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,559
the chems because

789
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,519
um you know you can cross a cam into

790
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:46,078
something that's terpy and still retain

791
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:49,980
those Terps and get like a a chem a

792
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,320
layered chem flake flavored and so I

793
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,920
think that's really you know what a lot

794
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:59,039
of people that are really into Terps are

795
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,858
looking for is like you know you get

796
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,800
that layered flavor flavor where you're

797
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:07,259
getting multiple different uh different

798
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,420
flavors rivers in one hit where you

799
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,300
could taste chem you could taste Pine

800
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:15,300
you could taste fruit or whatever it is

801
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,820
and so that's what makes a lot of these

802
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,160
uh strains really unique

803
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,440
yeah it sounds delicious doesn't it well

804
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,420
that was a bit of a cheeky segue

805
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,179
question because as I'm sure you're

806
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,579
pretty well aware star dog has really

807
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:31,440
become a major player in the UK scene

808
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:33,660
you know it's almost like it's the new

809
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,220
cheese in a sense I guess I'm just sort

810
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,259
of wondering like how does it feel to

811
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,819
have a strain that's become that

812
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,619
critically acclaimed like there are

813
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,420
people who have had popular strains but

814
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:45,539
you know when you're at that point it's

815
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:49,440
really to a different magnitude isn't it

816
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:51,420
it's kind of funny because like uh you

817
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,300

821
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:04,439
and so you know it's really uh the the

822
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,139
people of the UK that's kind of blown

823
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,559
that up you know uh some you know

824
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:12,239

825
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,440
seeds and some

826
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:18,838

828
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:24,480
cutting that was over there it's

829

someone's name I'm trying to it's it's a

830
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,820
particular type of uh cutting stuff yeah

831
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,940
so you know

832
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,039
um yeah I mean yeah I did I just finding

833
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,139
them it's it's amazing you know I mean

834
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,940
it's just it's just unbelievable you

835
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:41,039
know because you know it's just

836
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,039
something that just you know took a life

837
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,320
of its own you know like it's it it's

838
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:49,259
you know who you know

839
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,900
it's just really hard to explain because

840
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:55,440
you know I I didn't really have anything

841
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:58,380
personally to do with that you know like

842
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,139
you know I sold the seeds and somehow

843
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,858
they got into the hands of someone over

844
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:07,379
there and it just took a life of its own

845
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:10,139
it just you know and I know this has

846
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,660
been going on for quite some time so at

847
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:16,319
least five or six years now you know

848
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:19,259
I've been hearing this and uh that you

849
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,980
know the the star dog has just you know

850
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:25,619
taking over has taken over the cheese as

851
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,179
as the most you know popular commercial

852
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,400
strain

853
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:31,739
um I get a lot of people you know

854
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,079
telling me how good it is and I have a

855
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:37,139
lot of people telling me how bad it is

856
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,579
because it's being so commercially grown

857
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:40,618
so

858
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:42,780
um and and some of it they don't even

859
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,820
know if it's really the star dog or

860
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,519
someone just putting the name store the

861
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,880
dog on it so

862
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:53,820
um yeah yeah like I said it's just it's

863
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,700
just amazing because it's nothing that I

864
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:59,760
that I can I can't take claim to that

865
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:02,338
because some someone someone else did

866
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,820
that and you know just going back to

867
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:08,699
when something's that good that it just

868
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,579
takes its life of its own I can't really

869
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:13,618
say anything else other than that so you

870
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:16,260
get some Kudos I think but I quickly

871
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,240
Googled the the name of it and I think

872
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,880
it's called Manny's cut

873
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,858
man yeah the man he's cut correct yeah

874
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,740
the man he's caught right so that's one

875
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:27,480
of the more popular uh I think that's

876
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:29,699
the most popular one I've heard is the

877
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,199
mayonnaise cut so I'm not familiar with

878
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:33,719
the man he's cut right I don't know

879
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,819
anything about it but

880
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:37,679
um yeah it's made a name for itself man

881
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,539
whoever man he is

882
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,639
yeah I mean hopefully if you have a head

883
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:44,159
back someone will have a bag waiting for

884
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:46,559
you but um onto another sort of

885
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,199
international based question

886
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:52,920
a few different fans actually asked me

887
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,838
to try to find out from you what's uh

888
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,180
the can you give us the lowdown on the

889
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:59,159
top dog Thailand Endeavor you know I

890
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:00,838
think people have been following it and

891
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:03,000
are like oh this seems very interesting

892
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:06,059
like what's the backstory behind all of

893
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,699
that yeah well you know

894
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:11,820
um yeah I mean we're really interested

895
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:14,338
I've always been really interested in in

896
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,700
in Thai weed you know I had and I told

897
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:20,820
you the story of my experience with you

898
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:24,960
know earlier and so I mean that's always

899
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:27,240
kind of stuck with me you know so

900
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,179
um you know once we you know I started

901
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:34,259
seeing that you know they were you know

902
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:35,460
starting a a medical thing and

903
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,280
um

904
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,039
uh you know they were you know so you

905
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,099
know we we decided you know that we were

906
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:46,440
you know wanted to you know to try to uh

907
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,579
get more information and they actually

908
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,320
had a um

909
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:58,740
uh I'm trying to think the name of it

910
00:41:52,320 --> 00:42:00,300
now but they had uh uh a CBD uh show in

911
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:03,000
in Bangkok

912
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,359
and so you know we decided to to go

913
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,139
there and and check it out you know and

914
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:12,838
and you know make new contacts and and

915
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:16,078
and so um

916
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:19,739
a friend of mine me and a friend of mine

917
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:22,920
um he's a panther grew lion and he was

918
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:26,639
the one that actually uh gave me the uh

919
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,338
that Scentsy star cut so um you know we

920
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,980
decided to uh you know take a trip over

921
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:33,719
there and you know get our feet wet and

922
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,900
see what you know see if we could get

923
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,480
into the market somehow and so we went

924
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,940
over there and we were able to you know

925
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,179
establish some contacts you know start

926
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:48,420
getting some information and everything

927
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:50,819
and then my friend stayed over there for

928
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,740
he stayed over there for a few months

929
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,700
actually

930
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:57,419
and so

931
00:42:53,699 --> 00:43:01,799
um he wound up going up uh into Chiang

932
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:04,980
Mai and visited a few farms and grows

933
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:09,539
and stuff and started collecting seed

934
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:12,420
and so really uh you know we decided

935
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:13,739
that you know we wanted to you know try

936
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,980
to

937
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:21,000
um on one end tries to start collecting

938
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:24,900
Landry seed and try to start exploring

939
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,559
some of the mythical uh Thai stick

940
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:31,380
strains that have been you know uh

941
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:34,679
talked about and you know the ones that

942
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,480
I have experienced from personal uh you

943
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,399
know uh

944
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,119
from from myself

945
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,519
um experience personal experience so you

946
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,099
know we want to try to find some of

947
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:50,099
these strains and you know bring them

948
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:53,338
you know back to uh you know the

949
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:55,920
Forefront and because these things were

950
00:43:53,338 --> 00:44:00,480
you know very they have a place in

951
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,800
history and and for a reason and uh so

952
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,480
you know a lot of that you know we're

953
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,060
finding out a lot of different things

954
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,699
about you know the Thai stick a lot of

955
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:14,219
it had to do with the curing process and

956
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:17,098
and stuff like that so uh you know as

957
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:18,299
well as long with the strain so yeah we

958
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:21,180
want to

959
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,460
um yeah so that was one end of it is we

960
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:26,578
wanted to you know bring back the lore

961
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:29,579
of the indigenous you know land race

962
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:32,160
strains and then on the other hand we

963
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:33,980
wanted to bring them up to speed with

964
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:38,838
modern technology

965
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:41,699
and uh you know from what you know we

966
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:43,219
experienced uh there seems to be a lot

967
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:45,960
of the Dutch

968
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:49,139
seed companies are trying to make

969
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,220
influence over there and

970
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:52,559
um

971
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:55,199
we think that we're better we know that

972
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:58,619
we're better than a Dutch and so we want

973
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:01,799
to make sure that uh Thailand is going

974
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:05,280
to be having you know the best strains

975
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,339
available from America and

976
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,619
um and not get bamboozled by the Dutch

977
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,358
because they're being targeted because

978
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,240
they're an upstart

979
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:18,299
an upstart country they don't know the

980
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:21,299
difference between uh a lot of this

981
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:24,539
stuff so we want to educate them and we

982
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,920
and we also you know uh we want to bring

983
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:30,480
you know

984
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:36,000
um you know uh modern medical

985
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:39,000
um standards there and as in testing and

986
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,059
um and and and and all of that you know

987
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,539
because um you know they they want to

988
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:47,338
um you know have a medical CBD program

989
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:50,699
over there

990
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:53,519
um they're they're having problems with

991
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:56,639
um with strains over there you know a

992
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,280
lot of them a lot of the streams uh

993
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:03,659
can't grow well over there uh they're

994
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:07,920
not testing for CBD uh High you know a

995
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:09,420
lot of them are um got uh THC in them so

996
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,300
you know there's there's you know

997
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,119
there's a a lot of stuff that you know

998
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:20,160
so um they're really on the ground level

999
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:22,980
of and so um you know they they need uh

1000
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:26,639
to be shown you know the right way and

1001
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:30,659
hopefully you know we can um help

1002
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:33,480
influence them to uh you know you know

1003
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:36,779
to do things uh in the correct way

1004
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,440
because I think uh you know there's you

1005
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:42,060
know

1006
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,300
um uh a huge a huge um possible you know

1007
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:47,759
they you know uh

1008
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:50,400
of Asia you know because no one no one

1009
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,220
in Asia is really you know taking the

1010
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,559
Forefront for medical over there I know

1011
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:59,338
that China has some type of thing going

1012
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:05,338
on but um you know in Asia itself I mean

1013
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:08,519
uh Korea South Korea uh Japan uh you

1014
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:11,460
know that there's uh you know a lot of

1015
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:15,059
neighboring countries and so I you know

1016
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:18,679
I see you know uh the prospect of uh you

1017
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:22,199
know uh of a lot of a good you know uh

1018
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:25,379
economy they have um uh a lot of

1019
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:27,719
tourists over there uh that you know so

1020
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,660
you know they're talking about a future

1021
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:33,000
uh letting tourists bike you know

1022
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:37,379
cannabis or you know so

1023
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,920
uh you know I see uh you know a lot of

1024
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:43,619
uh future prospects there possibly so we

1025
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,420
we want to we want to get in on on the

1026
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:48,980
ground score on some of that stuff

1027
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:51,720
hopefully and have some influence uh

1028
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:54,179
around the world

1029
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,439
yeah nice nice that's a good idea I

1030
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:57,000
guess I never really thought about the

1031
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,220
Dutch getting into those markets but it

1032
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,318
makes sense that there would be in there

1033
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:03,659
nice and early trying to get that jumped

1034
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:07,739
the gun on people well you know the

1035
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:10,799
funny thing was I S uh we sat in on a

1036
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:13,219
um you know they did a discussion and

1037
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,200
stuff uh presentation

1038
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:19,559
and they showed like all their target

1039
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:21,059
markets around the world and the funny

1040
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,960
thing was

1041
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:27,299
the number one target market

1042
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,000
was excluded

1043
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,640
which is America

1044
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
why wouldn't you want to Target America

1045
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:38,818
because you're Irrelevant in the market

1046
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,358
as it is now as most

1047
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:45,779
you know Dutch companies are so now I

1048
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:48,480
mean so now they have to go into all

1049
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,579
these upstart countries to where they

1050
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,400
don't know any better

1051
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:56,220
yeah it's interesting do you think that

1052
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,139
it was purely just the change in laws

1053
00:48:56,219 --> 00:49:00,838
which led to sort of the decline of

1054
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:03,118
Amsterdam or do you think that it's

1055
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,440
maybe just you know more factors than

1056
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,559
just that

1057
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,900
uh that's part of it but I don't think I

1058
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:12,779
mean they're they're they're breeding

1059
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:16,200
techniques and and knowledge were you

1060
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:20,460
know uh very bad I mean they were

1061
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:24,299
breeding for all the wrong things early

1062
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:27,858
finishers heavy yielders

1063
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,859
orange hairs

1064
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:34,559
you know so after years and years of

1065
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:37,079
bottlenecking and crossing the same

1066
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:42,380
things into the same things into the

1067
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,380
same things you get what you got today

1068
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,358
yeah certainly I think it's um it's a

1069
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,219
tough situation if you're growing with

1070
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:51,659
Amsterdam genetics and hoping to get a

1071
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:53,939
good outcome

1072
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:56,639
well at one time they were the best in

1073
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:00,480
the world you know I mean if you go back

1074
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:04,618
to you know the the the the the late

1075
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:10,440
novel days you know and uh and and I say

1076
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:14,160
you know uh the late 80s 88 89 90 uh and

1077
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,099
then going into the Scentsy seed and

1078
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:20,639
they were probably good up until about

1079
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:24,900
95. anything uh from Scentsy seeds that

1080
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:27,059
had the original cellophane card pack it

1081
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,700
was a cell it was the see-through

1082
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:31,739
cellophane with just a card in it and

1083
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,960
then you had your your you used to be

1084
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:37,139
able to get I think it was 15 or 16

1085
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:40,559
seeds that they gave you originally in

1086
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:44,039
that cellophane pack and it just had the

1087
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:46,019
card in it with the northern lights on

1088
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:50,460
it and then you would flip it around and

1089
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:53,159
and so uh and then uh probably the last

1090
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,619
the last best thing that they did was

1091
00:50:53,159 --> 00:51:00,618
the Jack Herrera the original Jack

1092
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:04,980
Ferrer and uh I think that was what like

1093
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:07,980
94.95 somewhere in the mid 90s and that

1094
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:10,079
was kind of after that that was it uh

1095
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:13,440
they had they changed their packaging

1096
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:16,140
shortly after that and it was the the

1097
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,358
product was never the same I had a

1098
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,639
friend that went out and got some of the

1099
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:24,480
original Jack Carrera in the cellophane

1100
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:27,480
pack and he brought it back and he he

1101
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:31,139
grew it out and I remember it was like a

1102
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:34,619
77 Day plant but it used to I mean the

1103
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:36,598
top buds were your forearms it was just

1104
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:39,838
a heavy yield or it went a little bit

1105
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:42,059
longer it had a really nice

1106
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,099
um hazy tip to it you know but it was

1107
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,920
kind of it wasn't super strong or

1108
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:51,119
nothing but it was really nice like the

1109
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:53,700
original Jack Herer cut and um so I mean

1110
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,380
these guys uh once they found out it

1111
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:57,899
started to produce and they just started

1112
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,880
pumping it out and then I mean they just

1113
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,338
started over producing it and I was like

1114
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,140
whoa whoa hold on now I'm getting

1115
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:06,239
overburdened with this stuff is not

1116
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:08,639
moving anymore I was like we got to cut

1117
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,979
it out eventually you know I told them

1118
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,078
we can't do this anymore it's just not

1119
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,539
selling so they're like all right no

1120
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,339
problem we have we have the rest of the

1121
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:19,619
pack of seeds that we have I was like

1122
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:21,659
all right kill it all right so a few

1123
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:23,760
days a few years down the road I'm like

1124
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:25,558
hey why don't you you know find that

1125
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,760
pack of Jack career and get that going

1126
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:32,940
again oh I can't find it I lost it

1127
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,000
all right so at that time I was doing

1128
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,858
the seed Bay thing and getting getting

1129
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,079
the seed credit so I was like I'll get

1130
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:42,719
you another pack of the Jack Herer so I

1131
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,300
got him a the new and I got them in the

1132
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:47,639
new packaging I think it was in uh it

1133
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,260
was in the bubble in the box and all of

1134
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:51,358
that and so I give them a you know a

1135
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,099
packet of Jack Carrera and you know I'm

1136
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:56,279
looking forward to them to finishing it

1137
00:52:53,099 --> 00:53:00,000
out you know he finishes it out shows me

1138
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:04,019
the final product and it was just [ __ ]

1139
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,440
it was just so disappointing it just was

1140
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:11,159
nothing like the original it was just a

1141
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,740
stringy [ __ ] [ __ ] it was just so

1142
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:16,799
disappointing

1143
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:20,578
and just yeah I mean and really I mean

1144
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:24,720
to sum it up that's kind of you know how

1145
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:27,780
I feel about most Dutch genetics you

1146
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:30,539
know there are a few exceptions Karma

1147
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,119
and a few other guys that are that are

1148
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:36,480
out there doing the real thing but you

1149
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:39,480
know any of the old original guys are

1150
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,599
just pretty much just you know going

1151
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:45,900
through the [ __ ] you know emotions

1152
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:49,019
and just producing [ __ ] that you know

1153
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:51,960
for so for pretty much for souvenir

1154
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:54,599
purposes because they're really not

1155
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,300
worth much more than you know the

1156
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:00,960
packaging itself you know so I wouldn't

1157
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:03,359
you know I mean what what see what what

1158
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,659
what strains of greenhouse are relevant

1159
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,920
in today's uh on Instagram you know you

1160
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:11,578
can go down

1161
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:14,400
the whole list of all of them and you

1162
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:16,318
know what's relevant today and really a

1163
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,599
lot of them are offering American

1164
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:21,779
genetics now and branding themselves

1165
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:23,700
such as yeah yeah I think Bonnie's Farm

1166
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,339
have just come out with a like gelato

1167
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:29,219
wedding cake and it's like okay yeah

1168
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:31,440
yeah yeah I saw that yeah yeah well

1169
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:33,779
interesting stuff I mean to bring the

1170
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,579
focus back to the US

1171
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,800
um you know the Cannabis climate around

1172
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:40,380
the sorry the legal climate around

1173
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,780
cannabis in the U.S has been a sort of

1174
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,119
changing landscape and there's a bit of

1175
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,280
a sentiment nowadays that uh both

1176
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,500
legally and financially Californians

1177
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,140
just starting to push Growers out of the

1178
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:54,059
market and even out of the state what's

1179
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:55,980
your thoughts on the legal climate in

1180
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:57,839
the U.S and how do you feel about some

1181
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:01,639
of the newer places opening up and

1182
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,639
becoming the hot spot like say Oklahoma

1183
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,260
um well I got kind of mixed feelings on

1184
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,838
some of it because a lot of it is just

1185
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:13,559
geared towards money and corporate like

1186
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:17,400
like a California you know um if you're

1187
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:20,940
a small mom and pop operation you know

1188
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,680
uh they just make it so difficult uh for

1189
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,858
you to operate that it's just not

1190
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:30,299
feasible you know the licensing costs

1191
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:32,400
the process of getting a license uh a

1192
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,700
lot of places you have to secure a

1193
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,280
location to get a license so that means

1194
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:41,039
you're you're going to be renting out

1195
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:44,940
um a warehouse possibly for a year or

1196
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:48,960
two even before you could even start uh

1197
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:53,579
working there you know so uh the the

1198
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:56,059
court the the startup cost on on on some

1199
00:55:53,579 --> 00:56:00,180
of these it's just it's just ridiculous

1200
00:55:56,059 --> 00:56:03,960
and they have it set up uh so it favors

1201
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:06,960
uh big money incorporations

1202
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,940
um on the other hand you know you have

1203
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:13,199
States like

1204
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:15,720
um Oklahoma and Oregon where anyone with

1205
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:16,699
three thousand dollars can go and set up

1206
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:19,980
shop

1207
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:23,578
unfortunately uh there's not a lot of

1208
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:28,559
money in those States you know so

1209
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:31,380
um what's going to happen in Oklahoma is

1210
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,140
you know is the same thing that happened

1211
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:37,200
in Oregon you know once they got up into

1212
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:40,558
full speed full production then licensed

1213
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:43,558
you're gonna have ten thousand

1214
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:48,359
people that are producing and trying to

1215
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:51,540
sell weed all in the same spot and

1216
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:54,058
um how many you know as far as I know

1217
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:59,699
Oregon and

1218
00:56:54,059 --> 00:57:02,000
Oklahoma any type of tourist attraction

1219
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:08,818
um the the the

1220
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:11,639
uh household income is probably very low

1221
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:13,739
so you're really stuck in a market where

1222
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:16,139
it's over saturated

1223
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:17,899
there's not a lot of money

1224
00:57:16,139 --> 00:57:21,960
and

1225
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:24,240
everyone's fighting over the same nickel

1226
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,260
you know so

1227
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:28,919
um

1228
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:30,839
yeah I mean it's kind of [ __ ] up you

1229
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,800
know because they you know that you know

1230
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:34,500
uh

1231
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,980
the same thing in you know is is

1232
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:40,858
happening in in New Jersey now and in

1233
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:43,679
New York you know the the you know they

1234
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:44,639
say they want to open it up for you know

1235
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:46,919
um

1236
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:50,279
people that you know has been affected

1237
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,260
by the drug war and and this and that

1238
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,319
you know and then they start making up

1239
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:58,440
all these rules you know you got to be a

1240
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:01,019
resident for three years all your

1241
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,480
money's got to be in the bank for three

1242
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:07,920
years uh

1243
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:10,920
you know uh and then you got towns uh

1244
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,760
you know uh all right we got a town that

1245
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:16,920
uh we don't want we don't want uh wreck

1246
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:20,300
in our town so we're not you know we're

1247
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:23,480
not gonna allow it or we're gonna allow

1248
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:27,380
four licenses

1249
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:32,338
and you know the people with political

1250
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:36,599
connections and money and who are who or

1251
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:38,699
who knows how that licensing process is

1252
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:41,700
going to be how how that's going to go

1253
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:45,719
down and so

1254
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:49,019
um yeah so a lot of a lot of people uh

1255
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:51,838
get get get shut out and you know even

1256
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:56,039
you know someone like myself

1257
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:59,818
and who some may say has got some type

1258
00:58:56,039 --> 00:59:02,460
of reputation or or whatever you may

1259
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:05,159
think in the game it really doesn't mean

1260
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,920
[ __ ] to a lot of these people you know

1261
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:09,358
you know what I mean because uh you know

1262
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,780
a lot of these people are only

1263
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:16,259
interested in in uh these are corporate

1264
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:18,740
people uh you know in their only the

1265
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:21,599
only thing they had to do is count money

1266
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:26,279
and you know the the the corporate

1267
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:29,338
structure is hey if we made 10 uh 10

1268
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,460
million this year and we only make eight

1269
00:59:29,338 --> 00:59:37,739
million next year Well we lost 2 million

1270
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:42,358
in in their eyes so you know uh I see it

1271
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:45,539
as more of a commodity you know and so

1272
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:47,759
um yeah it's really gonna be interesting

1273
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:50,759
on how you know

1274
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:55,140
um this all plays out because the way

1275
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:57,960
that I see it is if you can't get in now

1276
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:59,879
you ain't gonna get in later you know

1277
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,000
and that's kind of like what's happened

1278
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:05,338
here in Colorado because

1279
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,460
um in the early days

1280
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:11,578
of medical uh just anyone could have

1281
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:13,079
just gotten set up anywhere you know and

1282
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:15,480
then

1283
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:17,579
you know they they uh you know they

1284
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,119
brought wreck down and you know they

1285
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:23,818
they uh they made a lot of rules and

1286
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,700
they forced a lot of people out for

1287
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:30,719
different reasons you know uh and then

1288
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:34,618
they can do it through zoning and

1289
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:37,199
through you know if you have uh a record

1290
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:40,680
and there's just a lot of these

1291
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:45,239
different things you know that that they

1292
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:48,358
do to uh to to make it make it you know

1293
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:51,479
virtually impossible for a small time

1294
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:55,019
operator to to get into it you know so

1295
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:57,780
it's you know really uh

1296
01:00:55,019 --> 01:01:01,259
geared towards Big Money a lot of these

1297
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:03,599
states seen and and those are the states

1298
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:05,880
that that have the money you know that

1299
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:09,000
you will be able to make you know some

1300
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:12,900
type of a profit you know I mean but you

1301
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:16,440
know the the the startup costs are in

1302
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:20,400
the millions you know and you know we we

1303
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:23,159
are working class people most of us and

1304
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,099
you know if we had millions of dollars

1305
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:29,159
quite frankly we wouldn't be who we are

1306
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:33,420
now you know what I mean so you know

1307
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:38,159
there's a you know there's a big Gap in

1308
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:43,200
between between you know uh reality and

1309
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:47,219
perception and uh you know what people

1310
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:49,379
think the market is is going to be

1311
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:52,139
yeah hugely

1312
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:54,838
so a sentiment I've heard expressed a

1313
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:56,940
little bit more recently is that there's

1314
01:01:54,838 --> 01:02:00,179
a sort of growing suspicion that

1315
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:02,760
National legalization may not be too far

1316
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:04,858
off the future do you see that being a

1317
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,920
possibility

1318
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:10,619
well you know it's really politics and

1319
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,680
you know unfortunately politics in

1320
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:18,298
America is really [ __ ] up right now

1321
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:20,818
and you know it's really uh kind of like

1322
01:02:18,298 --> 01:02:22,318
two parties the Democrats and the

1323
01:02:20,818 --> 01:02:25,440
Republicans

1324
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:30,199
and you know most of the Republicans

1325
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:34,740
don't favor cannabis legalization

1326
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:37,798
most of the states that aren't legal or

1327
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:41,219
run by Republicans

1328
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:42,298
with that being said our president is a

1329
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:43,739
Democrat

1330
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:47,699
and

1331
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:50,639
at first it seemed like he was signaling

1332
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:53,939
towards legalization

1333
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:56,039
and now it seems like he's signaling

1334
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,619
against

1335
01:02:56,039 --> 01:03:02,818
Federal legalization

1336
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:05,599
and so you know it's kind of caught in

1337
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:09,420
the middle because originally

1338
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:13,619
the drug war was started by executive

1339
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:17,159
order by Richard Nixon the president

1340
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:20,760
and it could be ended by executive order

1341
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:23,940
by the President Biden if you wanted to

1342
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:27,900
but no one seems and it could have been

1343
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:31,559
done by every other president in between

1344
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:34,318
and so uh

1345
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:38,059
you know I don't see them doing it

1346
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:40,380
unless it's beneficial for them somehow

1347
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:43,920
and uh

1348
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:48,780
for them to just keep things at status

1349
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:51,838
quo kind of you know kind of protects

1350
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:55,200
them and it's kind of like the same kind

1351
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:58,139
of issue of of the immigration issue

1352
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:00,480
that we have here where they just it's

1353
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:02,219
[ __ ] up but they don't want to they

1354
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,798
don't want to fix it they just want to

1355
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:06,239
keep it the way that it is

1356
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:07,199
so

1357
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:10,019
um

1358
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:12,659
yeah and then you know go and then the

1359
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:15,659
only other way to change it is by an act

1360
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:17,399
of Congress so if you want to do it by

1361
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:21,659
act of Congress then you need

1362
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,160
Republicans to get on board and you know

1363
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:27,500
the

1364
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:30,899
the politics in this country are so

1365
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:33,838
polarizing that it's just you know it's

1366
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:36,960
like living in two different worlds

1367
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:38,519
yeah it feels very tense very polarized

1368
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,760
at the moment doesn't it

1369
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:44,818
so I just wanted to ask you a question

1370
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,520
I'd love to ask all guests what would be

1371
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:50,099
some advice you would give to someone

1372
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:52,980
who's maybe hoping to start breeding

1373
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:54,599
maybe now maybe down the track what do

1374
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:56,780
you think some good advice you'd give to

1375
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,780
someone

1376
01:04:57,298 --> 01:05:01,440
um is try to do something original you

1377
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:02,099
know

1378
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,440
um

1379
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:07,798
you know you can't really you got to

1380
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:10,920
make your own way and not really ride

1381
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:15,000
off the coattails of other people's

1382
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:18,180
success which you can in in a certain

1383
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,818
way you know if you do it the right way

1384
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:24,298
but you want to do it in a way of

1385
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:26,940
creating something new not copying what

1386
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:29,880
something old so you could take

1387
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:32,039
something that's popular and new and

1388
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,380
cross it into something that's totally

1389
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:36,420
different and possibly come up with

1390
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:39,960
something uh

1391
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:42,599
so uh yeah I mean that's really you know

1392
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:45,659
really the thing is just to try to be

1393
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:48,780
original you know and you know like I

1394
01:05:45,659 --> 01:05:51,118
say your our past is our future and a

1395
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:55,140
lot of people only look at the status

1396
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:57,000
quo of what's popular today you know I'm

1397
01:05:55,139 --> 01:06:00,118
the kind of guy that want to go back

1398
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,719
into land races go back to the original

1399
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:06,780
start of things and start from there you

1400
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:09,179
know start over again or use that into

1401
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:12,900
some of the stuff that into some of the

1402
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:17,338
new modern stuff you know the key is to

1403
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:20,880
create new and not really try to uh

1404
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:22,920
replicate what is yeah that's some great

1405
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,660
advice and I mean you just reference

1406
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,579
wanting to dig into some land right

1407
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:29,279
stuff I noticed on your Instagram you'd

1408
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:31,559
post some Afghani seeds recently and it

1409
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,539
made me wonder are these some of the

1410
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:35,220
stocks you might be looking to work with

1411
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:37,140
and what sort of land races in general

1412
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:40,019
would you want to work with

1413
01:06:37,139 --> 01:06:41,159
yeah well right now there seems to be a

1414
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:45,179
big

1415
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:47,818
um search for uh roadkill skunk you know

1416
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:49,980
so you know in my opinion you know

1417
01:06:47,818 --> 01:06:53,759
that's going to be found in some Afghan

1418
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:56,818
strains uh so you know looking back on

1419
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:59,520
the history of it all uh yeah that's

1420
01:06:56,818 --> 01:07:01,558
where I think you really gotta start you

1421
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:03,900
know so you know

1422
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:07,200
um really you know just like you know

1423
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:12,240
like I was saying you know about the HP

1424
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:15,480
13 and not land right restrained uh yeah

1425
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:18,659
you have to you have to go out and you

1426
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:21,179
have to uh search for stuff you have to

1427
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:23,699
try new stuff

1428
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:26,460
um you know you gotta you know do stuff

1429
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:29,038
that people aren't doing and that's how

1430
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:31,318
you find stuff that's special and unique

1431
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:34,980
you know you you know you find something

1432
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:37,739
that's different and you know uh you

1433
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:39,780
just you know you you you start you

1434
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:43,038
start from there and start working off

1435
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:46,260
of that it it's a step-by-step process

1436
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:49,319
and you know really

1437
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:52,920
um you know with the amount of land race

1438
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:57,259
stuff that's available today well you

1439
01:07:52,920 --> 01:08:01,260
know there's Indian stuff uh Hindu Kush

1440
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:03,780
uh Afghan you know and that's really you

1441
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:06,539
know the base of you know all of the

1442
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:09,240
genetics that we have today you know is

1443
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:11,460
this that people you know they're that

1444
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:14,159
they're too lazy they don't want to put

1445
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:17,698
in the work you know a lot of it takes a

1446
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:20,099
lot of time and a lot of effort a lot of

1447
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:22,318
a lot of time you're you're you you know

1448
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:25,500
you're you're wasting your time a lot of

1449
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,359
wasted time you know so you know people

1450
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,420
don't want to do that they just want to

1451
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:32,880
do what's easiest for them and just it's

1452
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,159
easier to rip off someone else's stuff

1453
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,699
and do you know do some some kind of

1454
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:41,278
cross like that and uh so you know

1455
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:44,759
that's really kind of what separates you

1456
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:47,160
know people that lead you know uh

1457
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:49,259
compared to people that follow you know

1458
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:50,338
if you're if you're a leader you're

1459
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:53,219
going to go out there and you're going

1460
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:55,019
to find your own stuff you know one way

1461
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:57,779
or the other you know there's so much

1462
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:01,259
stuff out there you know you just got to

1463
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:03,239
go out there and find it and um and yeah

1464
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:05,579
and just grow it you know I tell people

1465
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:07,198
to pop seeds you know I mean pop keep

1466
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:10,679
pop and seeds you know because that's

1467
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:14,039
where the next best clone is going to be

1468
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:15,539
found obviously you know and where is

1469
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:17,579
that kind of where is that seed gonna

1470
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:20,338
come from well that could become from

1471
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:21,318
anywhere so you know that's that's

1472
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:24,778
that's

1473
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:27,359
the joy and the anticipation that you

1474
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:30,060
get when you pop something new because

1475
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,219
you want to see you know what what it is

1476
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,380
you know and as in especially if you

1477
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:36,960
made it yourself you know then it you

1478
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:39,539
know then then you have that much more

1479
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,819
tried to put into it you know but if

1480
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:44,399
you're just really searching for

1481
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:49,380
something you know you just got to try

1482
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:50,399
to you know come up with a game plan and

1483
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:53,699
just

1484
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:56,039
um you know have an idea on you know

1485
01:09:53,698 --> 01:09:58,019
what you want to do and kind of like

1486
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:59,460
what I'm saying about this roadkill

1487
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:02,940
skunk stuff

1488
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:05,300
for me you know I'm searching for it and

1489
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:09,899
you know I'm just gonna have to try

1490
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:12,440
popping different land race afghanis you

1491
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:16,259
know until I can find something that's

1492
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:19,738
similar you know you may find the next

1493
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:21,179
chem something Fury or you don't know

1494
01:10:19,738 --> 01:10:23,459
what could come out of some of this

1495
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:26,279
stuff because that you know that's been

1496
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:28,800
the foundation for all this stuff that

1497
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:32,460
we've we've we've had for a long time

1498
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,380
now you know there's been a a lot of

1499
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:39,899
um uh

1500
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:42,840
um unstable situations over there so the

1501
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:45,719
um you know I don't know you know

1502
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:49,500
um you know how you know that's affected

1503
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:52,079
you know uh indigenous uh farmer

1504
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:56,158
generational farmers who who

1505
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:58,198
traditionally farm from seed crop the

1506
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:59,819
seed crop the seed crop the seed crop

1507
01:10:58,198 --> 01:11:02,939
and produce hash

1508
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:06,658
from those you know from that stuff and

1509
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:09,419
that hash actually is what uh provides

1510
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:13,019
for their family so you know there was

1511
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:15,239
always great family pride in the Pro in

1512
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:18,179
the product in production in a product

1513
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:21,959
that they would bring out because that's

1514
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:23,640
what kept their family alive so it was

1515
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,399
something that was always kept in the

1516
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:29,400
family generation after generation so

1517
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:32,579
after you break that cycle you know

1518
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:35,759
where are you then so you know after all

1519
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:38,279
the you know the fighting and and and

1520
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,980
all this stuff throughout the the years

1521
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:42,960
you know um you just got to think to

1522
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:44,879
yourself you know how much has that

1523
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:49,079
affected some of those indigenous

1524
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:52,140
strains and and then and and and and has

1525
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:54,059
some of them been lost forever and and a

1526
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,280
lot of that can just you know you can

1527
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:59,039
just look back at the seed for I mean

1528
01:11:56,279 --> 01:12:00,960
the Hass production and how that is

1529
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,779
because that's how that I mean that's

1530
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,420
what all of that at the end you know

1531
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:08,158
produces the hash and Afghanistan was

1532
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,460
always known as the one of the best

1533
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:13,619
house producing countries in the world

1534
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:17,520
and you know it it became that into

1535
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:19,079
becoming just a commercial grade so you

1536
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,620
know there's a lot you know unless

1537
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:26,158
you're you know on on the ground and got

1538
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:28,439
intimate knowledge of the region and you

1539
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:30,839
know and stuff like that you know um

1540
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:33,719
which people do you know there's a lot

1541
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:37,140
of English people that are able to you

1542
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:39,420
know better Afghani and Muslim and

1543
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:42,000
they're able to you know travel back and

1544
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:44,279
forth to the country to the Homeland

1545
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,198
where if you and I went there and

1546
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:49,920
they've seen our white asses they would

1547
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:52,079
behead us so uh you know uh for us

1548
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,899
traveling into those regions would be

1549
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:56,340
you know uh very dangerous and you know

1550
01:12:54,899 --> 01:13:00,179
and something that I wouldn't wouldn't

1551
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:03,840
want to do you know but you know I I

1552
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:07,020
believe that you know those genetics are

1553
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:09,239
uh possibly still out there but you

1554
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:11,820
gotta go out there and get them

1555
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:13,619
yeah comprehensive answer there and

1556
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:15,719
while we're on the topic of you know

1557
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:18,119
advocating for popping seeds which we

1558
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:20,640
always do I'd like to know how many

1559
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:22,260
seeds do you pop when you're looking to

1560
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,820
search through a line to try to figure

1561
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:30,960
out what's inside it as many as possible

1562
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:31,859
I mean uh you know it's kind of hard you

1563
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,760
know

1564
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:36,059
um

1565
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:41,640
you know when you're just working you

1566
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:44,940
know uh not in a commercial facility

1567
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:47,340
so uh you know you gotta pick and choose

1568
01:13:44,939 --> 01:13:50,939
you know kind of

1569
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:53,480
um the direction on what projects you

1570
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:58,439
you want to do

1571
01:13:53,479 --> 01:14:01,979
uh space is always a concern uh because

1572
01:13:58,439 --> 01:14:04,500
I mean obviously uh

1573
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:08,158
you know you just can't you know this is

1574
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:10,560
not a enough room for all plants but um

1575
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:12,658
like right now

1576
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:18,600
um I'm popping

1577
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:21,960
um some Sour Diesel bx3 f2s and I think

1578
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:25,800
I got about 20 of them going right now

1579
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:28,800
and so I mean ideally I would like to do

1580
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:33,239
a lot more than 20 but that's probably

1581
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:35,880
about the limit that I could do in uh in

1582
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:38,939
in the confines of the space that I'm

1583
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:41,520
working working with now

1584
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:45,059
um you know when we um are doing these

1585
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:49,920
big Fino seed hunts in in the warehouse

1586
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:53,219
you know we're popping 200 a hundred you

1587
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:57,359
know uh we're doing a big

1588
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:59,579
um big seed pops and Fino hunts and you

1589
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:03,599
know like I explained earlier most of

1590
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:06,920
that is for you know for hash and and

1591
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:10,199
for flower production so you know

1592
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:11,819
luckily I'm able to

1593
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:14,460
um

1594
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:18,179
um work with some of those selections

1595
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:21,060
that you know that we're working uh out

1596
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:22,440
of the um Warehouse with

1597
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:25,199
but

1598
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:28,259
um me personally you know uh when I'm

1599
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:31,919
doing the seed thing like I explained

1600
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:34,320
earlier I'm doing about 20 of those uh

1601
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,179
so what I'll probably wind up doing is

1602
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:39,779
running them

1603
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:42,658
um selecting uh uh a male or two

1604
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:46,559
possibly and then

1605
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:47,819
um breeding them I would cross them and

1606
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,080
then I would

1607
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:54,539
um find the um

1608
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:57,658
the the Fino that I thought best

1609
01:15:54,539 --> 01:16:00,359
resembled the sour diesel

1610
01:15:57,658 --> 01:16:02,579
and then those would be my next

1611
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:05,339
generation of seeds that I would work

1612
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:07,800
with yeah what a great answer you you

1613
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:09,600
put in many of the blanks I had there a

1614
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,279
question we got from one of our

1615
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,560
listeners is can you tell us a little

1616
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:16,279
bit about the bubble gum chem that you

1617
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:20,520
used to have and have used in the past

1618
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:25,319
yeah uh the the bubble gum cam uh

1619
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:28,020
originally was a tray dog bubble gum so

1620
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:28,619
um that was the original cross

1621
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:32,699
um

1622
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:35,039
I had gotten the bubble gum cutting

1623
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:38,158
I don't even remember where I originally

1624
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:42,738
got it from but yeah it was definitely

1625
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:46,079
the real deal bubble gum uh fruity uh

1626
01:16:42,738 --> 01:16:46,738
really uh crystally

1627
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:51,600
um

1628
01:16:46,738 --> 01:16:53,639
yeah it it was it was it was nice I uh I

1629
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,940
brought it out here

1630
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:59,400
um a friend of mine motive

1631
01:16:56,939 --> 01:17:02,279
um I gave him some seeds and he did some

1632
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:05,819
F2 work with it he gave me some of those

1633
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:09,300
seeds back which I uh which I sold some

1634
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:11,719
of them and yeah

1635
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:14,520
um I haven't really done much other than

1636
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:15,539
other than that with the with the bubble

1637
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,460
gum cam

1638
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:20,640
that makes sense because I do remember

1639
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:23,340
seeing some of those f2s on his page as

1640
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,380
well okay so it all ties together yeah

1641
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:28,020
and it wasn't really a stream that I

1642
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:29,579
really planned on working you know it

1643
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:32,340
was like one of the things where I'd

1644
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:35,158
explained earlier where I'd gotten the

1645
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:39,119
the the cutting and I just wanted to

1646
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:41,698
make a a a cross with it and I pretty

1647
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:45,300
much that's what I did with it and and

1648
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:47,460
and that's and and so that's what I do a

1649
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:52,020
lot of times whereas

1650
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:56,219
a lot of times I will have a breeding

1651
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:59,219
um direction that I'm going with so to

1652
01:17:56,219 --> 01:18:02,100
speak with like the sour diesel like I

1653
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:05,640
explained but if I have a sour diesel

1654
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:08,520
male that I'm using to further that line

1655
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:11,940
and then I have a bunch of Clone onlys

1656
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:15,239
that I have ready to flower I'll throw

1657
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:18,779
the Clone only in with that with that

1658
01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:22,319
breeding and do a one-time breeding with

1659
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:23,759
that and so sometimes those breedings

1660
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:25,979
are

1661
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,900
um you know they're just one-time deals

1662
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:31,979
kind of like what you're talking about

1663
01:18:27,899 --> 01:18:35,099
the OG skunk or or something like that

1664
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:38,459
it was nothing that I really kind of

1665
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:42,239
um was going to further it was kind of a

1666
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:44,819
pollen shock one time deal and a lot of

1667
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,979
times the uh some of these things uh

1668
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:48,599
take a life of their own and sometimes

1669
01:18:46,979 --> 01:18:52,678
people find find some really special

1670
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:55,320
things on some in some of them and

1671
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:57,420
um yeah you know you know it was just

1672
01:18:55,319 --> 01:19:00,238
something that you know I did at the

1673
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:03,060
time and there was nothing that I really

1674
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:05,819
intended to work any further than what

1675
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:08,600
it was uh kind of like what Bodhi does

1676
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:12,479
he does a lot of one time pollen Chucks

1677
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:15,960
and so you know I I I I do some of that

1678
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:20,099
stuff but then on the other hand I do do

1679
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:22,859
a directional uh line breeding in in in

1680
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,840
a place where I want to go so it's a

1681
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:28,799
little bit of a combination of the both

1682
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:31,679
that that the way I do that and so would

1683
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:36,179
you ever consider doing any feminized

1684
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:38,100
braiding uh I mean I've kind of thought

1685
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:42,420
about it and

1686
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:44,640
you know and really getting back to the

1687
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,079
initial reason why I started breeding

1688
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:49,140
was for

1689
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,519
preservation so

1690
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:53,579
you know you can't really have

1691
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:57,120
preservation and

1692
01:19:53,579 --> 01:20:00,479
um without a male I mean you can I guess

1693
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:04,079
go from S1 to S you know keep asking all

1694
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:07,158
the way up but for me it's always been

1695
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:11,880
about the

1696
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:14,479
Evolution I guess of of the plant itself

1697
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:17,420
into

1698
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:22,619
breeding that's going to

1699
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:25,800
further the genetic pool uh

1700
01:20:22,619 --> 01:20:29,519
in time if you know it kind of like

1701
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:33,179
bettering each you're trying to do

1702
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:36,000
something better each time so in theory

1703
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:37,980
over a period of time you should have

1704
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,880
something that's

1705
01:20:37,979 --> 01:20:46,379
you know that that that's evolved into

1706
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:48,840
a superior product so to speak you know

1707
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,520
and I guess I guess that would really we

1708
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,920
we

1709
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:56,460
really be talking genetic genetically

1710
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:58,500
you know where we're over a period of

1711
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,960
time that that yeah you would have

1712
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:04,380
something that would be superior

1713
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,760
yeah sure so something I forgot to ask

1714
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,500
you earlier but I would be really

1715
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,960
interested in your perspective on was

1716
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,640
what was your first impression of OG

1717
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,619
like I'm imagining you were probably

1718
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:16,199
growing cam at the time and then all of

1719
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:18,179
a sudden OG came out you know did that

1720
01:21:16,198 --> 01:21:20,698
sort of change the game for you or was

1721
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:23,520
it still business as usual

1722
01:21:20,698 --> 01:21:27,299
uh well it was kind of business as usual

1723
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:29,460
for for us because uh it wasn't readily

1724
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,400
available I mean it was something I

1725
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:34,560
could definitely appreciated and wanted

1726
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:37,500
but yeah I mean we just didn't we didn't

1727
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,840
have access to it you know I think like

1728
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,819
the first time I was able to get it I

1729
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,579
was able to get like a ounce or

1730
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:47,460
something like that you know it was

1731
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:50,698
really tightly held like anything really

1732
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:53,100
good back in the day and to really get

1733
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:55,738
like full General access to something

1734
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:58,440
like that was just you know kind of

1735
01:21:55,738 --> 01:21:59,759
impossible because it was just locked

1736
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:03,059
you know it was just held down and

1737
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:06,659
locked down so so tightly that I just

1738
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:10,020
would wasn't you know wasn't readily

1739
01:22:06,658 --> 01:22:12,539
available but you know I I mean as a

1740
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:15,719
connoisseur I thought it was amazing you

1741
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:17,880
know and uh yeah give me give me more of

1742
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:20,520
it give me more of it so

1743
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,100
and it makes me sort of wander on that

1744
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,920
same sort of vein before you guys had

1745
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:28,020
chem dog what in your opinion was the

1746
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,239
best smoke on the East Coast

1747
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:33,719
yeah I mean you you know we're really

1748
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:36,899
kind of you know going back into there

1749
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:40,140
wasn't really a lot of names

1750
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:42,539
strange back then you know like anything

1751
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:45,360
that you would get from Amsterdam would

1752
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:49,800
be considered something super exotic

1753
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:54,559
early pearls the early skunks

1754
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:58,679
uh the silver pearls uh the I forget

1755
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:01,320
there was a couple other ones and

1756
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:03,600
um yeah so I mean back then we thought

1757
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:05,399
that was the [ __ ] is it because we just

1758
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,440
you know we just never saw something

1759
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:11,299
like that before so it was really

1760
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:15,539
anything that was kind bud or exotic or

1761
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:18,119
from Amsterdam or yeah cents a million

1762
01:23:15,539 --> 01:23:20,880
you know I mean there's a whole bunch of

1763
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:24,119
different things that were around but

1764
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:26,520
not one particular thing that I could be

1765
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:28,619
like you know because you know something

1766
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,719
would something great would would come

1767
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:32,219
around and then it would disappear you

1768
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,840
know because the thing was there wasn't

1769
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:37,500
a steady

1770
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:40,260
um uh flow of that stuff you know a lot

1771
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:43,319
of stuff got smuggled in and like I made

1772
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:45,780
it through one time and that was it

1773
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:48,299
you know unless it was being locally

1774
01:23:45,779 --> 01:23:51,359
produced you know once once we started

1775
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:54,119
locally producing everything then things

1776
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:56,880
became more production like when things

1777
01:23:54,119 --> 01:24:00,300
were being smuggled in it was just hit

1778
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:02,880
or miss yeah sure

1779
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:05,219
so what would be your recommendation of

1780
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,279
one of the top dog strains for a more

1781
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:09,840
newbie grower and also what's your

1782
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:11,099
personal favorite strain you've ever

1783
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:15,179
made

1784
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:18,179
uh well right now what I have available

1785
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:20,760
like right now the dirty taxi seems to

1786
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:24,239
be really popular and if you're really

1787
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:29,039
looking for a really kind of uh dirty

1788
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:31,500
chem kind of chemd uh kind of a tip uh

1789
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,719
that's what I would recommend the the

1790
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:36,179
dirty taxi

1791
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:39,539
um we have a lot of different stuff out

1792
01:24:36,179 --> 01:24:42,899
right now uh that's been selling out

1793
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:45,960
the the sour diesel back cross fours

1794
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:49,379
obviously has been really popular really

1795
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:53,399
good representations uh Of The Sour

1796
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:59,159
Diesel uh money has just you know made

1797
01:24:53,399 --> 01:25:02,579
some new I-95 uh ixes off of his keeper

1798
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:04,559
mom uh so they've been flying off the

1799
01:25:02,579 --> 01:25:08,819
shelf

1800
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:12,060
um the piths the black Pips

1801
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:15,059
um so really it really depends on your

1802
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:17,880
own personal taste and what you're

1803
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:21,500
looking for you know you know I've tried

1804
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:24,560
to You Know cover you know all the bases

1805
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:27,719
of you know a lot of my uh personal

1806
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:31,320
favorites and try to give people some

1807
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:33,779
kind of representation of that you know

1808
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:36,539
so you know a lot of that really comes

1809
01:25:33,779 --> 01:25:40,198
down to your own personal stuff you know

1810
01:25:36,539 --> 01:25:43,380
we have uh you know been like the I-95

1811
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:47,399
stuff is you know kind of OG stuff and

1812
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:50,940
stuff we've kind of tried to take in a

1813
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:53,879
little bit of the best of everything in

1814
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:54,479
some type of form so

1815
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,600
um

1816
01:25:54,479 --> 01:26:00,299
so yeah I mean it's you know a lot of it

1817
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,579
comes down to personal preference

1818
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:05,279
but I but you know like like I was gonna

1819
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:08,039
uh like the star dog you know you know

1820
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:10,259
you know for a first time or you can't

1821
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:13,800
go with the star dog unfortunately

1822
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:16,679
there's no Siege currently available but

1823
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:19,739
the good thing is is that uh there's

1824
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:22,319
gonna be uh they're gonna be harvested

1825
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:25,859
soon so we just did a remake of the star

1826
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:31,559
dog I did uh yeah the Corey Haim in

1827
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:32,880
Cross uh we did the guava in Cross uh we

1828
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:35,880
did the

1829
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:39,539
um original New York City Diesel and so

1830
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:43,020
that was the three cams which was a one

1831
01:26:39,539 --> 01:26:45,840
of uh a really uh popular strain which

1832
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:49,080
you know which was originally kind of a

1833
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,760
pollen Chuck which you know uh you know

1834
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:54,600
because we just had the original New

1835
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:58,260
York City Diesel and uh you know cross

1836
01:26:54,600 --> 01:27:01,860
to the star dog and not really thinking

1837
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:04,560
you know uh it would be as you know as

1838
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:06,599
popular it was because uh you know

1839
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,520
basically you got all three chems in

1840
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:12,780
there you got you got the tree dog which

1841
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:15,000
is chem you know chem 90 uh chem D you

1842
01:27:12,779 --> 01:27:18,779
know and then you got that cross to the

1843
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:23,760
chem four and then uh you got Trey dog

1844
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:25,880
uh uh trade dog 91 in there so you have

1845
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:30,300
a good blend of uh

1846
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:33,359
491 in um chemd in there so

1847
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:36,060
um yeah that was you know another good

1848
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:38,698
one the three chems that will be uh

1849
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:40,679
which is being remade

1850
01:27:38,698 --> 01:27:42,658
yeah brilliant you brought it up because

1851
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:45,000
I always saw that three cams and thought

1852
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:47,339
that looked particularly nice and you

1853
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,738
know Kudos who also brought up I-95

1854
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:51,539
which is an incredible strain in its own

1855
01:27:49,738 --> 01:27:53,698
right and you know you see some people

1856
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:55,679
who have got some pretty wickedly

1857
01:27:53,698 --> 01:27:58,619
Devotion to it it's uh it's pretty

1858
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:00,658
impressive did you ever anticipate the

1859
01:27:58,619 --> 01:28:03,840
I-95 would have become such a success

1860
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:07,559
and what was sort of the background on

1861
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:10,079
its Inception how did it come to be

1862
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:11,780
well you know that was that was a Money

1863
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:16,920
Mike creation

1864
01:28:11,779 --> 01:28:17,960
and I you know I believe we we made that

1865
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,940
in like

1866
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:24,779
2014

1867
01:28:19,939 --> 01:28:29,460
2015. uh we brought some seeds out here

1868
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:33,238
to uh Colorado and we had uh gifted we

1869
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:35,760
originally gifted some to Tara Rojo uh

1870
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:40,619
who who was working and uh working for

1871
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:44,159
mindful at the time and so we I gave him

1872
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:47,460
some and uh

1873
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:51,359
yeah uh and then we we that was the

1874
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:57,020
original uh release of that and uh that

1875
01:28:51,359 --> 01:29:00,539
original cross was star dog uh Legend

1876
01:28:57,020 --> 01:29:05,100
OG was the male

1877
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:06,600
times uh to the triangle Kush

1878
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,940
so

1879
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:11,520
um yeah that I mean

1880
01:29:08,939 --> 01:29:16,919
I don't know what that combination did

1881
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:20,580
but it just really opened up uh uh a a

1882
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:24,300
new box of uh

1883
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:27,179
of the way that I mean the the way the

1884
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:29,699
crystals and uh the formation of the

1885
01:29:27,179 --> 01:29:33,359
buds and everything it just really you

1886
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:36,059
know uh gave it hybrid Vigor is really

1887
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:38,759
what I'm trying to say really because

1888
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:42,480
um what what really came out of it

1889
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:45,179
really you couldn't find in any of the

1890
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:47,759
in any of the parents sick you know by

1891
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:50,399
themselves so

1892
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:53,100
um yeah I mean it's really got kind of

1893
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:56,638
an OG tip to it and it's got that

1894
01:29:53,100 --> 01:30:00,420
stretchiness to it but it's got more of

1895
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:05,159
a cheminess I guess and as a little bit

1896
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:07,980
more body uh and and stuff to it because

1897
01:30:05,158 --> 01:30:09,779
of the Indigo of the star dog so it's a

1898
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:13,738
very very unique

1899
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:16,939
um special strain and yes a lot of

1900
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:19,259
people have tried to you know copy it

1901
01:30:16,939 --> 01:30:22,919
and try to

1902
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:25,980
um make it as their own because it was

1903
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:28,500
never really put into like uh full

1904
01:30:25,979 --> 01:30:31,259
production so

1905
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:34,319
um you know there was you know uh

1906
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:37,440
releases of it but it was never really

1907
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:43,198
uh commercially released across the

1908
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:46,259
board and so you know the the packs that

1909
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:49,619
were released uh you know people were

1910
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:52,260
just fine finding such phenomenal uh

1911
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:54,960
phenos out of it that you know the

1912
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:58,260
string kind of just took a life of its

1913
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:01,139
own uh once again and you know people

1914
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:03,659
just started you know blowing it up

1915
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:07,739
blowing it up and

1916
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:10,379
um it's probably been more copied I'd

1917
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:14,698
say probably than the star dog because

1918
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:17,719
star dog was more readily commercially

1919
01:31:14,698 --> 01:31:21,299
available in releases

1920
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:24,480
whereas the I-95 really was it you know

1921
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:29,880
we've had that initial release of it

1922
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:32,638
like I said no it was 2014 2015 and then

1923
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:36,239
you know it you know we wound up blowing

1924
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:41,219
up you know over uh you know the first

1925
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:44,099
few years and you know uh

1926
01:31:41,219 --> 01:31:48,539
so yeah uh you know we really didn't

1927
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:50,699
really realize the magnitude of that and

1928
01:31:48,539 --> 01:31:54,479
um you know he had a limited amount of

1929
01:31:50,698 --> 01:31:56,759
original stock that he released but I'm

1930
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:59,039
sure I'm pretty sure that he still has

1931
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:03,600
you know quite a bit of that original

1932
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:05,039
stock that he's that he's sitting on and

1933
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,039
also

1934
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:11,158
um you know he's just recently

1935
01:32:08,039 --> 01:32:15,300
um you know done a remake of that you

1936
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:17,698
know from that so uh yes I mean is this

1937
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:20,940
something that you know once again one

1938
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:23,519
of our streams just you know it's what

1939
01:32:20,939 --> 01:32:25,138
other people you know did with him and

1940
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,159
made them popular because we never

1941
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:28,319
really

1942
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,839
kind of push you know we don't really

1943
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:33,899
push any of our strains on people you

1944
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:36,179
know it's like we release them and you

1945
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:39,359
know people buy them and then they

1946
01:32:36,179 --> 01:32:41,880
decide how good they are so

1947
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:44,639
um yeah so one of the questions I was

1948
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:46,980
interested in uh asking you is the chem

1949
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:49,199
genetics in general are sort of thought

1950
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:51,539
of as having some degree of sensitivity

1951
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:53,039
to stress and you know somewhat prone to

1952
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:54,359
a little bit of instability if they're

1953
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,000
stressed out

1954
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:59,339
when you're breeding with it do you just

1955
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,679
have to accept that there will be a

1956
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:03,600
small amount of instability to a degree

1957
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:06,359
or do you believe it's possible to make

1958
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:09,500
chem hybrids that are you know say as

1959
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:13,319
stable as any other strain so to speak

1960
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:16,800
uh no I think you know you know a lot of

1961
01:33:13,319 --> 01:33:18,000
that sentence sensitivity you know stays

1962
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,000
present

1963
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,399
uh you know a lot of it depends on the

1964
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,100
the you know the conditions of the grow

1965
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:30,000
and so you know when you have unstable

1966
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:33,000
conditions in a bro then uh yeah that's

1967
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,859
gonna you know affect some of the uh

1968
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,219
genetics and you know some of the

1969
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:43,738
genetics are really sensitive like the

1970
01:33:38,219 --> 01:33:45,480
sour diesel and the 91 and you know and

1971
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:47,519
even some of the cushes you can you

1972
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:49,019
could say that about the same things too

1973
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,800
so

1974
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,500
um

1975
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:55,980
if you know

1976
01:33:51,500 --> 01:34:00,600
it's all about environment and and I

1977
01:33:55,979 --> 01:34:03,539
think cannabis adapts to environment and

1978
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:06,060
so you know if if it's in an environment

1979
01:34:03,539 --> 01:34:08,279
where it's going to be stress and it

1980
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:11,300
thinks it's going to die you know

1981
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:14,939
obviously it's going to go into self

1982
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:18,480
preservation and start the Herm out and

1983
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:21,599
and I think that's you know um can be

1984
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:23,819
true that's true at any strain so I mean

1985
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:27,179
I think that's a built-in mechanism

1986
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:29,939
that's in cannabis regardless and yes

1987
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:33,359
some streams are going to be a little

1988
01:34:29,939 --> 01:34:37,138
more sensitive than other strains but

1989
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:39,539
really in the end what's key is having a

1990
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:42,239
stable environment you know not having

1991
01:34:39,539 --> 01:34:46,019
light leaks not having big temperature

1992
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:47,759
swings having your pH right you know

1993
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:49,920
there's a lot of little different things

1994
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:53,159
you can go down a list of things that

1995
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:57,539
happen you know and and what happens is

1996
01:34:53,158 --> 01:35:00,539
you know um people have it in unstable

1997
01:34:57,539 --> 01:35:04,139
environment they pop a pack of seeds

1998
01:35:00,539 --> 01:35:06,539
through life half the pack turn mail and

1999
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:10,739
the other pack hermied on me your

2000
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:14,939
genetics suck you know and so

2001
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:17,279
I get that all the time and you know

2002
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:20,819
and I've argued and I've fought with

2003
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:23,460
these people you know and you know and

2004
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:25,019
now I now I just reached the point where

2005
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:28,439
you know I'll just give you a new pack

2006
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:31,440
of seeds you know and it

2007
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:34,379
so you know it really comes down you

2008
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:37,500
know to breed or air I mean a grower air

2009
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:39,779
a lot of it and they you know they're

2010
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:42,179
quick to point the Fig finger at the

2011
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:44,759
breeder and they'll say well you know I

2012
01:35:42,179 --> 01:35:46,679
had a pack of your stuff and a pack of

2013
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:50,280
and other stuff and the other pack

2014
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:53,279
didn't harm but your pack did and you

2015
01:35:50,279 --> 01:35:56,819
know so you know um

2016
01:35:53,279 --> 01:36:00,658
there's just so many variables that that

2017
01:35:56,819 --> 01:36:04,319
are in cannabis itself and then you add

2018
01:36:00,658 --> 01:36:08,460
that to the variables of of the

2019
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:11,460
conditions it grows in and you just have

2020
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:14,639
you know you know you just don't know

2021
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:17,460
what it's gonna you know turn into so

2022
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:19,980
you know to me you know it's it it

2023
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:22,560
starts with the grower you know you have

2024
01:36:19,979 --> 01:36:25,799
a stable environment you have everything

2025
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:28,380
that's tight and you know you shouldn't

2026
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:31,260
really have too many problems even if

2027
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:33,119
you're using sensitive genetics you know

2028
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:35,940
but you know there's always going to be

2029
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:38,039
you know those cases where you know

2030
01:36:35,939 --> 01:36:40,859
something's going to hurt because of the

2031
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:42,658
genetics or whatever but you know you

2032
01:36:40,859 --> 01:36:45,059
have to do your homework on the people

2033
01:36:42,658 --> 01:36:47,698
that you're you know you're you're going

2034
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:50,699
to be buying seeds from what kind of

2035
01:36:47,698 --> 01:36:51,419
what kind of reputation do they have you

2036
01:36:50,698 --> 01:36:54,119
know

2037
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:56,279
um how long have they been making seeds

2038
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:58,920
for you know how long have these strains

2039
01:36:56,279 --> 01:37:00,779
been around like you know you know you

2040
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:03,500
know after a while you have a track

2041
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:06,719
record you know you gain a reputation

2042
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:08,520
and and it's not what you say about your

2043
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:11,100
product it's what everyone else says

2044
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:13,980
about your products so it kind of speaks

2045
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:17,520
for itself so you know you really gotta

2046
01:37:13,979 --> 01:37:20,099
you know go into depth and do a lot of

2047
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:24,000
research and you know and what you're

2048
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:26,940
buying so you know you know and and

2049
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,500
usually you you you get what you pay for

2050
01:37:26,939 --> 01:37:31,138
you know and if you're going to do

2051
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:32,639
research into someone and you and you

2052
01:37:31,139 --> 01:37:34,679
know they're going to have good genetics

2053
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:37,739
and yeah they're probably going to cost

2054
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:41,940
you you know more more than your your

2055
01:37:37,738 --> 01:37:43,559
usual uh pack you know hundred and fifty

2056
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:45,839
two hundred dollars three hundred

2057
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:47,460
dollars you know but you you know what

2058
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,159
you're getting you know I mean when you

2059
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:53,760
buy a 50 pack of someone that that's

2060
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:55,619
knocked off someone and yeah you might

2061
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,679
be able to find some really good stuff

2062
01:37:55,619 --> 01:38:01,738
in there and and on on the other hand

2063
01:37:58,679 --> 01:38:04,800
yeah you might get [ __ ] and and and it

2064
01:38:01,738 --> 01:38:07,859
might get a Hermie bomb so

2065
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:10,440
um yeah it's really you know the way

2066
01:38:07,859 --> 01:38:12,899
that I've always looked at it is it's

2067
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:14,638
like I've always tried to buy my seeds

2068
01:38:12,899 --> 01:38:17,460
from the source

2069
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:19,920
from the original Source or as close as

2070
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:22,079
you can get it you know so that's why I

2071
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:25,800
went to Scentsy seeds you know I mean

2072
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:29,579
and and I've bought other greenhouse and

2073
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:32,520
you know Mr Nice and you know all these

2074
01:38:29,579 --> 01:38:35,460
other name breeders I I buy from the

2075
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:38,460
source you know and you know so you know

2076
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:41,158
what you you should be getting and you

2077
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:44,039
know the reputation behind it and when

2078
01:38:41,158 --> 01:38:47,819
you're just buying some random Cross or

2079
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:50,639
you know it's it's a crap shoe and you

2080
01:38:47,819 --> 01:38:52,920
know you get what you pay for in the end

2081
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:55,199
so true so true

2082
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,000
so we've just got a few final fan

2083
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:58,799
submitted questions before we do our

2084
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,600
final five quick ones

2085
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,520
one I'm definitely interested to hear

2086
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,520
your answer to Is do you know any of the

2087
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:09,540
origins of the Nigerian silk

2088
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:12,239
no I mean I was given the Nigerian

2089
01:39:09,539 --> 01:39:14,100
um as a clone only

2090
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:18,419
um from my

2091
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:22,320
from what I remember it came from a

2092
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:27,179
group of people up in New Paltz New York

2093
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:30,119
who were a bunch of skydivers so

2094
01:39:27,179 --> 01:39:31,880
actually I think the The Cutting came

2095
01:39:30,119 --> 01:39:36,238
from a girl

2096
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:39,900
and from from what I read the story that

2097
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:43,799
I was told that I guess someone had

2098
01:39:39,899 --> 01:39:46,259
taken a trip over to Nigeria and brought

2099
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,760
back these seeds and they were grown

2100
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:51,179
upstate

2101
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:53,579
now how true that is I I don't know

2102
01:39:51,179 --> 01:39:56,399
because I didn't I didn't know the

2103
01:39:53,579 --> 01:39:59,519
original people the skydiving people I

2104
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:03,000
didn't know any of them so it was my

2105
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:07,380
friend who I got the cutting from so I

2106
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:09,600
can only go by what I was told in

2107
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:11,159
um yeah that's as far back as I can go

2108
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:15,239
with it you know I know that there's

2109
01:40:11,158 --> 01:40:19,019
been uh I know I know that Neville had

2110
01:40:15,238 --> 01:40:21,539
released some Nigerian uh seeds at some

2111
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:25,440
point and there might have been a few

2112
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:29,219
other people but uh yeah I mean I

2113
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:33,899
remember first seeing the Nigerian from

2114
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:37,079
uh the weasel he was growing it uh back

2115
01:40:33,899 --> 01:40:41,039
in the mid 90s and I remember getting it

2116
01:40:37,079 --> 01:40:44,639
once or twice and I remember him saying

2117
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:47,960
how it took too long and it yielded too

2118
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:51,060
little and he cut it out and

2119
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:55,198
uh once I remember you know and then

2120
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:59,159
once once and once I was able to get the

2121
01:40:55,198 --> 01:41:02,759
cutting uh yeah I jumped on on that

2122
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:07,738
opportunity and then you know just like

2123
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:10,860
I would with any Elite uh strain that I

2124
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:14,519
got I tried to make some type of uh

2125
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:18,420
representation and Seed so I mean that's

2126
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:20,340
really you know what I did and uh

2127
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:22,560
and that's what I've always been trying

2128
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:24,719
you know I've been doing all along and

2129
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:27,120
just you know had just been kind of

2130
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:29,219
fortunate on the way things have been

2131
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:31,319
working out

2132
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:32,939
yeah very nice so I think that's more

2133
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:35,519
information than I knew on it so that's

2134
01:41:32,939 --> 01:41:38,399
great the next one was have you ever

2135
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:40,619
been given any breeding advice that was

2136
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:42,118
particularly memorable or left an impact

2137
01:41:40,618 --> 01:41:46,738
on you

2138
01:41:42,118 --> 01:41:49,920
no I mean not not particularly from one

2139
01:41:46,738 --> 01:41:53,218
person because I've kind of learned you

2140
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:55,739
know everything myself going along I

2141
01:41:53,219 --> 01:41:59,219
mean obviously you know I've read you

2142
01:41:55,738 --> 01:42:00,299
know Publications from DJ Short Mal

2143
01:41:59,219 --> 01:42:04,439
Frank

2144
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:07,079
you know Ed Rosenthal and you know so on

2145
01:42:04,439 --> 01:42:09,919
and so forth so I've tried to you know

2146
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:12,479
do as much you know uh

2147
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:16,139
research that I could do

2148
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:18,839
um as possible you know other than you

2149
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:24,779
know really meeting you know

2150
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:29,940
you know Neville or Ashanti or you know

2151
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:32,819
one of these you know uh Skunk Man and

2152
01:42:29,939 --> 01:42:34,979
having you know one of these guys you

2153
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:36,359
know telling you something

2154
01:42:34,979 --> 01:42:39,238
um

2155
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:41,399
some type of secret other than that but

2156
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:43,439
not no because you never get to you know

2157
01:42:41,399 --> 01:42:46,198
you never get the the chance to meet

2158
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:48,359
people like that and and even if you did

2159
01:42:46,198 --> 01:42:51,118
I don't think they would tell you their

2160
01:42:48,359 --> 01:42:53,579
breeding secrets so you know a lot of

2161
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:57,238
these things you got to kind of just you

2162
01:42:53,579 --> 01:43:00,479
know learn as you go along uh try to do

2163
01:42:57,238 --> 01:43:01,979
as much research as you can

2164
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:04,439
um there's you know there's a lot of

2165
01:43:01,979 --> 01:43:06,539
books out there you know and now with

2166
01:43:04,439 --> 01:43:08,238
the internet and everything you can kind

2167
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:11,279
of get you know a lot more information

2168
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:13,099
that that used to be out there that you

2169
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:15,658
can get now

2170
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:17,039
yeah definitely grateful for all the

2171
01:43:15,658 --> 01:43:18,299
amount of information that's out there

2172
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:20,519
that's for sure

2173
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:23,159
so the next question was for you

2174
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:26,060
personally what are the most rare seeds

2175
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:26,059
in your collection

2176
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:31,379
um that's kind of a hard question

2177
01:43:27,899 --> 01:43:34,920
because I have so many seeds I mean I

2178
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:35,819
have seeds from all around the world I

2179
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:38,940
mean

2180
01:43:35,819 --> 01:43:41,579
um and I guess you know

2181
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:44,460
um probably you know more of the land

2182
01:43:41,579 --> 01:43:47,698
reach kind of stuff I would say

2183
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:49,560
you know uh because you know a lot of

2184
01:43:47,698 --> 01:43:50,519
this stuff you know

2185
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:53,219
um

2186
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:56,639
you know I just made you know I I made

2187
01:43:53,219 --> 01:43:58,698
it you know so you know really

2188
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,699
um

2189
01:44:00,539 --> 01:44:05,939
I I really can't I really don't have an

2190
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:08,880
you know I'm trying to think I really

2191
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:11,158
don't have a specific answer that I can

2192
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:14,880
give you because I would say it's my

2193
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:16,319
whole my whole collection in itself you

2194
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,920
know because

2195
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:20,399
um

2196
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:23,158
I can't point to one particular thing

2197
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:25,319
and say like that is

2198
01:44:23,158 --> 01:44:28,198
you know the

2199
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:30,539
creme Delhi creme so to speak you know

2200
01:44:28,198 --> 01:44:33,539
because everything is is so different

2201
01:44:30,539 --> 01:44:36,179
and special in its own right and

2202
01:44:33,539 --> 01:44:40,139
deserves its own space

2203
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:43,560
so I mean there's such a in a thing

2204
01:44:40,139 --> 01:44:47,520
about cannabis is such a wide spectrum

2205
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:49,679
of different varieties and which give

2206
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:53,000
you different effects and just

2207
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:53,000
everything so

2208
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:58,699
yeah I mean I mean the thing that would

2209
01:44:57,719 --> 01:45:02,899
be

2210
01:44:58,698 --> 01:45:06,299
most valuable is something that I can't

2211
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:08,819
get you know

2212
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,860
so if I can get if if I could have

2213
01:45:08,819 --> 01:45:13,679
something that I can't get I would say

2214
01:45:10,859 --> 01:45:16,679
that would be the most valuable thing

2215
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:20,520
but because most things you can get you

2216
01:45:16,679 --> 01:45:23,520
know I mean and especially you know uh

2217
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:25,500
you know luckily like you know someone

2218
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:27,360
like me

2219
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:30,658
um you know if there's something that I

2220
01:45:27,359 --> 01:45:33,899
really want I mean I can make a post

2221
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:37,379
about it and I'm pretty sure like

2222
01:45:33,899 --> 01:45:42,118
someone out there you know would offer

2223
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:43,859
me some kind of a trade or or something

2224
01:45:42,118 --> 01:45:46,439
like that you know I mean but it doesn't

2225
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:49,679
always work like that you know I mean it

2226
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:50,819
doesn't you know I mean so

2227
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,118
um

2228
01:45:50,819 --> 01:45:57,179
yeah I mean I guess the thing that you

2229
01:45:54,118 --> 01:45:59,939
know people want the most right now is

2230
01:45:57,179 --> 01:46:03,960
that roadkill that original roadkill

2231
01:45:59,939 --> 01:46:08,339
skunk that mass Super Skunk that

2232
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:10,198
you know rancid you know

2233
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:10,800
skunk so

2234
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:14,039
um

2235
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,600
yeah you know I mean so I mean that's

2236
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:17,639
what

2237
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,860
that's what everyone's looking for now

2238
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:22,139
so I mean and that's really why you know

2239
01:46:19,859 --> 01:46:25,799
I I you know getting back to the land

2240
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:27,960
race stuff and you know so I would have

2241
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:30,480
to say probably some of that land race

2242
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:33,600
stuff because you just don't know

2243
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:37,500
what the potential of something

2244
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:40,500
could be in there whereas a lot of this

2245
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:42,840
stuff I already know what it is you know

2246
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:45,380
so I that's what that would probably be

2247
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:48,179
the answer is kind of like the unknown

2248
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:50,579
because you know if you have something

2249
01:46:48,179 --> 01:46:52,199
that you think has potential but you

2250
01:46:50,579 --> 01:46:55,019
just don't know what it is until you

2251
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:56,939
actually get into it you know whereas

2252
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:59,699
you might have a bunch of seed stock

2253
01:46:56,939 --> 01:47:02,399
that you made and you're already kind of

2254
01:46:59,698 --> 01:47:03,719
know what it is and you already have you

2255
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:06,118
know

2256
01:47:03,719 --> 01:47:10,139
stuff that you know clones or whatever

2257
01:47:06,118 --> 01:47:15,179
so yeah that's yeah that's what I would

2258
01:47:10,139 --> 01:47:17,819
say yeah strong words I dig it so on to

2259
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:21,658
our final five quick questions before we

2260
01:47:17,819 --> 01:47:25,559
wrap this one up so first one is what is

2261
01:47:21,658 --> 01:47:27,839
the best or most memorable single sort

2262
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:29,940
of hit or smoking session you've ever

2263
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,119
had what left the biggest impression on

2264
01:47:29,939 --> 01:47:32,118
you

2265
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:37,380
uh

2266
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:40,139
well I told that that story earlier

2267
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:42,300
about the tie you know that was that

2268
01:47:40,139 --> 01:47:45,659
that was probably one of the you know

2269
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:48,900
most uh memorable smoking sessions that

2270
01:47:45,658 --> 01:47:51,299
really uh made an impression on me you

2271
01:47:48,899 --> 01:47:53,879
know when I you know broke out this this

2272
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:56,820
Thai weed at it you know in the dead

2273
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:59,460
dead show parking lot you know when

2274
01:47:56,819 --> 01:48:02,698
you're you know eight ten people in a

2275
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:05,579
circle and you know and we're smoking

2276
01:48:02,698 --> 01:48:08,039
and people are dropping out like flies I

2277
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:10,139
mean that was you know that that told me

2278
01:48:08,039 --> 01:48:13,139
that that weed was killer

2279
01:48:10,139 --> 01:48:15,239
great answer it sounds amazing so on the

2280
01:48:13,139 --> 01:48:17,219
other end of the spectrum was there ever

2281
01:48:15,238 --> 01:48:19,319
a time when everyone around you was

2282
01:48:17,219 --> 01:48:21,118
really hyped about this new strain and

2283
01:48:19,319 --> 01:48:22,920
everyone's talking it up and then you

2284
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:24,899
finally try and you just really weren't

2285
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:27,539
impressed

2286
01:48:24,899 --> 01:48:29,099
yeah uh I guess Take the Girl Scout

2287
01:48:27,539 --> 01:48:31,198
cookies and

2288
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:33,539
you know stuff like that you know I mean

2289
01:48:31,198 --> 01:48:35,879
there's been I mean there's been a lot

2290
01:48:33,539 --> 01:48:38,219
of streams like that I mean just you

2291
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:42,539
know being on the internet for so long

2292
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:45,539
and you know you uh you get caught up in

2293
01:48:42,539 --> 01:48:48,300
uh the hype that people put out this

2294
01:48:45,539 --> 01:48:54,000
kind of like how I explained you know

2295
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:57,659
the lore of certain things and uh yeah I

2296
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:01,079
mean uh you know in kind of like a

2297
01:48:57,658 --> 01:49:02,879
perfect perfect example would be kind of

2298
01:49:01,079 --> 01:49:05,399
like the Bubba Kush like that was

2299
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:08,159
something I was you know really you know

2300
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:11,759
really excited to get and then when I

2301
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:15,059
finally got to grow it out and smoke it

2302
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:18,840
not that it wasn't that bad but it

2303
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:22,380
wasn't that good and I can kind of see

2304
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:26,100
how it had its time and place in history

2305
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:29,520
at one time but by the time that I got

2306
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:32,880
it I already had other strains that

2307
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,920
[ __ ] you know that crushed it you

2308
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,980
know what I mean so you know there's a

2309
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:40,679
lot of things out there that you know

2310
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:45,000
you know that you hear about and are

2311
01:49:40,679 --> 01:49:47,279
hyped up and so on and so forth and you

2312
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,260
know you finally get into them and then

2313
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:52,139
you're just like that's just not all

2314
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:54,960
that and you know that's kind of how I

2315
01:49:52,139 --> 01:49:57,359
feel with you know a lot of the designer

2316
01:49:54,960 --> 01:50:00,779
strains that you know that are coming

2317
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:03,000
out now and everything and so you know

2318
01:50:00,779 --> 01:50:05,579
uh the Skittles you know when I finally

2319
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:10,679
got to try the Skittles

2320
01:50:05,579 --> 01:50:13,800
I mean it had a nice you know nice taste

2321
01:50:10,679 --> 01:50:17,279
all in all to it but I mean at the end

2322
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:21,239
of the day I mean probably

2323
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:22,920
test it out in the in the low teens in

2324
01:50:21,238 --> 01:50:26,939
THC

2325
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:28,679
but once you put that into concentrates

2326
01:50:26,939 --> 01:50:30,059
now that becomes a whole different

2327
01:50:28,679 --> 01:50:31,319
product

2328
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:34,860
so

2329
01:50:31,319 --> 01:50:36,840
yeah on one one hand I could say yeah I

2330
01:50:34,859 --> 01:50:39,059
didn't like the flower it kind of sucked

2331
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:41,719
but it you know it had a nice flavor to

2332
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:44,400
it but once you put that into

2333
01:50:41,719 --> 01:50:45,960
concentrates now you know now you're

2334
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:49,679
talking about concentrates where you're

2335
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:52,020
concentrating the THC and really at that

2336
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:54,420
point it's only about flavor

2337
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:57,179
you know so you know now you're taking

2338
01:50:54,420 --> 01:51:00,179
something that is not really such a

2339
01:50:57,179 --> 01:51:03,658
great flower now making it into a a

2340
01:51:00,179 --> 01:51:09,359
concentrate product that is exceptional

2341
01:51:03,658 --> 01:51:11,638
for some people so uh yeah it's you know

2342
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:14,639
it's you just don't know what what what

2343
01:51:11,639 --> 01:51:17,340
you know what will what will become at

2344
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:21,118
what can become out of a stream should I

2345
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:23,279
say yeah a good Insight so let's do a

2346
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:25,380
desert island situation if you could

2347
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:27,859
only take three strains with you onto a

2348
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:32,279
desert island what are you gonna take

2349
01:51:27,859 --> 01:51:35,639
uh I'm going to take the chemd

2350
01:51:32,279 --> 01:51:39,559
I'm going to take uh

2351
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:42,179
uh probably the black Haze pith

2352
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:45,539
and uh

2353
01:51:42,179 --> 01:51:47,279
probably the OG a good OG you know so

2354
01:51:45,539 --> 01:51:49,500
that I mean that's you know so really

2355
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:52,500
that would be kind of like you know I

2356
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:56,219
got a really good heavy Indica I got a

2357
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:58,500
really good hay sativa and then the OG

2358
01:51:56,219 --> 01:52:01,380
could kind of be like a nice little

2359
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:03,779
hybrid you know so uh yeah I think that

2360
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:06,000
those those three would be my choices

2361
01:52:03,779 --> 01:52:09,539
yeah three really nice picks I could I

2362
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:11,579
could get behind those so now to be a

2363
01:52:09,539 --> 01:52:13,679
little bit Devil's Advocate all right so

2364
01:52:11,579 --> 01:52:15,960
now we're gonna drop someone else off on

2365
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:18,239
the island and you don't like this

2366
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:19,980
person very much but you get to choose

2367
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:22,559
the three strains you leave them with

2368
01:52:19,979 --> 01:52:24,899
what are you gonna leave them with

2369
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:30,360
laughs

2370
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:30,359
well if I don't like them very much uh

2371
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:37,520
I'd have to you know I guess you'd have

2372
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:39,989
to give them the Blue Dream just because

2373
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:42,000
you know uh

2374
01:52:39,989 --> 01:52:44,039
[Music]

2375
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,260
I guess I'd have to give him you know

2376
01:52:44,039 --> 01:52:48,060
the Girl Scout cookie

2377
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:49,260
you know I'd have to give him something

2378
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:52,020
to

2379
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:54,900
something just to give you just enough

2380
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:57,179
you just don't get it just doesn't get

2381
01:52:54,899 --> 01:53:00,539
you quite there you know you're almost

2382
01:52:57,179 --> 01:53:02,819
there but almost not quite there you

2383
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:05,100
know and then I guess

2384
01:53:02,819 --> 01:53:08,279
you know I just have to give him a skunk

2385
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:12,300
one you know because uh

2386
01:53:08,279 --> 01:53:15,899
what can be more generic and a and a

2387
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:18,600
skunk one nowadays so I guess that those

2388
01:53:15,899 --> 01:53:21,118
would be a mystery some really good

2389
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:23,460
answers there so final question for the

2390
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:27,059
interview if you could go back to any

2391
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:29,039
place and time in history where would

2392
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:31,500
you go and what seeds would you collect

2393
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:33,840
while you were there

2394
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:36,779
um it would definitely have to be back

2395
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:40,800
you know in Afghanistan you know

2396
01:53:36,779 --> 01:53:43,319
definitely during the Silk Road time you

2397
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:47,480
know there was a time you know and this

2398
01:53:43,319 --> 01:53:52,019
is really I believe the the Inception of

2399
01:53:47,479 --> 01:53:55,979
uh Landry seeds because

2400
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:56,940
um in England they used to run tours you

2401
01:53:55,979 --> 01:54:00,539
know

2402
01:53:56,939 --> 01:54:03,379
um and they used to run train and bus

2403
01:54:00,539 --> 01:54:07,979
tours to India

2404
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:10,920
and uh it would go as far as Bangkok

2405
01:54:07,979 --> 01:54:14,039
and um if you know anything about the

2406
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:17,039
history of the Silk Road and the the

2407
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:19,260
routes that it took

2408
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:20,179
um you were able to

2409
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:22,380
um

2410
01:54:20,179 --> 01:54:26,179
basically you know

2411
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:29,819
travel in a lot of these um

2412
01:54:26,179 --> 01:54:33,060
Muslim past producing countries you know

2413
01:54:29,819 --> 01:54:34,698
where where hash was you know originally

2414
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:37,320
from

2415
01:54:34,698 --> 01:54:40,500
and um

2416
01:54:37,319 --> 01:54:44,759
yeah I mean you used to be able to uh

2417
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:47,039
just travel freely across Iran Iraq

2418
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:50,039
Afghanistan

2419
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:53,039
uh

2420
01:54:50,039 --> 01:54:55,139
you know the Hindu Kush

2421
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:57,079
India

2422
01:54:55,139 --> 01:55:00,060
um Nepal

2423
01:54:57,079 --> 01:55:03,960
uh Morocco

2424
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:07,980
all of these countries uh were very

2425
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:09,800
friendly to backpacking hippies and

2426
01:55:07,979 --> 01:55:15,000
adventurers

2427
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:17,520
and uh most of these countries uh were

2428
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:24,539
legal back then you know we're we're

2429
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:28,560
talking uh early 70s late 60s uh you

2430
01:55:24,539 --> 01:55:31,500
know before uh the drug War uh you know

2431
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:36,300
it was really during that time that

2432
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:40,679
Nixon Nixon really forced a lot of those

2433
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:43,139
countries to go illegal because we were

2434
01:55:40,679 --> 01:55:46,199
um you know we were funding a lot of

2435
01:55:43,139 --> 01:55:48,300
those poor countries and when we just

2436
01:55:46,198 --> 01:55:50,279
basically told them either you make it

2437
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:52,679
illegal or we're not giving you any more

2438
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:56,759
money and so you know a lot of those

2439
01:55:52,679 --> 01:56:01,139
countries were just forced you know to

2440
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:04,500
um go illegal and you know over you know

2441
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:07,500
uh Generations you know it just a lot of

2442
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:10,198
it has become Taboo in some of these

2443
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:14,579
countries like Thailand for instance you

2444
01:56:10,198 --> 01:56:17,819
know uh cannabis is pretty taboo uh with

2445
01:56:14,579 --> 01:56:20,399
the general population over there and

2446
01:56:17,819 --> 01:56:23,158
um the same could be said in in a lot of

2447
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:23,719
uh Asian countries you know

2448
01:56:23,158 --> 01:56:26,099
um

2449
01:56:23,719 --> 01:56:28,560
most of the modern Asian countries

2450
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:32,520
should I say you know you can go to uh

2451
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:34,920
Vietnam and Laos and in that in those

2452
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:38,159
places in in you know the cool the

2453
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:41,039
cultural still is is alive you know and

2454
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:46,319
you know and that really dates back to

2455
01:56:41,039 --> 01:56:51,179
to uh you know them just using uh uh

2456
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:53,819
cannabis and hemp for General use in in

2457

using you know this stuff for centuries

2459
01:56:56,158 --> 01:57:01,259
