you currently smoking on today

46
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,399
uh today i've rolled up

47
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,438
a joint of true love which is a cross of

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,840
a filipino land race and the truth which

49
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,398
is the strain i won a high times with

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
back in 2014.

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,879
wow okay there's a lot to go on there

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,399
let's go on the one i was a little more

53
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,159
interested in touching on first because

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,878
we'll obviously touch on the truth quite

55
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,799
a bit the filipino land race how did you

56
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,039
come across that one i've never seen

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,360
anyone with a cut like that

58
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,280
this is the most incredible story for a

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,000
strain this one like

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,919
i love this train for so many reasons i

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,479
had a friend i met when i was in

62
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,119
amsterdam a jewish friend of mine

63
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,518
called zohar one of the most adventurous

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
quirky characters i've ever met in my

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,719
life

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,599
i love him he's just a just an oddball

67
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,000
of the highest caliber and that's why i

68
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,238
probably like him because we're so alike

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
and so different in that regard

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,280
and

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,640
after living in amsterdam for a few

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,878
years he then moved to barcelona

73
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,479
i moved to barcelona

74
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,959
haven't been in touch with him i'm

75
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,759
walking along the street and see him

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,598
coming towards me with her with this

77
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,399
girl hand in hand

78
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,399
so i'm like bro he's like oh barry what

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
are you doing here i'm like oh i'm i've

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,239
moved over i was staying at a friend's

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,759
at the time just kind of looking for

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,800
somewhere to live and get everything

83
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,039
settled in

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,480
turns out he was doing tours of the

85
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,239
cannabis social clubs in barcelona and

86
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,759
it was an idea that me and him came up

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,920
with when i was in amsterdam because

88
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,158
instagram had kicked off by then and i

89
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,518
said to him like go and do the tours

90
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,479
take people around to the different

91
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,158
clubs you can basically what happens is

92
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,238
people take people around to the clubs

93
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,120
and they just charge a small fee or get

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,200
a cut of the entry fee but then they're

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,680
able to take people to like three or

96
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,359
four different clubs during a day uh

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,280
find out kind of what kind of people

98
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,120
they are and pair them up with a

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,878
cannabis social club that suits that

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,439
kind of person

101
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:54,079
so he while he's doing it

102
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,239
he meets this filipino girl who's on

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,680
like her first

104
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,560

on a kind of journey of self-discovery

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,598
so they fall in love

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,000
he pretty much jacks in his job and he's

108
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,639

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,039

he went back with her

129
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,279

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
phone call from him

153
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,918
while they have gotten to the airport

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,680
and are about to board their flight back

155
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,359
to europe

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,360
his girlfriend has been arrested

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,240

00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,159
flight

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,639

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,039
her friends to find out what's going on

163
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,000
or trying to get help and alert him

login had been done on his phone

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
so he was able to try and reach out to

167
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,359
some friends and try and get help

168

169
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,680
so doing that during his adventure he

170
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,639
met another jewish guy and said to him

171
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,639
brother i need to smoke some weed i am

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,759
under pressure you need to help me find

173
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,639
some weed

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,240
so this other guy goes out of his way to

175
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,360
find him some bud

176
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,680
and gets him like a filipino land race

177
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
in that filipino land race there's five

178
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,000
seeds

179
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,159
so my friend saves those five seeds and

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
then after a week or so of not being

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,960
able to get in touch with his girlfriend

182
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,959
and not being able to find out what's

183
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:07,680
going on he comes back to barcelona

184
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,758
he comes back and stays with me so while

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,560
he's staying with me

186
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,319
i start the seeds

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,759
after a couple of weeks

188
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,800
he gets a phone call from his girlfriend

189
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,639
she's in a mental institution

190
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
she's managed to get one of the girls

191
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,840
that works there to let her use the

192
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
telephone

193
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,638
secretly away from everyone

194
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,598
and tells us that they've

195
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,478
diagnosed her with love addiction

196
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:39,839
and they're literally drugging her

197
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,839
and giving her counselling

198
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
heavy

199
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,280
rose

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,840
if i hadn't have heard

201
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,399
the conversation myself and been there

202
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,560
and then heard the voice messages that

203
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,799
succeeded i would have been doubtful if

204
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
this is even possible bro it blew my

205
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,680
mind to think that something like that

206
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,520
can happen so then my friend as you can

207
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,840
imagine he's like there's nothing he can

208
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,159
do and he's super upset about it

209
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,038
but he kind of like

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,599
has constantly got her in his mind

211
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,800
after a little while he gets a letter

212
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,319
and this letter is just like a dagger to

213
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,879
the heart letter

214
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,919
you know like it is the most damning

215
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
like

216
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,399
by going on my facebook you broke my

217
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,598
trust like it broke down so many things

218
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,519
said

219
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,038
just destroyed and broke his heart

220
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,159
basically and i had to say to him that

221
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,000
look bro

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,639
this looks like someone put a gun to her

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,559
head and made her write it

224
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,559
but at the end of the day you're in

225
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,000
another country

226
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,598
there's nothing you can do you've got to

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,918
get on with your life

228
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,759
this is kind of crazy right now i mean

229
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,120
like it's so wild and i can see it's

230
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,639
depressing you you need to get on with

231
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,440
your life

232
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,639
so

233
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,480
at that point i decided to call

234
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,159
to strain that i was growing

235
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,159
lovesick the filipino

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,039
because of the love addiction diagnosis

237
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,000
that she was given

238
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:09,919
hot damn that's a neat name to a

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,080
potentially really dark story

240
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,278
well the craziest thing of all bro is

241
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,839
that

242
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,958
a month or say six weeks into veg in the

243
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,440
plan

244
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:23,199
i took a cutting from it

245
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,080
and it bled red

246
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,080
ah that that's exists in like you know

247
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,759
one of bodies strains that's so rare

248
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,639
though right yeah i think it's it's like

249
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,399
amphocyanins or something like that i'm

250
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,319
not sure the exact pronunciation i've

251
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,000
only ever seen it written but yeah i

252
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,240
think bodies got a strain called

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
dragon's blood that does it

254
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,839
yeah yeah yeah you know about that one

255
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,519
sweet

256
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
yeah yeah people have pointed out to me

257
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,799
when i actually found it people have

258
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,360
pointed it out to me so

259
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,079
yeah that strained air it goes like dark

260
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,879
purple it's the most unique hardy strain

261
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,000
i've ever grown in my life i've seen it

262
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,399
grow in a propagator in a dark room

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,639
where the rest of the tree cuts i had

264
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,799
discarded all molded and just fluffed

265
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,199
over and when i went in there the

266
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,719
filipino cuttings had grown to the roof

267
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,399
of the propagator and were trying to

268
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,278
find light

269
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,360
damn and what's it like as a plant in

270
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:20,320
terms of like flowering time and the

271
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,680
high and all that stuff

272
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,839
the flowering time is quite long like i

273
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,639
i've i've got it to finish it's in it to

274
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,880
an acceptable degree in barcelona

275
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,600
outdoors because i flowered it all the

276
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,639
way until the first week of december

277
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,879
okay

278
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,039
that's quite a while but indoors you're

279
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:42,399
looking at like

280
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,719
you could get away with 14 but really 16

281
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
weeks is where it wants to be and i

282
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,240
think if i really wanted to you could

283
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
probably push it to 20 weeks it's one of

284
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,320
those kind of strains like

285
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,240
it's weird like that and

286
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,560
the truth is indoors it's never as good

287
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,120
as it is outdoors

288
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,359
ah that's cool

289
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,240
yeah like what what my plan is to do

290
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,039
next year is to start flowering indoors

291
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
like

292
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,319
six weeks before the outdoor

293
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
schedule flips to flowering and then

294
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,519
take it outdoors and finish it off for

295
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:18,399
another 10 12 weeks outdoors so it gets

296
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,278
like 20 weeks altogether

297
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,120
oh

298
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,879
that sounds nice and so what's the high

299
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,240
like

300
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,559
it's a beautiful cerebral

301
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,560
low anxiety

302
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,639
i i haven't got the luxury of being able

303
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,039
to get things tested easily but i get

304
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,519
the feeling that it's got cbd in it just

305
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,439
for the fact that there's none of that

306
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,078
heart pounding

307
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,200
sativa anxiety from it but it's got a

308
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,439
beautiful cerebral calming

309
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,879
euphoric kind of

310
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,279
mildly psychedelic high

311
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,200
nice and so what um have you been able

312
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,200
to get the flowering time down to when

313
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,959
you crossed it with the truth

314
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,120
yeah do you know what i finished a whole

315
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:07,039
bunch outside first week in october

316
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,839
some some stunners so you get 10 week to

317
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,439
12 week

318
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,120
finishes lovely and and what kind of

319
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,959
flavors do they have are they leaning

320
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,959
towards one side or in the middle or

321
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,278
what do they do

322
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,278
with the regular version way more

323
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,919
variety it's all over the place with the

324
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,000
regular one the flowering time is more

325
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,240
varied as well but with the feminized

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
version that i've just done outdoors it

327
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,560
was a little bit more

328
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,200
balanced you know there wasn't so many

329
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,559
crazy sativa ones and there weren't

330
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,720
really

331
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,399
truth dominant ones it kind of evened it

332
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,480
out a bit more across the board which is

333
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,039
what i find with femme seeds it kind of

334
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,399
evens things out a lot more

335
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,639
so

336
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,480
yeah with that the flavors are weird

337
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,200
i'll be honest it's so hard to describe

338
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,600
bro i i haven't got a point of reference

339
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,920
for it it's kind of

340
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,000
in a floral direction

341
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,519
but i can't compare it to anything so

342
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
it's making it super difficult and

343
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,039
that's the same with the

344
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,800
with the lovesick cut itself i can't

345
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,039
give you a point of reference to tell

346
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,958
you what i think it smells like or what

347
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,799
it tastes like so

348
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,479
it's one of those ones i need to i need

349
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,240
more people to try it because there'll

350
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,839
be people with more experience you know

351
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,159
how it is sometimes someone will smoke

352
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,720
one of your strains like i've got a

353
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,919
strain truezilla which is terzil across

354
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,399
to the truth

355
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,799
and when i when i'm smoking it or

356
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,600
smelling it i can pick up on fruits that

357
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,399
i know so i'll pick up on a mango note

358
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,920
or

359
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,399
like grapefruit i can discern easily

360
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,278
you'll get a little pineapple smell that

361
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,958
one i can pick out but when someone else

362
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,278
comes along i've heard someone go like

363
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,879
oh i can smell papaya i couldn't tell

364
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,879
you what [ __ ] papaya smells like for

365
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,519
the life of me so i just have to take it

366
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,958
that that person has got more papaya

367
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,120
experience than me and they're just

368
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,919
picking one of the notes out because

369
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,198
it's familiarity which often makes them

370
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,519
jump out to you yeah that sounds like a

371
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,919
pretty sound theory

372
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,919
let's go back to the start though what

373
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,919
was your first experience with cannabis

374
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,639
do you know what yeah

375
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,879
i think

376
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,399
literally my first ever experience with

377
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,759
cannabis was from like a super

378
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,399
irresponsible like family member where

379
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,838
one of my aunties who's like

380
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,000
semi-degenerate uh basically my little

381
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,440
cousin when we were going on a walk in

382
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,759
the countryside

383
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
suggested to her to let me have a pool

384
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,759
on a joint

385
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,240
and that was my first hoke of a joint

386
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,838
was from my auntie when i was like

387
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,480
probably about [ __ ] 11 years

388
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,560
old so super irresponsible like not the

389
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,800
kind of thing that anyone should be

390
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,119
doing but

391
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,958
i guess the [ __ ] up thing is that

392
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
your favorite auntie when you grow up

393
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,439
you realize was the most degenerate and

394
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,239
now so that was the gist of that so that

395
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,440
was my first experience and always like

396
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,079
i remember seeing her and her boyfriends

397
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,279
and older cousins whenever they would

398
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:13,519
roll a joint and smoke a joint i could

399
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,679
see from a child

400
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,600
the difference and how happy they were

401
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,599
when they were smoking that joint so i

402
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,680
think there was always an interest from

403
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,000
when i saw people smoking when i was

404
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,239
younger i could see the change that that

405
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,919
made in people and how everyone was

406
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
laughing and smiling a little bit

407
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,838
happier and there was from a young age i

408
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
kind of had that interest and

409
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,160
fascination

410
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,078
yeah okay that makes sense and so where

411
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,799
did it go from there how did you

412
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,239
continue to smoke as you grew up um

413
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,000
beyond 11. no

414
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,919
no it was like a concept that couldn't

415
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,759
eat like the idea of it was baffling was

416
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,198
like i don't even know even when i think

417
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,800
about it like i was baffled by that i

418
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,278
think the only other thing i maybe tried

419
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,439
was like i tried smoking a cigarette one

420
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,159
time and then i didn't smoke again until

421
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,320
i was like i think maybe 14

422
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,159
in secondary school

423
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,278
and i started smoking with one of my

424
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,159
friends

425
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,480
a crazy uh little indian kid that i went

426
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,439
to school with that was just

427
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,360
wild and i got smoking with him and then

428
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,160
another friend of mine

429
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,360
his dad was moroccan and he would always

430
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,439
get hash

431
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,440
and he would uh smoke house with me

432
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,399
lovely and so that would have been

433
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,680
interesting having access to such a

434
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,919
kind of

435
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,559
much more high quality and more potent

436
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,240
high how did you feel is did you realize

437
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,719
like that was something special or was

438
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,039
it just kind of whatever

439
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,759
hash was so prevalent where i'm from i'm

440
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,240
from like northwest london originally so

441
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,120
that's not far from labret grove lebron

442
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,198
portobello road market and there's loads

443
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,039
a huge moroccan community there there's

444
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,719
loads of moroccan calves and things like

445
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,120
that and because of the moroccan

446
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,278
population in that part of london you've

447
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,560
always been able to access incredible

448
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,480
moroccan hash

449
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,159
and also back then even there was a lot

450
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,318
of good indian hash as well there was a

451
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,639
lot more variety but the moroccan has

452
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,798
always been around so you kind of took

453
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,480
it for granted that was the real first

454
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,798
experiences there was a lot of hash that

455
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,078
was smoked my early experiences were

456
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:18,078
going half

457
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,918
on a five pound draw of uh hashish with

458
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,399
a friend and getting two pound fifties

459
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,919
worth each and that's always that's a

460
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,759
lot of reason why you kind of start

461
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,240
smoking with tobacco

462
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,279
and that becomes the culture in the uk

463
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,359
and

464
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,639
even when you smoked flowers people

465
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,959
would say oh you need a little bit of

466
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,038
tobacco to help it burn so there was

467
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,919
this kind of mythology around needing

468
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,960
tobacco to combine it

469
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,720
so what were the first strains that you

470
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
can remember the names of smoking

471
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,120
growing up let me have one guess uh

472
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,120
skunk

473
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,678
well bro that's the funny thing yeah i

474
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,439
remember the day my best friend phoned

475
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,798
me and said

476
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,200
barry

477
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,960
get whatever man you can and come round

478
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,120
we've got this new weed

479
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,200
it's called skunk it feels like my

480
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,199
head's a balloon on a string

481
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,399
and i'm like okay i'm coming and at that

482
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,199
point it was like five pounds for a gram

483
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,880
of like imported bud or five pound for a

484
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,519
gram of moroccan hashish and this like i

485
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,760
think it was like 10 10 pound for a gram

486
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,519
or maybe more but it was at least double

487
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,759
so the idea of all of a sudden having to

488
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,519
spend double that for this

489
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,519
tight little s

490
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,000
a luminous green

491
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,160
stinking bud that

492
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,679
just was called skunk it was like a new

493
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,320
thing this was like 95 1995 when we

494
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,120
started to get that beginning of 95 i

495
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,599
think it was around then

496
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,159
love it man and was that like a kind of

497
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,719
a paradigm shifting moment for you or

498
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,720
was it like

499
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,000
huge massive

500
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,759
massive that was like wow it

501
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
the high and the difference in the

502
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,798
effect was so impactful the smell the

503
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,880
flavor everything like that

504
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,879
it's like in your mind as a kid you're

505
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,120
like my god what kind of laboratory did

506
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,600
this come from like this is like

507
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,119
this is incredible what scientists

508
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,759
provided this

509
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,079
uh i'll happily pay double like it

510
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,679
changed everything we were just like our

511
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,599
heads were spun that's great so how long

512
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,640
was it between that point to when you

513
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,599
first started your own grow

514
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,400
i would have been 15 then so but i

515
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,639
basically had like a journey from the

516
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,559
age of 15 to like

517
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,440
20 when i started growing properly where

518
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,119
my dad and his best friend

519
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,400
would grow a couple of plants in our

520
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,798
back garden

521
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,360
and as kids we didn't know what it was

522
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,519
and then as we got to the age of 15

523
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,599
we realized and that was part of the

524
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,079
whole thing this is so this is a great

525
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,759
story that you'll love bro it's like

526
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,759
this is the kind of funny [ __ ] that just

527
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,879
like you have to laugh

528
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,279
i when i started smoking at 14 my best

529
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,360
friend i wasn't smoking with him

530
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,480
and he found out and told his [ __ ]

531
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,558
mum

532
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,558
and his mum was best friends with my mum

533
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,440
and now dads were best friends

534
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,359
so one morning i go to school to meet

535
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,080
him and his brother and cousins to go to

536
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,359
school and his mum says to me barry can

537
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,558
you come hear me now i'll have a talk

538
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,959
with you

539
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,279
and then she pulls me into the bedroom

540
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,319
and gives me a lecture about smoking

541
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:36,558
cannabis and the fact that i'm a 14 year

542
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,000
old and that cannabis isn't the worst

543
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,399
drug in the world but it's not

544
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,480
appropriate for a 14 year old i'm at

545
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,120
school i should be learning my brain's

546
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,759
still developing i shouldn't be smoking

547
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,279
and she gave me such a legit talk

548
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,119
and said to me like look i'm not going

549
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,480
to say nothing to your parents but stop

550
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,959
don't do it it's not it's not

551
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,440
appropriate and it was so

552
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,279
on the level that i literally stopped

553
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,038
like i was like brah i've got such a lie

554
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,038
like i believe that she's not gonna say

555
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,720
nothing and for that reason i'm just

556
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,679
gonna stop because

557
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,759
i've gotten off lightly here but how

558
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,240
harsh my friend i'll be honest what it

559
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,038
was my friend at the time he was so

560
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,919
jealous that i was smoking i'm so afraid

561
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,839
to do it himself and get caught that he

562
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,400
ended up snitching on me that was like

563
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,279
he's like outlet so

564
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,400
bro literally for then for maybe

565
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,558
six months or nine months i didn't smoke

566
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,720
and i would have like

567
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,639
friends at school particularly these two

568
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,038
girls that i always used to smoke with

569
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,919
yeah and most of the time they would buy

570
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,599
the weed and i would always roll it now

571
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,080
they would come to me and i would have

572
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,199
to roll the weed and i wouldn't smoke it

573
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,839
i'd stand with them and i had such like

574
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,038
good like restraint that for like six or

575
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,798
nine months i didn't and then one day my

576
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,400
friend comes into school and says to me

577
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,918
oh

578
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,679
me and my cousin smoked weed last night

579
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
we asked our pet my parents and they

580
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,640
said yeah

581
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,080
so he's now

582
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,640
got permission from his parents to smoke

583
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,119
so i'm like my mind's blown and what it

584
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,720
is is that his dad used to grow some

585
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:21,839
outdoor plants every year and he'd like

586
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,120
give away 95 of it and maybe smoke the

587
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,439
odd joint

588
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,119
for himself on his own like one night

589
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,720
when all the kids had gone to bed but

590
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,759
really he just enjoyed to grow in the

591
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,558
plants

592
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,240
and

593
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,359
it got to the point where my friend and

594
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,519
his cousin

595
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,079
went to his parents and just said look

596
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,558
we want to try cannabis we'd rather do

597
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,399
it at home and ask you

598
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,480
and see what it's like

599
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,240
we've tried alcohol it's like the

600
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,759
english culture is that you're allowed

601
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,679
to drink alcohol

602
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,200
parents will let kids drink alcohol no

603
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,519
problem there's nothing for them to go

604
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
like ah you're 14 yeah you can have a

605
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,279
beer at 14. oh yeah you can have a

606
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,519
shandy at 11. you know i mean like

607
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,839
people will give their kids alcohol from

608
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,000
early i'll be honest my parents were

609
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,918
very liberal with uh with drinking

610
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,558
alcohol so when we went on holidays for

611
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,880
instance like like a summer holiday two

612
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,399
weeks to cyprus we were allowed to drink

613
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,080
a few cocktails we're allowed like two

614
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,679
cocktails a night and that's when your

615
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,960
kids

616
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,038
and it's nothing can that's like a

617
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,720
normal thing and the bar staff wouldn't

618
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,720
even care for you to ask your parents

619
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,679
they would just serve you

620
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,240
so the alcohol culture in the uk that

621
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,600
exists is just extraordinary and people

622
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,919
just get into a negative kind of

623
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,158
social state of like thinking that the

624
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,919
only way you can socialize is to drink

625
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,080
alcohol and go to places where

626
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,480
everyone's paralytic drunk

627
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,720
people prey on one another or hitting on

628
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,679
each other you've got girls worried

629
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,600
about getting drinks spiked about being

630
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,840
too drunk and people taking advantage of

631
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:55,119
them people getting into fights because

632
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,918
of the alcohol and the stupidness and

633
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,839
all of these kind of things so although

634
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
to some people it may seem crazy for

635
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,678
kids to go to their parents and ask them

636
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,240
that it was probably a sensible thing

637
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,559
because i'll be honest what it done is

638
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,558
in the long term what it done is that i

639
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,558
then asked my parents

640
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,918
if i could smoke they discussed it with

641
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,158
their best friends who had more

642
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,559
experience about people that smoked and

643
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,799
they come to the decision that look

644
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,399
if they want to try it let them try it

645
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,798
if they want to do it let them do it in

646
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,159
the safety of our own home

647
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:30,639
on a weekend as a sociable thing

648
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,278
one of them is 17 almost 18 the other

649
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,759
one's 16. they can leave home now they

650
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,798
can have sex they can get married soon

651
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,798
if they want to try it then really it's

652
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,480
better that we know what they're doing

653
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,278
and we have an honest dialogue with our

654
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,599
kids because otherwise what will happen

655
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,359
is they will hide smoking cannabis and

656
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,158
then all of a sudden

657
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:55,038
that just opens up a gateway of deceit

658
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,960
that that whole dishonesty thing and my

659
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,798
parents never bought me up to be

660
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
dishonest that was the one thing that

661
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,119
was always instilled into me i was like

662
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,720
look you can come back from anything but

663
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,399
if you're a liar

664
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,558
it's hard to bounce back from being a

665
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,320
liar that's who you are it's like if you

666
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,200
[ __ ] up if you make a mistake whatever

667
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,759
you do

668
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,400
admit it own it up deal with it but

669
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,240
don't be a liar so when it comes to that

670
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,600
it was like my parents it was kind of

671
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,038
hard for them to get their head around

672
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,678
at first but in the end they just kind

673
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,839
of said okay let's do this and then what

674
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,200
would happen is they would give us this

675
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:29,199
is the funny part they would give us

676
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,759
like a little bit of bud from the crop

677
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,440
that his dad had like grown outdoors but

678
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,599
they didn't have an idea about what we

679
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,798
smoked so we were asking them for like

680
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,199
weed for the weekend and they were

681
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,960
giving us like a half ounce of this bud

682
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,440
and we're like yeah yeah that should be

683
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,038
about okay for saturday and sunday and

684
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,759
then we would have enough to just like

685
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,000
slowly last us throughout the week and

686
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,000
you just slowly become regular smokers

687
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,319
from the age of 15 i was like

688
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,759
consistently smoking and

689
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,599
it was uh

690
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,200
it was only hash that we would buy from

691
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,759
other people to begin with then the

692
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,360
skunk came in there was commercial bud

693
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,119
like jamaican

694
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,278
i missed out on thai

695
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,678
i think like once we had something that

696
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,640
claimed to be thai but it was dubious

697
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,000
because

698
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,240
i don't know if it's the same with you

699
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,919
but now they send bud from anywhere in

700
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,839
the world with just string thrown in

701
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,600
it's like there's no stick but they

702
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,678
think that if they put string in it

703
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,359
people just think it's time so in

704
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,960
england you'll get people always posting

705
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,959
pictures like yeah i've got this

706
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
authentic tie and it's got a bunch of

707
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,038
string in it and i'm like guys that's

708
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,360
just from africa it's [ __ ] weed they

709
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,798
just put some string in it to like as a

710
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,319
unique selling point so that they can

711
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:37,599
convince you this thai stick or

712
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:39,839
something

713
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,439
i have to send people like pictures of

714
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,798
like a thai stick look this is what it

715
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,400
is it's a whole process it's not just

716
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,240
got some string [ __ ] wrapped around

717
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,798
it come on guys

718
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,880
yeah wow so

719
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,119
tell me about your first grow what was

720
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,440
that like

721
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,719
the first thing i grew was one small

722
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,759
plant outdoors and it yielded about 10

723
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,480
grams

724
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,640
and it blew my mind how good it was and

725
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,679
then literally

726
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,679
i i had my best friend he had two plants

727
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,919
growing outdoors vegin

728
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,159
and i decided that

729
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,200
i was giving up tobacco

730
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,720
and uh

731
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,480
the best way to do it was to start

732
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
growing on my own so i got these two

733
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,880
plants off of my friend put them in the

734
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,640
corner of my bedroom went to ikea and

735
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,559
got a blackout blind

736
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,200
went to the grow shop

737
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:33,200
got some bottled nutrients

738
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:37,278
then i got a 400 watt hps i never had no

739
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,880
fan no filter no tent no nothing i

740
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:42,398
literally just had it in the corner of

741
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,840
my bedroom with a wardrobe kind of half

742
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:45,839
boxing it in

743
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,519
and at night i would just turn

744
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,278
everything off and i'd be in my bed even

745
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,278
i'd watch a little bit of tv because i

746
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,038
was like you know you have no concept of

747
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,798
like a hermaphrodite really at that

748
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,720
stage like i didn't really know what i

749
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,319
was doing i was

750
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,200
i was kind of like

751
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,119
winging it it's like so i just grew that

752
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,600
in the corner and

753
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,439
the real inspiration that got me like

754
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,240
that made me want to grow was the book

755
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,200
hashish by rob connell clark

756
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,960
before i before i fully grew indoors

757
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,519
from one of the head shops where i would

758
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,159
buy like high times magazine rolling

759
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,720
papers bongs and things like that i saw

760
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,960
the book hashish in there and i got that

761
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,720
book and read it from front to back and

762
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,440
literally when i got to the end of that

763
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,679
book that's when i decided like

764
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,840
never mind a little outdoor plant every

765
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,038
year just like they didn't matter i

766
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,359
wanted to become a grower i felt like

767
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,919
i understood so much about the plant

768
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,959
from reading that book that i wanted to

769
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,759
grow and from that i got jorge cervantes

770
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,759
book the grow bible and i literally read

771
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,879
that in something like

772
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,440
10 days

773
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,399
i went insane reading this book front to

774
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,000
back

775
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:57,759
and literally

776
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,159
finished it the next day that's when i

777
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,079
went and got all my equipment

778
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,760
good effort and so

779
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,079
how long was it before you found your

780
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,879
way onto the forums

781
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,639
well in jorge savannah's book

782
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,480
at the very back of it

783
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,640
it had

784
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,200
seedsdirect

785
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,840
and overgrow.com it actually had the

786
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,640
website links so as when i read that

787
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,480
book i actually discovered overgrow

788
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,880
and seeds direct

789
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,640
so i was able to get my first ever seeds

790
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:33,360
from gypsy nirvana's original website

791
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,520
and also go on to overgrow which just

792
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,359
blew my mind

793
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,519
wow what are some of the memorable

794
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,879
things you remember being around for on

795
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,679
the overgrow website or forums

796
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,240
i was just so overwhelmed by

797
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,120
everything that was going on for me just

798
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,038
a strain base i was obsessed with the

799
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,479
strain base with all the information

800
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,640
about the strains

801
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,720
it's like if there was a jeopardy

802
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,080
special subject thing on

803
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,440
strain base of overgrowth and genetics

804
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,038
released from like 2000 to 2010

805
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,038
that would be my specialist subject

806
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,640
because i would go through that in such

807
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,879
detail i knew every breeder every strain

808
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,120
name what the background was it was just

809
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,039
incredible to go on there and

810
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,398
to see some of the growers on there was

811
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,000
just wow

812
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,479
and so who are the breeders you were

813
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,440
looking up to at that time

814
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,038
for me it was always like

815
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,600
to begin with it was always the dutch

816
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,759
breeders like i was always like a big

817
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,839
fan of serious seeds

818
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,839
it's like serious seeds to me the way

819
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,839
they actually done their breeding and

820
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,879
came with everything was incredible for

821
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:45,439
me so that made a huge difference but

822
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,919
once i got onto the forums and started

823
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,519
to see all this american genetics that's

824
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,480
when things really got interesting

825
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,440
because

826
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,599
everyone in the uk was growing the dutch

827
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,759
strains that i was familiar with it's

828
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,519
like the people that i knew

829
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,200
those strains were available and it's

830
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,319
always the interest of getting something

831
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,960
unique that kind of got my eyes so the

832
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,960
minute i saw all of these uh unique

833
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,840
breeders like i remember getting bog

834
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,558
seeds one of these boggle gum and some

835
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,398
other things that were like

836
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,038
deep wreck things that like you know if

837
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,278
it had an elite clone involved in it it

838
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:24,079
was some kind of american genetic that

839
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,159
was like a clone only if someone was

840
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,319
working with something like that that is

841
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,720
what attracted me it was like i wanted

842
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,879
to grow things out that i knew when i

843
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,880
passed a joint to someone in the uk they

844
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,399
were going to be looking at the joint

845
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,559
for answers you know when you pass a

846
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,158
joint around to people they take a toke

847
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,158
and then they look at the joint as if to

848
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,760
say hold on a minute and then they look

849
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,799
around for some answers that's what i

850
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:49,440
wanted and it was it was things like

851
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,599
i remember getting sour bubble from fog

852
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,000
way back in the day which is like a

853
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,839
barbecue crust bubble gum and that was

854
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,960
just a game change and flavor bro that

855
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:02,319
kind of flavor is just next level same

856
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,120
with sour diesel same with

857
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,359
like

858
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,918
train wrecked herbs same with o.g

859
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,398
kushter the minute chem dog flavors came

860
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,840
along like i grew out

861
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,798
a lot of those flavors

862
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:16,879
pre-2010 and

863
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:20,639
it was like revolutionary when when

864
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,960
oregon kid done those og kush s1s that

865
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,320
was just insane for us bro to have og

866
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,759
kush like

867
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:30,158
in the early 2000s was just wild so

868
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,398
i always looked out for those boutique

869
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,159
breeders the little like

870
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,038
crazy guys that had something with a

871
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,039
story behind it something from

872
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,599
that no one else was growing that had

873
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:45,200
like documented photos that you could

874
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:47,918
see you you're onto something special

875
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,558
wow what a cool backstory and so

876
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,960
what's one of your favorite um kind of

877
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:57,319
nabs in terms of packs you picked up off

878
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,319
the site just off the top of your head

879
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,720
do you know what there was this is this

880
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:05,519
is one of the ones that deserves a

881
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,919
mention yeah there was a guy called jlp

882
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,640
john lee pettimore this was probably my

883
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,519
greatest discovery on over bro

884
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,840
and he transferred over to icymag.com

885
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,079
when that started up and he was a guy

886
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:21,199
called jlp which stood for john lee

887
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:24,240
pedimore and what he done he would make

888
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,880
seeds and give them out free and he was

889
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,599
the only person that was allowed to like

890
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,600
get addresses from people directly on ic

891
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,240
mag and was allowed to do that and deal

892
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,319
with people direct and he would send out

893
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,120
thousands upon thousands of packs of

894
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,439
seeds and he'd done the most incredible

895
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,199
seed projects with all the latest

896
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,600
greatest genetics that maybe other

897
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,919
people weren't able to snag and he'd

898
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,839
done cool projects where he'd done like

899
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,399
he'd done a cross once which was a i

900
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,798
love the concept he he done

901
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,278
two strains called romeo and juliet and

902
00:33:54,798 --> 00:34:00,240
i can't remember what the genetics were

903
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:02,558
but it was the same cross done both ways

904
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,200
so he used like a male new york city

905
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:08,239
diesel crossed something and then he

906
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,398
used the female new york city diesel

907
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,559
versus the opposite male and then he

908
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,319
released them as both romeo and juliet

909
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,358
so that people could grow both of them

910
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,399
together

911
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:22,078
and get an idea of what the male and

912
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:24,960
females impart differently and have some

913
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,919
kind of side by side comparison to see

914
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,000
what the results were for that

915
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,319
yeah that's a that's a cool little proof

916
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,398
of concept of doing side by sides with

917
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,399
people i guess the question that jumps

918
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,358
to mind immediately for me is

919
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:41,918
do you feel like when you do a kind of a

920
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,239
sense check yourself like that with the

921
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,679
two variant strains do you feel like

922
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,878
really at the end of the day what you're

923
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,878
testing is

924
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,480
your ability to select a good male

925
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,078
because what if in just one case you

926
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,159
pick a dud male and then in the other

927
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,440
you pick like a good one and that's the

928
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,800
reason why you get such different

929
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,200
results

930
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,920
yeah 100 100 percent

931
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,199
that's exactly it bro at the time like

932
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,119
the concept

933
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,960
is wonderful but

934
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,599
depending on the work that's gone into

935
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,838
it is how it's variant you know i mean

936
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,599
it really does make that difference like

937
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,599
it's a huge difference because like you

938
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,760
say without the male being without

939
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,599
knowing what your male does to begin

940
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,119
with that's that's one of my favorite

941
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,280
things is to actually figure out what

942
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,039
does a male do

943
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,480
yeah i guess that should be the goal of

944
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:30,838
all breeders to have that as a bit of a

945
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,838
pastime right but um

946
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,640
shouldn't be a unique thing it shouldn't

947
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,079
be like a mind-blowing concept to people

948
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,838
but they should be able to give you a

949
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,039
list of what a male does and be able to

950
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:46,159
show you in a variety of crosses those

951
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,159
results consistently so

952
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,078
yeah yeah that's a good one and i think

953
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,480
we'll touch on that in a bit but i just

954
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,200
want to rewind for a second so you were

955
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,960
snagging some cool packs off overgrown

956
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,480
something i picked up on which is really

957
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,400
probably one of the most obvious things

958
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,320
people will pick up on about you if they

959
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,720
google you is that you're quite well

960
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,320
known for your cut of casey jones is

961
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:10,719
this where you picked that pack up from

962
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,119
no do you know what casey jones

963
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:16,078
basically around 2000 i think it was in

964
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,960
2004 so like maybe

965
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,400
three two or three years into my being

966
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,400
on overgrowth uh maybe two years i think

967
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,680
i'd been on there overgrown now would

968
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,079
like kind of got

969
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,679
clogged down and there was loads of like

970
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,920
it kind of

971
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,679
it lost the community vibe the bigger

972
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,720
and bigger it got

973
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,719
and then i see mag started up

974
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,759
and because i had discovered that the

975
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,039
website gypsy nirvana seems direct they

976
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,800
had a shop

977
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,039
not far from london which was like

978
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,440
within driving distance to me and back

979
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:52,320
in the day you're so paranoid about

980
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,800
dealing with anything in the post online

981
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,960
anything like that that i contacted them

982
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,320
and said like oh i do work down there

983
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,000
there's only chance i can pass by and

984
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,519
they said like yeah we've got a shop and

985
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,838
they had like a little head shop where

986
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:07,119
you could go in and see them so for me i

987
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,519
went down there and actually met them so

988
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,599
when they started i see mag

989
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,400
that was kind of

990
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,440
like a big massive thing for me and

991
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,680
i i got into ic mag and that kind of got

992
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,119
the icy mag cup going and that's when i

993
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,759
started to meet

994
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,640
american growers and breeders at the icy

995
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,800
mag cup and through icy meg is where the

996
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,960
world of the industry and the community

997
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,760
really opened up to me because

998
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,599
i was able to see other people's flowers

999
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,359
that had been sent from america i was

1000
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,240
able to try

1001
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,759
cup entries for the icy mag cup from

1002
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,358
res dog and

1003
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,680
jimmy knits and

1004
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:48,400
smokey the puff master all of these guys

1005
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:51,759
that had the east coast sour diesel cut

1006
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,480
and got to try elite genetics and

1007
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,640
got to have my own blood there i was i

1008
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,719
was always someone that sent a shitload

1009
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,759
of bud over or took it with me so i

1010
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,598
always had a rucksack with like five

1011
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,680
tupperware containers fall to the brim

1012
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,680
with different flowers and always wanted

1013
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,078
to like see what was around and what was

1014
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,159
available and see what people thought

1015
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,560
and try better things so

1016
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,239
that was when i i got the casey jones

1017
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,960
seeds was when i met the heads because

1018
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:21,279
they were visiting europe so

1019
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,119
i met them at the icy mag cup got the

1020
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,960
seeds off of them and

1021
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,838
then the next year i entered it in the

1022
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,159
ic mad cup in 2007. i think i met them

1023
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:33,759
maybe 2005 and then 2007 i see my cup i

1024
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,719
had grown it out

1025
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,640
done massive selection i kind of like i

1026
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:41,199
selected not massive selection in the

1027
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:44,319
amount of seeds but massive selection

1028
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,319
and like dialing in i was so obsessed it

1029
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,079
was the first real time that i decided

1030
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,320
to like keep clones from seed selection

1031
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,680
so not only did i do the selection but

1032
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,200
then i grew it out so many times and i

1033
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,759
flowered out like

1034
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,480
40 plants and chopped it every single

1035
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,400
day from week 8 to week 11 and then i

1036
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,559
had them all jarred up with the exact

1037
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,960
day on them and then i would smoke them

1038
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,039
and whittle it down to the to the 10

1039
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,519
best days and then i grew it again and

1040
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,679
then i'd chop down like five plants on

1041
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,119
each of those 10 days and then i went

1042
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,838
through the best ones and whittled it

1043
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,640
down and then i'm like all right day 64

1044
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:24,880
is the day for this casey jones cup

1045
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,879
now this plant here is the best one of

1046
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,160
that batch this is the one i'm going to

1047
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,320
enter in the icy mad cup this year and

1048
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,879
i really thought about my entry a lot of

1049
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,359
people don't put fall into an entry like

1050
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,280
for me the key to winning a cup like

1051
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:42,480
that is if there's a 35 gram

1052
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,599
requirement

1053
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,838
you want to provide 35

1054
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:52,240
buds that weigh approximately 1.1 to 1.2

1055
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,838
grams so that by time the person takes

1056
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,879
out the twig and breaks it down they get

1057
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:59,039
their gram sample it's one but

1058
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,079
no one has to break up big buds of your

1059
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,320
entry

1060
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,240
because when competitions have to start

1061
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,920
dividing things up and doing those

1062
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,239
they're under pressure and they haven't

1063
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,599
got time to gently break up your big bud

1064
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,439
that you sent in because it was your

1065
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,760
best bud that doesn't work in a

1066
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,240
competition unless it's one where

1067
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,160
they're keeping half of it for a judge's

1068
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,399
panel that want to examine it in that

1069
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,159
detail when it comes down to individual

1070
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,800
judges you really think about

1071
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:28,639
presentation the trim job a nice boulder

1072
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,480
don't use the top buds that have been

1073
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,960
directly under the light go for the

1074
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,318
second shelf i always pick those like

1075
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,079
you know like if you're picking one

1076
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,480
grand buds it's never going to be those

1077
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,079
tops it's kind of the middle level ones

1078
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,920
that have got the best frost that have

1079
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,960
had a little bit of protection that are

1080
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,440
just

1081
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,000
stunning those are the ones

1082
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,720
of course yeah in the words of peabod

1083
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,880
the shoulders of the plant

1084
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,879
that's

1085
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,639
you entered the cup and what was the end

1086
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,318
outcome you got to you got to finish

1087
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,598
your story for us

1088
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:09,519
yeah basically i entered that year and

1089
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,760
at this point a lot of the uk

1090
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,599
were entering but everyone was smoking

1091
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,000
with tobacco in the uk at that point

1092
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,240
even a lot of the growers from ic meg so

1093
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,400
although other good growers entered when

1094
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,559
it came to all these americans being

1095
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,559
over and judging

1096
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,400
i was growing cocoa and had been growing

1097
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,039
pure for seven years like six seven

1098
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,760
years by that point so i was so obsessed

1099
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,159
with the flush that mine smoked so well

1100
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,960
and i had such a good entry and it went

1101
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,838
off so good that i finished second place

1102
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,800
to

1103
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:43,039
john lee pettimore jlp with sour diesel

1104
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,079
he grew out sour diesel and got first

1105
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:49,119
place i came second with casey jones so

1106
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,039
for me to come second to one of the

1107
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,960
internet legends

1108
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,318
was just like a dream come true that

1109
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,318
just like

1110
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:58,719
that for me still was like just the most

1111
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:01,279
incredible one because it opened up a

1112
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,759
whole world of like friends and

1113
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,680
amazing contacts and just

1114
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
lost everything blossom from that point

1115
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,440
onwards

1116
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,880
yeah it sounds like an awesome win i

1117
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,039
guess the thing which immediately jumps

1118
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,358
to mind for me is when you first started

1119
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,440
growing it out and dialing it in did you

1120
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,880
realize how special of a cut it was or

1121
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,318
did you think like it was just pretty

1122
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,640
good

1123
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:25,119
no i knew it was nuts bro it was nuts

1124
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:29,039
the thing was yielding ridiculous like

1125
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:31,280
my first plant of it i yielded like 12

1126
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,079
ounces from the seed plant in a 10 liter

1127
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,079
pot of cocoa

1128
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,880
it's like it was just ridiculous and the

1129
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,880
turps on it were just insane it was like

1130
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,318
it was one of those ones like i said if

1131
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,800
you're at a party

1132
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,599
and you roll a joint you pass it round

1133
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,920
and as it goes round you see people toke

1134
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,760
on the joint look at the joint and then

1135
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,358
look around the circle to ask someone

1136
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,359
like what the [ __ ] is this

1137
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,440
because it's literally hitting them with

1138
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,799
so much flavor that it's just in their

1139
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,159
mouth

1140
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,000
hell yeah that's that's the goal right

1141
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,239
it was all unique it had like the

1142
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,960
background of casey jones is orient

1143
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:11,598
express which is billy goats bangkok

1144
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,358
betty a chocolate tie cross train wreck

1145
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,880
and then that was crossed with sour

1146
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:15,920
diesel

1147
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,720
so

1148
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,800
completely unique things like it was uh

1149
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,959
there was no familiarity in any of those

1150
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,039
flavors to the to the palette of like a

1151
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,800
uk smoker

1152
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:28,400
hell yeah so

1153
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,680
there were some other cuts of casey

1154
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,160
jones that went around there was like

1155
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,159
the schmo cart but yours was um

1156
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:35,679
considered the best for sure but what

1157
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:37,279
did you think of the others did you ever

1158
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,039
get to try them

1159
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,000
you know it's funny i had two cuts

1160
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,199
myself i had a typhino as well that was

1161
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,159
incredible

1162
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,279
but

1163
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,679
i let it go it's like i was then still

1164
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,000
at the mindset of like oh i can't have

1165
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,318
two katy jones you know like i'm trying

1166
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,159
to only really keep six mothers or

1167
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:57,119
something like that and i always love

1168
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,799
the like

1169
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,039
mindset of like

1170
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,800
a new one's gotta come in and knock one

1171
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,199
of those off and eventually i have to

1172
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,720
whittle down my selection so that i have

1173
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:10,719
one of each strain i was naive to the to

1174
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,679
the reality of

1175
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:16,959
two of the same strain being unique

1176
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:19,039
enough to warrant both being kept

1177
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,199
yeah i can uh

1178
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,679
i can certainly feel myself being guilty

1179
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,598
of that one as well at times regrets bro

1180
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,480
regrets but you know what

1181
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,640
the strain was passed out and i smoked

1182
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,240
it a couple of years later

1183
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,239
and it was given to me as something

1184
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,639
different they had mixed it up they were

1185
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:39,279
calling it the mass sour because we had

1186
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,598
a massachusetts super skunk cross sour

1187
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,119
bubble and they gave me the bud and when

1188
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,720
they gave it to me i go this is the

1189
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,960
casey jones cup i didn't even need to

1190
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:49,358
smell it nothing i goes that's not mass

1191
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,960
sour that's the casey jones but the guys

1192
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,480
wouldn't believe me

1193
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,159
it's my cuts both of them but they

1194
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,679
wouldn't believe me

1195
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,879
ah there you go

1196
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,358
well

1197
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,760
full circle right so

1198
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:04,960
were you breeding at that point

1199
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,520
no do you know what bro i

1200
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,720
i wanted to become the best possible

1201
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,880
grower i could and i held breeders in

1202
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,439
such high regard

1203
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,519
that breeding wasn't even on my radar

1204
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,400
until it was until i was asked to do a

1205
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,960
project

1206
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,200
for someone the idea of breeding is like

1207
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,358
i had friends around me that were like

1208
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:28,000
growing hobby growers like myself like

1209
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,279
my friend dr d online

1210
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,960
he

1211
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,880
i would grow out his seeds and he'd do

1212
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,280
little hobby breeding projects and even

1213
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,000
at that stage for me i was like

1214
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,480
i knew that there was there were levels

1215
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,358
that i hadn't reached as a grower the

1216
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,960
idea of breeding was like to me a slap

1217
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,199
in the face of people that were doing it

1218
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,880
because i thought you had to i thought

1219
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:51,039
you should get to a certain

1220
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,039
like master your craft in one regard

1221
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,079
before you try and get to a next stage

1222
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:55,838
so

1223
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,640
it wasn't until

1224
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,119
i

1225
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,239
competed in the ic mad cup

1226
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:06,400
i saw that my bud was on the levels i

1227
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,159
met mrs uh grateful grateful head's wife

1228
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,240
she was in the uk and i got to spend

1229
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:13,358
some time with her and she got to smoke

1230
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,479
everything i had and she told me like

1231
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,679
barry

1232
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,280
just true your stuff is on point like

1233
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,719
you're on the level of all of us in

1234
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,200
america

1235
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,598
like did this is the truth of it bro the

1236
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,439
best growers in the world are a nine out

1237
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,359
of ten

1238
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,318
that's my thing there's no diet there's

1239
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:35,440
no tens because we all know that for

1240
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:39,199
every single minute of every single day

1241
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,838
of an entire crop to go perfectly

1242
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,118
doesn't happen

1243
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:45,440
eventually it will get to that point

1244
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,720
because technology and

1245
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,679
room

1246
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:51,679
setups and grow techniques are evolving

1247
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,519
but at the moment it's not at that level

1248
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:56,318
and how i feel is that the best grower

1249
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,800
in the world on a day-to-day

1250
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:01,119
is an eight out of ten occasionally when

1251
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,240
you hit a nine that's when you say to

1252
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,318
your peers

1253
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,719
check this one out this one's special

1254
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,119
that's when i will like bother saying

1255
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,199
something i'll maybe have 30 jaws

1256
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,800
sometimes and offer them up just like

1257
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,919
yeah i've got this i've got this i've

1258
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,960
got this but there'll be one that i know

1259
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,079
pete

1260
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,240
one

1261
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,400
that really stood out and is on that

1262
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,799
level it's like ironically enough that

1263
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,680
spannabis last year i grew a cheese

1264
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,280
plant that was that level it was like oh

1265
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:32,318
this is as good as i've ever grown a

1266
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,720
plant for whatever reason this one had

1267
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:37,440
the right

1268
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,759
fruit zone it was healthy happy the

1269
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,400
light was correct the temperature was

1270
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,000
right and people was were going crazy

1271
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,039
about it i've never had people people

1272
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,280
were just shocked they're like [ __ ]

1273
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:49,199
hell brianna cheese like this ever like

1274
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,559
people were like really really excited

1275
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,239
about it and it was one of those ones

1276
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,920
that i knew it was the one i was saying

1277
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:56,239
to people like look these are all my

1278
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,800
things but even though these are all my

1279
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,118
creations this [ __ ] cheese just came

1280
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,839
out crazy check it out and

1281
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,559
that is it really like i i realized like

1282
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:08,799
once i realized i was in that realm of

1283
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,359
being able to attain

1284
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,400
eights and nines occasionally that's

1285
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:18,159
when you kind of i was willing to take

1286
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,480
on the concept of doing some breeding

1287
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:22,799
fantastic so we're gonna we're gonna

1288
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,639
lose our linearity in time for a moment

1289
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,559
fast forward for a second i've heard

1290
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,960
from a few various sources that you

1291
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,760
frequently have the best flower at

1292
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,440
spannabis most of the time

1293
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,200
do you agree with that and what do you

1294
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,119
feel is the kind of state of affairs

1295
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,118
with the flower at spanibus in general

1296
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,440
also there's turps army farm there's

1297
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,960
there's i've got to mention them because

1298
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,039
there's a couple

1299
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,358
a uk girl and i think a boyfriend's

1300
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,440
italian they're called terps army farm

1301
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,279
on instagram first of all i have to

1302
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,519
shout them out because

1303
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,160
i have a massive amount of respect for

1304
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:02,559
them they grow on that level their

1305
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,920
people that i would say are on the elite

1306
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,880
level of like

1307
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,200
yeah they're growing eights nines

1308
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,559
consistently they really put into work

1309
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,318
and they really have a love and a

1310
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,160
passion for it so

1311
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,759
before i pick myself up i definitely

1312
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,759
gotta give them a shout out because i

1313
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,599
love what they're doing and there are

1314
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,280
other people that have got some amazing

1315
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,880
buds but

1316
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,160
like

1317
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,358
i always plan for spannabis especially

1318
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,318
it's like

1319
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,400
from

1320
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,358
from always if there's an event

1321
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,880
nothing pleases me more than being there

1322
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:38,639
in my element around my peers and people

1323
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,358
that when you show them things they

1324
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:43,279
appreciate it so i go above and beyond

1325
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:46,719
and out of my way to try and make sure

1326
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:49,040
that i've perfectly dialed everything

1327
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,959
down to the time in so that the flowers

1328
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,199
haven't been cured for too long they're

1329
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,400
not too fresh try and get everything

1330
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,399
right and

1331
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,119
really just flush everything it's like

1332
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,960
my genetics i believe in and i know that

1333
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,000
if i flush everything right and it's

1334
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,318
clean then that makes it stand out

1335
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,400
because i know there's a lot of like

1336
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:09,920
oh why ash is a myth and all of these

1337
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,318
kind of things it's like i'm no

1338
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,079
scientist but i know the white ashes the

1339
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,920
more i enjoy it so

1340
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,440
i don't want to talk for anyone else i'm

1341
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,720
not saying i haven't had things that

1342
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,838
don't burn

1343
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:25,118
a little bit gray that weren't nice but

1344
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:27,599
whiter ash is a smoother cleaner more

1345
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,200
enjoyable smoke for me and

1346
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,838
those results

1347
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,759
are shown by the feedback that i get and

1348
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:37,279
you'll notice that anyone that's ever

1349
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,599
talking about my bud in a good regard is

1350
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,160
often talking about the flush and how

1351
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:45,440
clean it smokes

1352
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:47,279
yeah for sure so let's go back in time

1353
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,880
now and go back

1354
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,880
tell me about the first cross you ever

1355
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,400
made was it intentional or was it an

1356
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,640
accident

1357
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,240
you know it's funny the first the first

1358
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:00,000
cross i ever made i lost a project

1359
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:03,598
before i ever got to

1360
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:07,039
harvest the seeds or grow them out

1361
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,039
that's kind of what got me

1362
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,118
on the path of breeding i was doing a

1363
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,000
project for someone else

1364
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,280
so

1365
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,719
for res dog from reservoir seed

1366
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,760
like that will have people like that

1367
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,679
that'll get people super like that

1368
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,599
triggered a bunch of people now but it's

1369
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,679
like don't worry guys

1370
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,079
i learned he was a [ __ ] scumbag too

1371
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:30,799
just like everyone else but it's part of

1372
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,318
my

1373
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,400
my history nonetheless so yeah i

1374
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:38,719
i was actually doing a project i was

1375
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,280
doing a chem dog ibl

1376
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,399
so i had uh started doing that project

1377
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,359
for res

1378
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,880
uh

1379
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:48,838
because he knew that i knew the chem d

1380
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,400
i had got a lot of

1381
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:55,440
uh familiarity with that cutting by

1382
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,400
being around it a lot on the east coast

1383
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,159
so

1384
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,559
when he actually asked me to do a

1385
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:05,598
project it was the chem ibl because

1386
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,920
i realized two reasons one i was

1387
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,400
familiar with it and two because it was

1388
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,159
the ibl he realized that he could ask me

1389
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,519
to do the project without having to give

1390
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,440
me the cut

1391
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,599
because it was just

1392
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,800
crossing the seeds and crossing and

1393
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,079
doing an ibl so inbred line so

1394
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,839
i didn't need to actually use the

1395
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,519
cutting he just wanted me to select

1396
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:26,799
multiple males

1397
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,759
and hit

1398
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,760
the best females

1399
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,160
yeah he did a lot of interesting stuff

1400
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,559
where he'd like you know bx it then f2

1401
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,719
it or f3 and stuff like that did he

1402
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,720
explain to his rationale behind that at

1403
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:43,358
all

1404
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:44,879
he was a fan of

1405
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,279
mr souls

1406
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,358
and the cinderella 99 and the back

1407
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,240
crossing theory

1408
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:52,880
so

1409
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,318
that was his thoughts on that

1410
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,160
some of it

1411
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:57,759
as people will tell you there were there

1412
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:59,279
were versions that were good there were

1413
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,440
ones that were bad there were ups and

1414
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,160
downs some of it he did himself some of

1415
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,000
you farmed out to other people often it

1416
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:07,039
was farmed out to friends who [ __ ] it

1417
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,639
up and

1418
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:11,119
the seeds still went out so there were

1419
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:13,118
bad batches so it was all there was

1420
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,599
always crazy stuff like that going on

1421
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,400
the last batch of cell diesel ibl wasn't

1422
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:21,039
made by him that was made by

1423
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,200
basically connoisseur genetics who

1424
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,800
just used two clones that weren't even

1425
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,960
given to him by

1426
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,880
res dog they were two cell diesel clones

1427
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,800
sourced by someone else and

1428
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,760
it was just easier for rez to do that he

1429
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,760
was so burnt by getting

1430
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,319
scammed for the east coast sour diesel

1431
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,440
cut anyone who remembers icy mag will

1432
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:42,079
remember

1433
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,119
the friendly friend fiasco where someone

1434
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,440
came

1435
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,880
uh that was their name friendly friend

1436
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,880
it's like if someone's professing

1437
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,240
themselves to be called friendly friend

1438
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,599
it's like

1439
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,879
you're pushing it a bit too hard this

1440
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,640
friendliness you know i mean you should

1441
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,559
have been suspicious with the name but

1442
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:59,358
he ended up getting the east coast our

1443
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,519
diesel cut off res and starting his own

1444
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:04,239
line where he used that cup but called

1445
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:06,079
it indonesian diesel and there was this

1446
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:08,639
big drama on icy mag and it was

1447
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,160
hilarious but after that res dog like

1448
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,199
didn't want to give out the cut ever

1449
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,920
because

1450
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:16,719
you if you know the forum world back

1451
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,880
then cuts were so guarded that

1452
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:21,358
once it was out and people had it they

1453
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,000
were using it breeding it trading it it

1454
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:26,000
was it was a crazy world for cuts back

1455
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,159
in the day you had to earn your stripes

1456
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,639
to get a cut in things have changed so

1457
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,719
much these days it's like

1458
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:34,719
yeah back in the day it was like it was

1459
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,798
a sign of respect to know that you had

1460
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:39,279
like certain cuts because you had done

1461
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:41,039
something to get to that point where

1462
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,079
someone offered you a cut you wouldn't

1463
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,480
go out asking for cuts you would earn

1464
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,240
your stripes by putting in the work and

1465
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,920
then the right people would see what you

1466
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,519
were doing and offer you the right

1467
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,440
things

1468
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,838
yeah wow

1469
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,159
so i guess the question that i want to

1470
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,558
ask is how did you lose the project as

1471
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:03,199
you said

1472
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:06,480
basically being in a prohibition state

1473
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:10,159
like the uk where i used to live

1474
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,480
the house got robbed for the growth

1475
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,159
oh no

1476
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,358
which is

1477
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,199
it's like

1478
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,759
the way things always work right like i

1479
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,598
say loose lips sink ships and what

1480
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,760
happened is that the business partner

1481
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,920
who arranged a property

1482
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,160
had a best friend and that best friend

1483
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,599
robbed us

1484
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,159
because

1485
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,519
sadly with prohibition and the way

1486
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,838
things are it brings a lot of negative

1487
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:39,838
attention from the wrong types of people

1488
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:42,000
and people will get into their heads

1489
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,759
that they can justify doing those kind

1490
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,599
of things and

1491
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,960
all of a sudden you lose a project and

1492
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,720
it's like

1493
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,199
it was a sad thing to lose it's like i

1494
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,598
had two rooms one was the seed project

1495
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,759
and one was the flower project

1496
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,000
it's like

1497
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,680
to lose the seeds was more heartbreaking

1498
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,119
it's like you're [ __ ] idiots you've

1499
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,960
stolen a bunch of seeds that are

1500
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,440
worthless to you like

1501
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,920
and now i've lost everything so that was

1502
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,920
that was the first loss i ever had it's

1503
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,358
like the first time i ever did anything

1504
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,358
with anyone other than myself

1505
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,280
i lost the

1506
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,920
project so what happened after that you

1507
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,680
just started working with res

1508
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,920
after that by that stage

1509
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,759
i then stopped working with res res was

1510
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,680
doing all kinds of weird [ __ ] he

1511
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,440
basically blocked a mutual friend from

1512
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:36,960
giving me the east coast sour diesel car

1513
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,679
like to some super slime moves and

1514
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,880
he had like uh just generally started to

1515
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,719
show his true colors and reveal himself

1516
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,880
not to be

1517
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:49,039
like this is the thing with res his

1518
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,358
perception online

1519
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,279
was a scumbag piece of [ __ ] he used to

1520
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:56,159
come across so rude and abrasive that he

1521
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,240
wasn't likable i clashed with him online

1522
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:59,920
the only reason i ever got to know him

1523
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:01,759
is because i was friends with grateful

1524
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,358
head and mrs grateful the creators of

1525
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,240
casey jones

1526
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:09,440
i was friends with them and they in turn

1527
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,838
were friends with res dog

1528
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,358
hmm there you go and i guess they just

1529
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:15,039
had a better relationship with him than

1530
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:16,719
most i guess

1531
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,798
yeah and

1532
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:21,519
that's how i met him by going to america

1533
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:22,318
to visit them and then in turn meeting

1534
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:24,239
him

1535
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:25,519
and i got to be in those circles and be

1536
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,279
around him

1537
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:30,318
then over a period of time he just

1538
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,119
turned out to be a [ __ ]

1539
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,920
a major major piece of [ __ ] in real life

1540
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,240
but

1541
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,920
as with a lot of people who have like a

1542
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:39,439
certain degree of intelligence they're

1543
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,440
able to say the right things at the

1544
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,200
right time to people tune into their

1545
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:48,000
frequency and use them to their own

1546
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,358
ends and gain so

1547
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,760
that's that's the kind of person he

1548
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:54,639
turned out to be and then

1549
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,000
yeah i was kind of lucky that

1550
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,759
when they had

1551
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,880
a whole bunch of drama and all got

1552
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,920
busted

1553
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,400
i was in prison myself so

1554
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,960
i wasn't visiting america seeing them at

1555
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,318
that time gladly

1556
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:13,039
wow jail how did that happen

1557
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:15,279
i got busted with my partner at

1558
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:17,759
connoisseur genetics basically after the

1559
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,519
first res dog project

1560
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,200
i had all of my

1561
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:23,679
female selections

1562
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,919
from the chem project plus i had all of

1563
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:28,798
my female selections from just growing

1564
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,480
as a grower because i would have like i

1565
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,480
had a variety of different things i had

1566
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,079
mo breath from jimmy knits back in the

1567
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,838
day this is like 2008 2009 i had it

1568
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,920
before it had a name it was just crosses

1569
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:42,639
that he gave me when i went and visited

1570
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,358
america because i've i met jimmy nitz in

1571
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:47,519
america he's one of the best growers

1572
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,679
most humble and he's the guy that

1573
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:50,639
changed my whole thoughts on feminized

1574
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:53,919
seeds

1575
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:57,118
his san fernando valley reversal that he

1576
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,280
done to train wreck and to the chemd

1577
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,039
are to this day

1578
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,720
my top

1579
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:06,880
10 femmes i've ever grown

1580
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:09,679
probably mo breath motograf's in my

1581
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,440
probably top five ever

1582
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,118
well it's interesting you say that

1583
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,798
because i actually had the question i

1584
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,640
wanted to ask you

1585
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,960
do you ever feel like motor breath is

1586
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:20,239
kind of similar to the truth on paper

1587
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,559
they look like they've got a lot of

1588
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:25,598
similar elements

1589
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,559
basically i've tried to get that same

1590
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,240
chem

1591
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:32,640
terp is what i love they're far gas 80s

1592
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,479
joke shop fart gas that's hurt that

1593
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,118
smell that people smelling a rock that

1594
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,318
smells like fart gas that is what kim d

1595
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,960
smells like to me in its essence so with

1596
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,318
the motor breath you had like an og

1597
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,119
structure

1598
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:46,880
with

1599
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,000
that foul

1600
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,079
rotten

1601
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,318
chem d stank

1602
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,680
and that's what i like in the truth

1603
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:55,838
right that does come through in the

1604
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,838
truth that that's a terp that i love and

1605
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:01,679
i i've often like worked

1606
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:05,599
towards would you consider the truth to

1607
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:08,879
be kind of your most well-known strain

1608
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:11,838
yeah terpzilla as well is like

1609
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,160
quite well known that one

1610
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:16,960
like was grown out by a good few friends

1611
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,798
and got into some good growers hands so

1612
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,199
it won a few cups that's another one

1613
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:23,679
that's real well known and hyped up but

1614
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,598
i've had that for a long time as well so

1615
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:28,239
and i've never released it so it's kind

1616
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,000
of i think that's more kind of made it

1617
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:31,358
more well known as well the fact it

1618
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,039
hasn't been released it's just been

1619
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:36,558
grown and people have got to smoke it

1620
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:38,159
and it's picked up a few cups

1621
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,400
it's interesting you mentioned the terp

1622
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,318
zillow because that one uses the

1623
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,559
terparella and that one caught my eye

1624
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:46,480
because it's got that chocolate tie in

1625
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,400
it and i was wondering where did that

1626
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,039
come from and do you think that maybe

1627
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,559
plays a role in why terp zillow even

1628
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,639
though a bit of a distant relative why

1629
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,440
it does kind of shine through as one of

1630
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,558
your more well-known crosses

1631
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,639
do you know what it is i think it may be

1632
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,480
getting them mixed up yeah it should

1633
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:04,318
have sent chocolate that i'll be honest

1634
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,039
with you that strain there is a femme

1635
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:09,519
seed that an icy mag member made and

1636
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:11,838
when i started true kind of genetics

1637
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:14,559
i'll be honest i never i don't like

1638
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:16,400
making femme seeds that's true from it

1639
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,640
so when i originally started true

1640
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,559
candogenetics i was under pressure to

1641
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:23,759
release some femme seeds

1642
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,280
and one of my friends had made the

1643
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,559
cross supersorba haze which is

1644
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,920
turperella so he had those seeds and i

1645
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,280
just said to him look bro i'll release

1646
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,599
those through true kind of genetics

1647
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,599
because i need to sell some femme seeds

1648
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,280
because the market is just going crazy

1649
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,359
for them at the moment and i don't want

1650
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,480
to make them i want to focus on regular

1651
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:42,639
breeding

1652
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:46,079
so that one isn't even made by me that's

1653
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:48,480
the one and only time a strain or

1654
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:52,160
anything has ever been released by me

1655
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,440
that wasn't made by me myself the seeds

1656
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:54,960
so it's nice to get that out there

1657
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,119
because you know what i mean it's like

1658
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,559
it's not something i try and hide and

1659
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,160
generally it's not something i would

1660
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,720
ever do but

1661
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,000
that one yeah that one isn't made by me

1662
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,480
yeah that's all good we've heard other

1663
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,760
breeders talk about doing similar things

1664
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,199
so i mean we've talked about how the

1665
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,599
truth is one of your like more

1666
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:14,000
well-known strains but let's put that in

1667
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,599
contrast to what do you feel is your

1668
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,199
best strain like it may be there's

1669
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,880
something which kind of flies under the

1670
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,798
radar a little bit what's your personal

1671
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,960
favorite

1672
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:25,440
i'll be honest with you you know what

1673
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,240
the real like the real king strain for

1674
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,480
me

1675
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,399
is my chem valley cooks

1676
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,400
but i've not released it because my

1677
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,039
whole philosophy behind that is that

1678
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,559
when i got the forum cut i got it from

1679
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:41,119
an ic mag member called crunch bubble uh

1680
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,519
he got it with the crew

1681
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,680
that he's with in san francisco another

1682
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,239
grower called abba roots whose

1683
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:50,159
seed company is called always be

1684
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:50,959
flowering i think it is

1685
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,440
and

1686
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,798
they passed us the cut like i when i

1687
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,880
came out of prison in 2011

1688
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:01,440
they sent me the forum girl scout

1689
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,920
cookies and that was a groundbreaking

1690
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,960
strain but when i bred with it i knew

1691
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,519
that like i get no pride from breeding

1692
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,920
something that just tastes like cookies

1693
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:14,480
so what i'd done is when i created chem

1694
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,680
valley cooks and crossed it with an sfv

1695
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:20,079
chem dog mail i never wanted to release

1696
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,719
that because really it was very cookie

1697
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:25,519
dominant the females what i wanted to do

1698
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,798
was search for a male that when i bred

1699
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:29,358
with that male

1700
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:32,159
it gave all of the bag appeal

1701
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:34,960
and favorable traits of the cookies but

1702
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:37,358
allowed me to impart all of the flavor

1703
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,440
from the mother plant

1704
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:41,598
and that's why i love the chem valley

1705
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,639
cooks because it's allowed me as a

1706
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:47,519
breeding tool to release a variety of

1707
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:49,279
strains now that are giving me deter

1708
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:51,280
profiles that i want

1709
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,119
but the bag appeal that the modern

1710
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,280
market is obsessed with

1711
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,160
so i've got one at the moment like

1712
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,559
called

1713
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:01,038
crimson cookies and another one called

1714
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,119
cheminade the cheminade everyone's

1715
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,200
loving at the moment and that's a great

1716
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,160
lemonade across with the chem valley

1717
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,558
cooks

1718
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:12,318
and grape lemonade is a

1719
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,720
lemon larry og cross chem dog cross

1720
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:17,279
granddaddy purple

1721
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:19,439
wow okay and so when could we expect

1722
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,359
possibly i would possibly be able to get

1723
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,880
those for ourselves

1724
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,960
that one's available at the moment the

1725
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,599
cheminade's available in regular seeds

1726
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,079
now those are out there all my seeds

1727
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,920
come in packs of 15. the reason i do

1728
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:34,318
that is because you know what i'm

1729
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,119
obsessed with

1730
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:37,199
like

1731
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,240
as a grower i always wanted to be able

1732
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:40,639
to have

1733
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:42,959
my selection and then keep a few so for

1734
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:45,759
the average grower i'm confident that

1735
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,039
from a pack of 15 seeds you can pot 10

1736
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,760
seeds

1737
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:52,799
find at least one amazing keeper and

1738
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,799
then have five seeds so if ever anything

1739
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:56,639
happens you've got five seeds from that

1740
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:59,038
original pack because there's something

1741
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:01,519
in growers heads that no matter what

1742
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,079
if they've had a keeper from a pack of

1743
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:06,960
seeds and they lose it

1744
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,519
even if it's the same

1745
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,440
like strain same parents

1746
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:13,679
they really have an affinity for that

1747
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,599
pack of seeds that it came from so if

1748
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,838
they've got a few left over that they

1749
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:20,240
can go back to they've got like they

1750
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:22,960
feel more happy that they've got that so

1751
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:24,798
i kind of feel like 15 seeds in a pack

1752
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,599
is a nice number for a grower to have

1753
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:27,679
and

1754
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:29,680
give them a little backup

1755
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,598
yeah i like that applied psychology and

1756
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,960
breeding and marketing there we go a new

1757
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,400
one but um

1758
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,760
i just want to go back to a minute

1759
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,680
because i was actually talking to our

1760
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,440
buddies from always be flowering just

1761
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:40,480
earlier today in fact and he mentioned i

1762
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,519
mentioned i was going to be chatting

1763
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,798
with you

1764
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,480
and he actually basically kind of

1765
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:47,119
relayed similar information to what you

1766
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,240
just said but what i wanted to ask was

1767
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,640
he said you know you were one of the

1768
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:53,118
first people if not you know the first

1769
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:55,199
person in the uk to get the forum cut

1770
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,559
how did that change the scene was it

1771
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,318
like what happened at that point when

1772
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,440
you got it

1773
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:04,400
without any shadow of a doubt

1774
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,318
we were the first me like i

1775
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,559
the cuts were sent to me and immediately

1776
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:11,358
shared with my business partner at the

1777
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,720
time uh ojd of connoisseur genetics

1778
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:13,519
that's who i was working with at the

1779
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,759
time

1780
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:18,798
we i got those cuts it was incredible

1781
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,599
bro i couldn't believe how

1782
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:21,519
how

1783
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,680
how they got to me like literally we

1784
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,759
come out of prison got messaged by my

1785
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,960
buddy crunch bubble and he said look man

1786
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,720

1789
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,079
cut

1790
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,000
and they were there within three days i

1791
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,640
had six rooted cuts of the girl scout

1792
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,599
cookies and six unrooted cuts

1793
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:44,879
they all rooted and all of a sudden we

1794
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:48,559
had the most insane

1795
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:51,440
mind-blowing strain we had seen in

1796
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,039
[ __ ] years it was a game changer bro

1797
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,000
it literally

1798
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,200
like

1799
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,639
people

1800
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:01,838
in london

1801

01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:14,078
pound grams per kilo

1807
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,719
and that was people were buying that

1808
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:19,599
happily doubling their money and it was

1809
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:21,759
selling out people were like going home

1810
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,680
raiding their bank [ __ ] looking down

1811
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,240
the sofa people like

1812
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,159
okay i'll get 10 10 i'll get 10 20 draws

1813
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:30,159
like people were just going crazy for it

1814
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:33,038
it was a game changer bro it's that

1815
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:34,318
level where every now and again a tert

1816
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,880
profile

1817
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:39,679
a look something comes along you know

1818
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:42,880
like at one point it was purple but that

1819
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:44,960
was so rare when the blackberry uh cut

1820
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,519
that was on overgrow popped up it was

1821
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,199
like my god purple bud like and that's

1822
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:51,280
how it is when new buds come along

1823
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:53,519
they're just game changers and cookies

1824
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,798
did that it's like it was crazy the

1825
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:58,239
people that got it were going well

1826
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,079
hell yeah and so

1827
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,919
were you breeding at that point or were

1828
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,760
you looking to get back into it after

1829
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,920
your little steve yeah

1830
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,359
yeah we were breeding at that point it's

1831
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,119
like the

1832
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:11,199
the truth of it is is that at

1833
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:14,400
connoisseur genetics when when we were

1834
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:17,119
making seeds ojd was making seeds i was

1835
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,600
making seeds and ojd had another friend

1836
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:22,079
who was making a lot of seeds for us too

1837
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,560
so when we were locked up we were still

1838
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:27,119
having seeds produced so we were never

1839
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,279
stopping me and oj

1840
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,439
we're no longer friends we don't get on

1841
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:34,239
things happen perspective different

1842
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,000
views such as life but we went through

1843
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,238
some adventures and when we got locked

1844
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,798
up and we're in prison for trying to win

1845
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:44,879
a high times and getting busted

1846
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:48,238
we sat in prison made strain names up

1847
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,719
made phone calls relayed that info had

1848
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,439
us work still released

1849
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,480
and

1850
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:56,238
lived on in prison we did not stop i

1851
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,559
made a point of teaching at least five

1852
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:00,079
people how to grow when i was in prison

1853
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,239
i made a point i was like you think

1854
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:04,158
you'll stop me but you will multiply me

1855
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:07,278
because i will teach

1856
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:09,039
as many people as possible how easy it

1857
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:10,799
is and what a wonderful life you can

1858
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:12,399
have from growing and that's what i made

1859
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:15,278
a point of doing we continued to run the

1860
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:17,519
business i learned photoshop and use it

1861
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:19,040
in my business to this day it's like i

1862
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,520
made the most of it i was like you won't

1863
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:24,719
stop me i'll use it against

1864
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:28,159
the the system and i'll use it for my

1865
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:30,960
for my cannabis business

1866
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:34,798
fantastic so at what point did you

1867
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,880
diverge and start your own company

1868
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:38,560
basically after we came out of prison me

1869
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:41,759
and oj tried to

1870
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,359
work together and as with a lot of

1871
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,679
people that do business together

1872
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,079
business and friendship doesn't mix so

1873
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,798
it got to the point where i walked away

1874
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,399
from connoisseur genetics

1875
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:53,800
would have been like

1876
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:58,079
it had been around

1877
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:01,600
2011 end of 2011 or maybe

1878
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:03,359
early 2012

1879
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,400
and then that's when i started true kind

1880
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:08,960
of genetics it's like in order like

1881
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:12,158
when i walked away i wanted to try and

1882
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,079
salvage a friendship so i started fresh

1883
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:15,920
it's like my original release is through

1884
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:18,000
true kind of genetics rather than do

1885
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,399
anything with anything that we've done

1886
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,399
i released a couple of femme things that

1887
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:25,359
i had done that he hadn't so it was kind

1888
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:29,119
of unique like turtzilla originally did

1889
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:31,439
get released in limited packs on icy mag

1890
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,279
so a few packs went out and was sold but

1891
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:36,639
it was small amounts same with the

1892
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:38,880
purple halitosis the grape lemonade and

1893
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,239
a few other femme crosses i released

1894
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,400
those through true canon genetics

1895
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:43,839
originally but they were small batches

1896
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,399
when it actually came to full

1897
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,640
distribution i started with fresh

1898
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,238
palette and i went for regular seeds and

1899
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,640
i've always wanted to try and stay on

1900
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:55,359
that line so what i did is because i'd

1901
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:58,239
become such a fan of the chem dog

1902
01:10:55,359 --> 01:11:00,799
profile and from growing the chem dog

1903
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:03,279
ibl and the chem dog back cross work

1904
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:06,560
that i done with connoisseur genetics i

1905
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:07,599
got some sfv cross chem dog

1906
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,560
and

1907
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,560
that is what i used as a male to hit up

1908
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,960
a few different things to start the

1909
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,719
foundation of true kind of genetics and

1910
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,679
one of the original strains was ken

1911
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,719
valley cooks also the truth

1912
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,039
uh

1913
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:25,119
sagan star which was a scentsy star

1914
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:27,760
cross and then broadleaf black which was

1915
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:29,920
a black domino cross or black demeanor i

1916
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,520
never know how that was pronounced

1917
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,440
i think you said it right one of the two

1918
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,320
times i don't know which one either but

1919
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:35,599
um

1920
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:37,759
it's interesting you bring that up

1921
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,800
because i wanted to talk to you about

1922
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,079
that specifically the sfv chem dog

1923
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,920
component

1924
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,519
was that one of the various sfv ibl's

1925
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,359
crossed to the chem dog like how did the

1926
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,440
genetics work because on face value it

1927
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:53,679
sounds like two clone onlys right so i'm

1928
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:55,678
wondering where the male part is

1929
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,679
that is res dog's

1930
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,600
chem d back cross

1931
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,119
it's this it's the back cross ii the

1932
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,800
second back cross

1933
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:05,279
a male from that

1934
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,119
was hit to the san fernando valley og

1935
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:10,479
kushka

1936
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:13,039
haha okay cool well when you put that in

1937
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:14,559
context it then actually kind of makes

1938
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:18,640
me feel like

1939
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:20,719
the chem valley cooks is kind of like

1940
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,239
it's not all that different from a gmo

1941
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,039
thing in a way you know like it's got

1942
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:28,079
the similar components

1943
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:30,158
yeah the gmo kills me because it's like

1944
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:32,158
i love that it's taken

1945
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:34,479
like it's taking this long for everyone

1946
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:36,559
to fall in love with the chemdita it's

1947
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:39,039
like it had to look like cookies for the

1948
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,800
modern generation to fall in love with

1949
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,800
it because that's what the turp is you

1950
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,880
know i mean that is straight chem d

1951
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,360
turps but it's just got all the bag

1952
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,400
appeal that everyone goes wild for so

1953
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:53,519
yeah that's like that a is it's a good

1954
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:55,198
look and it's a beautiful turn it is

1955
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,679
so how would you compare the ken valley

1956
01:12:55,198 --> 01:13:00,639
cookies to something like the gmo or one

1957
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,719
of the very other various other chem dog

1958
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,360
girl scout hybrids like chem scout or

1959
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,039
whatever like the gmo like most notably

1960
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,479
has that horrendously long flowering

1961
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:11,439
time right how does the chem valley

1962
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:13,919
cookies compare to those ones

1963
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:17,519
well what it is yeah with the

1964
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,520
to really get that turp from the chem d

1965
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,199
i've crossed the ken valley cooks with

1966
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,880
the truth

1967
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:25,039
so then what you're getting is you're

1968
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,000
getting the sfe chem

1969
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:28,000
from both sides

1970
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:34,319
that one i've called trudeau

1971
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,800
and that one has got the chemter to

1972
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:39,599
perfection it's got that wicked fart gas

1973
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,560
stink and that one finishes at like

1974
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,719
eight

1975
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,679
nine weeks 10 if you really want to push

1976
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:49,198
it and that one's got all of the bag

1977
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:51,920
appeal it's got low leaf to bud ratio

1978
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,519
it's like super super dense

1979
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,600
and it's got

1980
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:58,080
super super high resin content it's like

1981
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,280
oh i've been pressing rosin on my

1982
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:03,198
sasquatch and my god it's just amazing i

1983
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:04,800
showed my friend yesterday and i love it

1984
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:06,960
because it was one of those times when

1985
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,560
you let them smell it and they tell you

1986
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,560
the thing that it smells of before you

1987
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:12,800
give them any hints and he said straight

1988
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,960
away that smells like fart gas and it's

1989
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,560
like he goes not in a bad way but do you

1990
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,000
know what i mean and i'm like yeah i do

1991
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,000
know what you mean that's exactly what i

1992
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,560
wanted you to say the fact you said it

1993
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,960
just put a big smile on my face so

1994
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,640
yeah i've i reckon it's there in the ken

1995
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,520
valley cooks itself

1996
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:32,159
that one the flowers the one that i've

1997
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,199
selected as a keeper

1998
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:37,920
i've kind of gone away from the chemter

1999
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:39,839
i've gone for like a sweeter

2000
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,039
more

2001
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:45,360
floral doughy kind of turp for the

2002
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:47,679
actual ken valley cooks itself

2003
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:50,960
so that one i'm i'm testing at the

2004
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,679
moment i've done the set like uh

2005
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,198
an incross of that and i'm waiting to

2006
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,920
see what they're like i haven't had an

2007
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:59,519
opportunity to grow them out but

2008
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,440
i've not been rushed to get the ken

2009
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,120
valley cooks out as a strain itself

2010
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,279
because like i said for me it was more

2011
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:07,840
about selecting a male

2012
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:10,000
to use as a breeding tool than releasing

2013
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,520
the flowers

2014
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,319
yeah of course

2015
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,080
so

2016
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:16,000
if we're trying to continue on the story

2017
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:18,319
so to speak at what point did you say

2018
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,920
did at what point did you decide to

2019
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:24,319
leave the uk and head over to spain

2020
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,560
do you know what happened after after

2021
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:29,840
originally getting busted going to the

2022
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:32,960
high times and going to prison

2023
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,800
i decided to send bud to amsterdam

2024
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,119
and that was a nightmare when it got

2025
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,920
there i just wasn't happy with how it

2026
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:42,158
was after having sent it

2027
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,158
and

2028
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:45,919
i literally decided to myself

2029
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,800
the only way i'm ever going to win a

2030
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,800
high time is if i am in a city

2031
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,960
grow the [ __ ] bud out

2032
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,360
put it into tupperware walk up to the

2033
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,198
people and hand it over like that that's

2034
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:59,039
how i need to do it

2035
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:01,599
and i decided yeah that's what i'm gonna

2036
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:04,158
do and tied in with that as well at the

2037
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,239
time a crazy a [ __ ] up thing happened

2038
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:08,238
is that my girlfriend at the time came

2039
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:10,959
to visit me from america

2040
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:11,839
got refused entry into the uk

2041
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,840
and

2042
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,159
i ended up just saying to like look

2043
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,079
move to amsterdam like i'm going there

2044
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:20,479
to grow now anyway it was only a matter

2045
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:23,279
of time i need to [ __ ]

2046
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:25,359
do do a high times in amsterdam so it

2047
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,158
was like it was kind of perfect timing

2048
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:30,799
for me to leave england and go to

2049
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,799
go to amsterdam and be in the city and

2050
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,039
win a high times which

2051
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,279
from being a kid before even growing you

2052
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:38,960
know like seeing the high times and the

2053
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:40,880
high times cup it was always so

2054
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,239
prestigious and it's like a lot of

2055
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,840
people want to criticize it and

2056
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:48,158
yeah i could probably talk some [ __ ]

2057
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,840
about high times too but at the end of

2058
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,079
the day uh

2059
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,319
proof is in the pudding and the fact

2060
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:56,479
that someone like me could place and win

2061
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:59,039
in the high times the fact that someone

2062
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:00,799
like lady sativa genetics can win the

2063
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,600
fact that someone like karma genetics

2064
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,119
can win all those times that is the fact

2065
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,320
that fino finders the fact that all

2066
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,439
these people

2067
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:11,198
can win is proof that smaller people

2068
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:13,919
can win these cups and it's not all

2069
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:16,399
about who does the big sponsorship who

2070
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,560
does this who does that it's like for me

2071
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,479
to win a second place high times blew my

2072
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,920
mind it's like the reality is that the

2073
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:22,879
small guys when they go to the high

2074
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,760
times

2075
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:29,039
your first place is third place

2076
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:32,320
you expect the big boys to sweep one and

2077
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:34,880
two and then the up and coming little

2078
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:36,158
guy who's making a name and putting in

2079
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,119
some work

2080
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:41,279
might snag a third place but then

2081
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:44,079
five other guys equally deserving are

2082
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:46,000
gonna lose out so when i stood there and

2083
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:47,279
they said second like they said the

2084
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,679
third place

2085
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,920
i looked at my cousin and said oh well

2086
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,760
it's been fun and then they said second

2087
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,560
place winner that just blew my mind just

2088
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,600
like

2089
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,000
and

2090
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,159
it shows that like putting in work and

2091
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,039
[ __ ] dedicating yourself to something

2092
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:05,759
can can pay off

2093
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:07,600
cool so you're in amsterdam and you'd

2094
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,400
won second place

2095
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:13,840
at what point then did you travel like

2096
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:13,839
where'd you go at that point

2097
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:18,158
amsterdam was such a crazy adventure

2098
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,479
anyone that's ever lived in amsterdam

2099
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:22,960
knows that it's the most

2100
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:25,039
like you can you can smoke around smoke

2101
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:28,960
and go to coffee shops smoke all of that

2102
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:30,158
but trying to grow there is so [ __ ]

2103
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,319
difficult

2104
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:34,238
it is mind-bending like you will

2105
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:35,599
literally move into a place and the

2106
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:37,279
neighbor will come and knock on your

2107
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,039
door and ask you who you are and what

2108
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,639
you're doing

2109
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:42,800
as if that's just a cool thing to do

2110
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,280
like they want to know and they are on

2111
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,000
to everything so when i originally went

2112
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:51,599
there i had a huge grow with a coffee

2113
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
shop and the grow got robbed

2114
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,239
so before before i ever even got a

2115
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,880
harvest out of it it got robbed and then

2116
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:01,198
i was left in a situation where i

2117
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:04,079
literally had to throw two 400 watt

2118
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:04,960
lamps into a room in my apartment

2119
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:06,800
pop

2120
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,800
four packs of seeds

2121
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,279
i had to grow the seeds out for eight

2122
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,920
weeks harvest to eight weeks

2123
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,119
dry for two weeks and then i had one

2124
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,000
week

2125
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:20,719
to trim and hand into the high times and

2126
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,719
i literally for my high times entry i

2127
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:25,920
entered a whole plant including the tiny

2128
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:27,198
little like point three gram nuggets and

2129
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,199
everything because it was just a whole

2130
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:31,119
plant i had to enter it without smoking

2131
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:34,479
it i just had to choose

2132
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:34,479
what plant i was going to end up

2133
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,039
gee whiz and what sorry what plan was

2134
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,039
that

2135
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:42,880
that was all of them i ended like i

2136
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:44,719
entered the truth that year

2137
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,159
uh i entered

2138
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:48,319
i think maybe we entered ken valley

2139
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:49,519
cooks we entered a few different things

2140
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:52,158
and

2141
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,560
sorry that's my dehumidifier going crazy

2142
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:56,399
i ended a few different things uh

2143
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,520
but uh truth is the one that wants

2144
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:02,319
second place and i literally had to like

2145
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,560
i said i had to just choose the plants

2146
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,719
and enter them because each plant

2147
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,960
because i only had like a couple of

2148
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,719
weeks to veg and had to do everything in

2149
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,239
such a small space of time because of

2150
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,079
losing the other grow

2151
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,479
i didn't have big enough plants to even

2152
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,399
really do selection i just had to kind

2153
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:19,919
of eye it but

2154
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,000
i was going to say the truth is in this

2155
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,719
ironic that i say that is that i knew

2156
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,600
from week five to winning plan

2157
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,439
like

2158
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,280
my my friend i was living with at the

2159
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:31,279
time who runs an extraction company

2160
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:33,599
called yellow brick labs

2161
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:35,840
we knew like when i showed him like

2162
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,760
smell this one he was like yeah he just

2163
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,319
confirmed to me you know when you know

2164
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,560
the standout plant he just gave me the

2165
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:44,799
nod just to say yep that's [ __ ]

2166
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,440
abrasive it just had such a beautiful

2167
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,679
aggressive smell so that was the one

2168
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:52,559
that i knew was special and that was the

2169
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:55,359
one that got me the place so

2170
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,560
very special place in my heart that one

2171
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,639
lovely

2172
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:01,120
so how long did you continue to hang out

2173
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:03,440
in amsterdam

2174
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:05,198
bro like i said it was so difficult to

2175
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:07,359
live there everything was so difficult

2176
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:10,399
to do and it was so expensive

2177
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:13,439
that i won a high times in november in

2178
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:16,079
december i went to morocco to like a

2179
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:17,279
beautiful farm over there to like do

2180
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,439
some like

2181
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,439
some research for them they basically

2182
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:24,238
wanted me to find out

2183
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:26,879
what was left on the material after they

2184
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,799
had done four grades of hash

2185
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,800
after it had been hit four times that

2186
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,199
got everything off of it was there

2187
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,800
anything left on the material because

2188
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:37,039
imagine if you've got five ton of

2189
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,159
material

2190
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:41,198
and there's

2191
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:42,399
resin left on it and you throw it away

2192
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:44,638
what's the potential

2193
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,638
a little bit accumulates

2194
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:48,560
yeah so it's incredible to go there and

2195
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:50,960
find out that one of the strains had

2196
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,199
four percent return and another one had

2197
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,920
seven percent return

2198
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:59,279
with just a crude simple like open

2199
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,319
blasted like bho extraction just to get

2200
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:01,359
numbers

2201
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,519
so

2202
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:05,839
as far as distillate

2203
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:08,960
somewhere like morocco just has [ __ ]

2204
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,760
incredible incredible potential

2205
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,679
so

2206
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,960
was it then you transitioned over to

2207
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,760
spain

2208
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,480
yeah my plan was always to go to spain

2209
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,239
uh after i went to high time so after

2210
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:23,039
that it was uh

2211
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:25,359
a couple of trips to barcelona to settle

2212
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:28,000
things up and then i moved there in the

2213
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:30,399
early part of 2015

2214
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,319
and barcelona the cannabis social club

2215
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:34,879
scene had always appealed to me before i

2216
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:36,960
even moved to amsterdam i had said to

2217
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,199
friends like yeah eventually

2218
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,719
spain and barcelona with the cannabis

2219
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:41,919
social club scene is going to be the

2220
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,239
place and

2221
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,399
once a bunch of friends were living

2222
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:47,359
there and i'd met loads of people that

2223
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:49,279
were

2224
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:51,679
were over here with clubs and doing

2225
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:53,920
things the opportunity was here to

2226
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:56,319
to come over and people kind of invited

2227
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,760
me to work and a lot of opportunities

2228
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:01,439
opened up

2229
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:03,199
and so is the european scene kind of the

2230
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,678
mecca that it's made out to be

2231
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:08,319
especially spain

2232
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:10,880
barcelona is the epicenter of the

2233
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:13,759
european cannabis industry

2234
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:16,079
by far it's taken over amsterdam this is

2235
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:19,039
the place where people come on a regular

2236
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:20,399
basis you know as a kid like from the

2237
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:22,399
age of 15

2238
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:24,879
onwards i was going to amsterdam

2239
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:27,039
constantly like most english people it's

2240
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:30,960
a 50 minute flight it costs less than

2241
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:32,319
100 pounds you can fly to amsterdam

2242
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,399
for a day if you want you know what i

2243
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:35,920
mean and hang out it's like people i

2244
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:38,960
know people that have been

2245
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:41,119
50 times in their lifetime to amsterdam

2246
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,679
because they do they view it like

2247
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:46,079
a weekend away like you can spend more

2248
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,760
money getting taxis around london

2249
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:50,319
than what you do if you get a

2250
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:53,119
last-minute flight over to amsterdam

2251
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:56,399
so people would do that so regular but

2252
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:57,840
as amsterdam has tried to push out the

2253
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:59,039
cannabis

2254
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,800
culture

2255
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:02,880
and kind of

2256
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,239
fancied the whole place up

2257
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,400
it's kind of

2258
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:09,039
given the opportunity for barcelona to

2259
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:11,359
have a thriving social club scene and to

2260
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:13,359
start to draw all of those same people

2261
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:15,599
over here and with a variety of

2262
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:18,158
different like airlines

2263
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,320
with the seasons that are quiet mild

2264
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:21,519
over here everyone loves it and i've got

2265
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:24,639
friends that

2266
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:27,360
nobody i know who's been here once

2267
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:29,760
has only been here once they all come

2268
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,679
back many times and often two or three

2269
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,320
times a year

2270
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:36,880
what a what a little ad for it all

2271
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,960
so what's the barcelona seem like in

2272
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:42,639
your opinion are you in the heyday

2273
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:45,520
currently or is the best yet to come

2274
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:47,840
it is awesome it's uh it's it's

2275
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,760
incredible to be in a place

2276
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,239
where people have the opportunity to

2277
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,679
make something of themselves you know

2278
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:58,158
like to be at the start of any industry

2279
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,679
where people with passion are able to

2280
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:01,920
put in the work

2281
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:04,158
find their niche

2282
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:06,800
fine-tune it and then put it out to the

2283
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:09,439
world and build a brand it's amazing to

2284
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:12,320
see from all the different social clubs

2285
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:14,319
that have a variety of styles to them so

2286
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:16,559
that no matter what kind of person you

2287
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:19,198
are you can find somewhere that suits

2288
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:22,080
your vibe that has your kind of people

2289
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:24,559
whether it's one up which is like

2290
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:27,760
full of retro computer games with an

2291
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,760
amazing menu with a cereal bar with like

you can't get anywhere else so it's

2342
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,960
adding to the culture and the scene it's

2343
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:22,158
like there's a new place that's opened

2344

food spot that's got loads of baked

01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,359
goods so

2348
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:31,759
they're just stoner guys that have

2349
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:32,799
opened a place and they've used the old

2350
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,800
uh

2351
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,039
name wacom bay free which is an awesome

2352
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,360
one because i knew a place on the east

2353
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:40,960
coast called the wake and bakery so

2354
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:44,000
slowly you're getting things with the

2355
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,198
cannabis museum the scentsy you've got

2356
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,079
you know you've got other things

2357
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:49,678
starting to pop up so that on top of the

2358
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:51,679
social club scene

2359
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,079
you've got other things for people that

2360
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:56,239
are in that scene to come and see and do

2361
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:58,960
and it's adding to the to the culture

2362
01:27:56,238 --> 01:28:00,959
massively out here

2363
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,800
yeah what an awesome description of it

2364
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,520
all so one thing i wanted to touch on

2365
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:07,679
which you yourself referenced the hype

2366
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,360
game it's a part of the american scene

2367
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,480
which i don't really enjoy that much

2368
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:11,920
myself

2369
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:13,919
you kind of referenced it but i'll

2370
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:17,039
outright ask it has it infected the

2371
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,880
barcelona scene and are the plug kind of

2372
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:21,760
like the equivalent of the jungle boys

2373
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:24,000
of barcelona

2374
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,000
uh

2375
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:30,238
the plug's just like

2376
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:32,319
incredible basically he's built the most

2377
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:35,198
incredible

2378
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:37,840
like spot like what he's done there

2379
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:40,000
people try to replicate and anyone that

2380
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:43,440
tries to replicate it they fail

2381
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,840
he came and done the perfect spot

2382
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:48,719
for people who are interested in the

2383
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,920
latest greatest things uh the latest

2384
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,960
kind of like

2385
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:55,600
music like that the uk scene's putting

2386
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,760
out the american crossover he's got a

2387
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,760
record label so he's got all the like

2388
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:02,320
best music playing for that age group

2389
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,320
and that that genre so

2390
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:06,880
it's not my style of place

2391
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:08,238
but it's incredible and what he does is

2392
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,480
he not only

2393
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:12,799
has all the latest greatest strains from

2394
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,799
kelly but he also has

2395
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,760
loads of stuff grown locally as well he

2396
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,279
does source out good local stuff so he

2397
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,039
has everything across the board that's

2398
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:22,960
the truth of it it's like a lot of

2399
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:25,679
people want to hate on whoever's doing

2400
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,679
really well and and and that's that's

2401
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,279
just uh that's just a modern day

2402
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:32,000
mentality it's probably been the way

2403
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:34,800
since day one since existence but what

2404
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,238
he's got there is an incredible place

2405
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,560
but it's not for everyone that's why i

2406
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:42,479
said barcelona's incredible bros like if

2407
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:44,480
you like guitar music and acoustic

2408
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,079
stuff you you'll find a club that's got

2409
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,399
free guitars set in the corner for you

2410
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:52,000
to go and play guitar if you like the

2411
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:53,198
latest greatest grime music track music

2412
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,279
the latest

2413
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:56,960
strains have just dropped then there's

2414
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,238
somewhere for that if you like oh

2415
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,679
there's somewhere for that if you like

2416
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:00,879
computer games there's somewhere for

2417
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,079
that so

2418
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,039
with the plug

2419
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:04,559
like

2420
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:06,719
they are

2421
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,639
killing the hype game but they're doing

2422
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,639
it properly and they are getting the

2423
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:13,840
best stuff do you know what i mean they

2424
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:16,000
have the connections to get the flavors

2425
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,840
what annoys me is some of the other

2426
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,760
spots that are just like

2427
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,800
trying to be that

2428
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,400
but they're getting [ __ ] cali bud

2429
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,279
and trying to charge through the nose

2430
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:29,039
for it and promoting that massively and

2431
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:30,880
trying to convince the world that cali

2432
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:33,760
buds better because their markup and

2433
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,760
profit margin on that cali bud is higher

2434
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,520
and that's where the problems are the

2435
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,119
problems are places that are trying to

2436
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,120
get the best thing for people to try the

2437
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:42,960
latest greatest things the problem is

2438
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:45,519
places that are getting

2439
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:48,480
sub par but

2440
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:50,719
pricing it crazy and then

2441
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:53,039
all the staff pushed that over local

2442
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:55,600
grown stuff to people who don't know any

2443
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:58,639
better and that is rife and the hype

2444
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:01,120
game with that regard is kind of [ __ ]

2445
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,480
bad in barcelona because

2446
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:04,719
unless you go to clubs where there's

2447
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:07,039
educated staff who can educate people

2448
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:09,840
about a grower and the genetics they

2449
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:11,119
just sell the latest greatest

2450
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,560
yeah

2451
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:14,399
yeah yeah that's that's the same

2452
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,760
everywhere i think but

2453
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:17,119
i want to touch on something you

2454
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,800
mentioned that you know you said that

2455
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:21,119
there is a variety of different things

2456
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:23,360
on offer depending on where you go

2457
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:25,760
so i'd love to talk about some kind of

2458
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:28,158
spain specific clone onlys and your

2459
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:30,159
experiences with them and the one i most

2460
01:31:28,158 --> 01:31:32,719
want to ask you about is a plan i've

2461
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:35,279
always had on my mind forever have you

2462
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:38,079
ever smoked that clone only of queen

2463
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:39,840
mother that goes around spain

2464
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:43,439
no i don't what is what's the background

2465
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:45,639
on ah so it's from the delicatessen crew

2466
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,359
who are kind of like friends with

2467
01:31:45,639 --> 01:31:49,760
cannabiogen

2468
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:52,479
and it's a cross of like a reunion

2469
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,719
island with like this congo hybrid so

2470
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:57,039
real raw sativery land race but

2471
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,439
apparently there's this specific cut

2472
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:02,479
that goes around spain of it that's just

2473
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:05,119
meant to be insane

2474
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:06,959
i think there's a cup that's a congo one

2475
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,639
called lily or something like that yes

2476
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,000
yes yes yes that's that's the name of

2477
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,199
the cut lily

2478
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,880
yeah yeah yeah yeah so incredible bro i

2479
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:17,198
have smoked here it's one of the best

2480
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,639
it's one of the only standout things

2481
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:22,238
i've ever smoked in barcelona that when

2482
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,920
i first came here

2483
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:27,039
in 2015

2484
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:30,079
i think i was given that in la colada

2485
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:32,880
and we flowers they both have that cut i

2486
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:34,880
think i was gifted in la colada and it

2487
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:37,520
was the best example i've smelled of it

2488
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:39,840
what a beautiful profile i was like

2489
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,800
congolese is this really a congolese i

2490
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,880
was like [ __ ] this is so tropical

2491
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,639
beautiful bro beautiful

2492
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,319
yeah cool that's one which doesn't get

2493
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:49,279
talked about a lot but i mean on that

2494
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:51,840
point

2495
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:53,359
what's going on with ace and cannabiogen

2496
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,639
do you have any contact with those guys

2497
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:56,639
at all i just feel like they've kind of

2498
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:58,159
fallen off a bit

2499
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:59,760
did they was there like fallings out

2500
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:00,719
between them was there some craziness

2501
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,480
where

2502
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,319
ace was meant to have taken the genetics

2503
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:05,678
of cannabis and they split up or

2504
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:07,519
something and

2505
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:09,679
he's like yeah there's some kind of like

2506
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,000
conflict i heard from someone

2507
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:14,319
okay yeah i just noticed that both of

2508
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,319
them have seemingly stopped putting out

2509
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,399
new releases whereas they were on a bit

2510
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:20,559
of a good run for a while

2511
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:22,479
basically what i got told now i'll

2512
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,080
speculate it's a total speculation this

2513
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:25,759
is what someone told me someone

2514
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:27,600
basically told me that cannabis was the

2515
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:30,560
one who was really doing the work and

2516
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,320
that ace kind of half-jacked them so

2517
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:34,560
that's the story i heard whether that's

2518
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:36,399
true or not it would explain why

2519
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,480
they both stopped doing it because if

2520
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:40,399
one guy didn't make it

2521
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:42,559
yeah the other day jacket

2522
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:44,638
yeah and now it's all gone and he can't

2523
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:47,199
make him again because he jacked him

2524
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:50,639
or whatever who knows but

2525
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:52,559
yeah it's a strange one

2526
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,960
yeah well i mean it's totally possible

2527
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,280
in the sense that charlie garcia is well

2528
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,198
known from the kind of biogen crew as

2529
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:00,639
being a legit breeder so it would make

2530
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:01,678
sense that they're the ones doing the

2531
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:03,920
work

2532
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:05,440
um but anyway you know well maybe we'll

2533
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,239
find out the answer to that one another

2534
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:07,198
day

2535
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:09,279
so

2536
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,119
is there anyone doing anything over

2537
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:13,198
there that's kind of really innovating

2538
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:14,479
in your opinion

2539
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:16,719
yeah do you know what there's a few

2540
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:19,599

like do everything in house where

2566
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,600
they're growing things they're pressing

2567
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,520
stuff themselves they've got rosin

2568
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,199
they've got flowers

2569
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:25,440
which i mean i've got a friend that does

2570
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:28,158
edibles as well so him and he's white

2571
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:30,319
like his girlfriend he grows she makes

2572
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:31,118
edibles that they sell to the club it's

2573
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:33,118
like

2574
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:35,118
that they're called fresh flower farm

2575
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:36,479
and fresh flower edibles it's like

2576
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:38,880
that's the kind of thing i mean there's

2577
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:41,519
like they came here from england and

2578
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:44,639
were able to build a life for themselves

2579
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,760
by taking some risks putting in a bit of

2580
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:47,600
work

2581
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,440
persevering

2582
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,679
going through some ups and downs but

2583
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:53,599
having a goal and a dream and wanting to

2584
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:55,600
come and do something and barcelona

2585
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,600
allows you to like

2586
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,159
find your niche and find your spot and

2587
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:02,400
like build something so

2588
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:03,839
there's lots of people doing cool stuff

2589
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:05,679
that's another one i have to mention

2590
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,319
growers with attitude they are doing

2591
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:10,719
incredible stuff over here

2592
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:13,679
yeah shout out to those guys for sure

2593
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:16,560
so i guess the next question that jumps

2594
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:18,319
to mind based off that is how hard is it

2595
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,000
realistically for someone to pack their

2596
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:21,840
bags and move over there give me a

2597
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,039
little bit of a rundown is it feasible

2598
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:26,239
or is it quite easy

2599
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:28,158
basically you've got to have enough

2600
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:30,319
money to set yourself up for six months

2601
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:31,920
really that's what it boils down to it's

2602
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:34,719
like you've got to be able to come over

2603
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:37,679
here and afford to lay down deposits and

2604
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:40,880
rent on a house for the first six months

2605
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:43,679
so you can find a house move in

2606
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:46,639
set yourself up get a crop down and then

2607
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:48,960
the ball's rolling so anyone who can set

2608
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:51,199
themselves into a position to do that

2609
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,880
and can get it right can do it but it's

2610
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:54,879
not that easy you've got to find the

2611
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,480
right house you've got to make sure that

2612
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,600
you can rent that house you've got to

2613
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:59,759
make sure that you've got the

2614
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,360
documentation and the bank account that

2615
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,920
you can show someone that you're

2616
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:07,920
self-employed that you're a computer

2617
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:10,239
programmer artist designer and that you

2618
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,719
work online and set yourself up and get

2619
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:15,678
a house and then once you're in a house

2620
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:17,920
you can set yourself up and

2621
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:20,800
be a part of the scene but it's not that

2622
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,239
easy bro it's like it's easy if you can

2623
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,719
make it happen

2624
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:27,759
but it's not just pack your bags turn up

2625
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:30,480
and it all falls into place it takes a

2626
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:32,239
lot of planning and

2627
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:35,118
a lot of [ __ ]

2628
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:37,198
determination and a bit of cash as well

2629
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:38,719
it's like it's not cheap to you know

2630
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:39,839
what it's like with anywhere you've got

2631
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,480
to pay

2632
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,199
one month to the agent maybe a couple of

2633
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:46,559
months as a deposit and then really you

2634
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:48,158
need to

2635
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,199
have your first three or four months

2636
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:51,839
rent

2637
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:53,279
ready to be paid so that you can get a

2638
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,079
crop out

2639
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:56,158
yeah

2640
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:58,479
pretty sound advice

2641
01:37:56,158 --> 01:38:00,719
electricity is always an issue here

2642
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:02,479
the houses are wired so bad that most of

2643
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,560
them are limited you can barely run any

2644
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:05,919
electricity so you've got to find a

2645
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,920
house where you can actually run enough

2646
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,679
electricity to grow properly

2647
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,440
so there's a lot of factors like that

2648
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:13,440
where it's like

2649
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:15,919
once you're here

2650
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:18,238
there's a wonderful sense of privacy and

2651
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,840
your house is your castle everyone minds

2652
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:22,399
their own business and a lot of people

2653
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:24,079
grow my neighbors grow they go into

2654
01:38:22,399 --> 01:38:25,839
their grow room when they open the door

2655
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:28,000
it opens out into their garden they

2656
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,239
don't do it discreetly they don't give a

2657
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,319
[ __ ] it lights up the hill that we live

2658
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:34,718
on i live on like a mountain it lights

2659
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:35,759
it up that at least six houses down the

2660
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:38,399
hill

2661
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,960
know these guys are growing they had 20

2662
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:43,359
like 15 20 foot plants in their garden

2663
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,198
it's like they harvested the whole thing

2664
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,279
in their back garden it's like they

2665
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:48,719
don't care and i've got other neighbors

2666
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:50,800
that have got plants in their front

2667
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,880
garden so it's like

2668
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,800
people mind their own business out here

2669
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,719
if you haven't if you're not showing off

2670
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,480
if you're not a flash [ __ ] who's

2671
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,880
driving a fancy car

2672
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:03,919
around working-class people stinking a

2673
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,920
weed all the time and making a noise

2674
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:07,600
you're going to be cool it's like i most

2675
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,079
of the people i know that come out here

2676
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:14,159
and live well it's like the guys

2677
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:14,158
turps army farm and fresh flowers

2678
01:39:14,479 --> 01:39:18,000
farm days guys

2679
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:20,638
peaceful people

2680
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,880
not flesh people have come out here set

2681
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,960
themselves up well and

2682
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:27,840
keep themselves in themselves are polite

2683
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,800
don't don't be too in to the locals

2684
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,920
because

2685
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,000
you don't want to get into too many

2686
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,079
conversations it's like i tell people

2687
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,279
i've got a t-shirt company because i

2688
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:39,920
have a t-shirt company it's like so

2689
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:40,719
that's it i can run my t-shirt company

2690
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,199
from

2691
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,960
spain that's why i live here and i go to

2692
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:47,039
the post office send my t-shirts all the

2693
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,039
time so

2694
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:51,439
yeah makes sense

2695
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:53,600
it is wonderful it is very private but

2696
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:54,479
it's not like i've seen a lot of people

2697
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,079
think

2698
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:58,319
because they see a lot of people like

2699
01:39:56,079 --> 01:40:00,158
myself over here doing it well that

2700
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:02,319
people just think it's easy to come over

2701
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:05,039
and do it's like but everyone has to

2702
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,799
realize what i put on instagram is what

2703
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:09,439
i want the world to see that's my

2704
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,360
business [ __ ] page like you'll get a

2705
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,198
little bit of who i am but i can't tell

2706
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:15,679
you every up and down and trails and

2707
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:17,678
tribulations i'm going through so

2708
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,279
when people ask me i will always

2709
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:20,880
encourage them but i'll give them a

2710
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,800
heads up and let them know like look

2711
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,400
these are the pitfalls you've got to be

2712
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,679
aware of this this is what you need to

2713
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:29,839
do but it is possible if you have

2714
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:32,639
a real passion for growing and you

2715
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:34,560
really see yourself wanting to do it and

2716
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,159
take that risk and come and live

2717
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,520
somewhere because there's always risks

2718
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:39,599
to everything you know i mean we're

2719
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,440
still in a prohibition state

2720
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,719
things are crazy in barcelona at the

2721
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:45,039
moment the

2722
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:46,880
spanish police are beating the [ __ ] out

2723
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:49,279
of protesters and

2724
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,440
yeah it's a it's a very volatile spot at

2725
01:40:49,279 --> 01:40:53,198
the moment but i love it here

2726
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:54,719
it's given me a wonderful life even

2727
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:56,399
through the ups and downs that it

2728
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,840
provides

2729
01:40:56,399 --> 01:40:58,799
yeah right on

2730
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,360
so

2731
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,360
in the in the scene over there what's it

2732
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:05,599
like with the growers are they looking

2733
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,679
to pop new things and find the next best

2734
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:10,719
thing or are they all just trying to get

2735
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:13,520
like the hype clones from the states

2736
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:16,719
it falls into the two categories bro

2737
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,719
if you can't like for our maker our

2738
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:21,118
maker like this is like a

2739
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:23,279
like a dick this is like a digger people

2740
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:25,759
i already know before i say it yeah

2741
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:28,319
so i'll be honest i'm saying that way

2742
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:31,280
there's two types there's the people

2743
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:32,799
that can't grow quite well enough

2744
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:35,840
to make

2745
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:38,480
and select something and make it shine

2746
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:41,440
and make it sell on that merit so they

2747
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:43,198
need to go with hype strains

2748
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:46,399
to sell their bud

2749
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:49,198
and then there are that level of grower

2750
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:51,439
who grow so well and have so much

2751
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:53,519
passion that what they want to do is

2752
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:54,559
select their own thing because they're

2753
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,280
growing

2754
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:59,840
is able to make that shine as much as

2755
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:03,279
any elite and they can get the same

2756
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:06,800
money as someone selling a skittles cut

2757
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:09,118
grown out or a gelato cup grown out so

2758
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,119
there are a lot of people that are like

2759
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:12,880
no do you know what i can do my own

2760
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:15,118
selection and find something unique and

2761
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:17,279
grow it to that level and

2762
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:19,839
that's what i like to see it's like it's

2763
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:21,759
probably evenly split a lot of people

2764
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,520
are just jumping on the hype and trying

2765
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,000
to get the latest greatest cuts that's

2766
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,360
always going to be the case but

2767
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,520
a lot of the time there's a lot of

2768
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:32,399
sharing in barcelona and you do see cuts

2769
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,679
passed around so it's kind of more like

2770
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,920
i'd like to say it's more on the

2771
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:38,960
positive side where people are hunting

2772
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:41,920
for keepers in the uk that's happening a

2773
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:44,480
lot now that that i've seen blowing up

2774
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,719
more and more in the uk recently

2775
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:48,959
i've noticed that because cuttings are

2776
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,639
going to the worst growers

2777
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,000
you know like people who are like

2778
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,679
average growers

2779
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,198
will buy cuts

2780
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:57,440
and because of that

2781
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:58,960
the elite growers that used to get those

2782
01:42:57,439 --> 01:43:01,198
cuts because that's let's be honest this

2783
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,960
is how it used to be in my mind when you

2784
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:04,879
were at a certain level of growing cuts

2785
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,480
would come your way it's like i got to a

2786
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,239
certain level and i got the cheese cut

2787
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:10,479
from bright side it was an icy mag

2788
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:13,118
brother and it's like that is because i

2789
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,559
had grown to a certain level it's like

2790
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:16,238
you would never

2791
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:18,400
give that cut out

2792
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:20,319
to someone who wasn't growing to a

2793
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:22,879
certain level because you want that cut

2794
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:24,158
reputation to be withheld

2795
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:26,800
it's like that was the whole thing is

2796
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:28,559
like elite cuts went to elite growers

2797
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,400
and that's why they were elite the

2798
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,320
minute they go to average growers they

2799
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:33,198
lose their shine and their reputation is

2800
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:36,079
ruined

2801
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:38,238
and now the uk is seeing that because

2802
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:41,439
all of these hype cuts are being grown

2803
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:43,839
out by average growers which is then

2804
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:46,158
ruining the market and they're realizing

2805
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:49,039
there's more longevity in finding

2806
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:51,439
something unique themselves and building

2807
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:54,319
a brand so that people come back for

2808
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:56,960
that specific thing

2809
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,559
yeah no truer words ever spoken but to

2810
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:01,840
loot back to a point you just made about

2811
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,440
how cuts are shared around in spain

2812
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,840
i wanted to ask you you've bred with a

2813
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:08,000
plant called nicole is this the same

2814
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,319
nicole that the dna crew got from that

2815
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,560
spanish dude and what's the plant like

2816
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:15,039
either way

2817
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,480
nicole is the cut from marimbarros he's

2818
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:19,198
a colombian guy

2819
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:21,599
yeah yeah that's that's the one

2820
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:24,319
yeah he's uh he's a friend that gave me

2821
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:26,960
that kite it is the same one that uh dna

2822
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:27,840
used to make the

2823
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,359
uh

2824
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,920
what is it they made with it i can't

2825
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:33,679
remember kosher no the nicole kush they

2826
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:36,319
made nicole cooter a bit by crossing it

2827
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:38,560
to the kosher kush

2828
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:40,799
okay and so yeah what's what's nicole

2829
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,719
like as a plant and what do you think

2830
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:46,000
pairs well with it

2831
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:48,639
to be honest with you as a plan

2832
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,719
as flower form i'm not a fan of it like

2833
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:53,279
i didn't like the way it smoked the

2834
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:56,000
unique thing about nicole is the resin

2835
01:44:53,279 --> 01:44:58,238
type it has a type of resin

2836
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,840
that comes away from the plant

2837
01:44:58,238 --> 01:45:04,079
and is the most solid resin you can

2838
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:06,000
imagine to make static sift with it and

2839
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:09,198
to do extracts and things like that it

2840
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,520
makes just ridiculously rigid extract it

2841
01:45:09,198 --> 01:45:12,799
it's an incredible hash making plant and

2842
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,520
that's why it's become one of the

2843
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:17,600
biggest hashmaking strains in morocco is

2844
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,159
the nicole kush

2845
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:23,119
when they crossed it with the with the

2846
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:25,439
kosher kush it's kind of giving it a

2847
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:27,118
a little bit more to it added a bit more

2848
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:29,198
flavor and

2849
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:30,960
really allowed the resin to just drop

2850
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:33,919
like crazy i heard that they were making

2851
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:35,600
something like four times the yield with

2852
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,158
the nicole kush

2853
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,600
from crops to like their own

2854
01:45:38,158 --> 01:45:42,319
stuff so

2855
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:44,079
crazy yields it's an incredible hashmate

2856
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:46,399
so i looked up the genetics on it and

2857
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:48,479
it's largely just a mixture of kind of

2858
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:50,960
like blue satellite and shishka berry

2859
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:52,399
and a few other blueberry type of things

2860
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,639
mk ultra

2861
01:45:52,399 --> 01:45:56,238
yeah yeah that's in the mix as well

2862
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:58,319
how do you feel about the blueberry

2863
01:45:56,238 --> 01:46:00,319
flavors and does that shine fl through

2864
01:45:58,319 --> 01:46:01,840
in that clone at all

2865
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:03,759
yeah it does you know there is that blue

2866
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:05,600
like it has got that blueberry like

2867
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,360
there is a hint to it that kind of

2868
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,920
stands out it's very unique it's very

2869
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:11,439
very unique like in the market you know

2870
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,440
like there's nothing do you know what

2871
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:14,238
really it smells like it reminds me of

2872
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:15,678
uh

2873
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:17,279
one of the

2874
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:18,880
the great gardener strains because

2875
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:21,439
that's also got the shishka berry in it

2876
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,118
so it's like it's the shishka berry terp

2877
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:25,279
that kind of dominates because i've

2878
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:26,960
smelled it also is it

2879
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:28,238
one is it from the great garden i can't

2880
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:30,000
remember what strain it is is it the

2881
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:32,799
barbara budd or one of those ones yeah

2882
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,960
barbara bud afghani crushed fishberry

2883
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,960
yeah that's it it's got to say it's got

2884
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,399
a familiar terp so basically whatever

2885
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,079
the shishka berry is if you ever get a

2886
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:42,399
chance to smell something with the

2887
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:44,238
shisha berry no that's very similar to

2888
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:46,799
the nicole

2889
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:49,279
yeah okay interesting interesting

2890
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:51,600
and so while we're talking about flavors

2891
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:54,000
what is your favorite flavors in

2892
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:56,159
cannabis

2893
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,399
you know what i like

2894
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:00,319
tropical that's the like you know real

2895
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:03,679
tropical floral notes

2896
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:05,599
i like those but i also like

2897
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:07,840
it sounds crazy but i remember once a

2898
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,159
girl texting me and saying

2899
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:11,679
is purple can purple be a flavor and i'm

2900
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:13,359
like that's what i'm working towards i

2901
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:14,960
hope so kind of thing because she had

2902
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:17,439
dabbed something combined and wanted to

2903
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,439
know if purple was a flamer and like

2904
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:22,079
that's the flavors that i like i really

2905
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:24,479
love the purple flavors and depending on

2906
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:26,000
how i breed with certain things it

2907
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:28,319
reveals different kinds of purple

2908
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,319
flavors so you get all the like

2909
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:32,719
lavender-y what i described as like

2910
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:35,840
grandma's purse candy you know like old

2911
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:38,079
lady perfume incensie those kind of

2912
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:42,560
floral kind of purples and then you get

2913
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:45,118
all the grapey merlot wines berries dark

2914
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,320
fruits those kind of purples so there's

2915
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:48,880
so many

2916
01:47:46,319 --> 01:47:50,559
purple flavors that come through

2917
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:53,039
depending on what direction you breed

2918
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:55,840
things in that i do love all those

2919
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:58,158
different purple flavors

2920
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:01,039
and broadly speaking what type of highs

2921
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:04,559
do you like the most

2922
01:48:01,039 --> 01:48:06,158
i like hugging a butt pie

2923
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,960
the bud that makes you feel like you're

2924
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:10,799
just wrapped in a warm cozy blanket of

2925
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:15,359
wellness and

2926
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:18,320
well-being and like not overly narcotic

2927
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:19,359
but that nice little fuzzy feeling of

2928
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:21,118
wellness

2929
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:23,519
that's why i smoke cannabis that's

2930
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:26,158
defeat that's the that's the higher most

2931
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:28,000
go for even in even in the sativa lines

2932
01:48:26,158 --> 01:48:30,960
i'm trying to breed with i'm trying to

2933
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:35,039
cut out the anxiety the heart racing all

2934
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:37,520
of that i want a cerebral like euphoric

2935
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:39,920
high that kind of can allow you to relax

2936
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,440
into it and that's why i like that calm

2937
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:43,679
something with a calming effect and i

2938
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:45,198
think cbd being in things

2939
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,239
is intricate to that and not being

2940
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:48,238
completely bred out

2941
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:52,479
yeah it's interesting i've been thinking

2942
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:54,559
about that same kind of thing myself for

2943
01:48:52,479 --> 01:48:56,559
a while i would be interested to know

2944
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,639
your thoughts on this then do you think

2945
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,800
that's a quality that you can try to

2946
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:02,560
breed into a strain or do you think it

2947
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,560
just comes down to kind of like an

2948
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:07,760
individual connection with a certain

2949
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,760
strain you might have

2950
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,039
i think it's both

2951
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,119
i think you can breed towards it based

2952
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:17,039
on your own experience and what's

2953
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:19,118
available to you

2954
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:22,158
to get from friends you can get to try

2955
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:24,880
it but because everyone is individual we

2956
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:25,519
do all need to find the perfect one for

2957
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,920
us

2958
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,840
and that's why i think like it's about

2959
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:32,079
selection and growing things out and

2960
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:34,159
when people grow things out grow them

2961
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:36,238
out three or four times don't make your

2962
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:38,319
selection off of the first seed run

2963
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:39,839
because not every grower is dialed in

2964
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:41,920
sometimes the second run plants are

2965
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,760
completely different sometimes a third

2966
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:46,079
is better it's like give them all a good

2967
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:47,920
try try them at different flowering

2968
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:50,399
times and it's like i think that's the

2969
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:52,639
real key to get into that where

2970
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:54,638
i want to feel from my smoke is actually

2971
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,560
dialing in your plants and doing the

2972
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:57,760
selection and looking for things that

2973
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,599
are kind of

2974
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:02,480
that do

2975
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:05,279
connect to you like do you know oh these

2976
01:50:02,479 --> 01:50:07,519
are these are the strains and often the

2977
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:10,158
terpene is the thing that connects to

2978
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:11,599
people that entourage effect is like you

2979
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:13,759
get people that connect to certain

2980
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:15,520
terpenes so it's obviously like there's

2981
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:18,159
certain things they need to look towards

2982
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,480
with certain terp profiles is often what

2983
01:50:18,158 --> 01:50:23,118
will help them so it's like i wonder

2984
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:24,799
often if like lemon sativas and lemon

2985
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:27,279
indicas will be good for a certain

2986
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:29,920
person that that particularly connects

2987
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:32,158
to them and then they go off it works

2988
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:34,800
both ways

2989
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:37,198
yeah for sure i mean while we're talking

2990
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:39,039
about breeding for a moment a question

2991
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:41,359
our viewers always love

2992
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:44,238
what are some of your tips for picking

2993
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:45,839
the best male possible

2994
01:50:44,238 --> 01:50:48,718
oh do you know what i'll wait this is

2995
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:52,000
how i look here when it comes to a male

2996
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:54,719
i never search for males i wait for

2997
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,599
males to identify themselves

2998
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:59,840
as the one

2999
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:02,319
it's like

3000
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,840
i never like to think oh this is this is

3001
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:07,039
the cross i'm gonna do i'm gonna select

3002
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:09,039
a male from this i like to wait for a

3003
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:11,279
male to pop up that's incredible you

3004
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:13,198
know often when you're growing out

3005
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:14,000
plants you have a plant it's happened

3006
01:51:13,198 --> 01:51:16,158
like

3007
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,158
i remember probably like before i

3008
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:21,759
started breeding it probably happened

3009
01:51:18,158 --> 01:51:24,399
three times in like five plus years

3010
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,320
where i had a plant that was my favorite

3011
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:28,638
plant out of the pack that i was the

3012
01:51:26,319 --> 01:51:30,559
most excited about and then it turns out

3013
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:33,199
to be a mel and i'm heartbroken because

3014
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:35,199
i'm not a breeder and i just chop it and

3015
01:51:33,198 --> 01:51:36,960
i want females

3016
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:38,960
those are the males that when they've

3017
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:41,760
got everything about them that just

3018
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:44,399
stands out from the structure it's like

3019
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:47,280
normally you will see a male it has

3020
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:50,158
single branch some [ __ ] like side

3021
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:51,759
branching that you can spot a male like

3022
01:51:50,158 --> 01:51:55,198
the females are the ones that have all

3023
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:56,639
the candelabra big wide side branching

3024
01:51:55,198 --> 01:51:59,118
it's normally obvious just from

3025
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:01,199
structure so when you do get a male that

3026
01:51:59,118 --> 01:52:04,639
has the perfect structure

3027
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:06,960
and then you touch it and it stinks

3028
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:10,719
then you're on to something then that's

3029
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:13,599
the start of this could be a good mail

3030
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:15,679
cool cool so i noticed on your instagram

3031
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:17,679
you've got some photos of the cam valley

3032
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:19,840
cookies crossed afghani and it

3033
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:21,760
immediately made me wonder where'd you

3034
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:25,199
get the afghani from and what kind of

3035
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:27,520
traits did you look for in that mail

3036
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:30,079
afghani is the craziest thing i've ever

3037
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:33,599
found it's my greatest ever random

3038
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:35,198
discovery i got contacted by someone who

3039
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:37,520
had a friend that had come back from

3040
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:39,598
afghanistan in the british army

3041
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:42,080
and had some seeds and the guy offered

3042
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:45,360
them to me so he sent me these seeds and

3043
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:46,800
there was like 37 seeds i think

3044
01:52:45,359 --> 01:52:49,759
i grew them out

3045
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:51,920
out of 37 seeds when they started they

3046
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:55,599
all look pretty uniform except for one

3047
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:58,158
that was growing with single blade leaf

3048
01:52:55,599 --> 01:53:00,239
and it looked like a run it was like

3049
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:02,719
growing shorter than everything i had to

3050
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:04,158
prop it up on a couple of pots until i

3051
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:06,079
get it up to the height of the rest of

3052
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:07,839
the canopy and i thought to myself let

3053
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:10,000
me mark that one with a little star on

3054
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,840
the number you know like so i remember

3055
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,039
it was looking weird at the beginning in

3056
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:17,119
case later on things grow out

3057
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:19,840
it turned out to be

3058
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:21,359
the most incredible plant

3059
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,440
you could imagine bro the rest of the

3060
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:26,319
plants were all very similar and had

3061
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:28,319
varying degrees of like

3062
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:29,359
wackness basically it's like they were

3063
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:31,920
like

3064
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:34,158
no resin no yield

3065
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:37,679
slightly nice smell a little bit

3066
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:40,799
perfumey i had one nice maybe two nice

3067
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:43,279
ones that were very similar in profile

3068
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,800
to all the bad ones so

3069
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:49,679
smell profile was across the board on

3070
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:52,480
say 30 or 25 of them that were female

3071
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:55,760
was all across the board very lemony

3072
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:58,718
floral this one plant looks like

3073
01:53:55,760 --> 01:54:01,280
an og kush it's an exact it makes me

3074
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:03,760
believe that og crush is at least 50

3075
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:03,759
afghani

3076
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,238
without any doubt in my mind

3077
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,679
and what do you think could be the other

3078
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:12,000
50

3079
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:14,239
i don't know if if i'll be honest with

3080
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,800
you if if i hadn't heard the stories

3081
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:18,399
recently about what the crosses were

3082
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:21,199
because there's like it's actually down

3083
01:54:18,399 --> 01:54:23,198
now from that tk origins guy it's like

3084
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:24,559
one of the strains that he says is half

3085
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:26,399
of the genetics

3086
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:28,639
is a cut and i'm presuming that that's

3087
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:31,279
an afghani strain that's my presumption

3088
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:32,400
and that this that is afghani dominant

3089
01:54:31,279 --> 01:54:33,920
because

3090
01:54:32,399 --> 01:54:35,519
if you see the pictures of the plant

3091
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:37,199
that i'm growing bro honestly when i

3092
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:39,520
when i say about it being a single blade

3093
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:41,279
leaf it looks like an og crushed cotton

3094
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:42,960
when it was growing

3095
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:44,960
and i actually thought like that's got a

3096
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,039
bit of an og crushed look to the cat

3097
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:48,800
like to the seed plant when it was a

3098
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:51,198
baby

3099
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:54,480
yeah no i i don't doubt you at all like

3100
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:56,559
bodhi and doc d have got the iranian

3101
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:58,079
which is like a dead ringer for cookies

3102
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:00,000
right

3103
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:03,039
yeah that's it bro it's like honestly

3104
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,880
it's like it makes me believe it so much

3105
01:55:03,039 --> 01:55:06,399
yeah okay interesting interesting well i

3106
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,560
guess time will tell with those ones as

3107
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:10,079
to what they turn out to be i want to do

3108
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,440
a bit of a throwback to something you

3109
01:55:10,079 --> 01:55:12,880
bred a while back i noticed in one of

3110
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:16,158
your posts you said

3111
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:18,000
you also bred a grand doggie perp strain

3112
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:19,598
was that different to the one that was

3113
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,760
offered by connoisseur or is that the

3114
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:23,679
same one given you were there and i

3115
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:26,639
guess the follow-up is how come we don't

3116
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:29,520
see or hear much about it from you

3117
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:30,800
basically that one what happened is

3118
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:32,560
when i lost

3119
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,079
the res dog

3120
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:36,800
ibl project

3121
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:39,439
i had another grow house where i had all

3122
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:39,890
of my female selections

3123
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:41,198
and

3124
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:43,520
[Music]

3125
01:55:41,198 --> 01:55:45,359
my males and then there was a security

3126
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,080
breach at that house

3127
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:50,559
so what ended up happening is oj at the

3128
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:53,840
time had connoisseur genetics and the

3129
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:56,000
only crosses he had done was using a

3130
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,400
g-13 haze male

3131
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
that had come via soma

3132
01:55:58,399 --> 01:56:01,598
that's like the one that he used for a

3133
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,520
lot of his crosses

3134
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:05,440
yeah that one that one got shared around

3135
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:08,080
amsterdam a fair bit

3136
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:11,039
oh yeah that one got pimped out hard so

3137
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:13,198
that one uh that got traded over to us

3138
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:15,760
for the casey jones cut the casey jones

3139
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:17,839
cut went back the other way so

3140
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:19,119
oj had bred with that and what happened

3141
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,000
is i

3142
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:22,559
had to

3143
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,800
remove all my plants from the house

3144
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,320
so my dad who's just a [ __ ] legend

3145
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,239
he's the most straight going guy that

3146
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,799
just does anything for me to help me and

3147
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:33,198
just supports me so much he

3148
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:36,800
literally had to like come to the house

3149
01:56:33,198 --> 01:56:40,000
we loaded up like 35 foot plants in big

3150
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:41,679
flat screen tv boxes for removal loaded

3151
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,679
them into his van and moved them to a

3152
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:45,840
grow that oj had

3153
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:47,679
and then oj

3154
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:51,920
rather than just holding onto my plants

3155
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:54,239
just pollinated all my selections

3156
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,679
with my males and made seeds with the

3157
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:58,399
whole lot

3158
01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:00,800
for connoisseur genetics

3159
01:56:58,399 --> 01:57:03,039
so at that point it's kind of took my

3160
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,320
project from me and i kind of said well

3161
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:06,639
how about i come in on connoisseur

3162
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:08,000
genetics together

3163
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:10,000
and that's when we become partners at

3164
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,880
connoisseur genetics

3165
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,158
so

3166
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:13,599
when we were working at connoisseur

3167
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:16,559
genetics

3168
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:18,400
that was the kbx project so from that a

3169
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,199
whole bunch of things came out so the

3170
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:23,118
first batch of seeds he made using my

3171
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:24,399
mail selection of chem with all my

3172
01:57:23,118 --> 01:57:26,238
females like

3173
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:29,039
motor breath

3174
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:31,678
train wreck cross sfv

3175
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:33,519
the casey jones

3176
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:36,319
a whole bunch of other things

3177
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:38,880
anyway they got made and then i made

3178
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:42,000
another batch of seeds the bachelor i

3179
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:44,319
then made i remade a few things like the

3180
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,840
kemi jones

3181
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:50,079
i also made the only batch of grand

3182
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:51,119
doggie perps

3183
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:52,960
because

3184
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:55,679
when when he done the original batch of

3185
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:59,840
seeds we didn't have the gdp cut in that

3186
01:57:55,679 --> 01:58:02,960
room because it was my genetics the gdb

3187
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,960
the gdp the granddaddy purple cut oj had

3188
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:07,679
actually sourced that one so when he

3189
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:11,198
gave it to me i did a batch

3190
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:11,199
of grand doggie perps

3191
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:15,599
and that was the only batch that ever

3192
01:58:13,279 --> 01:58:19,599
got made because after that it was not

3193
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:21,840
long after that we lost the cut

3194
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:23,679
of the male so we weren't able to make

3195
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:26,079
any of those strains again with the same

3196
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:28,000
male so it's been remade by connoisseur

3197
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:30,000
genetics a female version but it's

3198
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,719
slightly different the actual regular

3199
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,639
version has never been remade

3200
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:36,480
interesting and so have you ever wanted

3201
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:38,400
to work with that or is that just kind

3202
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:40,158
of falls under that banner of like fresh

3203
01:58:38,399 --> 01:58:41,598
start thing

3204
01:58:40,158 --> 01:58:44,559
uh do you know what the grand doggy

3205
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:46,719
perps that is in

3206
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:48,560
the purple project that i had done and

3207
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:50,880
the purple project i've used for

3208
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:53,119
breeding so i have kind of took it with

3209
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,639
me because i've used a couple of

3210
01:58:53,118 --> 01:58:56,719
different things like that i've gone

3211
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:58,719
forward with and done like when i first

3212
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:01,198
came to barcelona i literally just went

3213
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:03,599
through like 400 of all of my seeds that

3214
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:05,759
i had made that i had and just done

3215
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:07,760
selections through all of those

3216
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,280
and started re-selecting so i went

3217
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,520
through some of my granddaddy purple

3218
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:14,559
hybrids from when i done a reversal so

3219
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:17,280
the grape lemonade purple halitosis

3220
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,320
rainbow jones and a few of those things

3221
01:59:17,279 --> 01:59:21,599
are all

3222
01:59:18,319 --> 01:59:22,479
seeds that both me and oj had made

3223
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,599
and

3224
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:26,959
had

3225
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:29,199
stopped to go through when i got here

3226
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,719
yeah interesting okay that was the last

3227
01:59:29,198 --> 01:59:32,399
project of

3228
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:35,198
connoisseur genetics the last project

3229
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:37,118
i'd done was basically we done a gdp

3230
01:59:35,198 --> 01:59:39,439
femme project and then when we got the

3231
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:41,039
girl scout cookies together we done a

3232
01:59:39,439 --> 01:59:42,319
girl scout run

3233
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:44,238
but

3234
01:59:42,319 --> 01:59:45,840
the most horrendous thing happened is

3235
01:59:44,238 --> 01:59:48,959
that i

3236
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:53,199
was fighting broad mites at the time

3237
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:54,960
and i was using the swarovski mite

3238
01:59:53,198 --> 01:59:57,439
i had beaten the

3239
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,599
broad mites but i was still using the

3240
01:59:57,439 --> 02:00:01,279
my as a preventative but i didn't

3241
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:03,599
realize they eat pollen when they

3242
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:05,439
haven't got bugs to eat

3243
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:07,920
so i'd done a reversal of the girl scout

3244
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:09,919
cookies pollinated the tent

3245
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:12,239
and literally got like

3246
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:14,000
three seeds out of this plant five seeds

3247
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:16,319
out of that plant two seeds out of that

3248
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,560
plant it's like reversals are hard

3249
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:20,238
enough but when you've got a bug that

3250
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:23,119
eats pollen

3251
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:24,718
it turned out to be that was like before

3252
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:27,439
that was the last project i actually

3253
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:29,520
done with connoisseur genetics and then

3254
02:00:27,439 --> 02:00:31,598
he dumb across and then we walked our

3255
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,840
separate ways and yeah that was just a

3256
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:35,599
funny one to learn a very valuable

3257
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:38,239
lesson about what bugs eat when they

3258
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:40,800
haven't got bugs to eat

3259
02:00:38,238 --> 02:00:41,759
yeah wow there you go the more you know

3260
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,279
so

3261
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:45,360
i forgot to ask you earlier when we were

3262
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:47,359
talking about the truth but you know

3263
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:49,118
just in line with if we look at a lot of

3264
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:51,118
your strains are on offer now a lot of

3265
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:53,439
them have got the truth in it

3266
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:55,839
when we look at your keeper cut of the

3267
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:58,079
truth what type of characteristics does

3268
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:00,800
it pass on in terms of the female and

3269
02:00:58,079 --> 02:01:02,880
then also in terms of the male

3270
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:05,119
with the female

3271
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:07,679
when when i've hit like

3272
02:01:05,118 --> 02:01:09,598
what i've done is i i decided to go all

3273
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:11,199
with my own lines it's like i don't

3274
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:14,079
really want to be just

3275
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:16,238
breeding other people's stuff and

3276
02:01:14,079 --> 02:01:18,319
other people hype work and this and that

3277
02:01:16,238 --> 02:01:21,519
everything i've got has got like i've

3278
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:24,158
got some kind of hypothesis and idea of

3279
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:27,119
what i'm trying to get towards so

3280
02:01:24,158 --> 02:01:28,158
really what i've done is i've got my two

3281
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:30,559
males

3282
02:01:28,158 --> 02:01:32,960
that are the truth male and the ken

3283
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:35,440
valley crooks male and the idea of them

3284
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:37,679
is to have breeding tools one that adds

3285
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:41,439
all the favorable characteristics of the

3286
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:43,199
og kush which has proven itself to be

3287
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:45,359
the one of the most if not the most

3288
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:47,759
legendary like popular strains in the

3289
02:01:45,359 --> 02:01:50,238
world and the other one to have all of

3290
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:51,840
the bag appeal and characteristics of

3291
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:54,158
the ken valley cooks

3292
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:55,199
and that's the key thing is like for me

3293
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:56,158
i want

3294
02:01:55,198 --> 02:01:57,039
low

3295
02:01:56,158 --> 02:01:59,279
leaf

3296
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:00,560
ratio to bud i don't want to be trimming

3297
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:03,279
loads so

3298
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:06,239
with the truth it gives

3299
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:07,759
hardly any leaf like it's kind of like

3300
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:09,919
the double-edged sword is you never have

3301
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:11,280
no trim from it but you hardly have to

3302
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:12,480
trim so

3303
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:14,079
for me

3304
02:02:12,479 --> 02:02:16,399
when you're doing lots you don't want to

3305
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:18,719
be trimming a lot and as things become

3306
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:20,479
bigger and bigger the less you've got a

3307
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,960
trim and the less people are in if you

3308
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:24,799
can flush a plant to where the bigger

3309
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:25,679
families fall off and then you've got

3310
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:27,840
just a

3311
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:30,000
a basic little manicure that you're

3312
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:32,480
doing a couple of pounds in like a

3313
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,840
fraction at a time then people are gonna

3314
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:36,319
that's gonna make a difference and

3315
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:38,239
there's even like any grower that i know

3316
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:40,238
doesn't like trimming so that's one of

3317
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:42,479
the main characteristics the other one

3318
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:44,319
is branchiness it's like i like good

3319
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:46,158
side branch and i like plants that

3320
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:48,719
respond to being topped well so that

3321
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:51,519
they get a good amount of heads on them

3322
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:53,840
and you can top and train plants so i

3323
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,440
always go for that in my in my breeding

3324
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:58,319
and try and go from now that's going to

3325
02:02:55,439 --> 02:02:58,319
give good structure

3326
02:02:58,639 --> 02:03:04,239
solid answer and you just referenced the

3327
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:06,319
idea of using your own lines do you

3328
02:03:04,238 --> 02:03:08,799
think that breeders should look more to

3329
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:10,238
using females they've found themselves

3330
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:12,400
or just in general from their own

3331
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:14,079
projects or do you think there's also

3332
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:16,000
kind of a space for people who just want

3333
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:17,920
to repeatedly cross one male to just a

3334
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,840
bunch of clone onlys and don't really

3335
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:22,158
search to their own female stock too

3336
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:22,159
much

3337
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:27,359
the second bro i think there's a room

3338
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:30,719
for everyone to do everything

3339
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:32,319
as prohibition comes to a close there

3340
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:33,920
will be a niche for everything there's

3341
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:36,079
always going to be people that need to

3342
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:38,239
do the latest greatest thing

3343
02:03:36,079 --> 02:03:40,000
cash in on hype and do well and i'll be

3344
02:03:38,238 --> 02:03:41,519
honest with you if i was doing that i'd

3345
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,439
be making a lot more money than what i

3346
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:45,119
am because i have the opportunity to get

3347
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:47,198
whatever cut i want

3348
02:03:45,118 --> 02:03:49,359
as quick as i want and then do those

3349
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:52,078
kind of crosses but

3350
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:54,639
i i get no real pride from that

3351
02:03:52,078 --> 02:03:56,799
i get much more pride from creating

3352
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:58,159
something unique and having goals and

3353
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,000
aims and

3354
02:03:58,158 --> 02:04:02,238
seeing people be able to find something

3355
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,319
unique that then stands out and gives

3356
02:04:02,238 --> 02:04:05,759
them something that they're able to work

3357
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:07,679
with and

3358
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,599
turn heads with like for me just

3359
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:11,920
crossing things if it just gives

3360
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:13,760
something that already exists i get no

3361
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:15,520
no joy from it but

3362
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,719
i love the fact that anyone can do

3363
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:18,400
whatever they want that's what

3364
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:20,639
breeding's about the key thing is people

3365
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:22,638
just need to do their homework it's like

3366
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:23,760
if you're buying seeds from someone have

3367
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:26,078
a look see what they're doing see where

3368
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,440
they come from see what it's like see

3369
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:29,279
see if it's hyped see if there's any

3370
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:31,279
real work going in ask a few questions

3371
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:33,198
do your homework just

3372
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:35,198
you gotta put in the work otherwise you

3373
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:38,479
will end up wasting three months of your

3374
02:04:35,198 --> 02:04:40,158
life growing out a bunch of [ __ ] and if

3375
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:42,000
you do your homework it's easy to find

3376
02:04:40,158 --> 02:04:44,960
out who the legit ones and

3377
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:46,639
get something incredible

3378
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:47,599
yeah of course

3379
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:50,000
so

3380
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:52,639
there are a few other notable breeders

3381
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,560
who are in the spanish scene do you

3382
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:56,800
socialize much with them or is it kind

3383
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:58,400
of like it's a bit hard to meet up or

3384
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:00,480
whatnot and people just kind of doing

3385
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:03,198
their own thing

3386
02:05:00,479 --> 02:05:05,279
i'll be honest i've had such a hard

3387
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:07,279
couple of years the last couple of years

3388
02:05:05,279 --> 02:05:09,198
i've had a few issues

3389
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:12,639
with my housing that meant me having to

3390
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:14,399
shut down to a minimal minimal basis

3391
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:16,400
which has made things super difficult

3392
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:19,519
for me and it's meant that most of my

3393
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:22,399
time is just spent at home working

3394
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:24,719
keeping to myself so sadly i haven't had

3395
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:27,920
as much time as i would like to be

3396
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:29,920
socializing with the scene but there are

3397
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,760
lots of people doing cool things over

3398
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:33,760
here and it's like i'll be honest like

3399
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:36,159
that's why i'd love spannabis so much

3400
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:37,840
it's like it's the one time of the year

3401
02:05:36,158 --> 02:05:39,679
when everyone's out

3402
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:41,360
i get my dad to come and house it for me

3403
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:43,440
look after my dogs and my plants so that

3404
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:45,598
i can be away for the whole week just

3405
02:05:43,439 --> 02:05:47,598
socializing catching up with everyone

3406
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:50,159
seeing what everyone's got seeing the

3407
02:05:47,599 --> 02:05:52,560
evolution over the year and

3408
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:54,960
i do get into the city but not as much

3409
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,639
as i'd like but there's amazing amazing

3410
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:58,719
things going on as far as breeders and

3411
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:00,239
people trying different things and it's

3412
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:02,078
that it's a lot of like spanish

3413
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:03,839
underground guys doing cool stuff with

3414
02:06:02,078 --> 02:06:05,599
like old neville's haze cuts i've seen

3415
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:07,039
around the little things like that those

3416
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:08,639
are the ones that interest me there's a

3417
02:06:07,039 --> 02:06:10,560
couple little things like that

3418
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:13,359
yeah i heard there's a crew of guys over

3419
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:15,440
there who have been safeguarding the a5

3420
02:06:13,359 --> 02:06:16,719
and c5

3421
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:18,399
yeah i've got some friends that have

3422
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:21,520
recently got those as well as well as

3423
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:22,559
the s s is it an s5 is there an s one as

3424
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,719
well like

3425
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:26,960
i think there's one with an s the s5 as

3426
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:29,359
well maybe i recently heard some friends

3427
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:30,560
had that i want to get those myself and

3428
02:06:29,359 --> 02:06:31,679
play with those they're definitely

3429
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:34,639
special

3430
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:36,560
yeah certainly certainly okay cool well

3431
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:38,560
why don't you tell us what's your new

3432
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:40,880
project you're looking forward to doing

3433
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:43,360
or you've currently got underway even

3434
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:45,520
the projects i'm most excited about is

3435
02:06:43,359 --> 02:06:48,000
like we said earlier is that afghani the

3436
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:50,800
land race afghani that i've got and also

3437
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,880
i got given some pakistani land race

3438
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:55,520
seeds from the neelam valley and i've

3439
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:56,960
done some selection from those i did

3440
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:00,480
those both at the same time the

3441
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:02,239
pakistanis and the afghanis and the

3442
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:04,399
keepers that i've got from those feel

3443
02:07:02,238 --> 02:07:06,399
like real building blocks you know

3444
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:09,118
they've got like such

3445
02:07:06,399 --> 02:07:12,719
strong unique flavors

3446
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:15,598
such good strong resilient fast root in

3447
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:17,520
healthy genetics i'm super excited about

3448
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:19,360
working with those as well as with my

3449
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:21,040
filipinos so

3450
02:07:19,359 --> 02:07:23,598
it's kind of the mix of those at the

3451
02:07:21,039 --> 02:07:25,359
moment testing those lines

3452
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:27,440
is what i'm going to be focusing

3453
02:07:25,359 --> 02:07:29,679
probably the next year is going to be

3454
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:31,919
focused on the land races

3455
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:34,719
and at the moment i've got a good

3456
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:36,880
selection with my chem valley cooks mail

3457
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:38,880
and my truth mail that have been

3458
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:40,880
released i can kind of

3459
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:42,880
let those sit for a while

3460
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:45,679
and people are going to be able to enjoy

3461
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:48,078
those i've always got many strains that

3462
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:50,158
are made that i haven't released so in

3463
02:07:48,078 --> 02:07:53,359
the vault there's probably another 10 or

3464
02:07:50,158 --> 02:07:55,279
15 strains that slowly while i'm doing

3465
02:07:53,359 --> 02:07:58,639
all the testing and working on the land

3466
02:07:55,279 --> 02:08:00,319
race projects i can also test some of

3467
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:02,560
the things that are in the vault and

3468
02:08:00,319 --> 02:08:04,719
slowly if they make the mark or not

3469
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:06,719
release them to the public

3470
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:09,920
every now and again like for spannabis

3471
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:11,920
i'm looking to release something

3472
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:14,399
a purple halitosis across the chem

3473
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:15,520
valley crooks so that's one i'm working

3474
02:08:14,399 --> 02:08:17,598
at the moment

3475
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:20,239
that sounds exciting you just referenced

3476
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:22,400
the idea of working with some land race

3477
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:24,718
stuff i'm always interested in knowing

3478
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:26,479
would you ever be willing to travel or

3479
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:29,118
want to travel to collect some land race

3480
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:30,559
stuff yourself

3481
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:32,799
do you know what

3482
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:35,760
the ideas always appeal to me

3483
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:39,039
and if i wasn't so busy and had the

3484
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:41,840
funds i would definitely do it but i'm

3485
02:08:39,039 --> 02:08:45,279
so lucky that i've got people like

3486
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:48,319
uh himalayan connection and land race

3487
02:08:45,279 --> 02:08:49,920
genetics and a few other good-hearted

3488
02:08:48,319 --> 02:08:52,158
people

3489
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:55,279
from instagram that have reached out to

3490
02:08:52,158 --> 02:08:57,519
me and i've been gifted some very very

3491
02:08:55,279 --> 02:08:59,759
special seeds i've got some is it

3492
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:02,159
sumatra tripping weed that from

3493
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:04,159
indonesia some seeds from there that i

3494
02:09:02,158 --> 02:09:06,960
was given by himalayan connection that

3495
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:09,118
i'm going to be working with soon and

3496
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:11,520
things like that for someone like him

3497
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:13,920
who searches out genetics at source and

3498
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:16,079
has an incredible network of people to

3499
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:18,319
reach out to me and give me something so

3500
02:09:16,078 --> 02:09:20,559
unique that he searched out for years

3501
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:22,479
and years and him to see

3502
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:23,760
something in me to say look bro i think

3503
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:26,238
you could do something special with

3504
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:28,239
these that's that's incredible so i'm

3505
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:29,839
excited about working with those soon as

3506
02:09:28,238 --> 02:09:32,078
well

3507
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,800
so i looked through some of your work

3508
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:38,158
just on online and i noticed in a few

3509
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:40,960
places that you had essentially worked

3510
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:43,118
with some super silver haze stock i was

3511
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:45,439
wondering where did you get that was it

3512
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:47,118
from like the pre-2000 stuff or is it

3513
02:09:45,439 --> 02:09:48,399
more newer

3514
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:52,319
that's the

3515
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:54,960
that's this ssdh that was uh basically

3516
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:57,519
there was a cross from res doctor oj at

3517
02:09:54,960 --> 02:10:00,239
connoisseur genetics done a selection

3518
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:02,480
from and got a super silver sour diesel

3519
02:10:00,238 --> 02:10:05,519
haze and that is crossed with the

3520
02:10:02,479 --> 02:10:07,759
cookies which is in my cookie fever

3521
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:11,199
and that one yeah that was res dog's cut

3522
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:13,199
which is like old old black pack when

3523
02:10:11,198 --> 02:10:15,359
shanty barber was breeding that was a

3524
02:10:13,198 --> 02:10:16,879
very special cut say what you want about

3525
02:10:15,359 --> 02:10:19,439
res you may have been a bit of a [ __ ]

3526
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:21,279
but that was a wicked cut

3527
02:10:19,439 --> 02:10:23,678
yeah it's funny that that sentiment

3528
02:10:21,279 --> 02:10:25,359
comes up a fair bit so

3529
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:29,118
um i've noticed more recently you've

3530
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:30,639
been doing some collabs with ocd labs

3531
02:10:29,118 --> 02:10:32,799
what does that mean in practical terms

3532
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:35,520
like what do you do what do they do and

3533
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:37,760
what's your ideal collab like

3534
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:40,400
to be honest bro what that is uh that is

3535
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:45,119
uh that was something i started myself

3536
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:45,118
with a friend of mine way back in like

3537
02:10:47,158 --> 02:10:52,799
2013 maybe

3538
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:55,359
yeah about 2013 a friend of mine who i

3539
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:58,239
don't work with like i'll be honest ocd

3540
02:10:55,359 --> 02:11:00,319
labs now is kind of redundant because i

3541
02:10:58,238 --> 02:11:02,319
haven't been really doing much

3542
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:05,198
work through it it's me that's doing the

3543
02:11:02,319 --> 02:11:07,359
work now because my partner went off and

3544
02:11:05,198 --> 02:11:09,359
done his own thing now so really it's

3545
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:11,679
just me making rosin now through my own

3546
02:11:09,359 --> 02:11:14,559
genetics and the concept behind that bro

3547
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:17,199
was just literally when i saw how the

3548
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:19,199
american industry was going i knew that

3549
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:21,198
an extract company was essential so i

3550
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:24,719
started an extract company and i had a

3551
02:11:21,198 --> 02:11:27,118
friend who runs uh

3552
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:29,679
at the time he was just like a

3553
02:11:27,118 --> 02:11:32,238
a forum guy that was on the forums and

3554
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:35,199
he was like in the uk he was working for

3555
02:11:32,238 --> 02:11:37,359
like an estate agent but he was so on

3556
02:11:35,198 --> 02:11:38,879
point and obsessed with like the extract

3557
02:11:37,359 --> 02:11:42,799
game he was one of the first people that

3558
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:44,880
ever had shatter that was super on point

3559
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:46,719
so me being on the pulse of things i

3560
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:49,199
just decided i'm like bro let's start an

3561
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:51,359
extra company like

3562
02:11:49,198 --> 02:11:52,799
you can be the front man like i'll

3563
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:54,238
provide the genetics let's have an

3564
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:56,239
extract company everyone's doing it in

3565
02:11:54,238 --> 02:11:58,238
america let's just do it i'd rather have

3566
02:11:56,238 --> 02:12:00,959
an in-house one and being able to put

3567
02:11:58,238 --> 02:12:02,158
out all my genetics and do that and then

3568
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,679
because of all my friends in the

3569
02:12:02,158 --> 02:12:05,920
industry we just

3570
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:08,480
made some amazing like links in

3571
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:11,199
amsterdam and we just had a wonderful

3572
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:12,399
golden age in amsterdam where

3573
02:12:11,198 --> 02:12:14,879
myself

3574
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:16,960
ramon from yellowbrick labs now and

3575
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:18,960
another guy called rick who runs

3576
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,719
something called

3577
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:23,679
i can't remember the name of his company

3578
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:26,158
now but he's an amsterdam based guy we

3579
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:30,639
all ran ocd labs together when i was in

3580
02:12:26,158 --> 02:12:35,198
amsterdam and we did work for soma we

3581
02:12:30,639 --> 02:12:37,679
did work for dna we did work for

3582
02:12:35,198 --> 02:12:39,919
marimbaros and we done all the stuff for

3583
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:43,279
true kind of genetics so we were putting

3584
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:45,679
out so many extracts at a time when

3585
02:12:43,279 --> 02:12:47,679
there was no scene in europe there was

3586
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:50,000
the only other extract company that

3587
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:52,239
existed was nerd extracts

3588
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,238
and that was literally it so we kind of

3589
02:12:52,238 --> 02:12:56,879
wrote the birth of the revolution of

3590
02:12:54,238 --> 02:12:58,718
extracts and from amsterdam we just had

3591
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:00,880
people coming over constantly from the

3592
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:03,359
uk just getting tons of extracts and

3593
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:06,000
just blew up the whole european scene it

3594
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:08,559
was incredible to see that change like

3595
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,560
the amount of people that we gave first

3596
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:12,800
dabs to that now have

3597
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:13,840
glass shops extract company edible

3598
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:16,639
company

3599
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:19,279
clothing line like just crazy like just

3600
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:21,840
to see that everyone who's been around

3601
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:24,880
this scene has been inspired by the

3602
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:26,800
whole birth and their influx of social

3603
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:29,679
media the way that's affected it it's

3604
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:32,480
crazy it's crazy to see

3605
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:33,920
yeah huge progression right

3606
02:13:32,479 --> 02:13:35,759
the amount of extract companies that

3607
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:37,520
exist in england

3608
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:39,360
and it's a country that's where it's

3609
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:41,360
illegal and there are like

3610
02:13:39,359 --> 02:13:43,198
extract companies to build amazing

3611
02:13:41,359 --> 02:13:44,960
brands all kinds of edible companies

3612
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:47,198
it's like it's wild to think that it's

3613
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:49,118
got to that stage now

3614
02:13:47,198 --> 02:13:49,839
yeah 100

3615
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:51,039
so

3616
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:53,199
i don't know if we've touched on it

3617
02:13:51,039 --> 02:13:55,359
already but i'm always keen to know what

3618
02:13:53,198 --> 02:13:57,839
style of growing are you a fan or are

3619
02:13:55,359 --> 02:13:59,519
you into the no-till you're into coco

3620
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:01,760
what do you like

3621
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,159
i've been like my first ever grow that

3622
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:06,000
i'd done was remember i said i got two

3623
02:14:04,158 --> 02:14:08,158
friends off my like two plants off my

3624
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,000
friend that he dragged him from outside

3625
02:14:08,158 --> 02:14:13,439
and they were soil when i went to the

3626
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:16,319
grove shop and like got set up properly

3627
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:19,198
the guy advised me to grow with cocoa

3628
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:20,078
so from that day forward i grew a cocoa

3629
02:14:19,198 --> 02:14:22,000
and

3630
02:14:20,078 --> 02:14:24,639
because i was always so obsessed with

3631
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,399
getting it clean i've always loved cocoa

3632
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:28,560
for that reason the way i could grow

3633
02:14:26,399 --> 02:14:30,799
multiple strains

3634
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:33,760
not have any real deficiencies

3635
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:36,400
and get it flushed out it's like

3636
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:39,520
my examples of soil growers and organic

3637
02:14:36,399 --> 02:14:41,920
was never great until the last few years

3638
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:45,440
since no-till really blew up

3639
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:47,840
there's a guy called roadrunner 420 uk

3640
02:14:45,439 --> 02:14:50,960
who's in the uk of course and

3641
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:53,199
he does incredible no-till

3642
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:55,920
he is one of the people that showed me

3643
02:14:53,198 --> 02:14:57,439
what the results can be it's like i know

3644
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:59,359
that the best of the best is always

3645
02:14:57,439 --> 02:15:00,078
going to be soil grown but the problem

3646
02:14:59,359 --> 02:15:02,479
is

3647
02:15:00,078 --> 02:15:05,439
it's so hard to get that right and to

3648
02:15:02,479 --> 02:15:07,839
dial that right it's like i would do i i

3649
02:15:05,439 --> 02:15:09,919
once took over growth from some people

3650
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:11,360
and it's like out of the room i had some

3651
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,880
plants were like the best thing i've

3652
02:15:11,359 --> 02:15:14,719
ever smoked but

3653
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:16,400
it was like 20 of the plants were like

3654
02:15:14,719 --> 02:15:18,000
that i couldn't get them all to be right

3655
02:15:16,399 --> 02:15:19,198
i had some deficiencies here and some

3656
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,078
bits there

3657
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:20,960
and

3658
02:15:20,078 --> 02:15:23,759
now

3659
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:25,439
as a breeder grow in so many different

3660
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:28,000
strains

3661
02:15:25,439 --> 02:15:29,359
all the time cocoa is easier for me to

3662
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,000
maintain

3663
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:33,759
but as far as smoking than the best of

3664
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,520
the best

3665
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:39,599
my outdoor no-till dragonfly of medicine

3666
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:41,280
in the ground in the sun

3667
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:43,440
that's probably my favorite thing ever

3668
02:15:41,279 --> 02:15:45,198
it's like that's what i really love it's

3669
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:47,919
like i love to grow outdoors if i could

3670
02:15:45,198 --> 02:15:51,198
be somewhere at the perfect climate had

3671
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:53,599
a long season outdoor sun grown is

3672
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:55,919
something magic about those turps it's

3673
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:58,880
like indoors

3674
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:01,679
yeah if i had a small tent i would do no

3675
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:04,800
chill i'd keep it like that i may

3676
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:06,480
i may move into that over time but it's

3677
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:09,199
something i need to practice on a

3678
02:16:06,479 --> 02:16:11,598
smaller scale dial in become confident

3679
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:13,519
with and then go towards i can't make

3680
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:14,239
such a big jump when i'm dealing with

3681
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:16,480
like

3682
02:16:14,238 --> 02:16:20,319
30 to 40 different mother plants that

3683
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:22,238
i'm keeping healthy and making seeds but

3684
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:24,960
as far as seed-wise the best seeds i've

3685
02:16:22,238 --> 02:16:27,118
ever made are the ones i made

3686
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:28,880
outdoor organic grown they are the

3687
02:16:27,118 --> 02:16:30,319
biggest fattiest

3688
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:31,279
healthiest

3689
02:16:30,319 --> 02:16:33,760
most

3690
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:35,279
incredible looking seeds like you have

3691
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:37,679
yeah i have problems putting them in a

3692
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:39,439
vial because they're so much bigger than

3693
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:41,599
the normal seeds that you just about get

3694
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:44,479
15 in a vial

3695
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:46,239
that's uh that sounds lovely

3696
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:47,760
like eventually that's where i would

3697
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:50,478
like to get to it's just going to be a

3698
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:52,398
progression where i get the tech right

3699
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:55,519
get myself confident and then i will

3700
02:16:52,398 --> 02:16:57,679
eventually move to a no-till kind of

3701
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:59,120
grow set up that's like that's that's

3702
02:16:57,679 --> 02:17:01,439
the goal you know what i mean i don't

3703
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:03,359
know how close it is but i think that's

3704
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:04,880
that's the goal at the moment i'm very

3705
02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:07,439
lucky that i've got a couple of good

3706
02:17:04,879 --> 02:17:09,759
nutrient companies buddha's tree and

3707
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:12,159
shogun nutrients that i use and they're

3708
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:15,120
both uk based companies

3709
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:17,840
i've said to people as a uk breeder

3710
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:21,439
although i'm not living in the uk

3711
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:23,280
i expect the uk growers to support a uk

3712
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:26,079
breeder so

3713
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:28,479
i myself try and support uk industry as

3714
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:30,239
much as i can so when it comes to me

3715
02:17:28,478 --> 02:17:32,159
getting my packaging or stickers done i

3716
02:17:30,239 --> 02:17:34,478
use sticker express if i'm getting my

3717
02:17:32,159 --> 02:17:37,359
nutrients i want a uk brand if i want

3718
02:17:34,478 --> 02:17:40,318
lights i want crop master led you know

3719
02:17:37,359 --> 02:17:42,880
like i will always try my best to use a

3720
02:17:40,318 --> 02:17:45,199
uk company if possible because

3721
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:47,518
i'm trying to tell people look i'm a uk

3722
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:48,960
guy breeding i've got just as good as

3723
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:50,960
anywhere in the world

3724
02:17:48,959 --> 02:17:52,718
geograph geography doesn't dictate

3725
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:54,159
quality genetics it's about the hard

3726
02:17:52,718 --> 02:17:55,358
work that you put in

3727
02:17:54,159 --> 02:17:58,398
and

3728
02:17:55,359 --> 02:18:00,880
the genetics that you've got so i can't

3729
02:17:58,398 --> 02:18:02,638
push my brand to uk people and not do

3730
02:18:00,879 --> 02:18:04,398
the same

3731
02:18:02,638 --> 02:18:06,239
yeah of course and that's exciting to

3732
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:08,239
hear that you're almost fully there with

3733
02:18:06,239 --> 02:18:10,718
the no-till and a quick shout out to

3734
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:12,638
road runner and vic firth two homies

3735
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:13,678
holding it down in the uk

3736
02:18:12,638 --> 02:18:16,159
um so

3737
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:18,398
we've talked about how in barcelona this

3738
02:18:16,159 --> 02:18:21,200
is a established concentrate scene as

3739
02:18:18,398 --> 02:18:23,519
well as in the broader spain in general

3740
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:25,519
is there a similar phenomena going on

3741
02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:28,478
where vape carts are taking over the

3742
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:31,040
scene like we see in the states

3743
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:33,599
yeah sadly vape carts are like the

3744
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:35,599
casual smoker kind of thing that people

3745
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:37,840
who can't roll a joint or whatever just

3746
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:40,398
want to buy them so there has been a bit

3747
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:42,159
of an influx and amongst all the [ __ ]

3748
02:18:40,398 --> 02:18:44,318
that people have been bringing over from

3749
02:18:42,159 --> 02:18:46,478
america there's like a bunch of like

3750
02:18:44,318 --> 02:18:49,039
renamed carts that you could just tell

3751
02:18:46,478 --> 02:18:50,840
with like hot dog water with extra eagle

3752
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:54,000
20s you know i mean that's

3753
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:55,679
like micro butanol tips wow and so what

3754
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,760
do you think we can do to help counter

3755
02:18:55,679 --> 02:18:59,760
this and get people to realize that you

3756
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:01,760
know like a really good grown flower or

3757
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:03,439
really nice made concentrates or a

3758
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:05,040
superior product

3759
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:06,880
i think you've got name and shame i

3760
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:08,800
think people need to go around take

3761
02:19:06,879 --> 02:19:10,318
samples from a bunch of places get them

3762
02:19:08,799 --> 02:19:12,318
all tested and then name and shame

3763
02:19:10,318 --> 02:19:14,318
people that are putting out products

3764
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:16,558
with these things on them and then

3765
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:18,478
slowly the people that put in the work

3766
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:20,959
and work hard to get a clean room and

3767
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:24,318
not use pesticides and not spray things

3768
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:26,159
on it's like i go above and beyond to

3769
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:27,439
only use

3770
02:19:26,159 --> 02:19:29,599
beneficial

3771
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:31,439
microbes and things like that because i

3772
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:32,960
don't want residue on my plants because

3773
02:19:31,439 --> 02:19:35,760
any residue is going to come off in an

3774
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:37,839
extract so to keep a clean garden and

3775
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:41,599
not have anything with residue

3776
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:43,359
it's horrendously [ __ ] hard to get

3777
02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:45,599
to a level where you're happy and

3778
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:47,120
keeping a clean garden

3779
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:49,680
so

3780
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:52,160
it's hard when that's not appreciated so

3781
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:55,120
when testing becomes more prevalent i

3782
02:19:52,159 --> 02:19:56,639
can't wait because everything i put out

3783
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,640
will get tested

3784
02:19:56,639 --> 02:20:00,879
and that will be one of the points that

3785
02:19:58,639 --> 02:20:04,000
i want people to understand is

3786
02:20:00,879 --> 02:20:06,639
clean well-grown product that hasn't

3787
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,200
been sprayed with [ __ ] is not easy

3788
02:20:06,639 --> 02:20:10,318
and until people actually know it's like

3789
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:12,000
i i

3790
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:13,519
it makes me

3791
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:15,680
shake to think

3792
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:16,880
the things that people are consuming

3793
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:18,960
because

3794
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:20,559
the export market that's happening from

3795
02:20:18,959 --> 02:20:22,559
a miracle of stuff that's going to fail

3796
02:20:20,559 --> 02:20:24,398
the standards is just terrible bro and

3797
02:20:22,559 --> 02:20:25,600
the distillate that's coming over it's

3798
02:20:24,398 --> 02:20:27,760
like

3799
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:29,760
man people are using distilling things

3800
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:31,680
and it's like wow you just know where

3801
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:34,000
that's coming from distal it's you can't

3802
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:35,920
get enough distillate in america to fill

3803
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:38,000
the demand so if it's getting out the

3804
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:40,159
prices it's getting out at

3805
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,318
no wonder it's like it's a price is

3806
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:44,000
where i've had to say to people like

3807
02:20:42,318 --> 02:20:46,079
that's not feasible bro go look in

3808
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,639
america where it costs to get clean

3809
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:50,239
distillate just tested and ask yourself

3810
02:20:48,639 --> 02:20:51,439
how you're buying it for that price in

3811
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:52,719
europe

3812
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:54,239
it's like

3813
02:20:52,719 --> 02:20:56,079
people need to wake up and really pay

3814
02:20:54,239 --> 02:20:58,318
attention to things because

3815
02:20:56,079 --> 02:20:59,920
sadly the market is making too much

3816
02:20:58,318 --> 02:21:01,279
money and i mean anything makes a lot of

3817
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:02,719
money it brings in the wrong type of

3818
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:05,359
people and there's opportunists they're

3819
02:21:02,719 --> 02:21:08,239
taking like how can there be

3820
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:10,399
fake diamonds out now what the hell is

3821
02:21:08,239 --> 02:21:13,119
going on in the world where people are

3822
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:16,879
selling tree sap diamonds and things

3823
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:18,640
like that it's like it's just crazy so

3824
02:21:16,879 --> 02:21:20,000
the black market causes these problems

3825
02:21:18,639 --> 02:21:22,559
bro that's the reality of it the only

3826
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,318
thing we can do is just work towards

3827
02:21:22,559 --> 02:21:27,039
some kind of

3828
02:21:24,318 --> 02:21:28,799
regulated market to avoid all the

3829
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:30,399
fuck-ups

3830
02:21:28,799 --> 02:21:33,679
so what do you think is most optimal

3831
02:21:30,398 --> 02:21:36,079
legalization or decriminalization

3832
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:38,398
decriminalization

3833
02:21:36,079 --> 02:21:40,239
yeah i think decriminalization and allow

3834
02:21:38,398 --> 02:21:41,920
people to use their intelligence and

3835
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:43,680
allow people to test these things and

3836
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:46,478
that to be part of it it's like i think

3837
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:48,079
that makes more sense for people to like

3838
02:21:46,478 --> 02:21:49,438
bro if you if you want to be an idiot

3839
02:21:48,079 --> 02:21:50,799
and you want to get the cheapest thing

3840
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:52,720
and you don't care that's going to be

3841
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:54,559
your mentality no matter what goes on

3842
02:21:52,719 --> 02:21:56,239
you'll always go to a backstreet person

3843
02:21:54,559 --> 02:21:58,079
but if you're sensible you'll look for

3844
02:21:56,239 --> 02:22:00,000
the right things that have been tested

3845
02:21:58,079 --> 02:22:02,000
and all of that so the people that do

3846
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:03,760
that will have the best spots it's like

3847
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:05,840
if there's a place in barcelona that all

3848
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:08,159
of a sudden everything's tested and that

3849
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:11,040
certificate so say it's clean mold

3850
02:22:08,159 --> 02:22:12,959
pesticide fungicide free all of that and

3851
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,319
they've done it off of their own back

3852
02:22:12,959 --> 02:22:15,919
they know the ones that people are going

3853
02:22:14,318 --> 02:22:17,359
to pay attention to they're the ones

3854
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:20,000
people are going to want

3855
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:21,600
so i think that brings us to our

3856
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,280
quickfire questions before we wrap

3857
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:25,520
things up so

3858
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:28,399

favorites i actually miss the indian and

3876
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:06,880

3879
02:23:08,639 --> 02:23:13,760

spend time with my dogs just enjoy

3881
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:17,920
living in the mountains and going for a

3882
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:20,479
peaceful walk with just nothing around

3883
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:22,079
other than beautiful scenery

3884
02:23:20,478 --> 02:23:24,239
that's really the

3885
02:23:22,079 --> 02:23:26,000
the most enjoyable times when i'm most

3886
02:23:24,239 --> 02:23:28,239
at peace road

3887
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,559
have a nice few fat dabs and set myself

3888
02:23:28,239 --> 02:23:33,920
off on a nice little walk with the dogs

3889
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:35,680
this sounds lovely so next question what

3890
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:38,719
has been the most memorable canvas

3891
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:41,120
you've ever smoked in your whole life

3892
02:23:38,719 --> 02:23:44,000
i smoked african land race when i was

3893
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:46,640
like 16 and it made me go blind for like

3894
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,639
three minutes on a high street

3895
02:23:46,639 --> 02:23:50,318
chasing that high

3896
02:23:48,639 --> 02:23:51,119
bro i've been looking for that one ever

3897
02:23:50,318 --> 02:23:53,119
since

3898
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:56,399
i've done so many other psychedelics and

3899
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:58,240
drugs in my like adult life and never

3900
02:23:56,398 --> 02:24:00,959
once has it been as terrifying as those

3901
02:23:58,239 --> 02:24:05,119
three minutes

3902
02:24:00,959 --> 02:24:05,119
wow best and worst three minutes

3903
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:11,439
okay so on the other end of the spectrum

3904
02:24:08,879 --> 02:24:13,679
what was the worst strain you've ever

3905
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:15,600
smoked and my follow-up is

3906
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:17,520
what's the worst strain you've ever

3907
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:18,880
smoked part one and then part two is

3908
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:21,280
what's the worst strain you've ever

3909
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:23,119
smoked that somehow got a lot of

3910
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:24,880
commercial traction and other people

3911
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:27,359
liked

3912
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:29,039
worst dream i've ever smoked

3913
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:30,479
i'm from the days

3914
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:33,200
of

3915
02:24:30,478 --> 02:24:34,159
sticks and seeds

3916
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:36,240
so

3917
02:24:34,159 --> 02:24:38,639
when i was like

3918
02:24:36,239 --> 02:24:43,680
maybe 1999

3919
02:24:38,639 --> 02:24:45,358
or 2000 yeah say 98 or 99

3920
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:47,920
98 it would have been yep that's it i've

3921
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:50,079
done a mental mess in 1998

3922
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:52,318
i was getting weed that was coming in

3923
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:54,398
with albanian guys and i think it was

3924
02:24:52,318 --> 02:24:57,279
like from albania or somewhere in that

3925
02:24:54,398 --> 02:25:00,318
part of the world and i was paying like

3926
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:03,840
25 pound an ounce now bear in mind ounce

3927
02:25:00,318 --> 02:25:06,879
of weed normally was like 140.

3928
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:07,680
so 25 pound an ounce for this weed it

3929
02:25:06,879 --> 02:25:10,000
was

3930
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:11,359
it was horrendous bro it's like you lit

3931
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,959
like it was one of the things that

3932
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:14,318
started making me smoke pure because i

3933
02:25:12,959 --> 02:25:16,398
was just had so much of it and you

3934
02:25:14,318 --> 02:25:17,920
needed to smoke so much of it you could

3935
02:25:16,398 --> 02:25:19,760
actually just leave the tobacco out and

3936
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:21,520
just smoke two grams

3937
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:23,680
so that was the worst weed i've ever

3938
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:25,680
smoked but it was just funny because i

3939
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:28,159
was getting so much of it and moving so

3940
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:30,720
much of it but my god it was terrible

3941
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:33,280
bro it was it might have been hemp i

3942
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:33,279
don't even know

3943
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:39,840
and then so what's in your opinion is

3944
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,439
the weirdest strain which you didn't

3945
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:43,200
really like but it's commercially it

3946
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:45,600
seemed to take off

3947
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:47,520
do you know what yeah

3948
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:49,439
i'll probably seem like a [ __ ] hater

3949
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:51,280
for saying this

3950
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:54,239
but for me i don't i've never been that

3951
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:54,239
taken by july

3952
02:25:54,318 --> 02:25:59,359
it's like for me like i can understand

3953
02:25:56,879 --> 02:26:01,279
why skittles is hyped

3954
02:25:59,359 --> 02:26:03,680
it's got a profile that makes people go

3955
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:06,000
wow like it's incredible to profile i

3956
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:08,239
can understand why sherbet is like

3957
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:09,600
sherbert's got a wicked like i love that

3958
02:26:08,239 --> 02:26:12,879
profile i can understand the height

3959
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:15,120
behind that it's like

3960
02:26:12,879 --> 02:26:16,398
lemon tree it's like when that kick got

3961
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:17,760
hyped up i'm like i've got something

3962
02:26:16,398 --> 02:26:19,760
that smells like lemon tree you know

3963
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:21,280
like a lot of things

3964
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:22,719
i've got something i can go like i've

3965
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:25,439
got something that smells like i've got

3966
02:26:22,719 --> 02:26:27,760
someone who smells like that so

3967
02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:29,040
i can see hype when things don't but

3968
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:30,960
gelato

3969
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:32,880
disappointed me every time i've smoked

3970
02:26:30,959 --> 02:26:35,119
better crosses of gelato than gelato

3971
02:26:32,879 --> 02:26:36,639
i've been disappointed by all the gelato

3972
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:38,319
but some gelato crosses i've been

3973
02:26:36,639 --> 02:26:41,039
impressed by

3974
02:26:38,318 --> 02:26:42,079
there you go the inception so our next

3975
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:43,840
question

3976
02:26:42,079 --> 02:26:46,840
you're on a desert island you can only

3977
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:50,799
take three strains with you what are

3978
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:50,799
they i would take

3979
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:57,359
my chem valley cook's mail

3980
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:01,319
and then i would take

3981
02:27:02,239 --> 02:27:06,879
my

3982
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:08,960
grape lemonade 23

3983
02:27:06,879 --> 02:27:11,599
and then i would take

3984
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:13,919
a term silica

3985
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:15,840
lovely and then you'd get to work

3986
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:18,239
yeah and then i'll be good i'll be able

3987
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:19,760
to go in many directions

3988
02:27:18,239 --> 02:27:20,799
that's a tropical fruit on the tropical

3989
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:22,880
island

3990
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:25,840
lovely lovely happy with your coconuts i

3991
02:27:22,879 --> 02:27:28,159
like it so the next one is

3992
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:30,799
if you could have one clone back that

3993
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:32,398
you've lost or one that you wanted but

3994
02:27:30,799 --> 02:27:34,879
we're just never able to get your hands

3995
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:36,959
on what would it be

3996
02:27:34,879 --> 02:27:39,279
there's two there's one i can get back

3997
02:27:36,959 --> 02:27:40,639
and i'm gonna get back at some point and

3998
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,239
then there's one that i can never get

3999
02:27:40,639 --> 02:27:45,199
back

4000
02:27:42,239 --> 02:27:47,520
yeah yeah do tell more the one i can

4001
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:48,640
never get back is a cut of sour bubble

4002
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:50,880
that i had

4003
02:27:48,639 --> 02:27:54,799
which is from bog

4004
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:57,599
now bob will say publicly that that's a

4005
02:27:54,799 --> 02:27:58,959
freak fino of bubble gum

4006
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:00,880
i've heard from someone that he

4007
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:02,879
privately said it's a sour bar but it's

4008
02:28:00,879 --> 02:28:04,719
a bubba cush cross

4009
02:28:02,879 --> 02:28:06,879
every anyone who knows anything about

4010
02:28:04,719 --> 02:28:09,760
bubba kush knows sour bubble is a bubba

4011
02:28:06,879 --> 02:28:11,519
cush cross i don't want to hate on bog

4012
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:13,439
he's a lovely guy i've got a lot of

4013
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:16,560
respect for him but

4014
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:18,639
sour bubble is bubba crush on bubble gum

4015
02:28:16,559 --> 02:28:20,959
i would bet my life on it may i be

4016
02:28:18,639 --> 02:28:23,358
struck down by lightning if i'm telling

4017
02:28:20,959 --> 02:28:25,358
a lion anyone who smoked it tell me what

4018
02:28:23,359 --> 02:28:28,559
you think i would love to see comments

4019
02:28:25,359 --> 02:28:31,120
on this one but that for me as much as

4020
02:28:28,559 --> 02:28:32,879
it was that it was incredible so it's

4021
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:34,720
like i criticized him for not admitting

4022
02:28:32,879 --> 02:28:36,239
what it was but i'll be honest it was

4023
02:28:34,719 --> 02:28:37,840
probably the silliest thing he ever done

4024
02:28:36,239 --> 02:28:39,520
because if he would have said back in

4025
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:41,520
the day what it was it would have blown

4026
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:43,200
up even more and been even more hyped

4027
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:46,800
and at a time when

4028
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:49,600
it was kind of like reservoir seeds and

4029
02:28:46,799 --> 02:28:52,959
bog were the two kind of hype companies

4030
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:55,439
online and it was all about being sour

4031
02:28:52,959 --> 02:28:57,438
because sour diesel had blown up and bob

4032
02:28:55,439 --> 02:29:00,479
was trying to capitalize and get in on

4033
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:02,960
that hype market so he done that cross

4034
02:29:00,478 --> 02:29:05,599
called it sour bubble but said it's a

4035
02:29:02,959 --> 02:29:09,039
freak sour fino of bubble gum because

4036
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:10,159
his whole line is bubble gum based but

4037
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:11,920
i've heard

4038
02:29:10,159 --> 02:29:16,159
he said to someone in private that yeah

4039
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:16,159
it's a bubba kush hybrid so there you go

4040
02:29:16,478 --> 02:29:20,398
we've heard that sentiment before and

4041
02:29:18,159 --> 02:29:22,398
then what about the one you can get back

4042
02:29:20,398 --> 02:29:24,478
the tk the triangle cushion i'm waiting

4043
02:29:22,398 --> 02:29:25,920
for that one to come back to me but of

4044
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:28,639
all the things yeah the triangle

4045
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:29,920
cushion's the one i'm missing i just

4046
02:29:28,639 --> 02:29:31,680
i haven't really

4047
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:33,520
made an effort to get ropes like it'll

4048
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:35,600
come back eventually it'll come back i'm

4049
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:37,359
like i'm not a

4050
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:38,640
chase chase chase things a few people

4051
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:40,479
know that i want it eventually they'll

4052
02:29:38,639 --> 02:29:43,199
come to me

4053
02:29:40,478 --> 02:29:46,879
yeah i share that sentiment she's a

4054
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:47,600
amazing plan i am i miss her quite a lot

4055
02:29:46,879 --> 02:29:50,398
so

4056
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:53,040
the next one the final question if you

4057
02:29:50,398 --> 02:29:55,119
could go back in time anywhere any place

4058
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:56,240
anytime throughout history and get some

4059
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:59,120
seeds

4060
02:29:56,239 --> 02:30:03,280
where are you going and when

4061
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:05,840
i would go back to when thailand

4062
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:08,079
had loads of thriving things there's

4063
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:10,318
something about thai weed i love all the

4064
02:30:08,079 --> 02:30:11,760
different variety and the one that i

4065
02:30:10,318 --> 02:30:14,559
really really

4066
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:16,960
crave more than anything is the old

4067
02:30:14,559 --> 02:30:19,199
juicy fruit type

4068
02:30:16,959 --> 02:30:21,759
i would go back to when the juicy fruits

4069
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:22,560
i was there and was undisturbed and was

4070
