20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,558
thanks so much leo stone for joining us

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,920
today thanks a lot and i really

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,000
appreciate it man

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,558
no worries so first question what are

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,519
you currently smoking on

25
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,920
uh

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,320
we haven't named it yet it's a cross

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,040
between uh cherry noir

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,798
which was a collab that uh

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
me and gene and i did

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,439
back in 2013 i gave a mail from my uh

31
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,798
pollen from my chem dog special reserve

32
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,239
mail and he put that on one of his

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,479
cherry limes

34
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,478
and uh that plant ended up becoming the

35
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,000
mother of one of the selections from

36
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,078
those seeds and to become the mother for

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,599
the white cherry truffle so we took that

38
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,199
mother and we put a testerosa mail on it

39
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,759
to see where it would take it it took it

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,759
in an entirely different direction so

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,519
i've been smoking on it for a week

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,799
and i've been talking to professor q

43
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,798
who's my partner

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,159
and uh you know he lives in france right

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
now and so i'm telling him he's like man

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,359
you you know what the [ __ ] are we gonna

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
we have a working title for it you know

48
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,280
but it's like you know we don't know

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,439
where we're gonna name it it's just it's

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,920
a new flavor we haven't you know we have

51
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,438
yet to you know come across so

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,799
we don't want to give it some generic

53
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,639
ass name that's not going to give it

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,640
some justice

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
yeah okay i mean gosh there's so many

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,840
questions i want to ask and i'm going to

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
forget a bunch of them i guess the first

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,719
one and the most kind of recent thing

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,520
you mentioned at the end there was the

60
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,039
idea of giving relevant names to strains

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
i've always felt like this is an

62
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,159
important point like you know someone

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
made a point in the past where they were

64
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,759
like oh you go give some awesome name to

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,840
a strain and then it turns out to be a

66
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,759
shitty strain like

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,439
yeah what do you think should be our

68
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,878
conventions around naming strains do you

69
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,560
think people should put an effort into

70
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,598
trying to make like you know name it

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,640
yeah

72
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,639
yeah it's like

73
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,719
it's like uh

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
i i think i you know it's it's the

75
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,560
identity of the strain

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,599
you know and if you go beyond that and

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,280
you go start like you know we're

78
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,719
breeders and you know your job is to

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,840
make strains connect with people and you

80
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,598
have to market those strains so you

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
connect with people and so

82
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,839
you know we really approach it it's it's

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
a lot like music to us

84
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
you know it's like

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
the

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,199
the the the name of the album the name

87
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,878
of the track

88
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,919
has to fit the song

89
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,598
and so it you know in our case as being

90
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,679
breeders for us it's like the name

91
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,919
really has to fit the strain

92
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,239
and uh when it comes to naming you know

93
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,238
it's it's an important aspect of you

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,800
know distinguishing yourself as a

95
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,640
breeder or a creator of strains

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
on what you name your strains it's what

97
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,759
it's it's the it's gonna be the world's

98
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,280
first

99
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,598
um it's gonna be the world's first

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,560
experience and interface with your work

101
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:27,759
they're gonna understand they're gonna

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,959
hear the name

103
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,479
they're gonna hear about it before they

104
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,719
even smoke it

105
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,439
you know 99.9 percent of the time so to

106
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,560
me it's the i it's it's it's the true

107
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,719
identity that you're going to give it

108
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,598
for the long term so i think that a lot

109
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,519
of

110
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,598
um a lot of thought a lot of really

111
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,759
careful thought needs to go into what

112
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,598
you're going to name your children right

113
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,840
so it's to me the same thing you said

114
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,759
with with with with what we go naming

115
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
strains not really a convention

116
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,878
um

117
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,719
we'll go into breeding a strain

118
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,719
and people will you know we'll go oh

119
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,519
let's call it this

120
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,759
and

121
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,438
you'll finish the strain at the end and

122
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,719
it just doesn't [ __ ] identify with

123
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,959
that name you got to call it something

124
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,560
different it's it's essence

125
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,400
it you know isn't exposed till you're

126
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,318
done making the strain and it's final

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,239
and it's fine in the final product

128
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,238
that's what you name you know and the

129
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,478
consistency of of your strands you're

130
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,918
breeding it's it's this is like a really

131
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,560
this is something i'm super passionate

132
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,560
about is is i think it goes often

133
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,639
overlooked because a lot of breeders got

134
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,439
to understand that every single [ __ ]

135
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,360
strain is its own brand it's not about

136
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,719
your company as the [ __ ] seed brand

137
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,800
yeah that's the umbrella you're the

138
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
carrier you're the worker bee the plant

139
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,478
is allowing you to take its pollen and

140
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,399
make certain crosses i believe that more

141
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,560
than anything you know but when it comes

142
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,839
to you know naming these things and

143
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,639
giving these things a life

144
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,799
and an identity you know uh it's it's

145
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,680
it's a huge [ __ ] process for us

146
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,079
because that's gonna that's

147
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,400
that's the life of the cookies right

148
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,800
let's say someone took cookies and [ __ ]

149
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,198
said and [ __ ] got lazy and was like oh

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,960
this is just f1 derb cross

151
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
you know does it [ __ ] taste does it

152
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,439
when you open the bag does it smell like

153
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
a plate of fresh cookies [ __ ] no but it

154
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,600
has its own identity you could open a

155
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,599
bag and smell cookies and

156
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
that's [ __ ] cookies and the labels

157
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,280
right there and so like our goal as

158
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,800
breeders is to establish that is to

159
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,000
establish something that's easy to

160
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,160
remember

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,600
but also inspires a sense of

162
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,680
the name is supposed to instantly

163
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,439
inspire a sense of value

164
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,840
or or or an idea or a myth or or

165
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,759
supposed to um connect with a certain

166
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,679
emotion you know that's what we try to

167
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,199
do when we strains you know it's like

168
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,519
you know who wants

169
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,600
real weed head knows what cat pisses

170
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,359
real weed heads know what cat piss is

171
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,039
but you ask your you know you ask people

172
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,960
hey you want to smoke wedding cake great

173
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,719
pie or cat piss

174
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,319
they'll probably pick the sweeter of the

175
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
straights unless they know what cat piss

176
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,240
is so you know the branding is really

177
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,879
important to me

178
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639
yeah yeah on the money with that one so

179
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,279
a sentiment someone has echoed in the

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
past was that they were looking up some

181
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,000
names because they wanted to name their

182
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,919
strain this name so they're looking to

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,519
see if it's taken and sure enough it is

184
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,439
and then so they think of next in line

185
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,879
and then sure enough that one's taken do

186
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,399
you ever do you have a fear that that

187
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,839
day is going to come when there are

188
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,679
really no names

189
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,519
it's happy [ __ ] right now

190
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,519
there's so many strains

191
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,639
um we've been working on

192
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,719
in

193
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,000
um you know some of these strains take

194
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,319
years you know what i mean some of the

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,639
times you know we'll we'll we'll make an

196
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,720
f1 the f1 will just so [ __ ] fire and

197
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,400
it'll do great in testing

198
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,160
and that will just release f once but

199
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,279
when we're we're trying to

200
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,479
um

201
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,918
you know whether we're trying to take

202
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,758
something and back cross it or we're

203
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,120
trying to bring it to like f2 three or

204
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
four depending on what we want to

205
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,639
release because people want to you know

206
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,319
a certain modicum of variety um

207
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,519
i'm sorry i got high i lost my [ __ ]

208
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,790
train i thought i'm gonna be real with

209
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,639
you

210
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,280
[Laughter]

211
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,079
not the first time

212
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,359
we were talking about um the uh names

213
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,680
being taken

214
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
oh boom so this is my point because that

215
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,478
was yeah

216
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,160
so um

217
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,519
we're having that this year we're we're

218
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
looking up different strains that we've

219
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,839
been making you know things that we've

220
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
made back in like

221
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,239
2014 and um now those names are taken

222
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,439
you know so there's really a race to

223
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,280
you know this seems like there's this

224
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,719
race for people to [ __ ] you know put

225
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,559
different strains together just so they

226
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,400
could claim a certain brand name on

227
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
their strain and you know i don't really

228
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,918
have a beef with that that's just it's

229
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
just a phenomenon of the market you

230
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,038
can't [ __ ] about it it's something you

231
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
can't control so all you could do is you

232
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,360
know um adjust how you're going to react

233
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,198
and adjust how you're going to approach

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,879
strain branding you know when when we

235
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,560
had the creme brulee um uh we were

236
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,720
pretty in you know for the longest time

237
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,959
we were in um mendocino county now we're

238
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,800
based out of lake tahoe um but

239
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,439
mendocino's you know the same thing with

240
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,680
tahoe's it's really insulated um and

241
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,360
this is before you know instagram was

242
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
was really huge you know facebook

243
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,960
definitely was a thing but instagram

244
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,198
kind of changed the the landscape and

245
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,038
how people really interface cannabis and

246
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,879
learn about different brands so we

247
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,000
called our we uh we've been working on a

248
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,039
strain since 2012 called creme brulee

249
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,360
and when we the year we dropped it

250
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,478
uh bay exclusives also had a creme

251
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
brulee

252
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,560
and um you know it was kind of difficult

253
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,759
for us but i felt you know the best way

254
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,680
to approach that was just to be

255
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,520
respectful you know i wasn't trying to

256
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
step on bay exclusives toes you know i

257
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,598
hit him up i was like hey man um you

258
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,278
know you know obviously great minds

259
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,200
think alike i just want i just want you

260
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,000
to know you know i won't try to step on

261
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,560
your toes with this you know so in you

262
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,200
know in other aspects it really is you

263
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,159
know who has the biggest reach and and

264
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,600
what genetic is quality enough to to to

265
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,159
have you know their version of creme

266
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,360
brulee or their version of rose you know

267
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,120
um you know

268
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,000
get a certain exposure where people

269
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,639
recognize your version as as the

270
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,320
definitive you know creme brulee say you

271
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,399
know we got lucky with the creme brulee

272
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,640
because bay excuses crumbly rails was

273
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,799
really [ __ ] good but we had um you

274
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,080
know really good traction with the clone

275
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,838
getting out and uh uh kevin drawdry was

276
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
was definitely doing some selections

277
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,920
with with ziggy and they found some

278
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,600
bangers and so that you know that really

279
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,240
you know helped it so

280
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,519
um when it comes to that that's a really

281
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,120
you know

282
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,039
one are we running out of strains and

283
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
two what happens if you have a strain

284
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,439
that something's already called

285
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,278
something it's just it's just really

286
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,080
difficult you know we've been working on

287
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,600
the sangria for a while um we've been

288
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
working on that for the past two years

289
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
two three years

290
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,600
uh last year i believe it was i think it

291
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,599
was either compound

292
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,519
i think it was either compound or i

293
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
could be wrong it's one of those really

294
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,919
[ __ ] fire breeders but someone else

295
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,720
had a sangria it was just like a release

296
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,479
um

297
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
and so that's kind of the tough decision

298
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,039
we have this year is like are we going

299
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
to drop to sangria you know we already

300
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,079
had considerable traction with it in

301
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
europe so we're just going to go ahead

302
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,120
and

303
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,800
and drop it you know so it's it's the

304
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
risk you play because you could you

305
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,319
could risk as a breeder you could risk

306
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,079
pissing off other breeders you know

307
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,879
which is never a really good idea you

308
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:11,838
know and um you know and causing a stir

309
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,559
cause you know people have an extreme

310
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,640
attachment to their work and definitely

311
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,958
certain names you know that name if it's

312
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,559
catchy enough uh it's going to take it

313
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,879
you know this really going to put legs

314
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,479
on the strain where the the brand and

315
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,159
the quality itself

316
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
is what's going to you know

317
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,679
establish what's going to create the

318
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,359
platform for longevity for any

319
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,199
particular cultivar

320
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,039
so um

321
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,720
yeah that's a

322
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,639
very it's kind of a difficult one you

323
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,040
know because i've noticed this year

324
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,399
we definitely having a hard time

325
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,120
uh like like we've

326
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,879
made a merlot we made a cherry merlot

327
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,120
and we made a merlot

328
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,759
back in

329
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,839
2014

330
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,600
and uh there's another really good

331
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,399
really [ __ ] talented breeder i think

332
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,639
his name is casey out of yerba buena

333
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,600
in uh in oregon

334
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,958
and or i think that's corazon i could be

335
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,959
wrong we might have to erase that i

336
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,639
might be getting people mixed up bro but

337
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,719
there's definitely um i found out

338
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,639
someone bred them alone i was like [ __ ]

339
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,680
it was really good it was really good so

340
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,039
it was like cool we'll just let them

341
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,199
have that you know what i mean like we

342
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,399
won't even try to you know fight for you

343
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,160
know fight for that we'll just you know

344
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,919
find a different name

345
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,600
um but yeah yeah yeah so okay it's hard

346
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,399
to find these days you have to get

347
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,600
really creative and more people are you

348
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,519
know now confectionary base strains are

349
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,278
are are pretty hot you know we get all

350
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,200
credit [ __ ] for being the first guy to

351
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,519
have a confectionary strain you know he

352
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,600
was definitely inspired me to have you

353
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,360
know to name my cookies cross creme

354
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
brulee you know before there was a lot

355
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
of you know back in 2013 before there

356
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
was a lot of this on the market

357
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,680
so

358
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,240
um

359
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,799
yeah what's interesting is i talk to a

360
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,959
lot of people and we often discuss how

361
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,799
you know you can draw a lot of strains

362
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,879
their roots back to chemdog and how

363
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,599
quintessentially you know it's it's

364
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,200
really involved in most everything but

365
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,519
how would you feel about the idea of in

366
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,040
say 10 years from now that same analogy

367
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,360
is being made with the cookie crew

368
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,120
because i can almost see it happening 4

369
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,879
you can see it happening you can see

370
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,879
the lines that um

371
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,159
see junkie jay beezy's working who's

372
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,519
killing it right now you know i don't

373
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,759
know these guys personally don't have a

374
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
vested interest in their companies i'm

375
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,879
i'm i love cannabis i'm a fan

376
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,719
you know when i'm doing my work i try to

377
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,399
not focus on what other people but as a

378
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,240
fan i like to follow other people and

379
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,839
see what they're doing because i'm a i'm

380
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,120
[ __ ] generally a big fan of cannabis

381
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,920
so you can see

382
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,879
jbz is killing it and a lot of his stock

383
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,799
is based on um on different og kush um

384
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,958
phenotypes and definitely the cookies

385
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,240
you know as cushman's as wedding cake

386
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,319
you know a lot of this these are these

387
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,240
are cookie derivatives so you know [ __ ]

388
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,320
did something you know pretty amazing

389
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
the cookies you know likes to breed true

390
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,760
it likes to mix with things and i think

391
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,559
we're going to see that in 10 years i

392
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,919
think

393
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,679
you know we're going to start seeing

394
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,958
maybe in 10 years a lot of these crosses

395
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,120
are going to come from cats like

396
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,399
compound or symbiotic

397
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,240
you know what i mean i guess it's

398
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,919
whatever is fire at the time but you

399
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,839
know something as definitive as cookies

400
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,559
hell yeah there's so many strains

401
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,000
crossed with but what [ __ ] did with the

402
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,159
cookies

403
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,759
forced people to really look further

404
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,919
into what lions are doing you know what

405
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,639
i mean i think he had he had

406
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,479
the cookie fam had a really good idea

407
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,919
had a really good feel for for what was

408
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,440
hot for the market at that time they had

409
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,838
a really good um

410
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,160
eye for selecting in my opinion uh

411
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,160
because when when i when i'm working

412
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,399
cookies crosses and i'm i'm in breeding

413
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,000
them and i'm out crossing them

414
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,559
i'm using

415
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,399
different parents um that that i'm

416
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,799
assuming that they used i get to see

417
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,120
kind of you know what goes into cookies

418
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,120
and and what's making you know all these

419
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,639
strains so [ __ ] f what's in cookies

420
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
that's making these strains so [ __ ]

421
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
fire you know

422
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,120
so um

423
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,479
i guess that brings us to the million

424
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,919
dollar question what do you think's in

425
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
cookies

426
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,719
uh

427
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,278
i'm not even touched that

428
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,278
what i do know um what i do know is that

429
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,639
there's definitely you know we've i see

430
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,240
a lot of hindu

431
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,519
a lot of hindu tendencies like if you

432
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,519
ever take

433
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,560
mendocino like laytonville in particular

434
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,000
spyroc area um you know kado peak area

435
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,958
is a really good

436
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,799
um example of how you know they've been

437
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,479
holding you know old hindu kush

438
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,919
varieties since you know the early to

439
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,079
late 70s

440
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,639
and so in these you know old hindu kush

441
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,319
varieties which tom hill later bred into

442
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,480
as the br deep chunk we still have

443
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,240
access to these seeds and so a lot of we

444
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,480
were seeing a lot of similarities a lot

445
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,959
of parallels between how the cookies

446
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,399
grows and behaves the frost profile the

447
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,638
noses and and and with and with the uh

448
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
uh the hindus so you know that could be

449
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,680
wrong you know what i mean i could you

450
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,919
could be wrong but it's just a general

451
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,838
it was just you know based on years of

452
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,679
observation and and having an

453
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
established pattern you know we're not

454
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,638
[ __ ] scientists but we definitely

455
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,198
know that observation is the cornerstone

456
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,720
of evolution so as breeders and and

457
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,879
intuitive breeders because we're all not

458
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,720
scientists we're not [ __ ] doctors we

459
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,639
basically use this observation so we

460
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,160
could see what's in a strain so when it

461
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,720
came to cookies

462
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,719
it really made me look so the cookie fam

463
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,278
has cookies and sherbet

464
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,399
and then there's the big debate about if

465
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,159
skittles

466
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,919
came from sherbert

467
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,799
and so i

468
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,000
i grew cookies next to skittles next to

469
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,479
cherry pie

470
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,278
next to sherbet i grew it next to royal

471
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,800
kush i grew it and i grew all next to an

472
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,198
old school urkel

473
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,120
and to me that urkel was

474
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,278
the most common denominator i found

475
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,000
between a lot of those strains i think a

476
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,799
lot of these really exciting flavors

477
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,039
that mandelbrot got out of out of his

478
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,198
royal cush lines that was was the

479
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,439
[ __ ] i thought it was the sour for

480
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,039
years until i took all these cultivars

481
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,759
and i grew up next to

482
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,679
the urkel and you could see

483
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,919
a striking similarity between all these

484
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,758
cultivars not so much in the cookies but

485
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,679
more in the in in definitely in the

486
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:04,959
skittles in in the sherbs um i saw a lot

487
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,638
of uh telltale signs um of erko a lot of

488
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,078
these really exciting flavors you know

489
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,839
um uh you know urkel urkel and og are

490
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,319
really the fathers of a lot of these

491
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,040
really exciting fruit flavors um that

492
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,360
have like these really strong grapey you

493
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,879
know almost vineyard kind of floral you

494
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,639
know bouquets so i wish i had my [ __ ]

495
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,159
reading notes with me

496
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,320
because it's really interesting where

497
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,759
you're getting at and so i try to look

498
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,440
at

499
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,959
what's making everything so hot in the

500
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
[ __ ] market right now what's the most

501
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,518
common denominator

502
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,039
you know certain you know populations of

503
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,959
strains when i say populations i'm

504
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,599
saying like populations of og

505
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,078
populations of of things that are

506
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,759
crossed either with gdp

507
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,838
or or urkel because you wouldn't have

508
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,199
gdp without the [ __ ] urkel so the

509
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,199
urkel is like one of the original

510
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,359
you know purple that was the original

511
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,919
purple strain that had this [ __ ]

512
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,240
incredible crazy flavor

513
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,639
and and so i've noticed that going back

514
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
to the urkel you know the urkels where

515
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,240
you wouldn't have cherry pie without the

516
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,759
urkel you know there were so many uh

517
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,400
similarities between cherry pie and

518
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,519
urkel that was that was unreal to me

519
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,360
same thing with the skittles the

520
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,798
skittles actually you know i don't think

521
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,399
it's directly

522
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,240
a descendant of urkel but you could

523
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,919
definitely see

524
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,759
i'm still trying to [ __ ] figure out

525
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,839
what's in skittles

526
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,240
but you grow it next to

527
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,839
an urkel you can't you can't help it but

528
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
to see the similarities

529
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,240
and so that's all we're trying to do

530
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,558
we're just trying to guess and see where

531
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,120
straight where flavors are coming from

532
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,319
but um you know some is definitive as

533
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,399
cookies

534
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,159
that's you know i think that's gonna be

535
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,080
something that you know like every like

536
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,640
now all these strains came from sour or

537
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,918
chem dog or og five to ten years they're

538
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
still going to be strands coming from

539
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,360
gelato

540
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,038
cookies and sherbet you know what i mean

541
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,319
it's they're good

542
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,879
yeah totally

543
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,119
and so i guess one of the questions i

544
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,320
wanted to ask quickly do you trust the

545
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:05,119
fire loss results on skittles

546
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,839
you know um

547
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,199
honestly i

548
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,480
i'm gonna be real since we're on the

549
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,038
podcast the philos results were

550
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,919
was what was what made

551
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,359
the finalist results was provided at the

552
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,038
time it provided the evidence where i

553
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,079
was like

554
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,079
obviously

555
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,759
you know the owners of this whoever

556
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,079
created this strain it's it's really

557
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,839
muddied and it's really foggy but what

558
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,918
philos did was

559
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,678
you can't argue with genetics right

560
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,400
that's a [ __ ] science

561
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,759
right but um also at the same time you

562
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,720
know the whole genome hasn't been

563
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,480
sequenced too and we know that and also

564
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,079
the thing with philos too it's it's at

565
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,279
the discretion of who who who who

566
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,558
you know

567
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,160
it's there's a lot of human error

568
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,759
involved where i work with a lot of

569
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,320
breeders i work with a lot of [ __ ]

570
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,599
nurseries and anybody a lot of people

571
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,918
are going to identify with this where

572
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,000
they get a [ __ ] tray of clones and

573
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,280
some clones are mislabeled or you get

574
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,038
plants from people and some plants from

575
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,558
this label so that's that could be a

576
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,879
possibility where something was

577
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,480
mislabeled and and that happened you

578
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,559
know what i mean and this is just based

579
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,960
on that one skittles test i haven't gone

580
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,359
back to the galaxy and and explored more

581
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,038
because as a geneticist it's hard for me

582
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,359
to reconcile

583
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:22,079
uh being it's it's hard for me to

584
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,319
reconcile the reality of a lot of people

585
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,439
submitting their their genetic data to

586
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,879
philos and all this data is siloed

587
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,200
and we're seeing this in genomics

588
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,960
companies like 23andme we're seeing this

589
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,679
with the new genomics blockchain company

590
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,679
called nebula where you know you have

591
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,759
you know these geneanomics companies

592
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,880
where data donors and in this case

593
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,720
breeders and growers donate their dna

594
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,080
you know and and that they'll sequence

595
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,160
it for a fee

596
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,319
and then at the same time that data for

597
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,558
a regular human genomics company that

598
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,038
that is going to be bought by a data

599
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,359
buyer that's that's why these business

600
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,160
models are so [ __ ]

601
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,319
successful is because data you know data

602
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,200
buyers that's a huge business

603
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,798
data acquisition for for for research

604
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,880
and especially when it comes to human

605
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,599
genomics is for you know personalized

606
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,600
medicine and so when we see where the

607
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,038
where the industry's going with cannabis

608
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,480
are we going to make personalized

609
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,158
strains for people's individual

610
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,759
cannabinoid systems

611
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,120
how you know what's the evolution of

612
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,119
genetics going to be so when it comes to

613
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,798
someone like philos you know i think

614
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,599
it's really cool i have a lot of respect

615
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,319
for

616
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,599
for what they did um but just to me as a

617
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,678
breeder i think there needs to be a

618
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,519
platform where um all the data is

619
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,000
definitely decentralized and it's still

620
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,400
owned outright by the data donors and

621
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
the data donors have a right to say you

622
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,280
know what you can and can't do with that

623
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,279
data

624
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,119
so you know that's you know definitely

625
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,879
how i feel about that

626
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,038
yeah so i think i went down a little

627
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,200
rabbit hole right there but

628
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,480
that's that's perfect i think i i think

629
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,519
what they're what they're they're they

630
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,960
were the first cannabis genomics company

631
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,679
you know so i've you know i have a lot

632
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,480
of you know respect for that but there

633
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,280
is

634
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,679
there is a huge possibility for all this

635
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,558
data to be abused

636
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,960
there is when you have siloed data you

637
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,158
uh the the data is in one particular

638
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,880
place i don't give a [ __ ] how much

639
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,720
security you have that's hackable

640
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,720
i mean this is why blockchain's huge

641
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,038
right now it's because you have things

642
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,880
on thousands of servers

643
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,200
and so you can't hack thousands of

644
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,720
servers but you could [ __ ] hack one

645
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,000
you know and i and

646
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,919
prior to me

647
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,279
you know you know doing cannabis

648
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,038
full-time you know i was kicked out of

649
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,279
the army for smoking weed but while i

650
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,798
was in the army i was i was intelligence

651
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,960
and so these are things that when it

652
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,440
comes to data you know information is

653
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,079
everything so i tell all breeders

654
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,159
protect your [ __ ] data this is nobody

655
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,319
knows how big the genetics market is

656
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,039
going to be nobody knows

657
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,759
how valuable that that is going to be

658
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,759
there's going to be huge pharmaceutical

659
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,558
cannabis companies that are that i can't

660
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,319
wait to buy all this data so they could

661
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,158
you know genetically modify strains or

662
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,480
they could there they could you know do

663
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,320
breeding marker assisted breeding to to

664
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,159
find certain strains and and to go and

665
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,839
patent those flavor profiles and that's

666
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,559
just one scenario

667
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,158
you know so it's to me when it comes to

668
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,558
the breeders work and their in their

669
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,919
data you got to protect that but you

670
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,759
know we definitely got down a rabbit

671
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,480
hole because you know you're the rootier

672
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,400
question was you know uh phyllo

673
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,759
sequencing you know the skittles and

674
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,038
philos work i you know i think that work

675
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,119
was great but at the same time there

676
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,640
just needs to be a platform where um all

677
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,759
the breeders could still control their

678
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,440
data and and who interfaces it

679
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,919
yeah i love it man let's keep going down

680
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,440
this rabbit hole so the next question is

681
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,200
um you know you just touched on like big

682
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,440
companies and like the legal side and

683
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,120
the need for security i totally agree

684
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,798
we we see people trademarking things

685
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,119
within the industry but we don't see

686
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,720
cease and desist being commonplace how

687
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,959
long do you think it is until that does

688
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,200
start to occur and we see what you kind

689
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,880
of predicted

690
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
i guess it's going to really depend on

691
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,039
you know my lawyer always tells me who's

692
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,720
who else who has the most money for

693
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,558
litigation

694
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
you know so whoever has you know

695
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,319
whatever company hones whatever said

696
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,319
trademark you know if they have a big

697
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,678
enough war chest it won't be a problem

698
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,480
you know sending cease and desist

699
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,080
letters and backing that up you know um

700
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,679
legally backing that up and financially

701
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,240
backing that up you know so i i

702
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,280
definitely see this as

703
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,038
um

704
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,720
it's difficult because it's a lot of

705
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,400
people are worried about exactly what

706
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,200
you're what you're talking about right

707
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
now

708
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,360
you know um what if someone goes out and

709
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,038
trademarks our our you know our strain

710
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,678
names or our brand

711
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,359
um and and sends us the cease and desist

712
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
so you know i think that when you're you

713
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,278
know mostly cease and desist unless

714
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,479
someone's stealing your brand you know

715
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,798
try a little harder to come up with

716
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,319
something more unique you know what i

717
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,278
mean so

718
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,519
um

719
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,440
you know like we we named the testarossa

720
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,038
you know when ferrari sends me a cease

721
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,278
and desist

722
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,278
it'll be it'll be both a horrible and a

723
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,119
great day

724
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,880
because we've reached that that level of

725
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,918
exposure where ferrari you know so i

726
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080
think it's a good thing you know like

727
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,320
look at gorilla glue you know they got

728
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,558
beat up by you know by that company you

729
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,720
know they could have called it gg4 but

730
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,038
at the same time man josie wales and the

731
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,038
gorilla glue crew you're [ __ ]

732
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,200
your your your name in his in pot

733
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,640
history is etched in stone now you know

734
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,880
so you could i think you know there's

735
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,038
always you could in those instances you

736
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,120
could kind of turn [ __ ] in the sugar you

737
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,519
know and i think if you know these

738
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,199
trademark things are really difficult

739
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,480
you know trademarking different strain

740
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,038
names how do you you know how do you

741
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,720
you know reinforce that is it first to

742
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,000
file or the first to invent you know

743
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,679
what if someone invents something and

744
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,519
someone goes out and trademarks with it

745
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,278
you know there's this is a really this

746
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,839
is a

747
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,359
trying to navigate cannabis right now in

748
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,359
regulation to me is like playing

749
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,558
three-dimensional chess in a [ __ ]

750
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,000
dark room

751
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:53,519
you're constantly figuring you're

752
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,359
feeling your way things out you you

753
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,960
learn by making mistakes

754
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,199
you know what i mean and and you're

755
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,120
really just feeling in in in

756
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,038
there's so many dimensions and facets to

757
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,599
it that you're constantly having to

758
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,759
adjust fire and adapt to a new set of

759
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,079
circumstances so right now you used to

760
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,000
be able to call your strains whatever

761
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,678
and now if you're not careful

762
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
cert big companies will send you a cease

763
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,159
and desist like matt rise was one of the

764
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,759
first people to get a cease and desist

765
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,440
he had the uh

766
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,798
shatter brothers and the shadow brothers

767
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,960
and this was uh coming out of hopland uh

768
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:27,839
back in like you know

769
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,440
eleven two 2011

770
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,678
twelve matt ryze was one of the first

771
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,679
guys to popularize you know ice wax

772
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,519
extraction he was one of the he was one

773
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,360
of those guys and he also had a chatter

774
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,759
company and the shadow company had this

775
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,038
depiction of [ __ ] mario and luigi

776
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,440
making shatter

777
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,119
it and nintendo sent those guys a cease

778
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,640
and desist you know so

779
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,239
you know it's definitely you know could

780
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,759
be a bad thing but

781
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,839
damn matt you know

782
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,240
your exposure was to the point where you

783
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,319
got the nintendo's attention

784
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,159
so i don't know this could be turned

785
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,759
into a game by some breeders

786
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,520
but i think it's a slippery slope i

787
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,879
think it's a dangerous one

788
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,960
yeah definitely

789
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,559
well we hear talks about big players

790
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,159
getting involved in the industry even

791
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,399
like you know kind of well-known big

792
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,559
players i cringe to say that that dan

793
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,480
bilzerian guy has been in the news for a

794
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,558
minute what do you think about this type

795
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,400
of move do you think it's just like a

796
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,399
fad thing and do you think overall it's

797
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,000
a good or a bad thing to have rich

798
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,440
people getting involved in the industry

799
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,038
because i've kind of heard arguments on

800
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,558
both sides i guess

801
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:27,278
i mean here's how i feel about it you

802
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,519
know

803
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:29,519
um

804
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,798
you know with people like damn dan

805
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,720
bazillion

806
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,319
the guys you could tell by that guy's

807
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,000
[ __ ] ig feed

808
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,079
he's definitely a weak guy you know what

809
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
i mean if you're into guns

810
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,439
partying that kind of lifestyle you're

811
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,440
definitely smoking some [ __ ] weed

812
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,558
right so it's like i know a lot of these

813
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,240
guys

814
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,079
that come from that same that similar

815
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,440
worlds dan's world

816
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,038
and they're [ __ ] weed people you know

817
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,519
what i mean but that doesn't necessarily

818
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,440
mean that you understand the industry

819
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,278
you know this is kind of like

820
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,038
i'm not using dana's example he's a

821
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,240
different example i know the [ __ ] guy

822
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,000
um i just know him through his

823
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,000
reputation and he's getting you know

824
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,240
busy investing but a lot of these

825
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,558
corporate guys that are coming into the

826
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,759
industry and they think that it's going

827
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,918
to work out for them just because

828
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,759
they're [ __ ] rich it reminds me a lot

829
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
of when paris hilton tried becoming an

830
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,839
edm dj she got laughed off stage laughed

831
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,759
out of the [ __ ] industry there's like

832
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,759
oh that's cute

833
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,919
your money's going to be a panacea for a

834
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,759
lack of talent get the [ __ ] out of here

835
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,840

836
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,000
how we feel about this is you know you

837
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,678
have all these corporate cannabis guys

838

839
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,038
and they don't know the game

840
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,079
people forget this shit's like [ __ ]

841
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,440

842
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,960
you feel me it you know rappers

843
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,360
rappers are like the growers in our

844
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,798
industry you know breeders are like the

845
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,798

847
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,000

848
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,759
like music

849
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,278

850
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,679
street level

851
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,679

859
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,599
connection you know with that street

860
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,600
aspect you know people forget it's like

861
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,038
oh yeah we're growing medicine but

862
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,798
can we all [ __ ] acknowledge for a

863
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,720
minute that california was the largest

864
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,158
producer of cannabis the entire country

865
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,079
growing the country's [ __ ] weed and

866
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,320
it all wasn't medicine guys

867
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,398
you know and so all that pushing

868
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,480
the trends of what's pushed on the

869
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,239
street and what's in demand happens on

870
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,079
the [ __ ] street level and it has to

871
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,159
be co-signed on the street you can't be

872
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,759
a famous rapper without being co-signed

873
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,799
by someone from the hood or being

874
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:45,359
co-signed by some um og in the industry

875
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,119
like p diddy or jay prince you know from

876
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,558
rap a lot records who you know who

877
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,719
helped create

878
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,319
shape and shift [ __ ] hip-hop as it is

879
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,480
you know right right now so it's like

880
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,000
with corporate guys coming in i think

881
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,278
it's you know i think that there's

882
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,880
something to learn from them when they

883
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,679
have these really really efficient

884
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,440
business process business processes um

885
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,519
and really efficient ways for

886
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
understanding markets in ways we guys

887
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,960
can't um you know understand the market

888
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
but just because you have those talent

889
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,798
doesn't mean that you could connect

890
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
with [ __ ] smokers that's why we say

891
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,240
it's like music you know an artist's

892
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,080
entire [ __ ] job

893
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,000
is to connect with people around the

894
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,519
world is is to put something take

895
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,880
something from nothing put his heart

896
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,759
into the studio and connect with the

897
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,080
world growers do the same exact thing

898
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,759
you know breeder lays the track he he

899
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,278
puts the strain into the grower's hand

900
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,440
and the and the grower is going to

901
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,278
express that strain in a different way

902
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,759
than any other grower

903
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,278
right and and so when that weed leaves

904
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,359
when that quality leaves that usually

905
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,398
goes to the street level or the quality

906
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,839
is going to be acknowledged at the

907
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,319
street level we don't see any corporate

908
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,240

909
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,319

987
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,960
you can't shape you can't create shape

988
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,480
and shift the history of cannabis

989
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,759
through putting boof on the [ __ ]

990
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,519
market

991
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,519
you create shape and shift the history

992
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,399
of cannabis by changing the flavor

993
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,240
profiles again everybody to agree that's

994
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,518
[ __ ] hot

995
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,519
you know what i mean

996
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,319
yeah it's like they don't seem to

997
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,159
understand that like trends and things

998
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,558
are started by creative people and then

999
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,799
people like them more so take over it

1000
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,639
but yeah you touched on this perfect

1001
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,558
idea right with with big al i had a

1002
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,278
question perfectly lined up for that and

1003
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,200
so

1004
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,679
we've kind of seen in response to that

1005
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,440
hundred dollar eighths of mac that cap's

1006
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,600
you know capulet hasn't been too happy

1007
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,000
and his argument was that he doesn't

1008
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,000
want his brand associated with this type

1009
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,278
of what he would call price gouging what

1010
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,880
do you what are your thoughts on that

1011
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:55,278
you know do you think a breeder gets to

1012
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,480
have a say that extends that far out so

1013
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:57,679
to speak

1014
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,440
you know let me start from this level

1015
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,320
you know cap's probably one of the most

1016
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,320
talented guys in the industry right now

1017
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,158
he's creating [ __ ] nobody's [ __ ]

1018
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,079
creating you know only guys coming close

1019
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,360
to cap right now is [ __ ] in-house and

1020
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,558
c junkie

1021
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,759
jbz

1022
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:12,639
so with like

1023
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,558
you know

1024
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,640
being a breeder i understand i

1025
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,480
understand why he's upset

1026
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,880
i understand why he wouldn't want that

1027
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,640
because he's the creator that's his baby

1028
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,640
you know what i'm saying

1029
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,720
but on the flip side i used to have

1030
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,159
those those reactions too and then i i

1031
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,679
realized that when you when you let

1032
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,519
something out on the market it's it's

1033
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,360
going to take its own life

1034
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,919
um it could either be

1035
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,759
a a success

1036
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,080
or it could be a failure but as a

1037
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,480
breeder you have to accept either one of

1038
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,359
those dichotomies

1039
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,839
it's up you have to because

1040
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,199
control is a [ __ ] illusion and that's

1041
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,798
what breeding taught me is that control

1042
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,159
is illusion you can't control [ __ ]

1043
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,798
especially when you send stuff down

1044
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,320
range you send things down the pipeline

1045
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,079
seeds clones

1046
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,359
they're going to take a life of their

1047
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,158
own you know

1048
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,079
so

1049
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,919
you know with cap being upset yeah i

1050
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,038
just had a hard time understanding why

1051
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,679
he would

1052
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,079
why he why he wasn't so receptive

1053
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,398
um to that kind of exposure but at the

1054
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,639
same time he's really one of those true

1055
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,559
believers like one of those really

1056
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,960
down-to-earth dudes that that's not in

1057
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:22,078
the flash and [ __ ] and he's really about

1058
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,679
the craft so like i i genuinely see

1059
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,679
where he's coming from

1060
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,519
and i respect this point and but i also

1061
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,918
have another side of me where

1062
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:32,000
um i've always dreamed

1063
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,559
of there being a luxury cannabis

1064
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,079
component for people to participate in

1065
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,799
you know that was why we started

1066
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,200
aficionado that way back in 2012

1067
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,200
is i was like [ __ ] if mendocino and

1068
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,480
humble

1069
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,638
can

1070
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,679
can establish appellations a form of

1071
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,440
prestige right like that you see in wine

1072
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,200
then that would stabilize the long-term

1073
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,519
price of of cannabis

1074
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,358
and so on that same note like like if

1075
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,960
you use bordeaux as a model where they

1076
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,078
where they created the bordeaux apple

1077
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,280
appellation in the mid-1800s and um they

1078
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,119
got a premium on their wine it was then

1079
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,240
up to the participating brands in

1080
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,320
bordeaux

1081
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,639
to make bordeaux bordeaux to make it

1082
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,880
what it is today so that was the goal

1083
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:17,838
was to make aficionado

1084
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,880
this this this this apparatus that

1085
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,960
allowed us to to participate in high-end

1086
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,000
cannabis when the day came you know what

1087
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,358
i'm saying

1088
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,880
and so it's like

1089
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,119
big owl was the first to do it he's the

1090
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,400
first to sell 100.8

1091
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,838
and everything isn't binary that's my

1092
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
that's my thing it's like i'm not mad at

1093
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:36,799
anyone per se but they say [ __ ]

1094
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,640
binary

1095
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,480
just because it's 100 eight doesn't mean

1096
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,679
all samples of max are gonna be go for a

1097
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,320
hundred dollars

1098
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,919
you know but but we can't ignore that

1099
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,000
price demographic you know people who

1100
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,599
are students economics the luxury

1101
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,039
industry is the only industry that

1102
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,039
[ __ ] continues to grow despite

1103
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,719
recessions

1104
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,920
and so it's like you know if you're a

1105
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,439
small guy

1106
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,440
you don't have a huge [ __ ] corporate

1107
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,519
war chest but what you do is you have

1108
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,200
[ __ ] talent and you have quality

1109
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,559
man where are these christian la bhutans

1110
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,159
going to come from in our industry

1111
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,199
where's the john paul gold ta's where's

1112
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,719
the real louis vuittons you know this is

1113
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,598
this is what's [ __ ] possible right

1114
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,199
now so that's why i'm telling people

1115
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,920
like stop you know don't don't

1116
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,759
necessarily you know resist this new

1117
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,280
[ __ ] phenomena this is a great thing

1118
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,040
for small people because small people

1119
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,280
are the only people who have the

1120
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,239
prestige the heritage and the roots to

1121
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,079
be considered a luxury brand because if

1122
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,279
money and nice branding considered you a

1123
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,800
luxury brand

1124
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,720
then candescent be a [ __ ] luxury

1125
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,880
event but they're not

1126
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,319
there this is not so it's like you know

1127
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,079
when you have you know what are the

1128
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,519
prerequisites for luxury brands all

1129
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,039
right well it's a unique know-how in a

1130
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:45,358
particular area of expertise uh

1131
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,759
your work has to have an incredible

1132
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:50,000
attention to detail you have to use

1133
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,400
different ingredients and and and

1134
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,320
techniques and then other people use

1135
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,480
it's kind of almost like food too you

1136
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,119
know what separates a thousand dollars

1137
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,000
you know 300 steak from a 30 steak you

1138
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,880
know ingredients technique and timing

1139
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,559
and so and also the prestige of the chef

1140
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,640
preparing it

1141
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,119
and so you need all these things to to

1142
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,118
to justify yourself as as being raw

1143
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,119
enough to command those [ __ ] prices

1144
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,960
you know who knows the longevity of the

1145
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,039
hundred dollar eighth but it's a [ __ ]

1146
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,679
phenomenon right now and it's amazing

1147
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,599
that someone from our community was able

1148
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,279
to establish that was able to break that

1149
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,720
boundary someone from our neighborhood

1150
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,119
broke that boundary and not corporate

1151
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,000
cannabis like why can't we just realize

1152
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,358
that

1153
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,199
because i bet you if it was some

1154
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,000
corporate cannabis guys everybody would

1155
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,838
be up in arms this would be [ __ ] up oh

1156
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,920
corporate cannabis we knew this would

1157
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,838
happen blah blah but then the pendulum

1158
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
swings the other way the small guy with

1159
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,920
40 [ __ ] lights selling hundred dollar

1160
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,239
eights to migos

1161
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,320
they opened that strain up to a wider

1162
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,719
more diverse audience just because of

1163
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,640
price point alone the laws of economics

1164
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,719
did take that too there's an entire

1165
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,279
demographic a clientele and customer

1166
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,679
that only discerns value based on the

1167
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,519
perceived price

1168
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,559
if they don't know any better then how

1169
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,320
do they know

1170
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,838
well well price is one indicator where

1171
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,760
it's like okay this obviously has some

1172
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,119
extra level prestige but it better

1173
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,720
[ __ ] it it it better be good

1174
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,079
which is the whole thing and there's

1175
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,000
arguments

1176
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,440
whether you know was it worth a hundred

1177
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,920
dollars an eighth

1178
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,358
well [ __ ] millionaires like migos

1179
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,358
definitely [ __ ] felt that it was

1180
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,358
worth a hundred dollars an eighth and so

1181
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,039
that's the trend that needs to happen

1182
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,358
is that when you have these different

1183
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,440
brands we're able to interface and open

1184
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,119
new opportunities for small guys that

1185
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,358
got the fire the big guys don't got the

1186
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,720
fire it's the small guys

1187
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,559
so this is a great this is a great time

1188
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,719
for small people man it was like i was

1189
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,239
happy as [ __ ] man i called frenchy this

1190
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,078
is great

1191
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,799
al's getting roasted but it's good

1192
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,440
because he he's killing it every every

1193
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,039
if you're angry

1194
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,838
anger can't exist without fear you know

1195
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,440
what i'm saying so it's like a

1196
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:56,719
fear-based emotion if you angry it's

1197
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,320
like what are you scared of is what i

1198
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,399
want to ask a lot of these people not

1199
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,280
necessarily cat i'm not talking to cap

1200
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,000
in this

1201
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,839
um particular context because i i hunt

1202
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,440
hunterly wholeheartedly see where crap's

1203
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:08,799
coming from because he's a creator but

1204
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,720
with other people like other peoples

1205
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,400
that are really chiming on

1206
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,639
on on the subject it's like man why

1207
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,160
can't you just be happy for for big al i

1208
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:17,118
mean that yeah that that's capitulator's

1209
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,480
beef but

1210
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,240
something was done in the industry

1211
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,079
that's going to help the small guy

1212
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:23,679
more than anything else you know this is

1213
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,839
a huge it's going to be a huge economic

1214
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,279
force for for for guys that are at the

1215
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,119
top of their game that got the [ __ ]

1216
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,400
together and know how to communicate and

1217
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,000
sell their strains you know right you

1218
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,519
know what i mean and right now a big guy

1219
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,960
was able to do that

1220
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,239
cap's going to be able to do that too he

1221
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,240
doesn't want to count he was going to

1222
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,598
gouge people you know so it's like a lot

1223
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,639
of these growers are going to come out

1224
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,880
you're going to see crazy there's going

1225
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:45,199
to be a price war but there needs to

1226
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,640
also be a spectrum of brands

1227
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,480
it just can't be

1228
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,960
affordable cannabis it just can't be

1229
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,400
affordable wine and affordable alcohol

1230
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,920
you know people gave me [ __ ] about my

1231
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,320
prices for years i'm just like deal with

1232
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,240
it i'm sorry like i only make certain

1233
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,440
you know so many strains per year you

1234
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,118
know i [ __ ] sift through a lot of

1235
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,480
strains and so this is like

1236
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,800
you know only recently a couple hundred

1237
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,400
boxes of each straight anyway so

1238
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,079
yeah you know so but it's like it's

1239
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,960
really in the eye beholder

1240
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,640
yeah i i agree and i've spoken to a lot

1241
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,480
of people who have these opinions and

1242
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,118
what i find to be the most interesting

1243
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,000
part of it all is that these same people

1244
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,000
aspire to have you know luxury cars it's

1245
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,719
like they're okay with luxury something

1246
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,159
else but not in our industry

1247
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,318
exactly

1248
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,598
exactly and it's like you know

1249
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:31,358
essentially we're

1250
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,359
you know there are your people who like

1251
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,719
to ball out our industry but you know

1252
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,318
the cool thing about the industry which

1253
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:38,480
is you know one of the positives that we

1254
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,559
do have a lot of humble people

1255
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,559
a lot of humble people that that that

1256
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,639
don't need the flash

1257
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,799
that don't need to you know when swerve

1258
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,318
was blowing up back in the day posting

1259
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,760
pictures of his jaguar [ __ ]

1260
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,599
getting hated on

1261
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,440
that's not necessarily our culture you

1262
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,519
know saying it's like if if you're

1263
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,880
flossing and you're in the weed game and

1264
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,480
you were putting that on instagram you

1265
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,720
were wrong because you're basically dry

1266
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,920
snitching on yourself you know

1267
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,959
like

1268
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,800
it's so you know but but i like the fact

1269
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,519
that the community has this sense of

1270
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,400
humbleness to him because humbleness is

1271
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:15,280
in and and lack of ego is what's needed

1272
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,519
to to create true craft um but i think

1273
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,839
once you create that craft

1274
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,400
there needs to be a mechanism to be able

1275
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:24,880
to open that craft to

1276
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,480
what's the highest potential this you

1277
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,760
know our market has as boutique

1278
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,519
craftsman

1279
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,960
we can't do we can't get a [ __ ] price

1280
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,159
war with corporate cannabis that's for

1281
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,519
damn sure

1282
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,559
but you know what there's definitely

1283
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:39,199
this huge underserved demographic

1284
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,318
of of of uh you know of

1285
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,239
you know upscale oriented customers that

1286
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,239
want to indulge in this level of weed

1287
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,078
and it [ __ ] exists

1288
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,479
you know cats like big owl cats like

1289
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,720
[ __ ] you know capulator and [ __ ]

1290
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,159
compound these guys are growing the fire

1291
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,919
like crazy fire you know and so

1292
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:59,199
but i think that

1293
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,519
we are they also

1294
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:04,318
everybody collectively deserves more i

1295
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,318
think you spent time in the game

1296
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,559
and and you really cut your teeth and

1297
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,880
you sacrificed everything i think that

1298
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,719
it's a great [ __ ] moment when when

1299
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,119
the market could acknowledge that you

1300
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,598
know your your stuff is worth you know

1301
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,800
you know x amount you know so i think

1302
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,039
you could love her to hate it you know

1303
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,560
you could sit in front of a rolex shop

1304
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,079
you know with the timex on your wrist

1305
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,838
and [ __ ] [ __ ] about life all day

1306
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,359
saying oh i might watch tell sign better

1307
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,880
and you guys are ripping people off but

1308
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,719
that's just like that's just like you

1309
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,160
guys got to shift your focus your

1310
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,399
awareness from that particular

1311
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,838
perspective and and broaden your

1312
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,358
horizons it's like oh what are the

1313
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:38,880
opportunities in this because if big al

1314
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:39,838
could do it how many other people could

1315
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,960
do it

1316
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:42,400
and so like

1317
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,199
we don't know what the longevity of

1318
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,000
these price points are like first off

1319
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,598
but but we do know that the luxury you

1320
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,920
know luxury clientele demographic

1321
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,838
continues to grow worldwide

1322
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,519
you know that that's a fact

1323
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,639
yeah so you know we definitely know that

1324
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,480
and cannabis is quickly becoming uh

1325
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,639
international canada has already taken

1326
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,079
international u.s is we're really behind

1327
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,000
right now on that you know because we

1328
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,079
can have a serious edge but when it does

1329
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,639
go international man when it does go

1330
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,720
international we have to be cognizant of

1331
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,159
this entire spectrum of customer who do

1332
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,439
you want to sell to

1333
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,719
you know that's cool if you want to be

1334
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,159
jack daniels that's cool if you want to

1335
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,399
be ever clear you want to be budweiser

1336
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,799
we need these people we need those price

1337
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,119
points in the ecosystem to differentiate

1338
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,800
ourselves you know [ __ ] chateau

1339
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,680
montrachet at thirty thousand dollars a

1340
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,880
bottle needs box wine to create that

1341
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,399
[ __ ] huge chasm of separation

1342
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,559
that reminds people this is why you're

1343
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,160
paying x amount for this bottle of wine

1344
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,519
it's like i want to see that in cannabis

1345
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,199
it's always been my dream to do that you

1346
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,559
know we've tried doing that you know

1347
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,759
we've been doing that with you know we

1348
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:45,759
got really lucky we've been doing that

1349
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,599
with seeds you know for the last seven

1350
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,960
years but you know when it came to

1351
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,720
flowers

1352
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,000
anybody could smoke a flower only a few

1353
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:53,598
people could grow seeds you know you

1354
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,199
have to really know you know kind of

1355
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,559
what aficionado is working with or knows

1356
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,159
from back in the day to kind of really

1357
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,159
understand our value you know we don't

1358
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,759
think that you know we're big players in

1359
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,440
the genetics game we're just really

1360
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,680
really passionate about what we do

1361
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,039
but only so many people could grow seeds

1362
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,358
but anybody

1363
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,880
anybody could smoke a flower anybody can

1364
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,318
smoke hash that's what frenchie's power

1365
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,559
is [ __ ] smokes out thousands of

1366
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,159
people every month so everybody knows

1367
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,719
the frenchie is right so the same thing

1368
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,719
is with with with fire ass growers

1369
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,399
anybody could experience that and so

1370
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:23,118
it's like if anybody could experience

1371
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,079
that

1372
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,720
what place in the market do you choose

1373
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,720
or wish to participate in

1374
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,239
you know why limit yourself if you're

1375
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,519
worth that

1376
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:37,679
you know really like is is being aware

1377
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,759
better than being humble you know or is

1378
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,039
being humble better than being aware you

1379
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,119
know which

1380
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,440
which of these paths are we gonna choose

1381
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,240
as as breeders growers and marketers we

1382
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,838
can't

1383
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:49,118
we have awesome to see like just because

1384
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:50,799
you create a craft it's up to you to

1385
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,680
[ __ ] now communicate this and market

1386
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,519
it to the world it's value

1387
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,279
you know so it's like it's it's all

1388
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,358
everybody has choices

1389
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,960
and big al made a choice and it was a

1390
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,799
great choice and i just think it was

1391
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,720
really it was i thought it was just

1392
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,480
really unfortunate that

1393
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,519
you know the tension between you know

1394
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,199
big al

1395
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,759
and and cap is there you know because

1396
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,598
you know the two guys are are genuinely

1397
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,680
good people you know i never met cat but

1398
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,119
my partner leo you know knows him and he

1399
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,480
says you know great everybody i know

1400
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,920
that those caps has great things about

1401
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,440
him this is nice guys same thing with

1402
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,838
big owl he's like the most humble chill

1403
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,960
[ __ ] a dude he just loves weed and so

1404
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,920
it's like

1405
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,920
i think you know

1406
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,119
it it's unfortunate but there's also

1407
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,160
a really cool potential for for people

1408
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,079
to come back

1409
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,920
you know to come back full circle and

1410
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,160
you know maybe collaborate you know

1411
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,838
someday down the future you know because

1412
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,519
that's powerful what happened you know

1413
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:46,239
whether you like like that i would have

1414
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,559
sent a limo full of [ __ ] women to big

1415
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,799
al's house if he did that with my strain

1416
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,719
that's just me personally

1417
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,160
just to start the thank you process you

1418
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,559
know what i mean

1419
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,639
because we need that edge small time

1420
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,400
guys boutique cultivators

1421
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,920
need a distinct edge over corporate

1422
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,800
cannabis and this is what's happening

1423
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,079
right now

1424
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,400
you know like these guys are breaking

1425
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,160
down [ __ ] doors so other boutique

1426
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,480
cultivators can participate in these

1427
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,480
markets interface these higher levels of

1428
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,280
society because a lot of people [ __ ]

1429
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,119
forget man even though a lot of trends

1430
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,200
happen at the street level

1431
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,200
trends also

1432
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,118
par happen parallel at these really

1433
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,639
high-end levels too

1434
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,240
you know there's also there's also very

1435
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:28,400
rich trend centers too so we can't

1436
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:31,118
ignore you know if you're really in the

1437
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,800
weed and you and your job is to get your

1438
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,880
strain and you really want your strain

1439
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,440
to connect with people not through hyper

1440
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,960
[ __ ] but literally to be shared and

1441
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,400
connect with people because your work is

1442
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,720
good

1443
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,599
that's something magical man

1444
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,879
yeah

1445
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,200
totally

1446
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,720
so i think we might jump out of this

1447
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:49,919
rabbit hole for a moment and go down a

1448
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,799
different one

1449
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,480
um

1450
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,240
i just wanted to

1451
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,440
just wanted to loop back on to a point

1452
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,679
you made almost at the start of the

1453
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,280
interview you mentioned the creme brulee

1454
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:00,480
you had a bit of luck in that the clone

1455
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,400
got out there and it brought up this

1456
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,519
really interesting point of

1457
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,880
what is it like to to have a clone of

1458
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:08,480
yours that's like a really nice one

1459
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,079
that's been found selected and it gets

1460
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,000
out there is there a good or a bad thing

1461
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,760
because on the one hand it's like you

1462
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,358
know obviously there's good sides to it

1463
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,960
but at the other hand it's like well if

1464
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:18,078
people can get access to the clone

1465
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,318
they're probably not going to buy the

1466
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,000
seeds so how do you feel about it is it

1467
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:24,558
good or is it bad no

1468
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,800
like that's that's that's a that's

1469
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,599
whoever's whoever's logic that was this

1470
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,359
is wrong like right i mean like look at

1471
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,640
all the cookie cross seeds

1472
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:34,558
you know if cookie clone was on the

1473
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,159
market you know you wouldn't have you

1474
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,559
wouldn't have that the success of those

1475
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:40,558
crosses i think it's i think it's it's

1476
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,559
hugely i used to hoard

1477
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,760
so this is me talking from experience

1478
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,839
and and and somewhat regret that some of

1479
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,920
my best work i didn't put into the

1480
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,000
market you know you know um and that was

1481
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,599
kind of one of the things i learned

1482
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,280
working with kevin geodri back in the

1483
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,359
day you know who had one of the biggest

1484
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,400
nurseries at the time at home bolt

1485
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,480
and um

1486
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,400
you know in order for your [ __ ] to be on

1487
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,719
the market you literally

1488
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,318
like in order to be hot in the market

1489
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:07,679
you have to have thousands of growers

1490
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:10,000
growing this [ __ ]

1491
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,440
and you have to have thousands of pounds

1492
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,280
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands

1493
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,039
pounds a year straight

1494
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,200
touching people's hands across the

1495
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,558
country across the world

1496
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,558
you know so that doesn't happen unless

1497
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,160
you let the clone out you know so

1498
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,280
whatever you lose ownership you know

1499
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:24,558
there's this there's this false

1500
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,839
assumption people are going to argue

1501
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,920
with me this there's a false assumption

1502
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,199
that oh if i'm like the only one with

1503
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,200
this cut

1504
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,078
i'm going to hoard it and i'm going to

1505
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,639
it

1506
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,240
it you you limit its growth if you don't

1507
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:37,838
let it out because yeah you can show the

1508
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,519
world that you're the best at growing

1509
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,960
you know any particular you know this

1510
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,079
particular strain

1511
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,280
but

1512
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,839
growers and breeders we're all

1513
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,079
competitive people like by nature like

1514
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,358
that's why we compete with ourselves to

1515
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,599
get better than ourselves why people get

1516
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,318
better but we love showing our [ __ ] to

1517
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,920
each other we love that and so

1518
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,079
people love to say oh that was your

1519
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,519
cookies look at my cookies you know and

1520
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,440
that's part of that's part of the

1521
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:04,079
culture too what helps a strain get out

1522
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,440
there is when it's a joy to grow and

1523
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,079
it's also

1524
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,480
it's also it doubles as

1525
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,640
it doubles as you know um

1526
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,880
an opportunity for you to be able to to

1527
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:17,440
express you know what your best possible

1528
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,720
effort is you know so i think if you

1529
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,480
have a fire strain you gotta let you

1530
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:22,159
gotta let it out the market's gotta test

1531
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,240
it you know because really the market

1532
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,399
you could say it's fire all day long but

1533
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,759
if people ain't cloning it and pound you

1534
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,119
know pounds aren't flowing and the clubs

1535
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,480
because people could clone it you could

1536
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,559
have a million clones out there but if

1537
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,599
the clubs or the or the streets hate

1538
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,800
buying that weed again they'll buy it

1539
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,480
you know i mean i remember when barry

1540
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,880
white came out it's the frostiest strain

1541
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,119
that hit mendocino in a long time and at

1542
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,519
one year everybody grew it and everybody

1543
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,358
bought it but one time you know so it's

1544
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,759
like you get repeat buyers you know it's

1545
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,519
like people say oh cookies is hype

1546
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,520
it's not [ __ ] hype man millions of

1547
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,358
people are still buying it they come

1548
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,480
back and they buy it again

1549
00:49:55,358 --> 00:50:00,558
that's not hype that's that's real

1550
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,599
yeah i totally agree so you know to have

1551
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,880
that you got to put your strain out

1552
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,800
there you got to put the clone out there

1553
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,800
which you know i've i've felt i've

1554
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,559
fallen i fell short on

1555
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,359
you know the past you know five five

1556
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,400
years

1557
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:14,558
you know but i learned from you know i

1558
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,318
had to learn from my mistakes to go okay

1559
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,160
really the right way is to let it out

1560
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,000
you know will you lose ownership of it

1561
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:21,358
cool but if you really want to test your

1562
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,719
work against the market and see how hot

1563
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:24,239
you are as a breeder you got to put that

1564
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,719
[ __ ] out there

1565
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,519
yeah good plan so

1566
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,679
take us back when did aficionados start

1567
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,318
in your mind

1568
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:37,279
like uh 2011

1569
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:39,519
and what was the first project

1570
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,680
you know it kind of grew out of um you

1571
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,358
know i always had my i was you know i

1572
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,679
started growing when i was in germany

1573
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,440
and um i went to amsterdam a lot smoked

1574
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,199
a lot of weed smoked a lot of hash

1575
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,318
always brought seeds back um i just

1576
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,399
thought it was cool that you know i

1577
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,599
could collect these seeds then i started

1578
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,200
hanging out with some german college

1579
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,318
students that were growing organic

1580
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,598
indoor

1581
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:59,039
and um

1582
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,680
they were breeding like they were

1583
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,838
crossing their super silver haze to like

1584
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:06,239
um you know straight up land races like

1585
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,440
like afghanis and old school like not

1586
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:09,358
not even lyrics but old school like

1587
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,039
black dominance like [ __ ] you don't see

1588
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,960
you know anymore and you know that was

1589
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,119
really my crash course into you know the

1590
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,720
next level of growing you know and he

1591
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,720
this dude was just having fun he wasn't

1592
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:19,679
like a serious breeder he was like

1593
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,519
uh

1594
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,598
i hate buying seeds so i just make my

1595
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,639
own seeds so to buy seeds and it turns

1596
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,318
out good

1597
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,639
and i thought that was cool you know so

1598
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,679
um after i you know got out of the army

1599
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,598
in germany

1600
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,039
i uh you know brought my seed collection

1601
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,359
back to the states

1602
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:37,279
and um you know met with you know the

1603
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,039
guy who became my mentor you know

1604
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,960
mendocino mike

1605
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,199
and he took me up he took me up but you

1606
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,440
know that aficionado kind of you know

1607
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,480
was created out of you know when i was

1608
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,480
growing

1609
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,119
when you're growing the best possible

1610
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,880
cannabis it just comes logical that you

1611
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,160
have to breed your own strains right so

1612
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,079
whether you have a

1613
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,598
strain in clone form you know it's going

1614
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,960
to come to the time where you have to

1615
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,640
start breeding your own strains to have

1616
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,079
a unique edge over the market like if

1617
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,679
you get to the point where you can read

1618
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,599
the market

1619
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,799
and and and see what people want you

1620
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,720
know that's when i really started taking

1621
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,920
breeding seriously was when i was in

1622
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:14,399
mendo with mike and um uh i then i

1623
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,119
started on my then i got my own scene

1624
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,519
and i did what every other grower does

1625
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,358
to make ends meet you gotta

1626
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:22,639
you gotta do business right you got you

1627
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:24,239
gotta help your friends out you gotta

1628
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,480
make sure that that that the right

1629
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,239
things flow to the right pipelines so

1630
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,838
the cool thing about that is you i was

1631
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:32,799
able to like read the market in a way

1632
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:34,719
where i was like okay i think people

1633
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,039
want this

1634
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:38,719
and so i'd make a cross not test it out

1635
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,480
and i'd grow it out and the buyers would

1636
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,719
like it and then it came to the time

1637
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,318
where buyers were coming

1638
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,679
and they wanted just all sours they

1639
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,000
wanted all chem dogs they weren't all

1640
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:49,679
sours but they were buying chem dog too

1641
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,679
and this was like the headliners before

1642
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,239
you know og you know really hit the

1643
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,399
market in in the crazy bulk um up at

1644
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,159
humboldt mendoza like chems and sours

1645
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,160
were like the biggest thing

1646
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,078
and so these repeat guys that were

1647
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,318
coming back and making sure that things

1648
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,079
were flowing they wanted uh they was

1649
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:07,358
like look man if you could hook our

1650
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,839
farmers up

1651
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:12,159
with with with a strain that smells like

1652
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,960
this consistently

1653
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,639
then we'll we'll buy the whole crop

1654
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,559
and so that was really i was like holy

1655
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:21,358
[ __ ] i could probably i could like

1656
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,240
because i've seen so much product

1657
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:24,239
flow

1658
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:26,239
you know in mendocino and humble i had a

1659
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,239
good idea for like you know who the best

1660
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,639
growers were what the hottest genetics

1661
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:32,799
were i knew that even if the the the

1662
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,480
buyers weren't coming into town that

1663
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,160
even if even if this wasn't what they

1664
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,480
were looking for all i had to do was

1665
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,838
open the [ __ ] bag so like i've always

1666
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,679
i found out early that all you got to do

1667
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,239
is exceed expectations

1668
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:45,039
so we created a chem dog strain

1669
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:46,799
and

1670
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,960
gave it to our friends we grew it the

1671
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,359
buyers bought it all

1672
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,880
and um that was we exceeded the

1673
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:55,119
expectations of that chem dog and we

1674
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,800
ended up entering that that next year

1675
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,400
and so

1676
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,480
you know when it came to

1677
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,680
aficionados it was kind of like oh this

1678
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,039
started seed company you know i was

1679
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,199
really inspired to start the sea company

1680
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,519
from shiloh massive before he started

1681
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,279
dying breed um you know he had this

1682
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:11,358
project called massive seeds that he was

1683
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,200
doing like way back in the day

1684
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:15,440
and you know that was like you know that

1685
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,879
was really my first interface into like

1686
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,720
you know the seed breeders world because

1687
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,079
all the breeders i knew like the seed

1688
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,159
breeders world that was like the

1689
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,318
cannabis industry all the breeders i was

1690
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:25,920
getting my seeds from in mendo you know

1691
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:28,000
if it wasn't from europe were just like

1692
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,599
these old these old growers

1693
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,639
you know and so i was paying through the

1694
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,838
ass for ogcs like that's why we came up

1695
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:35,358
with our particular price point because

1696
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:38,719
i was buying 50

1697
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:40,960
a seed og seeds back in 2010

1698
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:42,318
you know 2000 you know 2011 like that

1699
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,079
was a real thing for me because it was

1700
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,599
worth the investment so

1701
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,000
you know it wouldn't have been without

1702
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,760
those strains being an amendo with mike

1703
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,559
that aficionado just ended up starting

1704
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,559
to happen you know it just came as a

1705
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,640
natural process of i was definitely

1706
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,798
influenced by shiloh but i was able to

1707
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,318
take the strains that i had i collected

1708
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:01,358
you know i made with mike and i had

1709
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:04,480
myself

1710
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:07,039
as an a as a as a way to you know

1711
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,480
communicate you know what if we could be

1712
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:09,759
you know one of the best players in

1713
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,318
mendocino

1714
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,599
and how can we communicate that

1715
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:15,679
and then you know we ended up winning

1716
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,960
the cup our first cup in 2012 and that

1717
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,118
kind of really

1718
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,679
you know really helped you know launch

1719
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,119
us into orbit with with people you know

1720
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,279
knowing who we were

1721
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,358
more buyers came up to us you know more

1722
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,160
people that wanted you know a certain

1723
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:32,159
flavor we were really good with gas

1724
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,480
i got really lucky with that you know my

1725
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,118
og was really good at you know selecting

1726
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,358
things for gas crossing things for gas

1727
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:42,160
and you know my later friend you know

1728
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:44,480
alan atkinson who who founded probiotic

1729
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,639
farmers alliance and growkashi

1730
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,119
uh he was really good at selecting for

1731
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,719
gas and selecting for good flavor too

1732
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,599
and so you know learning from all these

1733
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:55,279
people

1734
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,920
um having that you know um that

1735
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,720
you know opportunity to you know to meet

1736
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,480
shiloh through allen and to to get my

1737
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,558
first glimpse at you know what really

1738
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,559
the cannabis industry was like the above

1739
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,079
ground cannabis industry that was a

1740
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,680
different world for me i was completely

1741
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,200
off grid and black

1742
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:12,960
you know for a long time you know i was

1743
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,960
kicked out of the army so when i was

1744
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,039
kicked out of the army it was like [ __ ]

1745
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,960
it's either sink or swim i definitely

1746
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,199
ain't getting a job so i had to make it

1747
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,318
work you know so you know transitioning

1748
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:24,480
from straight

1749
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:27,440
you know the underworld to seeing this

1750
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,199
kind of medical quasi-medical you know

1751
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,880
cannabis movement happening cali was was

1752
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,078
just [ __ ] mind-blowing

1753
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,599
you know it was like it was a different

1754
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,559
world for me so that's really you know

1755
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,720
what aficionado was born out of

1756
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,240
and at what point did you decide to

1757
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:41,679
bring frenchie on board and more

1758
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:42,798
importantly

1759
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:44,639
it was kind of like a bit of a

1760
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:46,239
forethinking thought on your part what

1761
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,000
was it about frenchie that you thought

1762
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:51,519
like this is going to bring something

1763
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,519
new a twist to the usual

1764
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:54,719
we he met i met him after i got off the

1765
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,838
stage

1766
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:58,959
and woke up in

1767
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:00,480
2012. um

1768
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,000
because i remember he cut he came out to

1769
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,000
me and he was like he gave me this big

1770
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,119
hug he didn't even know me and he was

1771
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,199
just like

1772
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,640
really happy that he was like because a

1773
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,318
lot of people when they win the cup you

1774
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:14,078
know they basically pull their dick out

1775
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:16,400
and they flex oh you know and i i never

1776
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,640
thought i would was gonna win [ __ ] all i

1777
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,079
was like if i get top 20 i'm at least

1778
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,598
part of the cool kid crowd you know what

1779
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,680
i mean i just wanted to be acknowledged

1780
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,838
as a grower that was my thing i just

1781
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:28,480
wanted like my whole you know it wasn't

1782
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:30,719
like i bred so i could keep growing fire

1783
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,880
for myself and so i could keep hitting

1784
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,159
the highest ticket possible

1785
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,400
you know what i mean but when i met

1786
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,399
frenchy man

1787
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,720

1788
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,880

1794
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,798
that level you know where we got so when

1795
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,480
frenchie

1796
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:57,838
you know when i met frenchie

1797
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,760

1800
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,000
you've seen him before but you know you

1801
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,079
never seen him before but you have a

1802
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,480
feeling you've known him before that was

1803
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,480
the thing you know i see this guy you

1804
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,760
get that feeling then he opens a jar of

1805
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,079
hash

1806
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,480
i never smelled hash this [ __ ] loud

1807
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,880

1808
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,559
it was some mk ultra from some growers

1809
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,318

and and i was like dude i've never

1811
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,719
spelled hash like this he was like

1812
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,399
if your [ __ ] hash doesn't smell as

1813
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:29,919
loud or if louder than your flowers then

1814
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,599
you [ __ ] it up

1815
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,440
and i was like dude we gotta do it was

1816
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,039
right there like really that five-minute

1817
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,880
span was like dude you're my hash guy

1818
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:38,159
like forever

1819
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,599
and

1820
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,838
we've been loyal to each other ever

1821
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,599
since man like i've never taken other

1822
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:44,880
people's opportunities to make cash for

1823
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,119
them or have other people make hash it

1824
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,559
was like you know french is one of those

1825
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,680
day ones man

1826
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,839
where it's like you know you have a

1827
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:54,318
special connection and it was like

1828
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,318
it just ended up it wasn't planned

1829
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,159
we we ended up just being

1830
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,759
really compatible and we had we ended up

1831
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,759
sharing the same vision

1832
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,599
you know he's french and he was a he was

1833
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,240
a bag designer back in the day and he

1834
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,400
has a certain idea for aesthetics and

1835
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:11,039
and for and for refinement and that's

1836
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,798
what i always aspired to to have those

1837
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,639
sensibilities you know i kind of grew up

1838
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:16,400
in my family wasn't rich you know they

1839
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,639
were middle class but you know i had to

1840
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,240
earn and work for everything i had as a

1841
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:20,960
child you know nothing was given to me

1842
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,439
so

1843
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,559
um i have i've always appreciated people

1844
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,159
that had that that that that

1845
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,839
that

1846
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,480
that sense of aesthetic that friendship

1847
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:34,480
has that sense of refinement that we all

1848
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,318
wish we could pursue at a higher level

1849
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,838
so you know frenchie was the biggest

1850
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:39,759
blessing man he was the he's been the

1851
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:40,960
most solid guy in my life for the past

1852
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,880
seven years

1853
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,480
like uh he's family

1854
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,079
you know so i'm really lucky that you

1855
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,119
know we share the same vision on a lot

1856
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,119
of things

1857
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,240
and you know when it comes to organic

1858
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,838
growing

1859
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:52,798
it comes to where the where the company

1860
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,558
should go

1861
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,318
you know frenchie's definitely you know

1862
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,240
he's he's the [ __ ] dude where i'm

1863
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,159
like if i make a big move i run up my

1864
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:01,919
friendship first okay french what do you

1865
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:04,239
think about this

1866
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,079
yeah for sure i know what it's like to

1867
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:07,118
uh to have a guy like that that's solid

1868
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,359
it's good

1869
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,519
so i guess kind of leading into the next

1870
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,759
question the previous idea of like you

1871
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:16,239
guys are expanding beyond the typical

1872
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,160
breeder and i think that people would

1873
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:20,078
commonly identify cookies as doing this

1874
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:22,000
you know expanding into like a lifestyle

1875
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,839
type of brand do you feel like this is

1876
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,358
the natural progression for all breeders

1877
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:28,639
or and why not yeah why the [ __ ] not so

1878
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:30,480
some breeders are going to choose to

1879
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:32,000
participate at that level and and some

1880
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,599
don't

1881
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,440
you know so some won't want to and

1882
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,300
that's up to them

1883
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,519
you know um

1884
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,400
[Music]

1885
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:42,079
i think it's cool man like why not man

1886
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,400
if your shit's that hot and people want

1887
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,160
to support you and hop and hop on your

1888
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,318
train then man that's a that's that's a

1889
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,358
cool thing man like i respect people's

1890
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:50,798
hustle

1891
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,639
a lot of people like to hate on people's

1892
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:54,480
hustle but a lot of people forget that

1893
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,480
these are just ideas

1894
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,599
one day you know and they and then they

1895
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,119
fruited

1896
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,359
now they're now it's fruited into a huge

1897
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,720
[ __ ] brand that took a lot of work

1898
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,159
you know what i mean and so it's like if

1899
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:05,519
a breeder is willing to do that and do

1900
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:06,798
all that work man

1901
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:08,639
um you know

1902
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:10,480
i [ __ ] salute you you know i have my

1903
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,798
own plans for how i want to express my

1904
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,719
merchandise you know later in the future

1905
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:17,519
but you know it was just to me i wanted

1906
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:19,358
to really you know i really want to

1907
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,358
focus on that craft

1908
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,880
and not go all right you know because

1909
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:24,639
once you start

1910
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,720
i'm a control freak so if i if i did

1911
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,798
that i'd have to control the you know

1912
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:30,639
the the merchandising and the branding

1913
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:32,318
of it all but for me it's just as a

1914
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,000
breeder i wanted to focus on that craft

1915
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:36,639
so when the time comes

1916
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,920
um for me to branch out then

1917
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,440
you know hopefully it'll be the right

1918
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,440
time and i'll execute it right but i

1919
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,119
think breeders i think it's great man

1920
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,280
turn it into a huge lifestyle brand

1921
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,920
because it is a lifestyle people hate on

1922
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,920
everything but this is like the cannabis

1923
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,000
lifestyle is [ __ ] amazing and it's a

1924
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,000
lifestyle that when you're in it you

1925
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,880
never want to leave it and everybody

1926
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,318
dreams of being in it and so you know i

1927
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,160
don't understand why people you know

1928
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,480
hate on these brands you know like you

1929
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,399
know jungle voice gets a lot of flack

1930
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,679
you know and we and a lot of people

1931
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,160
around the globe could talk a lot of

1932
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:09,519
[ __ ] about jungle boys but why is why

1933
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,759
are they the only ones making that

1934
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:13,280
hustle work the way they're working it

1935
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,280
you know what i mean there's like that

1936
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,960
there's magic in that you feel me it's

1937
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,480
like you know their whole concept

1938
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,639
approach to branding i don't know these

1939
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,119
guys frenchie knows them he's really

1940
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,798
cool with him but i just respect hustles

1941
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,400
in general because all this [ __ ] came

1942
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:28,798
from [ __ ] nothing

1943
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,798
you know what i mean and you're able to

1944
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,239
to connect with people in this manner

1945
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,000
where they want to wear your [ __ ]

1946
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:35,439
clothes and support you communicate to

1947
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,280
the world that these are the

1948
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,880
[ __ ] i support whether you

1949
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,640
agree with it or not

1950
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,119
it's like music not everybody listens to

1951
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,719
future not everybody listens to to these

1952
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,318
new rappers some people choose to listen

1953
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,639
to older rappers like biggie and tupac

1954
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:50,719
but that's at your discretion but that

1955
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,480
doesn't negate the fact that these

1956
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:54,480
clientele are there and people want to

1957
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,159
[ __ ] support these [ __ ]

1958
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,480
people want to get behind certain brands

1959
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:01,118
and be like this is this is my identity

1960
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,440
i'm a weed person and i identify with

1961
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,640
this spectrum in the weed community like

1962
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,639
that's [ __ ] cool man i think there

1963
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:07,519
should be more brands that come out and

1964
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:09,519
flex

1965
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,519
and and and try to do a lifestyle brand

1966
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,599
because if you're raw and it's real

1967
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:14,559
it'll catch on

1968
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,640
yeah

1969
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,599
certainly what is what's the saying real

1970
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:22,000
real does he's real or whatever god

1971
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,440
yeah real like yeah that was like i

1972
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,119
didn't learn that one until i came into

1973
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,720
industry either like like the above

1974
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,880
ground industry like this whole

1975
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,078
real recognized real [ __ ] you know what

1976
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,760
i mean like i didn't have that when i

1977
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,920
was hustling it was like were you on

1978
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,839
time and was the money right yeah i mean

1979
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,559
it's like not real recognize real is

1980
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:40,400
this [ __ ] does what he says you

1981
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,079
know what i mean and so it's like the

1982
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,200
whole real record i mean it's like it's

1983
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,519
subjective

1984
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,358
yeah what's wrong you know what i mean

1985
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:49,199
let's i mean to me to me what's real is

1986
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:50,880
like you know i look at his authenticity

1987
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:52,798
in in the game

1988
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,720
yeah you know at least sacrificed it and

1989
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,880
you really you were really you know

1990
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:58,959
you you're really in the culture you

1991
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,880
know working for you know working to

1992
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,880
better your craft and really going to

1993
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,160
the shows connecting with people you

1994
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,838
know that's the real work that's the

1995
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,118
real hustle you know what i mean

1996
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:08,480
yeah yeah i think there's there's

1997
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,000
definitely tibbetts of truth you can

1998
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,679
draw from it like the idea of are you

1999
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,039
doing what's good for you or what's good

2000
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:14,879
for you as well as good for the

2001
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,520
community

2002
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,519
yeah i mean

2003
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,720
it's an interesting one but

2004
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,838
yeah that's like [ __ ] it's a good one

2005
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:24,959
it's like you know do you want to do

2006
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:26,558
what's good for the community or do you

2007
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,599
want to break boundaries

2008
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,200
so it's like if you want to do what's

2009
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,200
good for community you wouldn't have

2010
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,558
sold 100 eighth

2011
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,639
but if you want to break boundaries and

2012
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:35,839
make history you sell 100.8 so it's like

2013
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:37,118
what do you do

2014
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,239
i'm the kind of person i'd rather make

2015
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,358
history you know what i mean so it's

2016
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:41,358
like

2017
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,440
you know uh a lot of people in the

2018
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:45,358
community were against the high prices

2019
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,119
of aficionados back in the day but we

2020
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:48,880
wanted to make a point it wasn't because

2021
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,400
we you know we thought we were the best

2022
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,599
breeders you know because you know i was

2023
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,720
working with me and jean back then in

2024
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,680
john and q

2025
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:57,358
and um it was about showing the [ __ ]

2026
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,199
very best that emerald triangle had to

2027
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:00,960
offer so i think it's like you know how

2028
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:03,679
do you want to communicate

2029
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,440
to the world what you do

2030
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,279
yeah totally well that brings us to the

2031
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,119
next question i was going to say

2032
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,798
the pricing of seeds is an interesting

2033
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,079
topic and in the past you guys have

2034
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,798
copped a bit of flack for the seed

2035
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,960
pricing how would you generally answer

2036
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:19,358
someone who was say critical of a more

2037
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,720
expensive pricing model in general

2038
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:24,318
it better be good

2039
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,399
it better be good that's the only reason

2040
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:28,239
why it works you know some and all you

2041
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,680
know let me let me say this straight up

2042
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:30,959
for everybody when you're playing

2043
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,719
genetics

2044
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,199
it's it's it's a it's a game of

2045
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,959
statistics it's just a matter of time

2046
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:39,118
before you release something that's not

2047
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,440
good it's it's a there's going to be

2048
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,039
some seeds and a fire-ass batch of seeds

2049
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,480
that aren't going to work out for people

2050
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,839
you know what i'm saying so if you're

2051
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,559
going to compete at a certain price

2052
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,318
point um your testing better be on point

2053
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,400
your selection better be on point or

2054
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:53,679
you're gonna get [ __ ] roasted

2055
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,280
you know what i mean you have to have

2056
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:57,598
incredibly high standards and i think

2057
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:00,798
like depending on how you choose to

2058
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:02,640
price your seeds that's the hardest part

2059
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:04,000
what is this worth

2060
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:05,279
you know what i mean just because you

2061
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,960
say it's worth something doesn't mean

2062
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,440
people are going to buy it

2063
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,960
that's the hard part about that

2064
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,079
you know it's like you know we got lucky

2065
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,039
you know we tend to sell out every year

2066
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,039
but

2067
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:20,160
whenever we think about what do we price

2068
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,760
this at you know is is is that's like

2069
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:23,598
that's a huge conversation for us every

2070
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,960
single [ __ ] year you know things are

2071
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,160
changing now

2072
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,000
you know back in the day when we first

2073
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:29,920
came out we were

2074
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,079
part of part of aficionado was so we

2075
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,159
could establish you know one of the

2076
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,200
world's first luxury cannabis brands but

2077
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,038
really it was

2078
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,639
we wanted to sell we wanted to sell to

2079
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,440
the kind of guys we were selling packs

2080
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:40,960
to

2081
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,280
we wanted to sell people that like

2082
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,559
didn't look like weed people but we're

2083
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,079
moving a lot of money in the weed

2084
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,280
industry a lot of your growers don't

2085
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,318
look like wee people that's like regular

2086
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,839
people

2087
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,440
and those are the kind of guys i wanted

2088
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:53,038
to market to i was like if you were

2089
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,440
willing to spend

2090
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,520
500 on a box of seeds

2091
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,358
you either one would do everything

2092
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,639
[ __ ] possible to make sure you're

2093
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:03,440
going to grow the [ __ ] [ __ ] of that

2094
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:05,440
500 box of seeds or two you're raw

2095
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,119
enough where you're going damn

2096
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,679
i got 10 seeds

2097
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:12,000
worst case scenario i'll get 50 females

2098
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:13,679
that's five plants back in the day the

2099
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,760
reasoning was like oh five plants that's

2100
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:17,679
five to eight pounds of plant

2101
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,480
you know saying make my investment way

2102
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:22,239
over you know so but those but

2103
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,240
that that market dynamic doesn't exist

2104
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,118
anymore you know what i mean um you know

2105
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:26,719
now

2106
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,240
fire genetics are accessible at all

2107
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:29,919
kinds of price points you know so when

2108
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:31,598
it comes to pricing you know we're

2109
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,480
always going to have a high price point

2110
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,920
straight because there's things that

2111
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,880
we've been working on for a while and

2112
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,079
that just stand out but you know um it's

2113
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,400
definitely something that needs to

2114
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,280
change with the times you know

2115
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,960
yeah

2116
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,798
we're always going to have our our 500

2117
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,880
you know to 800 boxes of strains those

2118
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:48,480
will sell out and people always auction

2119
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,960
those we don't have control over that

2120
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,798
and that inflates the value too but you

2121
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,240
know um

2122
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:56,719
i also know what it's like to not have

2123
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,719
the money to spend on like 500 you know

2124
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:00,480
boxes of seeds so you know we definitely

2125
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:02,318
have some more accessible strains coming

2126
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,318
out this year for people that you know

2127
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:06,318
want to be able to experience it but

2128
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,440
we'll offer at a lower price point is it

2129
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:09,038
going to be like less quality we're

2130
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,240
actually like you know some of our best

2131
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,599
we're going to put at that lower price

2132
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:12,798
point you know what it means just to

2133
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,200
make a point

2134
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:17,198
you know because we understand that but

2135
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:18,880
but you know

2136
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,479
it's it's a it's a difficult concept

2137
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,079
when you when people talk about pricing

2138
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,519
because it also goes like your brand

2139
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:24,719
like what's what's the goal of your

2140
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,920
price

2141
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,679
you know what i mean like i'm only going

2142
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,600
to make these strains once so that's why

2143
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,359
we price them that way but i think if

2144
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,199
you're going to make them over and over

2145
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,319
then they have to not be

2146
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,238
then

2147
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,279
that level of prestige pricing doesn't

2148
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:39,039
work

2149
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,080
you're going to end up frying yourself

2150
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,439
and people are going to feel like they

2151
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:42,719
got cheated or you're just you're going

2152
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:44,399
to turn into another doggy's nuts

2153
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,439
remember doggies nuts back in the day

2154
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:48,639
they were selling

2155
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,079
seed packs and everybody upset with them

2156
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,159
yeah they were like that's

2157
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:54,559
come out of the blue selling similar

2158
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:56,798
seed packs you know what i mean so

2159
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,880
yeah okay so i that's it brings up a

2160
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:00,719
good question you know what would you

2161
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,960
say to someone if they were after one of

2162
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,158
your more expensive strains specifically

2163
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,838
but they just didn't really have the

2164
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:08,719
financial freedom to get it you know do

2165
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:10,000
you have any kind of creative solutions

2166
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,158
um you know

2167
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,640
usually we we hear a lot of these

2168
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:17,278
i stay off the gram do i don't do any

2169
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,279
business on ig that's my role so

2170
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,120
um it kind of sucks i can't interface

2171
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:23,120
with consumers on that level on ig

2172
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,880
because when we do have that interface

2173
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:26,399
it's usually on a show

2174
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,079
yeah you know i meet all kinds of people

2175
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,439
at shows there's like you know they'll

2176
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:30,960
show us a lot of love and they'd be like

2177
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,318
yo really i don't have enough money for

2178
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,719
this but i have this

2179
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:37,039
i'll hook you up man it's like you know

2180
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,399
especially like you know i i give a lot

2181
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:39,519
at the show

2182
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,439
like

2183
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,960
for a year they didn't want me to sell

2184
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,358
seeds at the show because they were like

2185
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,039
bro you you hook everybody up

2186
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,239
you're too [ __ ] nice you like you

2187
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,640
know because i really just want people

2188
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:52,079
to grow you know like aficionado the

2189
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,920
brand and the pricing is to show the

2190
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:55,920
world this is the potential in northern

2191
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,199
california so i want people to stop

2192
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,520
taking it seriously i'm trying to do

2193
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:00,639
something for us so we can you know so

2194
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,040
i'm trying to be a part of this

2195
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,719
ecosystem so more people could you know

2196
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:06,640
build up this ecosystem to make more

2197
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,439
high-end brands across the world

2198
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,560
you know

2199
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:12,479
i mean through i mean across california

2200
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,560
yeah well i i think you could argue

2201
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,559
it'll extend across the world i don't

2202
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,880
think a lot of people are familiar with

2203
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,800
your refund policy but let's just kind

2204
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,719
of put it into question form what would

2205
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,640
you say to someone if they said they

2206
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:27,039
were kind of unhappy with a pack of your

2207
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,880
seeds or something along those lines and

2208
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,719
does that ever really happen

2209
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,159
yeah happens all the time i mean it's

2210
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,319
genetics you know i'm saying everyone

2211
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,960
has different rooms and environments

2212
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:38,880
it's not gonna it's a [ __ ] seed and

2213
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,679
so it depends everybody grows

2214
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,800
differently um and our seeds are grown

2215
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,960
in a certain environment so it

2216
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,560
definitely happens but um i try to make

2217
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,520
an effort you know if

2218
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,199
we've had a few email accounts shut down

2219
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,960
um and get hacked over the last past few

2220
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:54,799
years so it's been you know kind of hard

2221
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,800
for us to get back to people

2222
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,320
but we always try to replace the packs

2223
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,400
especially if it's at a show i'll just

2224
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,000
hook you up if you're like unhappy and

2225
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:04,000
you show me your certificate like this

2226
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,800
was garbage it's like i'll just give you

2227
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,719
a pet

2228
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,320
like here you go you know but if if you

2229
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,319
hold on to the seeds you don't open them

2230
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:11,840
we'll buy it back from you

2231
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:13,039
but you know we'll only pay the

2232
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,119
wholesale price because that's what we

2233
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:16,640
get paid we'll pay you what we get paid

2234
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:18,238
you know what i mean and i do that every

2235
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,560
year i can't wait till people come up to

2236
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:23,039
the booth can't wait for that [ __ ]

2237
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,560
people to [ __ ] sell me back my seeds

2238
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:28,000
because the first three years we sold

2239
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,679
everything like everything so

2240
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,279
we know we didn't have a whole lot of

2241
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,440
white cashmere seeds left we probably

2242
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,279
had like 20 30 of those left and so like

2243
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,198
when someone came by the booth last year

2244
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:38,319
and they sold me back they wanted to

2245
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:40,960
they wanted

2246
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,079
me to buy back two boxes of cashmere i i

2247
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,359
gave them you know more than the

2248
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,600
wholesale price at that point because i

2249
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,839
really wanted those [ __ ] packs

2250
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,239
yeah and it is an interesting point and

2251
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,319
i think that it might be something which

2252
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:55,039
continues into the future do you think

2253
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:57,119
that's just a part of the the high

2254
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:58,158
kind of prestige and value of the brand

2255
01:11:57,119 --> 01:11:59,840
or do you think this might even be

2256
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:02,079
adopted yeah it was

2257
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,640
the the function of it was so your

2258
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:06,079
australians always have value

2259
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,360
you know if louis vuitton follows a

2260
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:09,279
certain model that's why i never find a

2261
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:10,880
louis vuitton at a [ __ ] thrift store

2262
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:12,399
because if you take a real authentic

2263
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,000
louis vuitton perspective louis vuitton

2264
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:16,000
they'll give you cash for it

2265
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
it always holds the cash value

2266
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,840
and i was inspired by that um when doing

2267
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,520
aficionados i was like

2268
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,880
you know if these things are still

2269
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,000
sealed up

2270
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,239
and and

2271
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,439
the the vials and the boxes are set up

2272
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:28,799
in a way so we can preserve these

2273
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,279
[ __ ] things

2274
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,480
you know um i'll buy it back we will buy

2275
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:34,960
it back you know we thought that was a

2276
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:37,198
great thing i can't that's that's i'm

2277
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,279
stoked every time someone keeps a box

2278
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,279
long enough for me to buy back because

2279
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:42,559
chances are i probably don't have boxes

2280
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,679
of that strain because we sell

2281
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,840
everything

2282
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,079
you know it's we sell everything we make

2283
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,880
we make we make new stuff every year

2284
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:51,920
and you know um you know that's just how

2285
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,880
it is

2286
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,640
so over the past say five to ten years

2287
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,880
at least as far as i can see there's

2288
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,560
been this growing demand for the use of

2289
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,560
growing from seed outdoors you know

2290
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,880
there's plenty of advantageous region

2291
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:07,600
reasons particularly the taproot and all

2292
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,840
the benefits it brings with it with that

2293
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,280
in mind do you consider the idea of

2294
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,039
catering to these kind of outdoor

2295
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:16,399
growers who are looking for like your 50

2296
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:18,560
or your 100 pack seeds

2297
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,719
yeah so um

2298
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,640
when you were local in mendocino in

2299
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,480
humboldt i had a uh

2300
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,679
there was this rule for a long time if

2301
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,439
you knew me

2302
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,119
if you if you knew me personally or or

2303
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:31,119
you knew me through a friend

2304
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,119
you know i get and i'd give you free

2305
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,439
seeds if you lived anywhere between

2306
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:38,000
arcata and ukaya

2307
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:40,559
you know so for the longest time i was

2308
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,560
you know and that was kind of you know

2309
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,320
the thing with you know back in the day

2310
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,920
with when i was working with me jeans we

2311
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:48,238
always had the homies come by the booth

2312
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,239
and we always gave them seeds because

2313
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:51,519
you know we came from points like you

2314
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:53,359
know even though

2315
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,360
like when i was making my own seeds and

2316
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:57,279
doing my own thing before aficionado i

2317
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:58,880
was like just giving them away to people

2318
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:00,800
like hey how does you know see how this

2319
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,319
is this is something i made you know

2320
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,320
with mike back in the day you know what

2321
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,679
i mean like tell me how it is

2322
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:07,599
and so it's like i've always given the

2323
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,719
homie seeds so it's like what am i doing

2324
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,400
i'm going to charge you now that i have

2325
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,840
a company so it's like i always you know

2326
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:14,000
made an effort to show love to the

2327
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:17,360
growers that made all the magic i always

2328
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,560
saw the growers in humboldt mendo as the

2329
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:21,920
the key

2330
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:24,080
the key the the key clientele that that

2331
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,319
could help are these strains you know

2332
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,960
reach a new level you know so when it

2333
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:30,079
came to those guys you know hell yeah

2334
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,520
you know but these are mostly on a

2335
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,519
personal basis where i'll you know i'll

2336
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,679
break you off like 50 to 100 seeds you

2337
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,120
know to to sift through

2338
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,600
you know but we're seeing that that's

2339
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:41,519
going away now you know the days of

2340
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,880
growing big ass outdoor plant patches

2341
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,719
you know that's going to get smaller and

2342
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,560
smaller because the name of the game now

2343
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,399
is clones and tissue culture and getting

2344
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,120
that consistent canopy

2345
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:50,879
so

2346
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:51,840
you know the breeding's going to change

2347
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,520
the corner that we're always going to

2348
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,719
breathe outdoors we're always going to

2349
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,760
breathe for outdoor people we're always

2350
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,239
going to have those strains because

2351
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,320
that's what we are before anything i was

2352
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:01,039
a [ __ ] outdoor grower you know that's

2353
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:03,599
like

2354
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:05,439
that was my passion and so like you know

2355
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,320
we'll we'll we'll make some strains

2356
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:10,158
indoors but we'll always make our best

2357
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,599
strains outdoors under the sun like

2358
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:13,759
that's that's a rule we just can't

2359
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:16,640
[ __ ] deviate from

2360
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,360
and do you believe that seeds produced

2361
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,039
organically under the sun give like the

2362
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:22,399
most healthiest and optimal seeds or do

2363
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,238
you think that 100

2364
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:26,158
100 people say it doesn't matter and

2365
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:27,678
i'll go okay cool

2366
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,359
cool let's take your pregnant wife stick

2367
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,760
her in a closet for nine months and feed

2368
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:33,839
her pizza and [ __ ] soda you know put

2369
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,280
a light on her should probably survive

2370
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,360
but i guarantee that [ __ ] baby ain't

2371
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:40,158
gonna turn out good you know what i mean

2372
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:43,279
yeah and so it's like the the inputs

2373
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:45,679
30 000 genes are in the cannabis plant

2374
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,719
every input matters right and so if we

2375
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,920
look at that

2376
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,198
and we're geneticists where it's like

2377
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,119
all right i want to give this dna

2378
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:52,719
everything it needs

2379
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,719
to be successful for the next person

2380
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,760
that's going to work these lines

2381
01:15:54,719 --> 01:16:00,480
i need to give this genetic everything

2382
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,320
that it evolved to uptake and have

2383
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:05,839
i mean people forget that this this

2384
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:07,920
phenomenon of of cultivation is wholly

2385
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,960
happened in the span of the last

2386
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,640
60 years you know what i mean in in big

2387
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,158
cannabis cultivation this phenomenon has

2388
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,960
only happened you know [ __ ] the last 10

2389
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:16,158
years

2390
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,439
and so it's like

2391
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:19,920
people have to also remember like this

2392
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:23,279
plant evolved for millions of years

2393
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:26,800
under sunlight and organic inputs

2394
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,479
and and that's just a [ __ ] fact so

2395
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,480
when it comes so that's our that's our

2396
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:32,158
that's the our core philosophy

2397
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:35,279
is providing the plant genetics

2398
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:37,759
everything that it needs you know every

2399
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:38,719
everything that it evolved to excel with

2400
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,560
you know and then we'll try to

2401
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,399
supercharge that aspect

2402
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,840
um but i think that nutrition of your

2403
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:45,839
seeds is so important man when i see

2404
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,679
people fertilizing seeds but with

2405
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,159
salt-based nutrients i'm like it's not

2406
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:53,199
the same it's not the [ __ ] same you

2407
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:55,279
take you take two prize fighters

2408
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,519
right you could take two prize fighters

2409
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:59,920
like let's say we take two clones

2410
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,239
and and and you [ __ ] make seeds that

2411
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,079
are that are inorganic

2412
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:06,079
with salt-based inputs grown on rock

2413
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,719
wool and you make seeds that are made in

2414
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:11,119
soil that have a high amino acid content

2415
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,760
have you know um a high content of

2416
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:15,599
organic matter have high content of of

2417
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,280
of minerals you know because a lot of

2418
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,960
the problems isn't an mpk problem in

2419
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,039
plants it's a mineral deficiency so it's

2420
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,679
like you know in genetics the genetic

2421
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:26,158
building blocks are all built on these

2422
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,760
essential minerals and amino acids you

2423
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,599
know so it's like it's essential to have

2424
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,679
these inputs present in the soil and

2425
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,400
present in your regiment just get your

2426
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:36,000
[ __ ] seeds in your babies to have

2427
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:37,439
their very best start so if you take a

2428
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,840
prize fighter

2429
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,279
and you feed one you know you feed one

2430
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,719
the right diet he's supposed to eat and

2431
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:44,880
the other one you feed him vodka and

2432
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,760
pizza before a [ __ ] fight you know

2433
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,679
you're definitely going to see the

2434
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,119
difference you know i see the difference

2435
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,960
in people's genetics when they when they

2436
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:53,119
don't when they make seeds without

2437
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,880
without organic inputs i see a distinct

2438
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:56,399
difference

2439
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,199
yeah totally

2440
01:17:56,399 --> 01:17:59,759
so

2441
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:02,238
how would you feel about people making

2442
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,440
f2s and f3s of your line for their own

2443
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:05,039
use and i guess in general how do you

2444
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:05,919
feel about people breeding with your

2445
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:07,600
work

2446
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,158
that's the biggest

2447
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,000
gift you could do for me

2448
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:13,359
it's like it's it's

2449
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,719
you know people think that the gift

2450
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:17,599
stops when you buy the seeds and you

2451
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:20,560
grow it out but man when you choose to

2452
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,640
to f2 it f3 f4 it

2453
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:25,120
man that's awesome

2454
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,520
kill it get it man make that line your

2455
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:29,359
line because at least you're working it

2456
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,560
they're doing the work you know what i

2457
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:32,639
mean there's a lot of work that goes

2458
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,760
into that [ __ ] and so it's like anybody

2459
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,920
who's willing to do that man like

2460
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,600
nothing but love and respect man

2461
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,880
like [ __ ] let's share some seed stock

2462
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,719
give me some ears i'll give you some of

2463
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,960
mine you know it's it's all kinds of

2464
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:44,560
opportunities for that man so when i see

2465
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,600
people work the genetics man that's just

2466
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,039
like the

2467
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,039
the greatest gift

2468
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,640
it's like the best complete circle to me

2469
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:52,719
it's better than the it's better than

2470
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,119
you know than selling the seeds it's

2471
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:57,679
that's that's the to me that's the the

2472
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:59,519
um the validation as a breeder when not

2473
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,840
only has it expressed itself good enough

2474
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,440
in flower to meet their you know to meet

2475
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,360
their expectations

2476
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:06,960
but it's exceeded their expectations to

2477
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:08,399
a point where they choose to continue

2478
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,000
working that line

2479
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:11,839
and so that's just the hugest most

2480
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
humbling gift to me

2481
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,079
so in a previous episode we had me and

2482
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,158
genon and he said he really enjoyed all

2483
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:20,238
the work he's done with aficionado but

2484
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,920
one thing he felt was that it carried a

2485
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:24,158
bit of a labor with it for like being

2486
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,520
the absolute best and he said that he

2487
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:27,599
just felt like that was a lot of

2488
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,360
pressure do you kind of agree with that

2489
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,800
do you feel the pressure sometimes i

2490
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:32,079
remember when gene was talking about

2491
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,159
that man

2492
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:36,399
because he would have every year he'd

2493
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:38,238
have something that was crazy fire

2494
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:40,479
and but if they do be the but i don't

2495
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:42,399
think it's good enough for aficionados

2496
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:44,799
like having to meet that bar is pretty

2497
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:45,920
[ __ ] stressful i'll tell you what bro

2498
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,119
like

2499
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,560
just to keep

2500
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:52,000
doing that and meeting these

2501
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:54,320
expectations is is is uh i think

2502
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,319
i was a little short-sighted when i

2503
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:57,759
first came up with that concept but i'm

2504
01:19:56,319 --> 01:19:59,519
already all the way in i got to keep

2505
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,600
swimming i can't drown now i got to keep

2506
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,640
swimming i got to hold that line

2507
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,199
and so

2508
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:07,360
i 100 percent feel gene on that and like

2509
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:10,158
you know when you're trying to meet that

2510
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:11,759
level of quality and expectation it's

2511
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:13,839
almost

2512
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,199
um unsustainable

2513
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,039
really if you really think about if you

2514
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:18,638
want to be hella real like it's it's

2515
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:22,000
almost unsustainable

2516
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:24,639
and so i think it also

2517
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,158
it also inhibits you from making other

2518
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:28,319
experiments you wouldn't otherwise

2519
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:30,638
because you're so focused on putting the

2520
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:33,119
best out and you're always so focused on

2521
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:35,679
having the most elite [ __ ] i mean look

2522
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:37,599
at what symbiotic did with larry og and

2523
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,800
gdp they created the purple punch you

2524
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,800
know [ __ ] what you say that's just not

2525
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,000
hype that's beautiful i've sifted it

2526
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,840
this year

2527
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,719
that's crazy you know what i mean it's

2528
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:49,039
like so you know when you're in this

2529
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,359
mindset of like man we only have to put

2530
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:53,760
the most exclusive genetics the best

2531
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:55,519
possible genetics on the market i mean i

2532
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,800
think it kind of takes away from the

2533
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,120
artistry because you're always trying to

2534
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,279
meet a certain expectation you're not

2535
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:02,719
doing it um just for the love of the

2536
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:05,039
game you know and i got to be real you

2537
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:07,279
know when um

2538
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:09,600
when when gene and i kind of went on our

2539
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:13,119
separate ways i think that was a point

2540
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,639
in in my game personally when um when we

2541
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:16,479
don't think my head was all the way in

2542
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:18,480
it i think that was that probably that

2543
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:19,678
that was probably one of those that year

2544
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,279
i think

2545
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,679
based on just how long i've been doing

2546
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:25,439
[ __ ] i got lucky with my selections you

2547
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:27,840
know what i mean i got lucky with the

2548
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:29,359
selections and i was able to to to meet

2549
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,239
a certain mark and expectations for

2550
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:32,799
people

2551
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:35,119
but uh it's it's a it's tough

2552
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,880
it's tough trying to [ __ ] always hold

2553
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:38,158
that line and do it you know it's like

2554
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,480
what gene's doing right now with his

2555
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:41,759
lines is crazy it's really cool you know

2556
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:42,638
he could do anything he [ __ ] wants

2557
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,560
you know

2558
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,600
like that and that's that's music to me

2559
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,960
you know what i mean so you could do

2560
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,199
anything you want that's freedom you

2561
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,719
know you can really make good music so

2562
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:53,279
that's one of the reasons why we started

2563
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,480
a french connection um with my partner

2564
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:56,960
professor q

2565
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:58,879
um was it's a it's an outlet for us to

2566
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,560
be able to explore a lot of these more

2567
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,359
contemporary flavors

2568
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,360
and find new flavors that necessarily

2569
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,679
don't fit the aficionado paradigm of

2570
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:09,119
what people expect but

2571
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,800
you know are something that can still

2572
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:13,519
exceed all expectations you know what i

2573
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,920
mean like you know the the genetics you

2574
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,920
know symbiotic and sea junkie are

2575
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,560
working with they're not the most

2576
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:22,239
crazy exclusive genetics

2577
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,679
but they're incredibly good breeders and

2578
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:25,678
that's why the quality comes out of it

2579
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:28,560
they're able to to select and find

2580
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:30,639
things out of you know normally found

2581
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,239
strains you know and some rare strains

2582
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,119
and create something entirely [ __ ]

2583
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,158
different

2584
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:37,840
in in in pivotal you know so that's the

2585
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,039
magic of it so you know going back to

2586
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,800
your thing with like

2587
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:43,039
you know uh yeah it was hella [ __ ]

2588
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,840
hard i can't blame him you know what i

2589
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:45,359
mean

2590
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,279
i can't blame him

2591
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,519
yeah so tell us a little more about

2592

01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,920
breeders where i didn't really play my

2754
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,920
cards right so

2755
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,760
you know you're so raw you're going to

2756
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,480
want to do your own thing one day

2757
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,560
so

2758
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,638
let's work on aficionado and let's build

2759
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,800
a company around you too your own brand

2760
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,960
where you could where you could [ __ ]

2761
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,520
express yourself and you could be your

2762
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,198
own person you know and and it'd just be

2763
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,800
kind of like this record label [ __ ] and

2764
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:08,879
he was down and that's how it's been

2765
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,119
working you know so we both work on

2766
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,079
aficionado and then like you know french

2767
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,679
connection is is is our opportunity to

2768
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:17,600
to to do really exciting things in

2769
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,199
europe with a lot of really badass

2770
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,960
french operators because when frenchie

2771
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:22,960
and i went to spain

2772
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,960
it's universal the best [ __ ] growers

2773
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,600
in europe are in the uk

2774
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,000
and and france i'm sorry all my french

2775
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,600
people my spanish people listen to and

2776
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,520
alberto i know you're in barcelona right

2777
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,639
now yes you're one of the best too

2778
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:39,440
so but but universally man the guys in

2779
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,920
france and and uk man they brought some

2780
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:44,319
[ __ ] heat we saw some crazy [ __ ] like

2781
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:45,920
[ __ ] the kind of talent where if you

2782
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,519
brought it to cali you could sell it for

2783
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,279
cali prices it was that [ __ ] good

2784
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,440
they gave cali people run for that money

2785
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:53,519
and so you know that was definitely you

2786
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,119
know professor q that was kind of our

2787
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,280
whole thing was like man we could make

2788
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:58,800
something bigger than aficionado

2789
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:00,559
and i'm more comfortable on an

2790
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,880
international scale anyway i grew up in

2791
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,480
japan so i was 20 started my career when

2792
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,079
i was in germany so

2793
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:07,119
going to europe with friends with with

2794
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:08,639
quentin

2795
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:10,479
and doing these new exciting things

2796
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,079
makes sense while you know we allow

2797
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,319
aficionados to be what it always has

2798
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,679
been keep it based out of california

2799
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:16,880
keep it pure

2800
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:18,319
you know because we're only going to

2801
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,400
release three to five strains a year

2802
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,238
anyway for the rest of the rest of this

2803
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:23,679
company's life because you know we have

2804
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:24,879
a very specific focus for what we want

2805
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,079
to do but

2806
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,079
the music we're going to make with

2807
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:29,840
quentin that's what i'm really excited

2808
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:32,079
about too

2809
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,159
sounds exciting are there any other

2810
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:35,119
breeders you plan to do collaborations

2811
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:37,119
with

2812
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,519
you know who i just hit up this morning

2813
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:41,359
as i hit up miss jill

2814
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,360
i had to miss joe because i've been

2815
01:29:41,359 --> 01:29:45,759
breeding a lot of strains

2816
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:48,238
i've been breeding a lot of strains um

2817
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,679
more geared towards the female palette

2818
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:52,319
and my sister who's frenchie's

2819
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:54,560
apprentice kind of really inspired me um

2820
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:56,158
she kind of indirectly inspired me on

2821
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,000
that because

2822
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:59,279
she liked a certain flavor profile and

2823
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,800
her friends liked a certain player

2824
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:02,000
profile and i was like [ __ ] i wonder if

2825
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
i could breed for that you know what i

2826
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,840
mean

2827
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,600
so

2828
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,639
um i forgot where i was getting to what

2829
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,159
was your

2830
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:10,159
any other breeders you want to collab

2831
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,000
with yeah yeah so so

2832
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:14,399
my my reason for hitting on miss jill

2833
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,039
was um she's

2834
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:19,599
got some of the craziest

2835
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:22,319
flavors that females love like like the

2836
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:25,280
jelly bean the asian orange like these

2837
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:27,279
really incredible exotic

2838
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:29,198
crazy pronounced tones you don't find a

2839
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,198
lot of cultivars so she was someone i

2840
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:32,638
hit up this morning i saw she said i

2841
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:33,919
asked if she was down

2842
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,800
and she was like yeah man let's rap

2843
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:39,760
later so um another breeder i'm really

2844
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,279
looking forward um to doing some work

2845
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,039
you know we've kind of really collabed

2846
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:44,719
with a lot of breeders we always kind of

2847
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:45,600
just did our own thing and made our own

2848
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:48,158
music

2849
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,360
but that's something that um i

2850
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:50,479
definitely want to change because

2851
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:51,519
there's a lot of talent out there

2852
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:52,799
there's a lot of breeders you know i

2853
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,880
want to put off

2854
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,719
the the notion that i'm too good to work

2855
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:59,440
with you because it was never like that

2856
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:01,279
i was just always in my own world i'm

2857
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:02,479
pretty reclusive by nature anyway you

2858
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:04,158
know so i was just in my own world

2859
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:06,638
working on my own thing because i tend

2860
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:07,679
to get distracted easy um but you know

2861
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,760
being able to work with different

2862
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,840
breeders you know i want to work with i

2863
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,000
you know in-house in-house is killing it

2864
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:16,480
right now i definitely like to work with

2865
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
him you know he was someone i like to

2866
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:19,599
work with um

2867
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,880
compound

2868
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,320
these aren't guys i'm planning to work

2869
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,159
with these are just guys i'm fans of

2870
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:25,198
because it works good compounds work is

2871
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:27,519
really good

2872
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:29,279
and you know if i could collab with with

2873
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,480
a breeder one day whoever's running

2874
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:33,119
symbiotic

2875
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:34,879
i think it's budologist 420

2876
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:36,960
but i could be wrong but whoever's doing

2877
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,039
their breeding is doing some incredible

2878
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,198
work like i sipped it through their

2879
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:43,119
their purple punch f2s

2880
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:44,479
and i just can't believe you got that

2881
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:47,439
expression

2882
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:49,119
out of gdp and og like what the [ __ ] did

2883
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:51,919
you select for to get it to look like

2884
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:53,840
that like that's like what he did

2885
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,199
was what i always try to do you know

2886
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:59,119
what i mean

2887
01:31:55,198 --> 01:32:01,678
so and 303 seeds some cat out of [ __ ]

2888
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:03,359
colorado believe it or not

2889
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,039
you know it's like california guys kind

2890
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:06,319
of hate on colorado guys but we just got

2891
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:08,880
to be real man there's some cats in

2892
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:10,960
colorado bringing some flame the 303

2893
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:14,560
seeds was one of them they did the jet

2894
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:16,639
the g6 jet fuel and that was

2895
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,239
he was able to get an expression of sour

2896
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,840
that i've been trying to get for seven

2897
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,079
years

2898
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:25,039
you know he was he he nailed it on the

2899
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:26,319
g6 jet fuel you know what i mean so if i

2900
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,880
could work with someone it'd be some

2901
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:31,198
would definitely like that too you know

2902
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:33,600
yeah so on the flip side what are just

2903
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:35,599
some general genetics whether it be land

2904
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,960
race or modern that you kind of want to

2905
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:41,199
work into an aficionado strain

2906
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,920
well like we're we've been suffering

2907
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:45,279
through the lebanese for a while

2908
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,800
that's going to turn into a long-term

2909
01:32:45,279 --> 01:32:48,639
project because you know you could cross

2910
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,880
things with things that sound exotic but

2911
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:52,239
is the end product going to be exotic

2912
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:54,159
you know so

2913
01:32:52,238 --> 01:32:55,759
we're really going to open up um the

2914
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:57,439
urkel we're gonna you know a lot of

2915
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,400
these really exciting flavors come from

2916
01:32:57,439 --> 01:32:59,919
urkel

2917
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:02,399
so you know

2918
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,480
the essence of royal kush

2919
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:06,079
you know i always thought that

2920
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:08,238
you know mandelbrot was trying to go

2921
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:10,960
towards the sour d side of things with

2922
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:12,559
the royal kush until i finally grew his

2923
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,960
f1 clone

2924
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,639
the magnum opus and the original release

2925
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,198
of long valley

2926
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:21,359
directly next to an urkel

2927
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:22,559
and i was like holy [ __ ] and it wasn't

2928
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:24,158
you know it was literally until last

2929
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,560
year i saw that observation i was like

2930
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:27,359
holy [ __ ] that's what he was selecting

2931
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,039
for

2932
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:30,719
that's where all those crazy flavors in

2933
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:32,560
the original royal cr7 coming from it

2934
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,000
wasn't coming from the the ghani it

2935
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,920
wasn't coming from the sour i mean it

2936
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,719
was complimented by that but man those

2937
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:41,440
that some crazy tense piercing fruit

2938
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:43,279
tones but coming from the urkel

2939
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:46,158
and so i'm definitely going back into

2940
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:47,679
the urkel again um doing some exploring

2941
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:50,559
into there

2942
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:52,639
and um we made a crazy cross last year

2943
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,920
with one of the contemporary strains

2944
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,319
grape pie

2945
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:58,880
we got one of the cuts of grape pie from

2946
01:33:56,319 --> 01:34:01,359
one of our buddies in humboldt

2947
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:03,840
um the cut came from la

2948
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:05,519
and uh we crossed it with the uh the

2949
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,039
rose especially

2950
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,480
and we just were like we'll see what's

2951
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:10,158
going to happen

2952
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:12,879
and so we didn't really pop the seeds

2953
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:14,638
this year we had uh royal key

2954
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,039
josh from royal key organics ran the

2955
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:19,520
seed and he found some crazy [ __ ] he

2956
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:21,039
ended up giving us two males back

2957
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,639
we floured the males out and there were

2958
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:24,079
some of the frostiest males we've ever

2959
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,079
seen so that's something we're going to

2960
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:28,238
explore that that cultivar a lot more

2961
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:31,279
next year and see what we could select

2962
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:33,039
see if it meets certain expectations and

2963
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,399
um you know

2964
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:38,238
i'm really excited about working the

2965
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:39,839
original diesel i met strawberry jerry

2966
01:34:38,238 --> 01:34:41,519
from um

2967
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,480
god damn i can't remember his [ __ ]

2968
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,440
his company name he released strawberry

2969
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:46,879
jerry

2970
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:49,359
he's a super talented beer from the east

2971
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:51,520
coast and he's he's got a back cross

2972
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:54,479
of the original diesel mudder that's

2973
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,719
sour diesel original diesel the mom that

2974
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,399
made sour diesel so he's got a back

2975
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,399
cross of that and that's definitely

2976
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:02,399
something i'm i'm really you know

2977
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:03,839
excited to work in you know i've kind of

2978
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:05,198
been

2979
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,760
um

2980
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:10,158
you know collecting pollen and you know

2981
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:13,840
storing a few things uh because uh

2982
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:16,559
capulator gave us uh he gifted leo

2983
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,679
from blockchain to give to me a pack of

2984
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,400
this uh

2985
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:23,279
orange apricot times mac crossed our

2986
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:25,118
chem dog espresso reserve so

2987
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:27,439
leo ended up keeping the two females out

2988
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:30,639
of that and we ran all the males in our

2989
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:31,678
indoor and the mails are [ __ ] crazy

2990
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,520
and so

2991
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:36,079
um we put it

2992
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:37,679
we put the mail on on one of my white

2993
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:39,039
cashmeres to see what happened but like

2994
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:41,359
we're just gonna test that out you know

2995
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:42,399
i have no intention of releasing that i

2996
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:44,960
make

2997
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:46,799
anywhere from like 30 strains a year on

2998
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:49,279
average you know but we only release

2999
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,960
like five to six so it's like part of

3000
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:53,279
part of me you know breeding is just

3001
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,880
seeing what things happen you know what

3002
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:56,559
i mean and how do they cross you know

3003
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,239
how they look you know not everything

3004
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:00,480
that i'm gonna cross i'm gonna i'm gonna

3005
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:02,238
produce or sell you know a lot of this

3006
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:03,919
is for observation just like you know

3007
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:06,079
you're only gonna be a good breeder as

3008
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:08,239
as many strains as you grow and you [ __ ]

3009
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:10,238
with too so that's why i also see the

3010
01:36:08,238 --> 01:36:11,359
the virtue and working with other

3011
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:13,519
breeders and collaborating other

3012
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:15,519
breeders getting an extra set of eyes

3013
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,679
um getting that extra perspective on

3014
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,119
what a certain direction could take you

3015
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:21,118
know what i mean because i'll be i'll be

3016
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:23,519
honest you know like if i don't if i

3017
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:25,039
don't have quentin you know here most of

3018
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,320
the time in frenchy i'd probably be full

3019
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:28,079
of [ __ ] you know because you could

3020
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:29,519
believe your own [ __ ] you tell yourself

3021
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:31,039
in your head but if you don't have

3022
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,159
another informed breeder going no i

3023
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:33,920
don't think that's the right direction i

3024
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:35,519
think we should go this way

3025
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,279
and you can look that objectively and go

3026
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,000
yeah you're right bro you know that's

3027
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:41,439
magic you know so you know the you know

3028
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,960
these breeders that i'm talking about

3029
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:45,359
that i want to work with you know in

3030
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,960
their strains it's because i'm seeing

3031
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:49,039
[ __ ] in their work that they're making

3032
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:51,840
selections they're coming with flavors

3033
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:53,359
that nobody else is making you know

3034
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:56,719
that's magic

3035
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:59,118
yeah totally so i mean on the topic of

3036
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:00,639
creation and whatnot seed testing is

3037
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:02,799
always a topic of interest to me in the

3038
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:04,319
past we used to see people use testers

3039
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,239
but we've steered away from that and a

3040
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:08,000
lot of people do in-house testing where

3041
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:10,638
do you guys sit

3042
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,399
we've never done testers

3043
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:15,520
ever we've always it's always been our

3044
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:16,879
policy to vigorously test a house

3045
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,480
when you're when you're outsourcing

3046
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,679
testing it's kind of like the risk of

3047
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:23,198
licensing

3048
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:25,679
you're you're expecting a certain

3049
01:37:23,198 --> 01:37:27,839
a certain standard to be met

3050
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,199
in your absence and that's always a risk

3051
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,679
right especially with breeders breeders

3052
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:34,158
need breeders always need to have things

3053
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,520
a certain [ __ ] way and you know and

3054
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:37,759
we're the same way too you know it's

3055
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,760
like i vigorously test you know i have

3056
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:42,560
we have a vigorous testing you know

3057
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:45,280
program you know where like the whole

3058
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,880
time that we test so when we test this

3059
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:48,559
is like a you know how we test right so

3060
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,639
like we'll make a strain

3061
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,960
and then we'll test it it's first year

3062
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:54,719
outdoors right we'll test it outdoors

3063
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,800
and when we get you know we get a full

3064
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,399
six to eight months you know

3065
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,960
you know living with this strain seeing

3066
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:02,638
how it works and also we take clutch

3067
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,319
cuts during when it's growing we take

3068
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,359
cuts of the females we take cuts to the

3069
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:07,840
males

3070
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:10,000
right one for preservation and two for

3071
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,560
[ __ ] stress testing you got to see

3072
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,399
what's within these strains because you

3073
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,880
know when we grow

3074
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:18,559
i'm basically giving the seeds and their

3075
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,400
environment the best possible

3076
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,159
environment you know it's like you it's

3077
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:24,960
how you want to treat you know your

3078
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:26,719
pregnant wife right you want to give her

3079
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,840
just nothing but love and a comfortable

3080
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:32,560
environment and just no stress so that

3081
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,800
baby comes out it's best possible self

3082
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,560
right and so with

3083
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,079
so we need that to happen in the garden

3084
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,480
where things are producing or we're

3085
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:42,719
getting a feel for you know cultivating

3086
01:38:40,479 --> 01:38:44,879
these things under ideal conditions but

3087
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:46,639
you also have to test things under

3088
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,719
unideal conditions

3089
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:51,920
you got to kind of be

3090
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:54,399
a [ __ ] [ __ ] and and and subject

3091
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:56,000
your the girls that you love to you know

3092
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:58,079
a certain degree of pain and especially

3093
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,760
the boys we call we you know the

3094
01:38:58,079 --> 01:39:01,439
champagne room the reason why we call

3095
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,920
our mail room the champagne room is

3096
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:05,678
because it's the final place you go

3097
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,000
after you get your ass beat in fight

3098
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:09,679
club like that's initial mail selection

3099
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,920
for us it goes through fight club and

3100
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:13,359
that's we have to see what the [ __ ] this

3101
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,560
strain can deal with and that's really

3102
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:17,039
where a lot of your testing is going to

3103
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,400
come from you know um you know testing

3104
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:20,079
as far as like germination that's

3105
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:21,839
something you should always do in-house

3106
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:23,840
test the [ __ ] germ on your seeds test

3107
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,360
the progeny see if they grow out well

3108
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,199
you know but you know i think there's

3109
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:28,880
also a lot of value in having other

3110
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:31,519
talented growers test your [ __ ] too i

3111
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:33,440
just think you have to be really um you

3112
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,679
have to be really uh

3113
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:37,439
[ __ ] you have to be very decisive on

3114
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:40,079
on who you choose to work with you have

3115
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:42,000
to be a lot of trust and there has to be

3116
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:43,679
you know a set of rules you know in an

3117
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,118
agreement that has to be honored between

3118
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,960
the breeder and the guy that's testing

3119
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:48,559
it you know because a lot of the reason

3120
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,399
people like testers is because you know

3121
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,560
things could end up getting stolen you

3122
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:54,799
don't know certain people's security

3123
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,320
you know um so you know as a breeder you

3124
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,480
just kind of want to control everything

3125
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:59,920
you know best possible

3126
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:00,959
yeah totally

3127
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,520
yeah so

3128
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,600
aficionado as a brand has a lot of kind

3129
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,080
of mystery and kind of mystique around

3130
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,440
it in my opinion with that being said

3131
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:11,039
what are the types of things you get up

3132
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,359
to on an average basis like are you just

3133
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:15,198
locked away breeding most of the time

3134
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:16,639
yeah

3135
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:19,359
sure yeah

3136
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:20,960
yeah like it's you know um

3137
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:21,920
so basically there's like my day i'm up

3138
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,079
at five or

3139
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:25,679
five to six every day

3140
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:27,920
i'm a weed monk

3141
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:30,000
i give a five or six every day i work

3142
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,920
out and and i do weed

3143
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,319
all the way until i sleep

3144
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:37,279
and you know i think you know you need

3145
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:39,118
that kind of intense focus to be good at

3146
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:40,559
anything you know and it's like you know

3147
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:42,238
i've really butted heads with this guy

3148
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,239
in the past and people know that we kind

3149
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:45,118
of don't like each other publicly but

3150
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:47,519
you know

3151
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:49,118
brandon from third gen a lot you could

3152
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,719
love him or hate him

3153
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:53,920
there's one thing that i learned from

3154
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:55,679
him was was i never seen somebody work

3155
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:57,279
harder in the industry than that

3156
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,800
[ __ ]

3157
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:00,479
and so seeing

3158
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,159
you know and a lot of people have you

3159
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,479
know you could say whatever you can but

3160
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:07,118
he he earned he earned everything he's

3161
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:09,039
[ __ ] earned through hard [ __ ] work

3162
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:11,599
you know the guy's talented

3163
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:13,519
but hard work beats talent every time

3164
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,679
you know what i mean he's any any i

3165
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,199
never seen someone work that intense so

3166
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:18,880
you know i've always

3167
01:41:17,198 --> 01:41:20,319
you know looked at brandon as someone i

3168
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,639
had to kind of keep up with you know and

3169
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:24,238
it was kind of using you know using a

3170
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,760
rival to your advantage where you could

3171
01:41:24,238 --> 01:41:27,118
find inspiration from someone you don't

3172
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,039
get along with you could start you can

3173
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:30,719
kind of see the strengths they have so

3174
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:33,198
it's like you know seeing guys at the

3175
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:34,639
top of their game seeing how many

3176
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:36,319
[ __ ] hours they put into their

3177
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:37,679
business the name of kevin's audrey the

3178
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:39,439
motherfucker's a workaholic he's a

3179
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:40,399
workhorse you know the dude never stops

3180
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:42,719
working

3181
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:44,319
and you know that that inspires me you

3182
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,239
know the same thing and i follow the

3183
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:48,559
hip-hop industry you know most some of

3184
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:50,559
your most successful artists don't

3185
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,880
[ __ ] sleep i mean they sleep but

3186
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:55,280
they're they work and it takes that

3187
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:57,440
level of focus and attention to detail

3188
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:59,118
to be successful at it and so it's like

3189
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:02,559
i've gotten through times in my life

3190
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:04,719
where i've i've deep m where my focus

3191
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:06,080
and my cognition is deviated from where

3192
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:09,118
it should be

3193
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:11,840
but in but knowing that if i really want

3194
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:13,839
to be in this industry make something i

3195
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,279
got to be super [ __ ] disciplined you

3196
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,039
know what i mean like this isn't just

3197
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:18,719
because i own you know we have our own

3198
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:20,800
business doesn't mean that we can [ __ ]

3199
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:22,880
off it's like you have to be incredibly

3200
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,960
[ __ ] disciplined because no matter

3201
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:27,118
how hard you're working i really feel

3202
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,960
that there's other people out there that

3203
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:31,118
are more hungry that are [ __ ] working

3204
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,880
harder than you to take away what you

3205
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:34,799
have or to [ __ ] you know get better

3206
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,800
that at you in the game

3207
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,079
and that's just gonna [ __ ] happen

3208
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,760
so it's like

3209
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:42,800
my regular day it's like you know i have

3210
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:44,800
to manage the indoor the outdoor

3211
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,880
check on emails check on sales like we

3212
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:49,600
have a really small tight you know tight

3213
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,679
family through a small type network

3214
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:53,679
you know and we really like to we

3215
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:55,600
operate like we hustle we don't like to

3216
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:57,359
really share about share a lot about

3217
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:59,440
what we do we just like to show people

3218
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:02,079
the end product we feel that's part of

3219
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:03,678
the magic you know when when you go to a

3220
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:06,319
magic show and someone shows you how the

3221
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:09,840
magic trick is done it kind of loses its

3222
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:12,158
its mystique kind of it loses the magic

3223
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:14,639
and so we figured if we just like

3224
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:16,638
really focus on the [ __ ] craft

3225
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,719
and just whenever people see us

3226
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:20,159
we're just communicating some fire

3227
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:21,600
you know that's that that's our goal you

3228
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:22,799
know and so it just takes a certain

3229
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,560
lifestyle

3230
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,159
um definitely a lot of sacrifice you

3231
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,840
know it's definitely sacrificed partying

3232
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:30,000
a lot you know i was parting a lot when

3233
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:32,239
i first started aficionado but you know

3234
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,600
now you know just i've learned by being

3235
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:35,599
in the game that if you want to be

3236
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:37,600
relevant you got to work harder than the

3237
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,520
guy that's working harder than you to

3238
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,960
get in the game right now

3239
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,119
so that's what keeps me hungry you know

3240
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:46,800
it's like my normal day is busy as [ __ ]

3241
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:48,799

3242
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,039

3243
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:54,079
sometimes go to bed at two

3244
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:55,920
yeah wow workaholic by the sounds of it

3245
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:56,800
yeah a little bit you know it's but it's

3246
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,239
like

3247
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,600
um

3248
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:01,039
you know everybody thinks it's a cool

3249
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,800
idea to start their own company until

3250
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:03,519
you're actually doing it and you have to

3251
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,600
see

3252
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,679
what goes into it and then you know i

3253
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:10,159
have a lot of people i i aspire to kind

3254
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:11,679
of you know get to the level and so i

3255
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:13,759
just kind of emulate their their work

3256
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,600
habits and their intensity when they

3257
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:17,280
approach their traffic you know certain

3258
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,840
producers i know that i really look up

3259
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:21,279
to and certain businessmen that i know i

3260
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,199
would look up to that they have these

3261
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:25,198
these work ethics that man if i want to

3262
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,118
get to that level i have to [ __ ] work

3263
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:29,359
that hard or harder

3264
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:31,679
yeah totally it's like a shout out to

3265
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:33,679

3268
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,079
people publicly know we don't get along

3269
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:41,279
but my voice is the thing is like just

3270
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:43,359
because i don't like you doesn't mean i

3271
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:44,960
can't respect you you know what i mean

3272
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:46,719
and just you know like there's always

3273
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,880
you know everyone's got something about

3274
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:50,480
their hustle and their intensity that if

3275
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,440
you just put us put away your [ __ ]

3276
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:52,879
ego

3277
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:54,238
man you can see you can really see the

3278
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,039
value these [ __ ] bring to the

3279
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:56,959
game

3280
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,800
you know aside from all the ego [ __ ] on

3281
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:01,359
ig it's like no one worked harder than

3282
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,840
that [ __ ] that do work hard as

3283
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:05,679
[ __ ] you know what i mean and same thing

3284
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:08,639
with gene you know no one

3285
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:10,719
makes no one breeds and observes

3286
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:11,920
on a level that gene does

3287
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,158
you know what i mean when it comes to

3288
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:16,399
breeding so it's like you know being in

3289
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:18,638
proximity those guys showed me a

3290
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:19,679
standard of of of where we should

3291
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,800
operate

3292
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,560
you know what i mean

3293
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,400
and then not abiding by those and making

3294
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:25,920
my mistakes and [ __ ] ups further

3295
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:28,000
reinforces

3296
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,158
how we should emulate how certain guys

3297
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,359
like that operate that intensity that

3298
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:33,279
dedication

3299
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:34,158
you know what i mean so

3300
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:35,679
yeah

3301
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:38,000
okay it's definitely like a spiritual

3302
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,000
journey

3303
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:42,559
so a little bit unrelated i want to know

3304
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:44,079
what's your prediction on the next big

3305
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,520
thing to hit the industry or the next

3306
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:48,639
big wave whatever you want to call it

3307
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:51,199
and how do you plan to ride it

3308
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,199
i don't know

3309
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:56,000
that's a good question

3310
01:45:53,198 --> 01:45:57,839
that's a good question i think like

3311
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,600
the big thing in what context the big

3312
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,760
thing in like the flower market genetics

3313
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,920
market you know

3314
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:06,079
it's you know next big strain next big

3315
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,520
phenomenon

3316
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:08,800
i mean

3317
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,880
i really think the next big thing

3318
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:13,520
happened with big al bro

3319
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,239
i think that you know

3320
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:18,159
it's

3321
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:19,599
is it is it is it set in stone

3322
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:21,920
we can't tell yet

3323
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,159
but but is it happening right now is the

3324
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:25,760
opportunity here right now [ __ ] yeah

3325
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:28,000
that's what that's what real people in

3326
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,000
the industry needed so hard

3327
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,079
was was to be able to participate at

3328
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,319
that level and separate themselves from

3329
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:35,760
the [ __ ] corporate booth squad

3330
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:37,039
you know so like to me that's like you

3331
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,800
know some people could say that's not a

3332
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:41,198
big phenomenon [ __ ] is a price

3333
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:43,920
skeleton look that that customer

3334
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:46,079
demographic exists they're underserved

3335
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:48,239
it's the reason why audemars piguet

3336
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:50,479
ferrari and rolex are in business as

3337
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:52,000
customers of this demographic and so

3338
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:53,359
it's like they need to be served you

3339
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,039
know what i'm saying it's like and just

3340
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:56,399
because you serve them at that at that

3341
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:58,319
price point doesn't mean you could offer

3342
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:00,079
things at an other price point too you

3343
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:01,840
know it's not binary

3344
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:04,960
you know cannabis isn't binary it's not

3345
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:06,639
just it's not black or white you know so

3346
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,079
you know i think that's like the biggest

3347
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,359
thing that's happening to the culture

3348
01:47:08,079 --> 01:47:10,960
right now that people really aren't

3349
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:13,679
appreciating is that we have this new

3350
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:15,359
opportunity to really be like wine to

3351
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:18,079
really be like craft spirits to really

3352
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:20,799
be like high-end cuban cigars you know

3353
01:47:18,079 --> 01:47:22,079
so why resist this opportunity when it's

3354
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,320
going to be what's going to save us

3355
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:25,760
later down the line

3356
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:27,359
yeah totally

3357
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,440
so one of the questions we received from

3358
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:32,399
a few different fans over the period of

3359
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:34,399
this show is that basically they're

3360
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:36,319
always interested in knowing how is it

3361
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:38,079
you go about sourcing all of the rare

3362
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:39,920
genetics i know before you mentioned

3363
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,600
that it was through you know bags and

3364
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,440
whatnot but obviously some of the stuff

3365
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:45,760
you have access to which is really old

3366
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:47,839
doesn't come from a bag is it like a

3367
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:49,119
real oh it wasn't from bags it was like

3368
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,639
when it came like when i said in that

3369
01:47:49,118 --> 01:47:52,399
context

3370
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:53,600
yeah when the person would bring the

3371
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:56,238
packs over i'd be like where's the

3372
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,920
farmer at i want to meet the farmer ah

3373
01:47:56,238 --> 01:47:59,279
there you go if they if they want to

3374
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,880
introduce me to farmer i'd give them

3375
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:02,079
some [ __ ] fire ass seeds or a fire

3376
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,679
ass clone

3377
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:06,158
i was like dude introduce me farmer bro

3378
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,600
he's gonna want this clone yeah okay so

3379
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:09,839
just in general how do you go about

3380
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,440
procuring these more rare and obscure

3381
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:14,480
strains

3382
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:16,479
man all over you know sometimes you know

3383
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:19,279
some people will be talking to frenchie

3384
01:48:16,479 --> 01:48:21,599
you know i've met um

3385
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:22,559
you know really it happened it's always

3386
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,159
different

3387
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,560
you know back in the day

3388
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:29,039
um before before everything went legal

3389
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:31,280
it was really through when i was still

3390
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:33,600
you know when i was still really active

3391
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:35,198
you know uh doing other things is when i

3392
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,880
was really collecting the strains

3393
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:38,960
meeting farmers you know driving

3394
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:40,480
thousands of miles putting thousands of

3395
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:42,719
miles on my [ __ ] vehicle every week

3396
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:44,000
just to meet farmers uh making deals

3397
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:45,520
happening so i could find genetics but

3398
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,319
now now it's a lot different now it's a

3399
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:50,000
lot now it's the culture changed the the

3400
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:52,639
landscape change so we're getting our

3401
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,800
genetics from you know from you know

3402
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:56,079
just random people now like not random

3403
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,440
people but like people that we meet

3404
01:48:56,079 --> 01:48:59,198
through our network that we never would

3405
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:00,799
have thought would brought this you know

3406
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:02,638
we have to verify these genetics and

3407
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,320
grow them out and see if it's really

3408
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:06,000
what they say it's going to be

3409
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:07,920
but a lot of the times you know the

3410
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,118
hardest part about obtaining genetics is

3411
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,840
getting it from

3412
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:13,759
a rare source that's willing to share it

3413
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:16,079
the game's changed now where

3414
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,119
a lot of people really realize the value

3415
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:18,880
and their genetics so it's getting

3416
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:21,279
harder for a lot of breeders to to

3417
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:23,840
obtain you know new gear unless you're

3418
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:25,599
collabing with people or or you're

3419
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,119
straight up buying seeds and i've never

3420
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:30,400
been you know

3421
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:32,319
uh uh i've never been a huge like uh see

3422
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:34,000
seed collector in the sense where i i

3423
01:49:32,319 --> 01:49:35,920
collect other companies packs it was

3424
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,198
like i want the [ __ ] that comes in a

3425
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:39,520
ziploc bag

3426
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:41,039
you know that came from [ __ ] thailand

3427
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,800
you know or the stuff that we got from

3428
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,238
lebanon like the seeds we got from

3429
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,880
lebanon was

3430
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:48,479
uh we could congratulate professor q you

3431
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,400
know what i mean it was really hard to

3432
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:52,959
get those they were from they were late

3433
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:55,118
70s stocks that was just opened up a

3434
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:58,319
couple years ago and then um open

3435
01:49:55,118 --> 01:50:01,679
pollinated and so and that came directly

3436
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:03,439
from from from lebanon um uh and then we

3437
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:05,679
got that from came from lebanon then it

3438
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:07,198
ended up uh landing in spain where we

3439
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:09,118
were sifting it

3440
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:10,719
and so um i don't know how i [ __ ] got

3441
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:13,519
to spain but quinn calling one day and

3442
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:16,239
he was like dude i got the lebanese

3443
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:18,960
we were so happy you're [ __ ] so happy

3444
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:20,718
oh yeah but you know finding the strain

3445
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,000
is is the hardest part

3446
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:23,599
it's it's like when you look at a

3447
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,238
producer right when i was mentioning

3448
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:28,560
earlier that you know producer's job is

3449
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:30,718
you know um to create shape and shift

3450
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:33,039
the future music you know then

3451
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:34,560
i have to quote funk master flex was one

3452
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:36,319
who who says that

3453
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,039
that producers create shape and shift

3454
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:38,559
the

3455
01:50:37,039 --> 01:50:40,079
future music but also what these

3456
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,280
producers and djs do is they do

3457
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:42,319
something they have this culture of

3458
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:43,599
digging

3459
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:45,359
where they where they where they go

3460
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:47,279
through and they dig through records so

3461
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:50,079
they can find new sounds

3462
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:52,800
and where you uh where you obtain these

3463
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:54,238
new records in these new tracks and how

3464
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,239
you obtain them is always a [ __ ]

3465
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:57,598
secret to djs

3466
01:50:56,238 --> 01:50:59,118
you know a lot of people like back in

3467
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,800
the day you know

3468
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:02,319
you know [ __ ] always ask other

3469
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,279
producer dj hey were you getting these

3470
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:05,679
tracks for where you getting these

3471
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:07,679
samples from that's that's part of their

3472
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:09,679
that's part of their magic and how they

3473
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,840
acquired seeds you know like i've always

3474
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:13,199
just had a really

3475
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:15,679
you know that was kind of one of the

3476
01:51:13,198 --> 01:51:18,238
weird things i fell into i was just i i

3477
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,719
ended up getting really lucky at finding

3478
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,479
good genetics because because of

3479
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:24,239
business pipelines

3480
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:26,399
and so i just keep following those

3481
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:28,079
pipelines i just keep you know i keep

3482
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:30,000
you know networking with people

3483
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:31,039
and i share a lot of genetics too so

3484
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,279
it's like it's not like i'm just like

3485
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:35,039
look going out looking for [ __ ] i'm like

3486
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:36,880
you know i have a lot of things on my

3487
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:38,238
fault that i'm like hey you know what

3488
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,359
are you looking for is there anything

3489
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:41,039
you want

3490
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:42,960
and then you know i'll make that happen

3491
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:44,158
you know you know or to the best of my

3492
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:45,920
ability

3493
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,519
it's usually the the best that the best

3494
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,920
way we can get strains

3495
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:52,159
yeah for real yeah so you trade them you

3496
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:55,118
know do you feel like breeding with

3497
01:51:52,158 --> 01:51:57,679
heirloom or land race strains is able to

3498
01:51:55,118 --> 01:51:59,359
help you remove what we would maybe

3499
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:01,279
refer to as the ceiling or that

3500
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:03,039
inability to continue to get more and

3501
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:05,118
more high which doesn't seem to be

3502
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:06,639
occurring in like land race and heirloom

3503
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,799
varieties

3504
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,400
i don't know man it's it's really

3505
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,320
difficult breeding

3506
01:52:10,399 --> 01:52:14,000
land rice and heirloom varieties it

3507
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:14,840
sounds exotic until you're actually

3508
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,599
doing

3509
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:19,039
it you know and then you have to go out

3510
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,400
and you have to make the crosses and

3511
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:22,158
test it you know without these

3512
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:23,598
contemporary strains you could tell from

3513
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:25,519
the mother stock

3514
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:27,119
and what you select that you're going to

3515
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:29,040
have a good probability of getting

3516
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:31,359
something that's going to meet a certain

3517
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:33,519
level of expectation but when you're

3518
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:35,359
working with land race your selection

3519
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:37,199
has to be [ __ ] incredibly on point

3520
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:39,359
there's a lot of really garbage land

3521
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:41,678
race but there's a lot of really good

3522
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:43,279
stuff but it's really difficult to

3523
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:45,840
access

3524
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:47,679
and um so you know for me a lot of these

3525
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,360
really difficult ones to access that i

3526
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:51,039
was been searching for years was you

3527
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:54,158
know the the

3528
01:52:51,039 --> 01:52:56,399
the broadleaf burmese old-school burmese

3529
01:52:54,158 --> 01:52:57,920
the one that looks like og

3530
01:52:56,399 --> 01:52:59,759
you know i smoked it i smoked the

3531
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,920
burmese

3532
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,760
my first trip when i went to when i was

3533
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,359
i grew up in japan so i was 20. the

3534
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:06,880
first time i went to thailand i was like

3535
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:07,839
18.

3536
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,679
and

3537
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,880
my buddies came out it's like hey we

3538
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:12,560
were in the smoke weed at the time

3539
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:15,279
because wheat is expensive as [ __ ] in

3540
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:17,199
japan it was 70 bucks a gram and so we

3541
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:19,118
went to thailand you know it was just

3542
01:53:17,198 --> 01:53:20,319
like smoke heaven and i remember having

3543
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:22,639
a burmese

3544
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:24,399
that was rock [ __ ] hard

3545
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:25,920
and

3546
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:27,198
it was one of the craziest highs i've

3547
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,719
ever had so i've been kind of chasing

3548
01:53:27,198 --> 01:53:30,799
one of those strains it was really

3549
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:31,840
frosty it was like exceedingly frosty

3550
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,199
you know some of the weed we were

3551
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:35,440
getting in japan a lot of it was coming

3552
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:37,118
from mexico if it was coming in nug for

3553
01:53:35,439 --> 01:53:39,198
him or was getting smuggled in from from

3554
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:41,118
cali from from on the navy ships with

3555
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:42,000
the sailors and then they'd sell it to

3556
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:43,759
kids

3557
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,599
and um

3558
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,960
but when we went to thailand we were

3559
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:48,639
that was the first time i got to see

3560
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,399
like really good wheat i got really

3561
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:52,079
lucky it wasn't it wasn't hydraulically

3562
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:53,679
pressed or anything and so it was

3563
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:55,198
something like that that was the

3564
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:56,480
standard what i wanted to chase you know

3565
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:58,638
same thing with like in afghani like a

3566
01:53:56,479 --> 01:54:01,039
real afghani or like a like an

3567
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:02,239
incredible pakistani that has not just

3568
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:04,238
frost

3569
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:05,678
but a nose you know so you see a lot of

3570
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:07,919
these old hash fridays like they'll be

3571
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:09,840
crazy frosty but they won't really have

3572
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:11,279
like a definitive nose something that

3573
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,960
you can breed with that you're really

3574
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:15,118
certain that you're gonna get you know a

3575
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:17,359
new and exciting flavor from

3576
01:54:15,118 --> 01:54:18,238
you know so it's like it's really i've

3577
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:19,598
learned

3578
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:21,839
through trial and error that when you're

3579
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:23,840
breeding land races it's more of a

3580
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:25,039
long-term project and a lot of it's

3581
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,400
going to be more research and

3582
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:27,840
development and recording your

3583
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:31,118
observations because it's going to take

3584
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:32,719
some time to get that land race cross to

3585
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:33,920
express itself in a manner that's going

3586
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:35,760
to meet

3587
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,000
the expectations of what strains are

3588
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:40,400
doing these days you know with [ __ ] that

3589
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,479
[ __ ] you know symbiotic and see

3590
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:44,960
junkies releasing these crazy frosty

3591
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:46,959
profiles like that's the new standard so

3592
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:49,039
it's like if you want to breed with land

3593
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:52,158
race strains that historically don't

3594
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:53,760
have these exaggerated frost profiles

3595
01:54:52,158 --> 01:54:56,559
it's going to be more of a

3596
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,079
you know it's it's it you you better

3597
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:01,039
have a [ __ ] good direction you're

3598
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:03,118
going to go if you want to release that

3599
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:04,719
yeah so that's at least my two cents you

3600
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:06,479
know and there's people that work a lot

3601
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:08,560
of land races that have really good work

3602
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:10,879
you know there's ak bean brains

3603
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:14,320
um in the nature farm

3604
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:16,079
on ig these guys um are growing some

3605
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:18,719
crazy [ __ ] land races really rare

3606
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:20,238
[ __ ] and that's cool i think those guys

3607
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,319
might end up being some of the next big

3608
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:24,399
guys in the game i've been seeing some

3609
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:25,920
crazy phenotypes and collection coming

3610
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:28,000
out of their [ __ ] feeds that i'm just

3611
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:28,960
like how the [ __ ] did you get that you

3612
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,560
know i mean

3613
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,439
but it's like that's the magic you know

3614
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,039
what i mean

3615
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:34,719
how did you get that the fact is they

3616
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:36,960
got that and it's exotic and they're

3617
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:39,198
going to be able to flex crosses their

3618
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:41,520
land races that are going to hopefully

3619
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:43,198
prove themselves to be just as good if

3620
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,440
not better than a lot of these

3621
01:55:43,198 --> 01:55:47,759
contemporary polyhybrids we're seeing on

3622
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:49,118
the market

3623
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:51,360
of course

3624
01:55:49,118 --> 01:55:52,158
so something i realize i haven't asked

3625
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:53,759
you

3626
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:55,198
what type of cannabis is your personal

3627
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:58,079
favorite are you into stuff that's kind

3628
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:59,919
of like gonna hate more yeah

3629
01:55:58,079 --> 01:56:01,679
stimulate stuff i don't

3630
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:03,840
i mean i love gas like you know really

3631
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:06,079
my my first love is gas

3632
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:09,520
i have a really

3633
01:56:06,079 --> 01:56:11,198
i i've i i just i get gas plants i get

3634
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:13,280
along with them really well

3635
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:17,279
um as far as growing and smoking them

3636
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:18,079
but man my my love is haze man i love

3637
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:19,519
that

3638
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:20,800
crazy

3639
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,320
you know it looks like someone just

3640
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,079
plucked your third eye out and just

3641
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:25,840
threw it into outer space like that's

3642
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:27,679
what i want like the first time i smoked

3643
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:31,199
the c5 haze

3644
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:34,399
in spain was a crazy experience it was

3645
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:36,319
like a 16-week flower it didn't look it

3646
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:38,719
looked airy as [ __ ]

3647
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:40,000
it was pretty frosty it didn't really

3648
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:42,800
have

3649
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,679
a crazy unique nose that i can remember

3650
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:47,360
right now go oh it's this flavor

3651
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:50,158
i just remember the the high was so

3652
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:51,759
intense i don't remember the flavor bro

3653
01:56:50,158 --> 01:56:54,319
and i was sitting

3654
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:56,800
in this house and and great gardener

3655
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:57,920
says to smoke it it's just all the way

3656
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:00,239
up like what do you mean it's just

3657
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:01,679
straight up what the [ __ ] you mean smoke

3658
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:03,598
it straight up

3659
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:05,359
all right so i spoke it and literally it

3660
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:07,840
feels like someone grabs the side of

3661
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:10,079
your head and lifts you straight the

3662
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:12,239
[ __ ] up i haven't had such a visceral

3663
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:14,559
sativa high like that since i was a

3664
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:16,399
little kid in thailand and so it's like

3665
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:18,639
my favorite weeds are always going to be

3666
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:20,319
those old school sativas

3667
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:22,079
that kind of get hated on because they

3668
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:24,799
take a long time to flower out because

3669
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:26,079
to me it's about the high like you know

3670
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,760
like yeah everyone says oh this is

3671
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:30,559
medicine yeah it is [ __ ] medicine i

3672
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:33,119
got ptsd i use it medicinally but really

3673
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:35,199
like my form of medicine is getting to

3674
01:57:33,118 --> 01:57:37,598
this certain high

3675
01:57:35,198 --> 01:57:39,039
so i could i could interface life at a

3676
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:41,039
different frequency you know what i mean

3677
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:43,279
and so to me like

3678
01:57:41,039 --> 01:57:44,719
you know the haze height did that and

3679
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:46,719
i'll be real too

3680
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:48,880
with the other straight i love smoking

3681
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:50,960
that [ __ ] love because the high just

3682
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:52,480
makes sense to me skittles

3683
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:54,800
you know what i'm saying some people

3684
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:57,919
either hate that [ __ ] or they love it so

3685
01:57:54,800 --> 01:58:00,079
it brought me a similar happy heady high

3686
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:01,840
that i get when i smoke a lot of the you

3687
01:58:00,079 --> 01:58:04,719
know the old school and the contemporary

3688
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:07,520
hazes you find in in europe nowadays

3689
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:09,359
you know so um i just i don't like being

3690
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:11,360
really stoned and sleepy because i'm

3691
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:13,519
busy as [ __ ] all day so i like something

3692
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:14,559
that's going to you know really pick me

3693
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,400
up

3694
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,560
and uh get me going you know almost like

3695
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:20,238
like a proper sour diesel

3696
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:22,639
you know where you could you're

3697
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:24,638
noticeably high but you're not impaired

3698
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:27,039
to the point where it's gonna it's gonna

3699
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:30,319
inhibit you know productivity

3700
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:32,000
yeah so on that note of gassy

3701
01:58:30,319 --> 01:58:34,079
we've mentioned it earlier the chem

3702
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,399
special reserve it's one of the popular

3703
01:58:34,079 --> 01:58:38,399
ones i hear about people from people all

3704
01:58:36,399 --> 01:58:39,679
the time from you guys do you plan to

3705
01:58:38,399 --> 01:58:41,679
bring it back and work with it and

3706
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:43,760
broadly speaking will you ever rework

3707
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:46,239
any projects again

3708
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:48,880
yeah we're in the middle of reworking

3709
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:49,678
the white cashmere

3710
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,679
so

3711
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:53,920
um those packs

3712
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:56,079
yeah those oh no it was yeah those packs

3713
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:57,760
coupled with the last like 30 to 50

3714
01:58:56,079 --> 01:58:59,920
seeds we had we went for broke like we

3715
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:01,599
never pop everything we popped

3716
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:03,760
everything this year

3717
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:05,440
so we got we got males in clone form we

3718
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:09,280
saved all the females we got tons of

3719
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:11,039
pawns stocked up but um it depends on

3720
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:13,198
on how good the strain is you know you

3721
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:14,960
know we would really be doing

3722
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:17,678
a lot of our clients

3723
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:19,920
a disservice if we were to release this

3724
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:22,239
to do a re-release of the strain or to

3725
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:24,319
rework it it kind of takes from away

3726
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:25,439
from the allure and the prestige of why

3727
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:26,319
they bought it in the first [ __ ]

3728
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:27,759
place

3729
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:29,920
um unless

3730
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:31,599
it was one of those strains where

3731
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,880
because a lot of the times in the first

3732
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:34,480
three years

3733
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,239
these strains didn't get saved they were

3734
01:59:34,479 --> 01:59:37,678
literally grown as big-ass outdoor

3735
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:39,598
plants and the packs were moved back

3736
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,440
east that i mean that's just was the

3737
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:42,560
culture at humboldt and mendo at the

3738
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:43,598
time you know

3739
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:45,599
so

3740
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:47,119
um you know under certain circumstances

3741
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:48,159
like that like the white cashmere was

3742
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:49,759
one of those where a lot of people

3743
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:51,920
really didn't save a cut it kind of

3744
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:54,079
disappeared and if we have enough

3745
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:56,079
evidence that it's disappeared

3746
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:57,198
we'll [ __ ] we'll do a re-release you

3747
01:59:56,079 --> 01:59:59,599
know what i mean we'll do an encore

3748
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:01,759
release but we've never

3749
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:03,360
purposely opened up a strain and then

3750
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:05,039
reworked it and released it probably the

3751
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:07,279
only one we've done that with was like

3752
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:09,039
you know the royal lions because every

3753
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:11,359
generation was different from like when

3754
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:13,279
we when i got it as the royal cr7 then

3755
02:00:11,359 --> 02:00:15,198
we brought it into eight and nine every

3756
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:17,118
generation was [ __ ] different like

3757
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:19,678
now we have it in twelve

3758
02:00:17,118 --> 02:00:21,839
you know we have it as like magnum 12.

3759
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:24,239
and so like and it's completely

3760
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:25,920
different every generation just like

3761
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:27,198
you know there's something unique in

3762
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:29,039
everything so

3763
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:31,678
when we go back and we open things up

3764
02:00:29,039 --> 02:00:33,760
it's if only if we could find

3765
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:35,920
an entirely new direction

3766
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,800
then it becomes a new thing

3767
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:38,880
yeah

3768
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:40,400
so that's actually a question we got

3769
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:42,719
asked a lot about as well

3770
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:44,719
what was your journey with mandelbrot's

3771
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:47,520
royal and how did it go from being you

3772
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:51,599
know the the royals sorry six to the

3773
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:51,599
long valley to kind of where it is now

3774
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:56,239
so um

3775
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:57,519
i met andelbrot through kevin in in

3776
02:00:56,238 --> 02:01:00,000
shiloh

3777
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:01,920
uh at the emerald cup in 2013.

3778
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,359
we won in 2012

3779
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,520
and then i got fourth place with the

3780
02:01:03,359 --> 02:01:07,439
royal

3781
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:10,639
and i remember

3782
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:12,319
on the bree on the card it said

3783
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:13,440
who's the breeder or who bred it i think

3784
02:01:12,319 --> 02:01:16,319
there was a thing i was like i remember

3785
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:17,598
writing i don't [ __ ] know

3786
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:18,479
i wanted to

3787
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:19,599
and

3788
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:21,198
because i always heard about him i

3789
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:22,800
didn't know his name was man lebron i

3790
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:23,759
always heard about the guy that bred the

3791
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:27,119
truth

3792
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:28,480
the guy that bred the uh the royal cush

3793
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:30,158
because these are the stain these are

3794
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:32,399
the strains that were going back east

3795

and

3811
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:05,039

02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:13,359
the truth and so that was like this

3817
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:15,840
whole story and you know that was just

3818
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:17,759
you know and that was the story you know

3819
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:18,800
[ __ ] were also talking about

3820
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:20,880
when

3821
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:22,880
the truth seeds were in mendo the truth

3822
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,880
seeds were the first [ __ ] seeds i

3823
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:26,000
ever heard that were eighty dollars a

3824
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:28,159
seed

3825
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,920
like they went for eighty dollars a pack

3826
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:32,000
but my our partner sean at the time

3827
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:33,520
who's no longer with us bless your soul

3828
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,719
you know he passed away from cancer he

3829
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:36,719
was one of the guys that came up to

3830
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:38,960
mendo in my first years

3831
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:41,760
um he came into the [ __ ] house after

3832
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,960
going to uh a club in in san francisco

3833
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,239
and he was like you would have [ __ ]

3834
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:45,599
believed this because he was a seed

3835
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:47,198
collector too that was our thing we

3836
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:48,880
collect clones we'd collect seeds we'd

3837
02:02:47,198 --> 02:02:51,359
go to any club we could find clones and

3838
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:52,800
seeds and just and go shopping

3839
02:02:51,359 --> 02:02:54,238
and um

3840
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,920
he came back with these [ __ ] truth

3841
02:02:54,238 --> 02:02:57,919
seeds he was like and he and he didn't

3842
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:59,679
pop them he was like bro i paid 80 bucks

3843
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,039
a seed for these

3844
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:03,440
i was like bro how many caesar in there

3845
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:04,960
he's like 10. he's like it's it's like

3846
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:06,638
some of the best flour you've ever

3847
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,960
smoked and he had some samples of flour

3848
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:11,118
it was [ __ ] crazy

3849
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:12,800
that was probably like 2010

3850
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:15,039
when when i saw those seeds and then

3851
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:17,199
fast forward to like 2013 when i won the

3852
02:03:15,039 --> 02:03:18,800
cup i didn't know who had bred the royal

3853
02:03:17,198 --> 02:03:19,759
coast so

3854
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:22,239
um

3855
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:23,520
i didn't claim that i've read it so

3856
02:03:22,238 --> 02:03:25,279
mandelbrock

3857
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,360
shiloh comes up to the booth

3858
02:03:25,279 --> 02:03:30,319

3859
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:32,399
um shadows with this [ __ ] big dude

3860
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:34,319
and he was like hey this is mandelbrot

3861
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:36,879
he bred the royal cush

3862
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:38,639
and and i was like holy [ __ ] because

3863
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:43,199
when i went to go find the seeds of the

3864
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:44,880
wild kush they were they were at this um

3865
02:03:43,198 --> 02:03:45,839

3866
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:49,199
lovin

3867
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:51,119
lovin it at a dispensary in mendocino

3868
02:03:49,198 --> 02:03:52,719
and it was the only dispensary in the

3869
02:03:51,118 --> 02:03:54,960
entire state of california that had

3870
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:56,480
[ __ ] emerald mountain seeds and they

3871
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,679
were all the original seats they were

3872
02:03:56,479 --> 02:03:58,879
all the original release seats i

3873
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,399
remember buying

3874
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:03,440
tons of packs

3875
02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:04,879
and we selected the the winning royal

3876
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:07,519
sauer out of that that's how the royal

3877
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:09,520
sour name came about it was a pheno

3878
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:12,400
from the royal coast seven packs that

3879
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:14,639
was hella sour d dominant it was long

3880
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:16,078
long lanky spaghetti noodle stems and

3881
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:18,639
anybody that grows royal knows it's like

3882
02:04:16,078 --> 02:04:20,479
a [ __ ] pine tree it's short stop fat

3883
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:22,880
you know grows like a christmas tree but

3884
02:04:20,479 --> 02:04:25,198
this one was like a sour and so that was

3885
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:27,760
the one we entered and i remembered the

3886
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:30,238
seeds were old and they had really bad

3887
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:32,159
germ rates on them and then after i met

3888
02:04:30,238 --> 02:04:33,759
uh mandelbrot he was like yeah dude

3889
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:35,279
those are the original you know seeds

3890
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,400
those original royal cause seventies i

3891
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:38,639
made

3892
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:40,879
i was like holy [ __ ] and so i remember

3893
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:42,880
after that you know we became you know

3894
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:44,880
he we became friends and you know he

3895
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,719
sold me several hundred seeds of you

3896
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:48,639
know the truth the original truth which

3897
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:50,480
i you know some of them i still have

3898
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:52,480
and the royals

3899
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:54,399
and so my goal was like

3900
02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:56,479
i was like look man i'm making this

3901
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:59,039
royal and it's it's

3902
02:04:56,479 --> 02:05:01,839
it's i want to acclimatize it

3903
02:04:59,039 --> 02:05:03,599
to the mendo environment

3904
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,360
you know because what we were doing is

3905
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:08,159
you know the royal cush was really

3906
02:05:05,359 --> 02:05:10,960
unique was you'd get a [ __ ] nice

3907
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:14,879
you know huge [ __ ] crazy frosty plant

3908
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:17,198
that had gas but no powdery no mold

3909
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:19,440
you know and laytonville is a really

3910
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:22,000
unique environment as far as mendocino

3911
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:24,719
is concerned it's not as dry as places

3912
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,960
like like boonville it's not as dry as

3913
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:27,920
places in you know uh east willets like

3914
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:29,118
in hearst

3915
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,359
you know laytonville definitely has a

3916
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:34,000
lot more coastal influence

3917
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:36,319
a little more fog so the whole goal of

3918
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,760
doing the long valley royal kush was to

3919
02:05:36,319 --> 02:05:41,198
select a royal cushrum seed that was

3920
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:43,920
relatively

3921
02:05:41,198 --> 02:05:45,598
consistent if anybody remembers popping

3922
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,880
the original royal crisp

3923
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:49,840
seven seeds

3924
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,039
from brat every single female was was

3925
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:52,800
crazy different

3926
02:05:51,039 --> 02:05:54,639
like not in a bad way everything was

3927
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:56,320
[ __ ] fire

3928
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:57,760
but you know some would be long some

3929
02:05:56,319 --> 02:05:59,279
would be short some would be purple

3930
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,639
someone would have gas some wouldn't

3931
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:03,599
have gas

3932
02:06:00,639 --> 02:06:06,078
and so we wanted to get a strain that i

3933
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:08,239
selected the sour deep dominant male and

3934
02:06:06,078 --> 02:06:10,238
the sourdy dominant female

3935
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:11,919
um so because we felt that the sour d

3936
02:06:10,238 --> 02:06:14,718
tendency sourdy did really well in

3937
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:16,560
leightonville it was uh old faithful you

3938
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:17,840
could grow a ton of it it wouldn't have

3939
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:19,920
a lot of powdery wouldn't have a lot of

3940
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:22,960
botrytis and you could get it to market

3941
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,960
so you know just from that observation i

3942
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:27,679
wanted to select you know more of these

3943
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:29,679
smaller leaves noodly branches it was

3944
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:31,599
traits that were definitive to that and

3945
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:33,840
you know and then when i started working

3946
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:34,639
as lines more that when mandelbrot sold

3947
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,599
me

3948
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:39,359
um those original seeds that was you

3949
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:41,119
know that was where we really made the

3950
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:42,479
[ __ ] royal christian and he helped me

3951
02:06:41,118 --> 02:06:44,639
select

3952
02:06:42,479 --> 02:06:46,319
and you know um

3953
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:49,039
you know i was giving him plants up up

3954
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:49,920
until you know when he passed away 2015

3955
02:06:49,039 --> 02:06:51,679
you know

3956
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:53,679
it was [ __ ] up you know i gave him

3957
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:55,599
actually gave him the last of my plants

3958
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:57,118
in my greenhouse because he had a

3959
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:58,400
problem on his farms a bunch of his

3960
02:06:57,118 --> 02:07:00,319
plants died and

3961
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:02,078
i remember you know i was still with

3962
02:07:00,319 --> 02:07:03,359

3964
02:07:03,359 --> 02:07:07,118
gave him like a few hundred of our

3965
02:07:05,359 --> 02:07:08,799
plants that we had left

3966
02:07:07,118 --> 02:07:10,158

and so he sent my first um like real ag

3992
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:58,639
account up at a ag wholesaler and at the

3993
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,639
time i was super into soil science i was

3994
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:02,560
super into compost

3995
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:04,560
um i have just previously worked with

3996
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:06,719
alan atkinson from grokashi who was

3997
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:08,239
doing probiotic farmers alliance

3998
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:10,319
and so that was something that we really

3999
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:12,879
connected on command lebron

4000
02:08:10,319 --> 02:08:15,359
was doing emerald mountain organics

4001
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:17,760
he was formulating soil for people he

4002
02:08:15,359 --> 02:08:19,759
was actually mixing his own nutrients he

4003
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:21,360
was buying he was getting bio-link

4004
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:24,000
nutrients and he was mixing him and

4005
02:08:21,359 --> 02:08:25,439
having ag unlimited do custom mixes for

4006
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,719
him and then he would find his own

4007
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:29,118
inputs around

4008
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:31,359
so like really my regimen

4009
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:32,719
i gave to my plants it's like i won the

4010
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:35,519
cup

4011
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:38,078
through the regimen i built with you

4012
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:39,199
know that i learned from mike and that i

4013
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:42,078
helped you know it's like because the

4014
02:08:39,198 --> 02:08:44,879
cup soil recipe was jointly created by

4015
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:47,198
um by by lady elle and i you know her

4016
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:49,679
cousin crazy larry had this crazy fire

4017
02:08:47,198 --> 02:08:51,198
so makes me use that and then i was you

4018
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:54,000
know i did all the the top end

4019
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:55,279
fertilization and the gene selection but

4020
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,960
when it came to

4021
02:08:55,279 --> 02:08:58,960
fertilizing that mandelbrot had an

4022
02:08:56,960 --> 02:09:00,880
incredible talent for that and that's

4023
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,719
where we really bonded on you know what

4024
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:06,159
i mean and

4025
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:07,599
i remember we would be at ariel 101 with

4026
02:09:06,158 --> 02:09:09,279
emerald cup tim

4027
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:11,360
and at the time there was man i was

4028
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:13,198
there man lebron was there i think casey

4029
02:09:11,359 --> 02:09:16,000
o'neil might have been there

4030
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:18,399
um but this guy named this phd plant

4031
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:22,078
pathologist named chuck schiller who

4032
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:24,719
invented the the micronized 1200

4033
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:26,479
uh the 1200 soybean powder that a lot of

4034
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:28,480
people are using as a foliar that's

4035
02:09:26,479 --> 02:09:29,439
[ __ ] crazy he invented that

4036
02:09:28,479 --> 02:09:31,439
and

4037
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:33,118
you know he was kind of like him and han

4038
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:36,238
a lot of us growers

4039
02:09:33,118 --> 02:09:38,158
but he was genuinely blown the [ __ ] away

4040
02:09:36,238 --> 02:09:41,198
by mandelbrot's knowledge

4041
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:43,039
of soil sciences and in general botany

4042
02:09:41,198 --> 02:09:45,678
and horticulture he was blown the [ __ ]

4043
02:09:43,039 --> 02:09:46,639
away this guy's knowledgeable so

4044
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:47,920
um

4045
02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:50,000
you know and i think that was probably

4046
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:50,960
like a year before you know he passed

4047
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,039
away

4048
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:54,639
those was when you know they called us

4049
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:56,800
in you know the whole the whole thing it

4050
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:58,960
was is chuck schiller was working for

4051
02:09:56,800 --> 02:10:01,440
grower's secret at the time and growers

4052
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:05,039
was like well we're trying to formulate

4053
02:10:01,439 --> 02:10:06,879
the best you know bloom formula possible

4054
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:08,319
you know and so like you know me and

4055
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,760
amanda about we were really geeking out

4056
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:11,679
on that because we had a beef with bio

4057
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:13,360
links you know phosphorus you know

4058
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,880
because their phosphorus was great they

4059
02:10:13,359 --> 02:10:16,880
had this great phosphorus nutrient but

4060
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:18,880
it was a colloidal phosphate suspension

4061
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:21,118
so basically it was just [ __ ] water

4062
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:23,440
and soft rock phosphate right so there

4063
02:10:21,118 --> 02:10:26,000
was you know and so what we wanted was

4064
02:10:23,439 --> 02:10:27,839
we wanted something kind of like what a

4065
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,760
biochanner had but they had an exclusive

4066
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:32,319
license on it was like this colloidal

4067
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:33,920
phosphate based phosphorus bloom formula

4068
02:10:32,319 --> 02:10:35,599
but that didn't have any sediment that

4069
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:37,118
you could run through a drip line you

4070
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:38,000
know because mandelbrot was really big

4071
02:10:37,118 --> 02:10:39,598
on

4072
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,359
all right i want to breed these genetics

4073
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:43,599
but also want to create the soil and the

4074
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:45,118
nutrient you know nutrient regimen for

4075
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:46,960
it but i also want it to be scalable and

4076
02:10:45,118 --> 02:10:47,920
i want it to be universal so anybody can

4077
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:49,599
use it

4078
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:51,520
and so it's like

4079
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:53,920
really working with mandelbrot goes way

4080
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,679
past the genetics the dude taught me so

4081
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:58,000
much about [ __ ] in general you know

4082
02:10:55,679 --> 02:11:01,760
general nutrients i still have a a file

4083
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,679
box full of like the old catalogs from

4084
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,920
emerald mountain organics of what what

4085
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:07,920
what the soil mixes man lebron would

4086
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:10,639
make for people and the different

4087
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:13,520
regimens like he had a 32 part you know

4088
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:15,118
18 part liquid uh

4089
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:16,560
organic liquid regiment and it wasn't

4090
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:19,039
for feeding the plant it was for feeding

4091
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:20,560
the soil like he was onto some next

4092
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:21,840
level [ __ ] man lebron was the first

4093
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:24,800
person

4094
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:26,639
using a calcium magnesium

4095
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:29,840
using a cow mag that was completely

4096
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:32,159
organic it was all from mined car uh

4097
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:34,560
magnesium carbonate and calcium

4098
02:11:32,158 --> 02:11:36,158
carbonate and this company

4099
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:38,560
that was working with spinach farmers

4100
02:11:36,158 --> 02:11:40,158
back in late 90s they found out that

4101
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:41,520
they could take this calcium carbonate

4102
02:11:40,158 --> 02:11:43,039
and this magnesium carbonate they could

4103
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:46,560
put in a vat

4104
02:11:43,039 --> 02:11:49,198
of of what's called dextrolactic acid

4105
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:51,039
dextrolactic acid and it's a it's it's a

4106
02:11:49,198 --> 02:11:52,158
different salt it's a different sugar

4107
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:54,319
based

4108
02:11:52,158 --> 02:11:56,559
or sugar i think i'm saying the right

4109
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:58,799
thing sugar based lactic acid but what

4110
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:00,800
it does is it it attaches a sugar

4111
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,560
molecule to the calcium and the

4112
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,960
magnesium components and the magnesium

4113
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:06,880
calcium carbonate and allows it to just

4114
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:09,599
hang out in the soil

4115
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:11,920
as as an amino acid based calcium

4116
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:13,279
magnesium you know so what was crazy

4117
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:15,520
about this is like whenever you

4118
02:12:13,279 --> 02:12:19,359
generally feed cal mag to a plant it's

4119
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:21,360
chelated with with with with um edta

4120
02:12:19,359 --> 02:12:22,960
which is a chemical salt chelating agent

4121
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:24,639
and it gets directly absorbed by the

4122
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:26,960
roots but what mandelbrot was doing he

4123
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:29,440
was like [ __ ] how do i how do i increase

4124
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:32,000
the mobile availability of calcium and

4125
02:12:29,439 --> 02:12:34,638
magnesium like so we know that magnesium

4126
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,399
is mobile in soil but calcium is it

4127
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:38,000
but with through but but through doing

4128
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:40,479
his [ __ ] homework he was the first

4129
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,880
person to use cal magdl

4130
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:44,879
on crops on like cannabis crops like

4131
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:46,480
this and that was like you know like

4132
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:49,359
when when he taught me these things and

4133
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:50,799
i switched to using his inputs man my

4134
02:12:49,359 --> 02:12:52,479
[ __ ] soil went through the roof i

4135
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,239
remember the first time dirty business

4136
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:56,799
soil came online and i was actually able

4137
02:12:54,238 --> 02:12:58,399
to see what my cat ion exchange capacity

4138
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:00,079
is and what people understand they're

4139
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:02,158
listing what a cation exchange capacity

4140
02:13:00,078 --> 02:13:05,118
is it's basically a number that

4141
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:07,039
indicates um the rate of how uh how

4142
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:08,799
available nutrients are in your soil and

4143
02:13:07,039 --> 02:13:09,760
the breakdown of nature into your soil

4144
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:11,840
so

4145
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:13,599
um i was getting way higher numbers like

4146
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:15,760
with the soil that was using

4147
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:17,440
mandelbrot's inputs versus the soils

4148
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:19,360
that weren't you know so it's like

4149
02:13:17,439 --> 02:13:20,238
it goes way more than genetics how i

4150
02:13:19,359 --> 02:13:24,238
grow

4151
02:13:20,238 --> 02:13:24,238
completely changed because of him

4152
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:29,679
yeah for real as well there's a lot to

4153
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:30,880
take in i'm trying to think i'm trying

4154
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:33,440
to think about a lot of people don't

4155
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:35,520
know the story you know it was a it was

4156
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:37,039
a really it was something that it was

4157
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:38,320
always it was street business back in

4158
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:40,158
the day you know

4159
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:42,000
so it was that was something that you

4160
02:13:40,158 --> 02:13:43,839
know no matter what even though that

4161
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,760
there was drama between man lebron's

4162
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:47,599
brother and i back in the day it was

4163
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:49,520
something that you know it wasn't my

4164
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:51,520
business to share like it wasn't it

4165
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:53,360
wasn't me it's like people were doubting

4166
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:54,960
that when i worked with man lebron it

4167
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:56,399
wasn't up for me to reinforce that like

4168
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:57,520
i knew what the [ __ ] i don't remember

4169
02:13:56,399 --> 02:13:58,799
the right people don't know what that

4170
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:00,000
meant brought

4171
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:02,079
you know what i mean

4172
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,520
i was sitting with him in an area 101

4173
02:14:02,078 --> 02:14:04,719
helping formulate [ __ ] bloom

4174
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:06,320
nutrients with chuck schiller from

4175
02:14:04,719 --> 02:14:07,359
grower's secrets chuck shirley remembers

4176
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:08,799
that [ __ ]

4177
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:11,519
and so it's like

4178
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:12,880
it's a it was like a

4179
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,239
it was a it was a bittersweet you know

4180
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:16,400
because i had some drama with with his

4181
02:14:14,238 --> 02:14:18,319
family back you know like two years ago

4182
02:14:16,399 --> 02:14:20,319
and it was a really hard thing to deal

4183
02:14:18,319 --> 02:14:22,399
with you know because i had never met

4184
02:14:20,319 --> 02:14:24,238
his family we had us we had a strictly

4185
02:14:22,399 --> 02:14:25,679
it was old-school relationship you know

4186
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:26,479
what i'm saying we were based on the

4187
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:28,000
hustle

4188
02:14:26,479 --> 02:14:30,000
it's like you know

4189
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,118
people that usually are [ __ ] doing

4190
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,960
deals together you're not going to

4191
02:14:31,118 --> 02:14:34,880
family barbecues together you know what

4192
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,880
i'm saying

4193
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:38,319
unless you guys grew up together you

4194
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:39,760
know and i'm a transplant you know i

4195
02:14:38,319 --> 02:14:41,198
mean so

4196
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:42,239
i really didn't get to meet most of many

4197
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:44,238
rock's family until i feel like he

4198
02:14:42,238 --> 02:14:45,118
really passed away

4199
02:14:44,238 --> 02:14:47,359
yeah

4200
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:49,359
that's unfortunate to hear

4201
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:50,639
yeah he was like he was probably you

4202
02:14:49,359 --> 02:14:53,439
know he's i

4203
02:14:50,639 --> 02:14:55,199
the whole point of working his lines

4204
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:57,678
especially after he passed away was was

4205
02:14:55,198 --> 02:14:58,879
so his memory wouldn't die

4206
02:14:57,679 --> 02:15:00,399
it was that

4207
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:01,840
a lot of people

4208
02:15:00,399 --> 02:15:03,679
you know me and mandela would talk about

4209
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:05,119
this thing about the great breeders that

4210
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:07,359
would breed something

4211
02:15:05,118 --> 02:15:09,439
and their [ __ ] got raided by the cops

4212
02:15:07,359 --> 02:15:11,118
or they got killed you know and no one's

4213
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:13,678
ever going to hear that story

4214
02:15:11,118 --> 02:15:14,880
and and and and that shit's in and those

4215
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:16,800
genetics

4216
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:18,880
are are are forever going to be extinct

4217
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:20,719
you know so it was about

4218
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:23,920
you know i felt that this guy was like

4219
02:15:20,719 --> 02:15:24,960
the father of the contemporary you know

4220
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:28,158
of what

4221
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:30,960
he made breeding fuel possible

4222
02:15:28,158 --> 02:15:33,198
for a larder for a larger audience that

4223
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:36,000
didn't have access to things like chem

4224
02:15:33,198 --> 02:15:38,238
dog or or og bat cross seats you know to

4225
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,359
get these kind of crazy real profiles

4226
02:15:38,238 --> 02:15:41,598
you know so

4227
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:44,158
i did i you know it was like i'd be

4228
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:46,800
damned if if if [ __ ] forgot

4229
02:15:44,158 --> 02:15:48,960
about him you know what i mean but now

4230
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:51,119
his memory lives on through

4231
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:52,960
you know numerous farms and ben still

4232
02:15:51,118 --> 02:15:54,559
can you know ben still continuing you

4233
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:56,399
know his brother's work

4234
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:57,440
and so like that's the beautiful thing

4235
02:15:56,399 --> 02:15:58,638
you know what i mean

4236
02:15:57,439 --> 02:16:00,078
so

4237
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:02,960
yeah for sure

4238
02:16:00,078 --> 02:16:06,319
so what type of legacy do you want to

4239
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:10,000
leave on the industry from aficionado

4240
02:16:06,319 --> 02:16:10,000
i just want i want to build something

4241
02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:14,960
i want to build a company that stand the

4242
02:16:12,319 --> 02:16:14,960
test of time

4243
02:16:15,118 --> 02:16:18,799
you know and i think it's about

4244
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:20,319
you know finding finding different

4245
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:21,199
talents that could help you take this

4246
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:22,559
vision

4247
02:16:21,198 --> 02:16:24,000
and take it somewhere you know what i

4248
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:26,000

4249
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,238
like you look at like i i studied a lot

4250
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,158

4251
02:16:28,238 --> 02:16:33,039

4255
02:16:36,638 --> 02:16:40,318
always

4256
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:42,000
been fascinated by how a lot of these

4257
02:16:40,318 --> 02:16:43,519
luxury companies were built a lot of how

4258
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,679
these fashion companies are built so you

4259
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:47,439
look at you know long after christian

4260
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:49,760
dior passed away he had this guy named

4261
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:51,599
john gagliano you know being his

4262
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:53,439
creative designer you know so you could

4263
02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:55,280
have like you know after

4264
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:57,359
if if the brand's good enough and it

4265
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:58,559
could live it could continue to live on

4266
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:00,559
it's still going to need some sort of

4267
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:02,398
creative director to carry that

4268
02:17:00,558 --> 02:17:04,079
legacy i don't want to just

4269
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:06,318
sell aficionados and i want to do this

4270
02:17:04,079 --> 02:17:07,920
for the rest of my life i want i want i

4271
02:17:06,318 --> 02:17:11,359
want my grandkids

4272
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:13,760
to to be able to to sit at the board of

4273
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:15,760
aficionados table and work with whoever

4274
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:17,920
they choose to be the creative director

4275
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:19,679
or whoever is good enough to breathe you

4276
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,120
know what i mean so it's like with you

4277
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:22,719
know you saint laurent that's where

4278
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:25,120
that's how tom ford was the creative

4279
02:17:22,718 --> 02:17:27,039
director of yves saint laurent and gucci

4280
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:28,719
and all these companies were started by

4281
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,559
a guy named [ __ ] east st laurent and

4282
02:17:28,718 --> 02:17:33,279
a guy whose last name was gucci

4283
02:17:30,558 --> 02:17:35,199
and so like my my vision was like i mean

4284
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:36,719
if we if i could really

4285
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:38,880
if there's a possibility we could build

4286
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:41,598
something to stand the test of time

4287
02:17:38,879 --> 02:17:44,079
that will still be here after we die

4288
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:45,679
what's needed to make that happen

4289
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:47,200
you know so i guess we're exploring that

4290
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:48,879
right now and i know french is exploring

4291
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:51,519
that right now you know because

4292
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:53,920
frenchie's building is is a brand

4293
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:56,000
that that we want to to stand the test

4294
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,920
of time too you know jack daniels isn't

4295
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,519
going to make the whiskey forever but

4296
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:00,638
he's going to continue to spend the test

4297
02:17:59,519 --> 02:18:01,840
of time

4298
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:03,438
and so

4299
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:06,000
it's really early in the industry and

4300
02:18:03,439 --> 02:18:08,000
it's getting only time in the market and

4301
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,920
consistency is going to decide

4302
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,120
who reaches that level first you know

4303
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:13,040
because i don't think anyone's reached

4304
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:14,960
that level yet but i think it's worth

4305
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:17,040
trying

4306
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:19,598
yeah i totally agree so i mean if we're

4307
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:21,280
talking means to an end there what are

4308
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:23,040
you gonna release next what can people

4309
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:25,120
look forward to next and tell us what

4310
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:26,479
you're going to have at emerald

4311
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:30,319
so we're

4312
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:32,000
so uh emerald mountain emerald cup

4313
02:18:30,318 --> 02:18:33,920
our distributor seeds here now is going

4314
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
to be representing a fishnet cup i'll be

4315
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:38,079
doing some appearances there but due to

4316
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,519
regulation we weren't able to get all

4317
02:18:38,079 --> 02:18:41,200
the right permits in time for the

4318
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:43,120
emerald cup this year so james is going

4319
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:45,439
to handle the launch for us

4320
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:47,439
we're also going to be doing an online

4321
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:49,519
uh pre-sale we've never done

4322
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:51,040
a launch online for the emerald cup it's

4323
02:18:49,519 --> 02:18:53,359
always that people have always had to

4324
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:56,000
wait after the emerald cup for things to

4325
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:58,000
be available on seeds here now so

4326
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,040
what we're doing something different is

4327
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,638
since

4328
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:02,960
our market has

4329
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:04,718
magically grown global over the last two

4330
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:07,518
years we're going to offer you know

4331
02:19:04,718 --> 02:19:09,358
special online pre-emeral cup release

4332
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:11,120
so people that are fans and have always

4333
02:19:09,359 --> 02:19:13,280
supported us they could you know they

4334
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:15,120
have the opportunity to cop what's going

4335
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,359
to be at the emerald cup too everybody

4336
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:18,800
has the opportunity to cop it now but

4337
02:19:17,359 --> 02:19:21,120
there's not going to be a lot you know

4338
02:19:18,799 --> 02:19:22,879
we we we we did a 2000 plant sniff this

4339
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:24,399
year we worked a lot of strains that we

4340
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:26,558
worked last year

4341
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:28,159
we ended up only keeping 80 plants out

4342
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:31,358
of the 2000

4343
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:33,679
and we only pollinated 13

4344
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:35,040
13 plants different we used

4345
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:36,079
some different males on some different

4346
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,840
plants

4347
02:19:36,079 --> 02:19:39,359
but our production like that's what we

4348
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:41,760
made and so five

4349
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:43,519
five to five of those 13 will probably

4350
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:45,599
make it the fruit tartar turned out

4351
02:19:43,519 --> 02:19:46,880
really good the forbidden fruit right in

4352
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:48,558
the pines

4353
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:51,438
across forbidden fruit magnum opus that

4354
02:19:48,558 --> 02:19:54,719
turned out hella good oh releasing that

4355
02:19:51,439 --> 02:19:58,079
we released six boxes of the f1 of

4356
02:19:54,719 --> 02:19:59,679
formula one um and those auctioned for

4357
02:19:58,079 --> 02:20:01,520
obscene amounts of money we never

4358
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:02,960
thought they would auction for so much

4359
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:05,200
i guess the fact that they had there was

4360
02:20:02,959 --> 02:20:06,239
only six boxes we used some good [ __ ] on

4361
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:08,399
them too

4362
02:20:06,239 --> 02:20:10,159
um it went for huge price but we wanted

4363
02:20:08,398 --> 02:20:12,478
people we liked it so much it was like

4364
02:20:10,159 --> 02:20:14,000
man there just can't be six people with

4365
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:16,478
[ __ ] boxes of formula one so we're

4366
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,799
gonna release f2 and we're pretty happy

4367
02:20:16,478 --> 02:20:20,719
with how the f2 you know how the f2 is

4368
02:20:18,799 --> 02:20:22,559
turning out and we're really excited

4369
02:20:20,719 --> 02:20:23,599
about how the f1 turned out in general

4370
02:20:22,559 --> 02:20:26,079
so

4371
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,159
um we have the sichuan flambe which is

4372
02:20:26,079 --> 02:20:29,600
the sangria times cherry noir times

4373
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:31,280
testarossa

4374
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:33,200
that's the one that we're really excited

4375
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,520
about and

4376
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:37,600
we have a few that still waiting to be

4377
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:40,560
named we just can't find

4378
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:42,239
the perfect name for him but uh

4379
02:20:40,559 --> 02:20:44,559
were we going to be releasing an og

4380
02:20:42,239 --> 02:20:46,719
cross this year i did a collab with the

4381
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:48,478
guy who brought me up to mendo's name is

4382
02:20:46,719 --> 02:20:51,760
mendocino mike

4383
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:53,519
and we bred his he has this og called we

4384
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:55,040
called the green bomb oh geez his name's

4385
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:57,600
mike greenbaum

4386
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:59,200
so we called the green bomb og and what

4387
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:02,318
that is it's a heirloom bubblegum

4388
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:05,040
crossed with an sfvog that he had from

4389
02:21:02,318 --> 02:21:06,318
seed that he's been making his himself

4390
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:07,520
last four years

4391
02:21:06,318 --> 02:21:11,439
and so he crossed that with the old

4392
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:14,560
school bubblegum and he got this

4393
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:17,520
bubble gum framed plant that turns

4394
02:21:14,559 --> 02:21:20,318
purple but still somewhat smells like oh

4395
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:22,800
gee it's weird it's like you get this

4396
02:21:20,318 --> 02:21:24,959
fruity bubble gum but it's there's just

4397
02:21:22,799 --> 02:21:26,959
as much og on the contrast in the butt

4398
02:21:24,959 --> 02:21:29,199
it's [ __ ] crazy and so we crossed

4399
02:21:26,959 --> 02:21:31,679
that with our our versailles which was

4400
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:33,520
like a really good solid og

4401
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:35,680
and um you know we're releasing that

4402
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:37,359
year we're calling you know that that

4403
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:39,439
you know um that's gonna be we're

4404
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:41,120
releasing the miyazaki og and that's

4405
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:42,000
what we're calling that

4406
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:44,960
um

4407
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:48,079
that's from you know my old japan roots

4408
02:21:44,959 --> 02:21:50,000
miyazaki was a director who created

4409
02:21:48,079 --> 02:21:52,000
films such as totoro

4410
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,600
and we always called mike totoro because

4411
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,600
he was like a mountain he's like he's

4412
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:57,520
like a forest spirit he's like he's like

4413
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:59,280
this guy's he's like uh you know late

4414
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:00,800
50s

4415
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:02,800
huge white beard

4416
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:05,279
tatted from head to toe

4417
02:22:02,799 --> 02:22:06,799
walks barefoot he's a [ __ ]

4418
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:08,640
mountain spirit you know this guy's a

4419
02:22:06,799 --> 02:22:10,478
forest spirit you know so

4420
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:12,398
and he taught me a lot about you know

4421
02:22:10,478 --> 02:22:14,478
paying respect to plants

4422
02:22:12,398 --> 02:22:17,039
and and appreciating nature the way that

4423
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:19,119
miyazaki's films uh did for me when i

4424
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:21,120
was growing up as a kid in japan so we

4425
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:23,040
chose to name that that strained me as

4426
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:24,399
akioji

4427
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:26,560
and um

4428
02:22:24,398 --> 02:22:27,920
the next two we just haven't named yet

4429
02:22:26,559 --> 02:22:29,680
but they're good

4430
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:30,799
they're good

4431
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:33,920
like

4432
02:22:30,799 --> 02:22:37,039
we we came across a flavor and um the

4433
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:39,120
backyard and bcn got some of these seeds

4434
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:41,760
leo got some of these seeds and its

4435
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:43,520
working title was rosso corsa and that

4436
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:45,680
was this offshoot from the the

4437
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:47,600
testarossa line we were working when we

4438
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:50,479
crossed it with the cherry noir

4439
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:52,479
and rose of course is the name

4440
02:22:50,478 --> 02:22:54,559
we weren't going to brand it this way

4441
02:22:52,478 --> 02:22:56,079
because that's ferrari has that name

4442
02:22:54,559 --> 02:22:58,879
trademarked as the color of the paint on

4443
02:22:56,079 --> 02:23:00,799
their cars so it was just like i just

4444
02:22:58,879 --> 02:23:03,199
called it that just as remember that it

4445
02:23:00,799 --> 02:23:05,119
was like oh that's obviously from my

4446
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,720
testarossa cross you know what i mean

4447
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:08,880
because the the number the color red on

4448
02:23:06,719 --> 02:23:10,959
the testosterone was called rosa corsa

4449
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:12,959
but we're we're we're going through this

4450
02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:14,398
thing where we're trying to find

4451
02:23:12,959 --> 02:23:15,839
a good identity for it because it

4452
02:23:14,398 --> 02:23:17,279
doesn't smell like anything we've ever

4453
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:18,880
worked before

4454
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:20,159
it's gotta completely it literally

4455
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:21,039
smells like

4456
02:23:20,159 --> 02:23:22,719
um

4457
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:24,560
like if you were trick-or-treating and

4458
02:23:22,719 --> 02:23:27,760
you had a roll of smarties in your

4459
02:23:24,559 --> 02:23:30,159
pocket get crushed up and then somehow

4460
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:31,520
someone spilled gasoline you know what i

4461
02:23:30,159 --> 02:23:34,398
mean it's it's

4462
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:36,000
insane like crazy we've never been able

4463
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:38,000
we never thought we'd be able to get

4464
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,159
terps like this to express

4465
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:42,159
so we wanted something that we could

4466
02:23:40,159 --> 02:23:44,159
call it that would give it its justice

4467
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:46,639
and two we wouldn't get a cease and

4468
02:23:44,159 --> 02:23:48,478
desist from ferrari

4469
02:23:46,639 --> 02:23:50,318
sounds exciting

4470
02:23:48,478 --> 02:23:52,559
yeah because tesla roast is like you

4471
02:23:50,318 --> 02:23:54,559
know italian for redhead and so like a

4472
02:23:52,559 --> 02:23:56,719
lot of the stems and the leaves and the

4473
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:58,318
testarossa would get this red hue and

4474
02:23:56,719 --> 02:24:00,398
that's why you know we called it the

4475
02:23:58,318 --> 02:24:02,318
testarossa and the rosso corsa was even

4476
02:24:00,398 --> 02:24:04,559
more [ __ ] red it was just this

4477
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:06,719
brilliant vibrant red that would

4478
02:24:04,559 --> 02:24:09,519
transition to a lavender and then like a

4479
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:11,599
royal purple and then but the nose was

4480
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:12,840
just pure candy shop

4481
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:17,120
pure candy

4482
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:17,120
shop maybe we'll call it shop

4483
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:21,040
sounds really exciting i got a question

4484
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:23,119
though for you and you've got to be

4485
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:26,720
honest here when you do the online

4486
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:28,240
launch do you expect the site to crash

4487
02:24:26,719 --> 02:24:30,079
[ __ ]

4488
02:24:28,239 --> 02:24:31,280
that would be cool

4489
02:24:30,079 --> 02:24:33,280
i mean

4490
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:35,359
the coolest thing that happened to

4491
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:37,040
seeds here now is we crashed their

4492
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:39,920
servers one time

4493
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:40,840
um where the orders came in so fast they

4494
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:43,120
actually

4495
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:44,799
oversold and because the computers

4496
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:46,479
couldn't keep up with them with the with

4497
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:47,679
the frequency of orders going out so

4498
02:24:46,478 --> 02:24:49,039
that was like

4499
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:50,398
you know we never expect these kind of

4500
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:52,240
things to happen it's just really

4501
02:24:50,398 --> 02:24:53,119
grateful and we're humbled you know

4502
02:24:52,239 --> 02:24:54,799
because

4503
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:56,640
we really approach this like as music

4504
02:24:54,799 --> 02:24:59,279
you know we could you know if we're in

4505
02:24:56,639 --> 02:25:01,680
if we're in the the the garden you know

4506
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:03,920
our version of a studio there's a really

4507
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:05,359
good chance what we what we make won't

4508
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:07,600
connect

4509
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:10,079
so it's like if it connects on the front

4510
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:12,079
end and people like the cross they like

4511
02:25:10,079 --> 02:25:13,840
the way it sounds and then it really

4512
02:25:12,079 --> 02:25:16,239
expresses itself to exceed their

4513
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:18,239
expectations and that's what we'll know

4514
02:25:16,239 --> 02:25:20,719
you know our job is done so it's like

4515
02:25:18,239 --> 02:25:23,280
it's really hard for us to get excited

4516
02:25:20,719 --> 02:25:24,639
over sales because the sales is the

4517
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:26,319
first part of that that that

4518
02:25:24,639 --> 02:25:27,920
relationship with with the grower you

4519
02:25:26,318 --> 02:25:29,439
know who's who's the cornerstone of your

4520
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:31,520
[ __ ] brand

4521
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:33,520
you have to get his validation it's not

4522
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:35,439
a good day it's not a good day when you

4523
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,479
sell the seeds it's a scary day when you

4524
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:38,398
sell the seeds because you better

4525
02:25:36,478 --> 02:25:40,000
[ __ ] hope those seeds come out good

4526
02:25:38,398 --> 02:25:40,719
for that grower

4527
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,799
so

4528
02:25:40,719 --> 02:25:44,639
when when you get the feedback months

4529
02:25:42,799 --> 02:25:46,239
later that's when you know you could you

4530
02:25:44,639 --> 02:25:48,079
could rest easy

4531
02:25:46,239 --> 02:25:49,280
because your testing could be on point

4532
02:25:48,079 --> 02:25:50,559
in your friend's gardens that you're

4533
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:52,159
testing other strains too because we

4534
02:25:50,559 --> 02:25:54,318
tested our other strains in mendo this

4535
02:25:52,159 --> 02:25:55,760
year and they did they did good as usual

4536
02:25:54,318 --> 02:25:57,439
because renders were reframing those

4537
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:58,800
contests good but

4538
02:25:57,439 --> 02:25:59,760
is it going to hold up in other people's

4539
02:25:58,799 --> 02:26:01,438
grows

4540
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:02,960
it's going to express yourselves to you

4541
02:26:01,439 --> 02:26:05,600
according to your expectations and their

4542
02:26:02,959 --> 02:26:07,919
expectations in their environment

4543
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:09,439
so that's that's the key so i try not to

4544
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:10,879
get too excited about it you know i

4545
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:12,960
think if you get excited about selling

4546
02:26:10,879 --> 02:26:14,398
seeds you're in it for the wrong purpose

4547
02:26:12,959 --> 02:26:15,279
and that you know

4548
02:26:14,398 --> 02:26:16,719
um

4549
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:17,760
you know if you're getting excited too

4550
02:26:16,719 --> 02:26:20,719
early

4551
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:22,159
and and then you know

4552
02:26:20,719 --> 02:26:23,438
you just can't forecast the [ __ ]

4553
02:26:22,159 --> 02:26:24,799
future you know i mean if we could all

4554
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:27,200
forecast the future we wouldn't be in

4555
02:26:24,799 --> 02:26:28,318
the weed game we were running headphones

4556
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,600
so

4557
02:26:28,318 --> 02:26:30,879
that's just the fact

4558
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:32,159
all the testing in the world could be

4559
02:26:30,879 --> 02:26:34,959
good but if it doesn't prove itself on

4560
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:37,200
the market you're [ __ ]

4561
02:26:34,959 --> 02:26:39,199
so bringing us to kind of the tail end

4562
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:40,640
of things a really interesting question

4563
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:42,560
i pose to a lot of people doesn't seem

4564
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:44,559
to be a very clear answer what's your

4565
02:26:42,559 --> 02:26:47,039
recommendations for the small scale

4566
02:26:44,559 --> 02:26:48,639
farmers both indoor and out who are kind

4567
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:51,200
of continually dealing with this

4568
02:26:48,639 --> 02:26:54,559
conundrum of ever decreasing prices and

4569
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:54,560
ever increasing supply

4570
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:59,760
that's a really difficult problem isn't

4571
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:59,760
it

4572
02:27:00,318 --> 02:27:05,039
you know i think the regulations are

4573
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:07,200
changing almost daily

4574
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,800
right when people adapt to a certain set

4575
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:11,200
of circumstances the circumstances

4576
02:27:08,799 --> 02:27:13,199
change yet again

4577
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:15,040
i'm a long-term thinker i know it's

4578
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:17,359
really painful for a lot of people that

4579
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:19,280
that that are are in the wreck industry

4580
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:21,120
it's not as profitable but it used to be

4581
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:24,560
you got to pay every [ __ ] tax under

4582
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:26,800
the moon um you know uh you know things

4583
02:27:24,559 --> 02:27:28,559
are getting spread out regulation makes

4584
02:27:26,799 --> 02:27:30,559
it so you know definitely like i said

4585
02:27:28,559 --> 02:27:32,879
before we're not making as much money so

4586
02:27:30,559 --> 02:27:34,719
i'm a speaking in the sense of long

4587
02:27:32,879 --> 02:27:37,279
speaking in light of you know of a

4588
02:27:34,719 --> 02:27:40,000
long-term scale

4589
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:41,840
if if if they could just hold on hold on

4590
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,600
for another two to four years man keep

4591
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:45,200
grinding as hard as you [ __ ] came for

4592
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:47,840
two to four years because

4593
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:50,079
canada's already made cannabis

4594
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:52,559
international and the amount of [ __ ]

4595
02:27:50,079 --> 02:27:55,520
money that government cannabis is going

4596
02:27:52,559 --> 02:27:58,239
to dramatically improve canada's gdp

4597
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:59,600
huge and america's not gonna sit back

4598
02:27:58,239 --> 02:28:00,879
and watch this happen for too much

4599
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:02,479
longer

4600
02:28:00,879 --> 02:28:04,478
a lot of people a lot of people agree

4601
02:28:02,478 --> 02:28:06,719
with the sentiment in washington

4602
02:28:04,478 --> 02:28:08,398
and um i still talk to a lot of my old

4603
02:28:06,719 --> 02:28:09,679
colleagues back in washington that are

4604
02:28:08,398 --> 02:28:11,519
still doing it i'm like hey what's hot

4605
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:12,398
right now where do you think politics

4606
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:14,319
are going

4607
02:28:12,398 --> 02:28:16,879
you know um and then i'll kind of get a

4608
02:28:14,318 --> 02:28:18,478
feel for things i think that

4609
02:28:16,879 --> 02:28:20,318
whether you want to [ __ ] acknowledge

4610
02:28:18,478 --> 02:28:23,358
it or not cannabis is international

4611
02:28:20,318 --> 02:28:26,639
right now so people these small farmers

4612
02:28:23,359 --> 02:28:28,800
have to embrace the future and and just

4613
02:28:26,639 --> 02:28:31,199
hold the [ __ ] on because once this goes

4614
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:34,398
international these small farms

4615
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:37,439
are overnight going to be big or are

4616
02:28:34,398 --> 02:28:39,199
going to be the next big napa wineries

4617
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:41,760
all their products going to [ __ ] sell

4618
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,280
out over and over and over and over

4619
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:44,559
smart ones are gonna [ __ ] scale

4620
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:45,760
immediately

4621
02:28:44,559 --> 02:28:47,920
and then they're gonna

4622
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:50,478
and they're gonna you know

4623
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:51,920
california right now california wheat is

4624
02:28:50,478 --> 02:28:52,959
all over the [ __ ] planet if you go on

4625
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:55,200
instagram

4626
02:28:52,959 --> 02:28:57,199
you go on different feeds in the uk you

4627
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:59,600
want different feeds in spain just the

4628
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:01,840
fact of the matter is

4629
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:04,239
there's there's california branded weed

4630
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:05,920
everywhere and it's going for a premium

4631
02:29:04,239 --> 02:29:08,159
and that's you know so

4632
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:09,600
a lot of people have to understand so

4633
02:29:08,159 --> 02:29:11,119
when we were breeding

4634
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:12,239
we like to read what the black market's

4635
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:13,520
doing and see what trends in the black

4636
02:29:12,239 --> 02:29:15,520
market are doing that's the most one of

4637
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:16,720
the most demanding markets as far as

4638
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:18,479
taste and flavor when you're just

4639
02:29:16,719 --> 02:29:20,318
dealing with people that that buy things

4640
02:29:18,478 --> 02:29:21,840
at the highest ticket possible and so

4641
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:23,519
it's like what the black market's doing

4642
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:25,760
you know worldwide you know you're

4643
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,280
seeing a lot of you know somehow a lot

4644
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:29,200
of these packs from cali

4645
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:30,640
are are are going worldwide but they're

4646
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:32,079
going for huge premiums and that should

4647
02:29:30,639 --> 02:29:34,318
be indicated to everybody that when this

4648
02:29:32,079 --> 02:29:36,478
[ __ ] switch flips guys

4649
02:29:34,318 --> 02:29:39,439
when this switch flips everyone's gonna

4650
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:41,519
have it made that that that sacrificed

4651
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:43,359
everything that put their [ __ ] dick

4652
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:44,800
on the line you know put every put

4653
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:47,439
everything on the line their families

4654
02:29:44,799 --> 02:29:48,959
their well-being to just keep doing this

4655
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:50,639
dream of cannabis

4656
02:29:48,959 --> 02:29:51,919
we kind of stop looking at just the cali

4657
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:53,119
thing even though it's the kali thing

4658
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:55,200
for right now because it's not always

4659
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:56,640
going to be like that the world's global

4660
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:58,319
and the market dynamics are going to

4661
02:29:56,639 --> 02:29:59,599
change big time but one thing we've done

4662
02:29:58,318 --> 02:30:01,359
it's not going to change

4663
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:02,399
is that consistently the best quality is

4664
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:04,559
going to continue to come out of

4665
02:30:02,398 --> 02:30:06,318
california hands down

4666
02:30:04,559 --> 02:30:08,318
it's just our culture

4667
02:30:06,318 --> 02:30:09,760
what we're known for

4668
02:30:08,318 --> 02:30:11,840
that's it right

4669
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:13,200
yeah it starts telling me you're at the

4670
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:15,359
top it's hard right now it's hard to

4671
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:17,520
look at it just hold on guys i believe

4672
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:21,040
in everybody man it's like our [ __ ] was

4673
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:23,280
so fire for years it was going back east

4674
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:24,080
for a for a long time you know what i

4675
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:25,760
mean

4676
02:30:24,079 --> 02:30:27,600
and and who else knows where it was

4677
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:29,200

02:30:42,398 --> 02:30:46,719
it's like people need to start

4686
02:30:44,398 --> 02:30:48,398
accepting that our fate as california

4687
02:30:46,719 --> 02:30:49,679
for the large part if you're raw at your

4688
02:30:48,398 --> 02:30:51,920
[ __ ] game

4689
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:53,439
man it's gonna be like wine or your

4690
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:55,600
shit's gonna go for extremely high

4691
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:56,479
premiums one because your location and

4692
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:58,239
two

4693
02:30:56,478 --> 02:30:59,599
because you got roots in the game and

4694
02:30:58,239 --> 02:31:00,799
you're able to back that up with your

4695
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:02,640
quality

4696
02:31:00,799 --> 02:31:03,679
so it's like if you're at a farm and

4697
02:31:02,639 --> 02:31:05,599
you're holding on right now just keep

4698
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:07,439
[ __ ] holding on guys because you know

4699
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:08,640
you're going to do way better you know

4700
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:10,079
you guys are going to be the magic

4701
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:11,439
makers that connect with everybody

4702
02:31:10,079 --> 02:31:12,959
breeders can only connect with so many

4703
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:15,280
people but growers connect with

4704
02:31:12,959 --> 02:31:16,159
everybody those are the true artists

4705
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:19,200
so

4706
02:31:16,159 --> 02:31:21,359
what do you think is the best way to

4707
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:23,760
deal with the dichotomy of you know

4708
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:25,359
needing to use instagram or social media

4709
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:26,840
in general as a breeder to promote your

4710
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:29,520
brand but also you know trying to it's

4711
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:30,880
necessary it's [ __ ] necessary

4712
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:32,880
i think if anybody doesn't think it's

4713
02:31:30,879 --> 02:31:35,358
necessarily crazy your [ __ ] better be so

4714
02:31:32,879 --> 02:31:37,599
[ __ ] fire other people just naturally

4715
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:38,880
post pictures of it you know what i mean

4716
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:40,800
i think

4717
02:31:38,879 --> 02:31:42,719
the the uh

4718
02:31:40,799 --> 02:31:44,559
the world's changed

4719
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:46,239
how we interface with people has changed

4720
02:31:44,559 --> 02:31:48,239
before it was on threads and it was on

4721
02:31:46,239 --> 02:31:51,760
forums it was on icmag

4722
02:31:48,239 --> 02:31:53,280
it was on the hustle but now

4723
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:55,040
instagram's changed the game we're so

4724
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:56,399
more connected than we've ever been

4725
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:58,560
people are able to show their grow

4726
02:31:56,398 --> 02:32:01,199
methods you know we've seen a huge

4727
02:31:58,559 --> 02:32:03,359
exponential increase in raw growers

4728
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:05,120
[ __ ] are put people a lot of

4729
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:06,479
people a lot of hobbyist growers people

4730
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:08,960
just starting out people just in

4731
02:32:06,478 --> 02:32:10,398
instagram are growing some good [ __ ]

4732
02:32:08,959 --> 02:32:12,799
because they're watching all these pros

4733
02:32:10,398 --> 02:32:15,119
on instagram sharing their knowledge man

4734
02:32:12,799 --> 02:32:17,358
sharing sharing the tech and so like you

4735
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:18,720
know quality you know qualities you know

4736
02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:21,040
continuing to go up and that's because

4737
02:32:18,719 --> 02:32:23,199
the phenomena on instagram and more

4738
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:26,000
people globally have been able to

4739
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:27,520
discover aficionados through ig than we

4740
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,439
ever have been you know being in

4741
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:31,600
magazines you know being in you know

4742
02:32:29,439 --> 02:32:33,120
being a skunk you know and being at high

4743
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:35,840
times you know i mean being in high

4744
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:38,000
times is big for us but consistently

4745
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:39,439
when you have a platform that reaches

4746
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,840
everybody in the world and everyone

4747
02:32:39,439 --> 02:32:44,318
network you know overlaps to these over

4748
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:46,318
worldwide networks it creates a reach

4749
02:32:44,318 --> 02:32:48,239
that we've never been able to see before

4750
02:32:46,318 --> 02:32:51,199
so it's like i think everyone's still

4751
02:32:48,239 --> 02:32:53,039
adjusting to this new culture of ig it's

4752
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:54,079
absolutely necessary and if it's [ __ ]

4753
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:56,479
up when people get their accounts

4754
02:32:54,079 --> 02:32:58,318
deleted because their livelihoods their

4755
02:32:56,478 --> 02:33:00,719
followings are dependent

4756
02:32:58,318 --> 02:33:02,559
on on on their ig and unfortunately a

4757
02:33:00,719 --> 02:33:04,000
lot of people's success is measured upon

4758
02:33:02,559 --> 02:33:05,359
their followers because people think

4759
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:07,680
there's a corollary between your

4760
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:09,840
followers and your consistency as being

4761
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:10,559
someone who's a supplier of quality

4762
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:12,559
so

4763
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:15,279
but perception's reality and this is how

4764
02:33:12,559 --> 02:33:17,600
people communicate so we can't ignore

4765
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:19,600
reality we got to be real

4766
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:22,399
yeah right now it's on instagram it goes

4767
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:22,399
down the dm

4768
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:27,040
alrighty so just on to the final little

4769
02:33:25,439 --> 02:33:29,200
last few questions these are the more

4770
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:31,040
short response ones generally speaking

4771
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:32,319
first one it's a bit of a less harass

4772
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:34,479
one but i have a feeling you have a good

4773
02:33:32,318 --> 02:33:37,279
answer what's your favorite tom hill

4774
02:33:34,478 --> 02:33:38,959
strain besides deep chunk

4775
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:41,280
it was deep chunk

4776
02:33:38,959 --> 02:33:43,279
i know but that's why i said besides

4777
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:45,040
because i heard stories

4778
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:47,200
about him

4779
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:50,080
um on spy rock

4780
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:52,399
having the balls to select their 3 000

4781
02:33:50,079 --> 02:33:54,239
plants like nobody was doing that when

4782
02:33:52,398 --> 02:33:56,000
tom hill was doing that

4783
02:33:54,239 --> 02:33:57,760
[ __ ] nobody

4784
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,879
and so the fact that he was able to get

4785
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:02,239
the old blue hindu and the old red hindu

4786
02:34:00,879 --> 02:34:03,358
um

4787
02:34:02,239 --> 02:34:05,840
and they're

4788
02:34:03,359 --> 02:34:07,840
people in town laytonville can actually

4789
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:10,159
trace back who the [ __ ] brought the

4790
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:12,000
hindu back to leightonville and you know

4791
02:34:10,159 --> 02:34:14,079
it's not my business to to make you know

4792
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,000
who these people are public knowledge

4793
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:17,200
um but definitely you know jackson knows

4794
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,799
these people you mean gene knows these

4795
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:20,720
people 100 percent

4796
02:34:18,799 --> 02:34:22,318
um and you know these are the people

4797
02:34:20,719 --> 02:34:24,559
that originally brought hindu kush back

4798
02:34:22,318 --> 02:34:26,639
to spyroc in the 70s and so like when

4799
02:34:24,559 --> 02:34:29,359
tom hill was working at the 90s early

4800
02:34:26,639 --> 02:34:31,039
2000s nobody was doing that nobody was

4801
02:34:29,359 --> 02:34:32,640
putting their balls in the line selector

4802
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:34,000
like that so it was just

4803
02:34:32,639 --> 02:34:37,199
the whole

4804
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,879
mystique of him having him him being so

4805
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:40,560
devoted to his craft he's willing to

4806
02:34:38,879 --> 02:34:43,358
blow it up that much not to sell the

4807
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:45,199
flower but to select a [ __ ] seed oh

4808
02:34:43,359 --> 02:34:47,359
he was crazy back in the day to not use

4809
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:49,600
that [ __ ] and to sell all that flour and

4810
02:34:47,359 --> 02:34:52,000
he was selecting for like the best

4811
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:53,120
possible [ __ ] like that's passion and so

4812
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,639
it's like for that one like he went

4813
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:57,680
through that sacrifice to make deep

4814
02:34:54,639 --> 02:35:00,398
chunk bro that's my that's my backup why

4815
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:02,159
it deep chunks my favorite of his it was

4816
02:35:00,398 --> 02:35:04,478
the folklore behind that too that really

4817
02:35:02,159 --> 02:35:07,039
attracted me yeah no it's a good story

4818
02:35:04,478 --> 02:35:10,639
it is a fan favorite so next one what

4819
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:14,319
strain do you wish you had back

4820
02:35:10,639 --> 02:35:14,318
oh [ __ ] um

4821
02:35:18,159 --> 02:35:23,039
which one did i [ __ ] get rid of which

4822
02:35:20,239 --> 02:35:23,039
one have i lost

4823
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:28,960
i lost my original g13 cross

4824
02:35:26,879 --> 02:35:30,478
that got lost i got lost in a raid it

4825
02:35:28,959 --> 02:35:33,358
was at a buddy's place

4826
02:35:30,478 --> 02:35:35,358
it was a g13 across panama

4827
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:37,520
it wasn't anything that was

4828
02:35:35,359 --> 02:35:40,880
super special it was something that was

4829
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:42,960
special to me in the terms that it

4830
02:35:40,879 --> 02:35:44,398
one it harvested late as [ __ ] you know

4831
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:46,239
hardest is like 20 second week in

4832
02:35:44,398 --> 02:35:48,159
november but it didn't get any mold and

4833
02:35:46,239 --> 02:35:49,840
it had the craziest high the craze the

4834
02:35:48,159 --> 02:35:50,639
craziest high

4835
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:55,600
um

4836
02:35:50,639 --> 02:35:57,920
but the one i really regret losing is uh

4837
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:59,600
the really the the bulk of my white

4838
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:01,280
cashmere seats

4839
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:03,680
i think that was one of the strains that

4840
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:05,439
i really could have opened up a lot more

4841
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:06,159
i really could explore that one a lot

4842
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:08,079
more

4843
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:10,398
and um

4844
02:36:08,079 --> 02:36:12,079
you know there's a few others that

4845
02:36:10,398 --> 02:36:13,680
i've let kind of go out of the window

4846
02:36:12,079 --> 02:36:15,840
and i'm like [ __ ] i shouldn't have sold

4847
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:18,318
all those you know because i it was to

4848
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:21,280
me i did i want if i want it to me it

4849
02:36:18,318 --> 02:36:23,199
was a personal thing that if if i really

4850
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:24,159
felt my work was good enough i'd let it

4851
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:25,600
all go

4852
02:36:24,159 --> 02:36:27,920
you know i'd save like a little bit but

4853
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:29,439
i wanted to see really where i stood

4854
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:31,600
you know would it come back to me would

4855
02:36:29,439 --> 02:36:34,159
people keep working it and if people

4856
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:36,559
didn't work it then obviously it wasn't

4857
02:36:34,159 --> 02:36:38,719
it didn't meet my expectations for for

4858
02:36:36,559 --> 02:36:40,079
what could be a classic you know because

4859
02:36:38,719 --> 02:36:42,478
because people weren't inclined to keep

4860
02:36:40,079 --> 02:36:44,239
working it and so it was things like

4861
02:36:42,478 --> 02:36:46,239
that where i released really small

4862
02:36:44,239 --> 02:36:47,359
numbers of it people didn't work it

4863
02:36:46,239 --> 02:36:49,359
because i felt like i could have done

4864
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:50,399
better at the breeding

4865
02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:51,359
yeah you know

4866
02:36:50,398 --> 02:36:53,920
okay

4867
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:57,359
so what is the most memorable or the

4868
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:57,359
best strain you've ever smoked

4869

holy weed and it cuts clear through all

4899
02:37:55,200 --> 02:37:59,040
the dabs

4900
02:37:56,478 --> 02:38:01,119
like it was almost like the c5 haze like

4901
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:03,600
the closest thing to c5 hayes for me as

4902
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:06,319
far as like intensity of cerebral high

4903
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:07,840
was was mike's big sir holy weed that

4904
02:38:06,318 --> 02:38:09,760
[ __ ] was [ __ ] crazy

4905
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:12,079
it was like it cut through all those

4906
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:14,318
dabs we were smoking og

4907
02:38:12,079 --> 02:38:16,079
you know bamf was big at the time we

4908
02:38:14,318 --> 02:38:18,239
were smoking a lot of his [ __ ] lemon

4909
02:38:16,079 --> 02:38:19,520
oh g hash which was really strong you

4910
02:38:18,239 --> 02:38:21,199
know i had a kick

4911
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:22,800
man but that [ __ ] big stroller that

4912
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:25,920
was probably easily

4913
02:38:22,799 --> 02:38:28,719
the most that uh and and this too this

4914
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:31,760
too when i won the cup in 2012

4915
02:38:28,719 --> 02:38:34,079
um derrick emerald gave me some flowers

4916
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:36,159
of his in the pines

4917
02:38:34,079 --> 02:38:39,120
and derrick emerald had won five emerald

4918
02:38:36,159 --> 02:38:40,318
cups previous you know to me winning

4919
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:41,680
and

4920
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:43,119
to me i think he's probably one of the

4921
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:44,960
absolute but he's

4922
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:46,800
in my opinion the absolute best grower

4923
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:48,799
to ever compete in the irmo cup circus

4924
02:38:46,799 --> 02:38:50,879
derek emerald and when i smoked his

4925
02:38:48,799 --> 02:38:53,039
flowers i think i think you know on

4926
02:38:50,879 --> 02:38:55,199
point with how blown away i was with

4927
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:57,359
with mike's flowers that was really

4928
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:59,359
memorable as far as like holy [ __ ]

4929
02:38:57,359 --> 02:39:01,680
that's big sir holy weed it's exceeded

4930
02:38:59,359 --> 02:39:02,559
all expectations it's incredible but

4931
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:04,720
um

4932
02:39:02,559 --> 02:39:07,439
derek emerald's flowers and that in the

4933
02:39:04,719 --> 02:39:09,599
pines he gave me that year

4934
02:39:07,439 --> 02:39:11,840
was the absolute best flower i've ever

4935
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:13,840
[ __ ] smoked you could taste

4936
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:16,239
taste the [ __ ] love

4937
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:18,239
that he put into it you know and then i

4938
02:39:16,239 --> 02:39:20,239
think also the first time i met

4939
02:39:18,239 --> 02:39:21,920

4940

02:41:29,359 --> 02:41:33,760
and um we had refreshed from san diego

5008
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:35,760
we had just closed the club down uh the

5009
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:38,639
sheriff said shut the club down

5010
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:40,239
and uh but mike had some weed that was

5011
02:41:38,639 --> 02:41:42,398
hanging in the house for like literally

5012
02:41:40,239 --> 02:41:44,398
six [ __ ] months like the whole time

5013
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:46,879
he was like he was mike when i was

5014
02:41:44,398 --> 02:41:48,478
running the club in san diego with mike

5015
02:41:46,879 --> 02:41:50,879
he was back and forth you know going

5016
02:41:48,478 --> 02:41:52,719
from mendo to san diego all the time

5017
02:41:50,879 --> 02:41:54,478
and so like when we finally had the club

5018
02:41:52,719 --> 02:41:55,679
shut down we were there

5019
02:41:54,478 --> 02:41:58,639
he had this weed that was hanging there

5020
02:41:55,680 --> 02:42:00,239
for six months and it was original urkel

5021
02:41:58,639 --> 02:42:02,318
it was the first time i had the realest

5022
02:42:00,239 --> 02:42:05,600
urkel and that was

5023
02:42:02,318 --> 02:42:06,959
that was probably some of the highest

5024
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:09,120
probably the hot

5025
02:42:06,959 --> 02:42:11,358
some of the happiest high weed i've ever

5026
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:13,520
smoked in my life was was that original

5027
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:15,120
erko that mike had just sitting there

5028
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:17,279
after months months and months and

5029
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:19,680
months i never tasted a flavor like that

5030
02:42:17,279 --> 02:42:21,120
you know his house was like in the trees

5031
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:22,559
and so it was in this place in the

5032
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:24,319
stairs where his house was wood and

5033
02:42:22,559 --> 02:42:25,920
there was like a perfect it was always

5034
02:42:24,318 --> 02:42:26,719
cool and cold and there's always the

5035
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:28,318
right

5036
02:42:26,719 --> 02:42:30,398
temperature so it just cured perfectly

5037
02:42:28,318 --> 02:42:32,079
after this last six months but you know

5038
02:42:30,398 --> 02:42:33,840
that was like it was my first time in

5039
02:42:32,079 --> 02:42:36,719
mendo and my first time smoking mental

5040
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:38,159
weed was like you know that urkel so i

5041
02:42:36,719 --> 02:42:39,519
guess

5042
02:42:38,159 --> 02:42:40,398
you know those four experiences were

5043
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:42,640
like

5044
02:42:40,398 --> 02:42:44,318
definitive to me which which changed how

5045
02:42:42,639 --> 02:42:45,599
i looked at weed and how i approached

5046
02:42:44,318 --> 02:42:47,119
that weed every single one of those

5047
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:48,640
experiences

5048
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:50,560
pushed me to want to

5049
02:42:48,639 --> 02:42:52,639
get to that level i was like wow that

5050
02:42:50,559 --> 02:42:54,879
level exists what do i have to do to

5051
02:42:52,639 --> 02:42:57,358
just get on that level what kind of

5052
02:42:54,879 --> 02:42:59,358
concentration do i need to have what

5053
02:42:57,359 --> 02:43:00,800
discipline do i need to have to express

5054
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:02,318
myself in the way these guys are

5055
02:43:00,799 --> 02:43:05,039
expressing themselves

5056
02:43:02,318 --> 02:43:06,799
you know it came like that for me

5057
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:08,880
yeah what an awesome little backstory so

5058
02:43:06,799 --> 02:43:10,639
on to our third last question polar

5059
02:43:08,879 --> 02:43:14,478
opposite of the best one what's the

5060
02:43:10,639 --> 02:43:14,478
worst weed strength barry white

5061
02:43:16,478 --> 02:43:21,119
[ __ ] hate barry white

5062
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:23,439
it's a great plant to grow but it's got

5063
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:27,040
it's just frosty it's got no kick the

5064
02:43:23,439 --> 02:43:28,398
hash sucks nobody wants to smoke it

5065
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:30,560
you know it's definitely one strain that

5066
02:43:28,398 --> 02:43:33,039
i wasn't really a fan of like

5067
02:43:30,559 --> 02:43:34,478
um i'm a big fan of weed you know so

5068
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:36,319
it's like there's one strain of hate

5069
02:43:34,478 --> 02:43:37,840
growing i hate growing bubba but i love

5070
02:43:36,318 --> 02:43:39,680
smoking that one but this one thing i

5071
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:41,120
just hate smoking is [ __ ]

5072
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:42,880
you know some people say blue dream

5073
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:45,279
train wreck i like smoking all that [ __ ]

5074
02:43:42,879 --> 02:43:48,318
you know anyways for some reason

5075
02:43:45,279 --> 02:43:49,840
i do not very white yeah i'll always

5076
02:43:48,318 --> 02:43:52,478
have a little soft spot for blue dream i

5077
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:55,200
reckon on to the next question

5078
02:43:52,478 --> 02:43:56,559
so desert island top three weeds all you

5079
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:59,040

5080
02:43:56,559 --> 02:43:59,039

5081
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:02,840

02:44:12,559 --> 02:44:15,519
original

5086
02:44:14,079 --> 02:44:17,120
it's really hard to find the original

5087
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:18,720
sour d everybody says they have it but

5088
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:20,479
it's not the real sour d even when i was

5089
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:23,358
moving packs 1 out of 20 pounds was a

5090
02:44:20,478 --> 02:44:24,959
real sour d any hustler agree with that

5091
02:44:23,359 --> 02:44:26,239

being nice too

5093
02:44:26,239 --> 02:44:30,639
um but if

5094
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:32,799
i could find the you know the original

5095
02:44:30,639 --> 02:44:34,159
just like that [ __ ] crazy sour from

5096
02:44:32,799 --> 02:44:37,358
back in the day that would just stink up

5097
02:44:34,159 --> 02:44:40,159
your whole car i'd bring that with me

5098

okay and so lucky last question if you

5105
02:44:53,359 --> 02:44:58,159
could go back in time to anywhere any

5106
02:44:55,600 --> 02:45:01,680
place to get some land race seeds

5107
02:44:58,159 --> 02:45:04,239
presumably where would you go

5108
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:04,239
oh man

5109
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:12,398
i don't know like

5110
02:45:08,559 --> 02:45:13,278
marco polo times in like southeast asia

5111
02:45:12,398 --> 02:45:15,519
like

5112
02:45:13,279 --> 02:45:17,680
you know before like western expansion

5113
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:20,159
you know because with trade

5114
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:22,239
you also saw the trade of certain

5115
02:45:20,159 --> 02:45:24,719
cultivars of plants that were being

5116
02:45:22,239 --> 02:45:28,559
domesticated by people throughout you

5117
02:45:24,719 --> 02:45:30,318
know uh you know europe and in asia

5118
02:45:28,559 --> 02:45:32,239
um so you know i always heard these

5119
02:45:30,318 --> 02:45:34,318
stories about you know my my favorite

5120
02:45:32,239 --> 02:45:35,840
weed just generally since i was in

5121
02:45:34,318 --> 02:45:38,079
thailand as a young kid was always been

5122
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:40,079
the tie in the burmese weed and i always

5123
02:45:38,079 --> 02:45:42,398
wondered what

5124
02:45:40,079 --> 02:45:44,719
weed was like from those villages

5125
02:45:42,398 --> 02:45:46,239
because they they purposely cultivated

5126
02:45:44,719 --> 02:45:48,079
those flowers in certain parts of this

5127
02:45:46,239 --> 02:45:50,159
area just for their flower just for

5128
02:45:48,079 --> 02:45:52,478
smoking it you know whereas other places

5129
02:45:50,159 --> 02:45:54,799
in the region in the world like you know

5130
02:45:52,478 --> 02:45:56,959
like india and in pakistan and

5131
02:45:54,799 --> 02:45:58,159
afghanistan there's hash cultures and

5132
02:45:56,959 --> 02:46:00,239
other places that were cultivating him

5133
02:45:58,159 --> 02:46:02,239
we're cultivating it for fiber but you

5134
02:46:00,239 --> 02:46:04,318
know uh southeast asia is one of those

5135
02:46:02,239 --> 02:46:06,159
rare places where people you know and

5136
02:46:04,318 --> 02:46:09,039
some parts of africa too i won't forget

5137
02:46:06,159 --> 02:46:11,760
about that but um you know

5138
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:15,120
[ __ ] thailand burma

5139
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:17,120
1800s before western real real western

5140
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:19,520
industrial you know technocratic

5141
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:21,279
expansion happened where people where

5142
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:22,000
their where their ancient way of life

5143
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:24,159
was

5144
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:26,318
um wasn't allowed anymore you know so i

5145
02:46:24,159 --> 02:46:28,239
wanted to you might you know if i had it

5146
02:46:26,318 --> 02:46:30,719
if i get a time machine would be what

5147
02:46:28,239 --> 02:46:33,680
was what what if they were one of the

5148
02:46:30,719 --> 02:46:36,559
only cultures on the [ __ ] planet

5149
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:39,120
you know breeding weed and selecting it

5150
02:46:36,559 --> 02:46:40,799
for the taste and the high of the flower

5151
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:43,279
man what the [ __ ] were they smoking on

5152
02:46:40,799 --> 02:46:45,599
before you know western before western

5153
02:46:43,279 --> 02:46:47,840
idea you know ideal says that this isn't

5154
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:50,000
good for you and we have to outlaw that

5155
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:51,520
or even before when

5156
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:53,439
you know

5157
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:55,279
you know different dramatic changes

5158
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:57,200
happen in certain countries where that

5159
02:46:55,279 --> 02:46:59,359
culture is lost because the village is

5160
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:02,240
obliterated due to war

5161
02:46:59,359 --> 02:47:03,279
you know that's also a factor too so

5162
02:47:02,239 --> 02:47:04,879
um

5163
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:07,520
yeah i've got i got a thing for those

5164
02:47:04,879 --> 02:47:09,278
hazes from southeast asia

5165
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:11,120
totally

5166
02:47:09,279 --> 02:47:12,560
alrighty so i think that might bring us

5167
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:14,160
to just about the end of it did you have

5168
02:47:12,559 --> 02:47:15,439
any comments or shout outs you wanted to

5169
02:47:14,159 --> 02:47:16,318
