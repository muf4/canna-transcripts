more let's get into

139
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,079
it beautiful stuff and I wanted to ask

140
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:10,120
you there's there's weirdly like a lot

141
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,159
of Reports online and I've never really

142
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,720
known much about it people used to say

143
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,479
that the white was very similar to the

144
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,000
TK and like sometimes the name like the

145
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:20,199
white used to be called triangle or

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,759
something like that do you do you know

147
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,800
anything about that at

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,479
all yeah actually um when I did I was

149
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,439
talking to the swamp Boys around 20

150
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,240
2017 when I was living down there in

151
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,038
Central America and we had some

152
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,759
conversations for a while we we had some

153
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,279
mutual friends and once we started

154
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,240
talking we started talking about who we

155
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,038
knew back in Florida together and um I

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,759
was talking to chome and he told me the

157
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,599
story The White came to him as a plant

158
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,960
called the triangle and uh he was

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,720
definitely interesting in he interested

160
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,198
in hearing the story about the Amal

161
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,120
triangle and any sort of relation and

162
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,360
actually the white I've only seen it one

163
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,240
time but it was at my friend Craig's

164
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,919
house and that was the closest turfs

165
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,598
that I've come across since back in the

166
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,279
day with the anal triangle but I don't

167
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,038
think it's the same plant um because I

168
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,478
took an ounce home and it dried out I

169
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,240
dried it out a little bit more and it

170
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,519
kind of lost its turps and it was a

171
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,120
little bit more bland tasting than I

172
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,038
remember definitely didn't have that

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,959
sweet floral thing going on that the

174
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,680
animal did but something about it when

175
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,279
it came out of the freezer had those

176
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,598
exact like memorable turbs from back in

177
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,918
the day and that was the closest thing

178
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:32,240
I've seen to it so I told ch that whole

179
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,639
story and you know I can't it's only

180
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,639
speculation CU I don't really know for

181
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,199
sure but it could be related it could be

182
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,000
a seed of the anal triangle or something

183
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,120
related to it somehow yeah okay yeah

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,918
I've just never grown the white

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,840
personally I've only seen it in flower

186
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:50,279
form sure sure I actually haven't tried

187
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,719
the white myself so I have to try some I

188
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,638
definitely wanted to say I've tried a

189
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,520
really nice pure Loco so definitely that

190
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,120
was a good one from

191
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,839
archive uh I I wanted to ask you you

192
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,639
know because um in terms of the whole

193
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,359
storyline in in recent episodes we' had

194
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,840
Noto dog and inspector on the show and

195
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,720
they both commented that they felt like

196
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,598
they'd seen some discrepancies within

197
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,160
the storyline and posts from maybe like

198
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,598
IC mag over the years and on different

199
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
sources they sort of felt like there had

200
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,079
just been inconsistencies between the

201
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:25,478
dates and the ages I guess the question

202
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,120
is like you know has there ever been

203
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,478
different you know has your memory

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,160
changed over time you're like oh you

205
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,478
know I think I was different or you know

206
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,280
where do you think this comes from this

207
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,719
view that could be from the second time

208
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,359
I went to Amsterdam um which I went to

209
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,560
the Cannabis Cup there High Times

210
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,479
Cannabis Cup at first I thought for some

211
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,158
reason that I went there for that trip

212
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,439
in 91 or 92 and I'm pretty sure I might

213
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:51,839
have mentioned that to a few people here

214
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:53,839
and there but come to find out later on

215
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,359
after talking with Adam Dunn about a few

216
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,918
things that it had to be later because

217
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,240
he we had shopped at this place called

218
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,000
the grayer coffee shop that trip and we

219
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,360
were we bought some good flow from there

220
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,720
and they told us where we could find

221
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,800
some seeds and of the stuff we bought

222
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,879
there like bubble gum and

223
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,319
AK-47 and there was this place called

224
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,240
the CIA which Adam I guess owned or he

225
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,439
was partners with at the time and all it

226
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,280
was was like this little black door up

227
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,399
this like abandoned looking building and

228
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,959
it had a word the three-letter word CIA

229
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,598
on it so it was like sketchy even

230
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,239
walking in the door but we were given uh

231
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,639
directions by this guy at the gry house

232
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,680
or the gray area coffee shop to go there

233
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,759
so I had known I had shopped at um the

234
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,918
CIA and maybe had met Adam he looked

235
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:42,038
familiar to me after all that and seen

236
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,679
him on the podcast years later so the

237
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:46,278
discrepancy might have been where I

238
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,679
thought it was 9192 when I went on that

239
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:51,639
trip but it was actually

240
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,639
1993 because we basically think there

241
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,120
was a year he opened that place and I

242
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,879
remember there was this huge hemp plant

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,519
grown in the middle like you'd walk up

244
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,039
these you walk in the door you go up the

245
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,639
straight staircase it go up to like a

246
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,039
lounge and there's bun people hanging

247
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,799
out smoking and there was like a desk

248
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,639
over there someone sees there I think

249
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,439
and there might have been like a little

250
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,039
DJ booth set up and in the middle of the

251
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,079
room there was like this huge pot with

252
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,360
this giant hemp plant and looked like a

253
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:15,519
bamboo trunk it was like huge nothing

254
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,600
never seen anything like it before and

255
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,200
it was like probably 15 foot tall grown

256
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,720
to like a sunlight up the top of the

257
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,200
building so when I ran that story by

258
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,240
Adam he told me they had to be 1993

259
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,440
because that's when he had that going on

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,440
so you know thinking back to when I

261
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,040
first came out um basically my story

262
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,519
actually it came out I started going on

263
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,159
uh excuse me I started going online

264
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,039
while I was on stuck on house arrest and

265
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,039
probation before I moved down to Central

266
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:47,838
America and long before I created

267
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,879
Origins and I started searching triangle

268
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,519
Kush and I found some stories here and

269
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,439
there from people talking [ __ ] about how

270
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,240
it came to Florida from some military

271
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,360
guys like from overseas and brought

272
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,159
seeds back other stories were talking

273
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,639
about how it was named after the free

274
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:04,240
cities in Florida meeting Jacksonville

275
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,559
Tampa and Miami which I laughed at all

276
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,120
those stories and I might have chimed in

277
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,879
a couple times saying this is all

278
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,000
[ __ ] or whatever it was and I got

279
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,720
people telling me you don't know what

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,078
you're talking about so I just it wasn't

281
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,720
very long I was on there at all um

282
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,120
whatever story I told back then I don't

283
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,839
know I was I was drinking at the time I

284
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,039
wasn't smoking I was pissed off with the

285
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,880
world I was pissed off with the

286
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,439
government um I was looking forward to

287
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,919
getting off all that stuff so I could

288
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,240
move on and start growing again and and

289
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,519
at that point like my wife and I were f

290
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,680
and I had plans on moving down to uh

291
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,039
Latin America where I already built a

292
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,000
house um so I was just want to be done

293
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,000
with everything and if I was on any sort

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,759
of IC mag orever that was back then in

295
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,240
those days and it was just to like try

296
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,919
and correct people that were spreading

297
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,799
rumors that were false about names and

298
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,958
how I got named and where it came from

299
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,679
and stuff so that was my that was my

300
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,599
time on there as far as M dog goes me

301
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,879
and him had conversations when I first

302
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,759
created Origins and those guys even

303
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,320
invited me to their Emerald cup parties

304
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,879
that I went to a couple years in a row

305
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,079
with Josh and it seemed to me like right

306
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,200
after the pandemic I went to the last

307
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,039
Emeral cup before the pandemic and

308
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,240
before the

309
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,799
elections it came back from that trip it

310
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,879
was like wet and cold and gloomy and I

311
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,199
came back sick as can be probably had Co

312
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:21,360
who knows so I get back to Central

313
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,519
America and uh basically after that

314
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,680
those guys stopped following me for

315
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,799
whatever reason I blame it on something

316
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,439
that might have I might have done like

317
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,159
on one of my posts that's kind of

318
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,279
political thinking back to it and I'll

319
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,319
never do again but this was during the

320
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,320
election it was during like the riots

321
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,839
that were happening everywhere there was

322
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,519
chaos there was lockdowns and then covid

323
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,360
and where we lived it got really strict

324
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,759
and they had us on curfew every night

325
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,320
there was driving restrictions and the

326
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,319
beaches were closed and it was like

327
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,800
really hectic um and around that time

328
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,200
for whatever reason those guys just

329
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,000
stopped talking to me um I don't know if

330
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,560
it because I made a political post that

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,159
was like against this Administration

332
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:01,239
that had just gotten voted in or

333
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,519
whatever it was not like I was on either

334
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,919
side because I don't think either sides

335
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,519
are good they're all evil both political

336
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,240
parties and like I'm directly in the

337
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,679
middle because they both have their both

338
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,360
they both have their good things and bad

339
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,359
things but I'm definitely on not on

340
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,800
either side so for whatever reason I

341
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,480
made some stupid posts about anti

342
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,159
Hillary and anti-biden and anti-china

343
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,839
and it was kind of like a meme I guess

344
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,519
at the time and immediately I got all

345
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,120
kinds of like [ __ ] for it I got people

346
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,480
dming me telling me I'm a scumbag

347
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,639
Trumper I had people dming me telling me

348
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,320
to [ __ ] off and unfollow me and never

349
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,680
want to talk to me again type thing and

350
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,199
that seemed to be around the same time

351
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:41,479
that I like lost those guys as far as

352
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:43,240
like followers go as far as like Matt Ry

353
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,120
and NATO dog and some of those other

354
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,240
guys so I don't know if for that or what

355
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,039
it was but you know as far as the dates

356
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,399
go and my age for sure I was 17 on my

357
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,120
first trip and that was 1989 and second

358
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,679
trip I was a little lost on at first but

359
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,759
that was definitely

360
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:02,479
1993 and at that Canabis

361
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,198
anyone that was there um would remember

362
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,800
there was as you walked in the doorway

363
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,799
there was these two big plants growing

364
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,399
they were live flowering plants and I

365
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,120
remember specifically they were dering

366
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,440
poison because a friend of mine I went

367
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,159
there we had like snuck like walked up

368
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,360
and grabbed a little nugget off one and

369
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,360
put in his pocket thinking it was going

370
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,360
to dry out on that trip we get to

371
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,360
actually try some deran poison but uh as

372
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440
anyone knows and answer to him in

373
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,399
November which is when the the Canvas

374
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Cup was back then is so wet and rainy

375
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,799
out that like nothing will dry you have

376
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,600
to have a demier to get in dry

377
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:38,278
there so yeah I don't know those guys

378
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,959
could be the reason why they're talking

379
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,078
[ __ ] um I've had plenty of conversations

380
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,958
with him and and I actually found my

381
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:47,719
conversation with him at some point and

382
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,198
basically in the conversation I told him

383
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,360
straight up we were popping seeds from

384
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,679
the seed bank and from ceny seeds um you

385
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,079
know I never I might not have told him I

386
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,519
went there twice or whatever it was

387
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,278
because the second trip wasn't really

388
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,000
related to the OG triangle story

389
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,320
or I don't know that might have been a

390
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,679
reason why I didn't say I went there

391
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
twice or but I definitely went there

392
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,078
twice um the second time was more for

393
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,439
fun and I went to chill and relax and

394
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,039
had my own money that trip and uh went

395
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,399
for almost two weeks with some friends

396
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:19,480
and had a good time and that trip we

397
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,039
brought back like I said the bubblegum

398
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,320
AK47 um at that point in time the seed

399
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,399
bank was closed I guess because ciny

400
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,040
seed he got in trouble every everyone

401
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,320
knows about and ciny seeds had bought

402
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,799
them out

403
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,720
and they were still working out of the

404
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,439
castle but at the time they opened up a

405
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,079
new store in like real close to where we

406
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,600
were staying like walking distance

407
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,719
across from like the Cannabis Museum or

408
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,079
H Museum I want to say so that's where

409
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,320

410
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:50,039

450
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,399
of progress to that after you know the

451
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:24,199
Inception of the TK and

452
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,559
OG all right so um I had moved from

453
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,479
Jupiter we skipped a lot I moved to

454
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,198
Jupiter in uh 9 before like I said B my

455
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,440
first house there and I stayed there

456
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,359
till

457
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,000
1999 um the house there I had gotten um

458
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,720
I got chased out of there basically by a

459
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,198
lightning bolt um I had a stolen power

460
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,680
rig going on I that had actually take a

461
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,159
year off from growing because some of

462
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,879
the older guys I knew in South Florida

463
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,519
were having some issues and there was a

464
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,198
lot of Heat going on so I took a while

465
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,278
off and during that time I was making

466
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,359
surf videos and I started this I partner

467
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:56,360
with this company it was a friend of

468
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,600
mine that started this company called

469
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,600
crypto clothing um it was around like

470
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,639
the late 80s and most of the 90s and it

471
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,439
was surf based but like also weed

472
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,880
related and it was um him taking his art

473
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,079
put them on shirts and then I joined in

474
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,760
with another friend and so for a couple

475
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:16,000
years I kept mom's alive somewhere but I

476
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,720
didn't grow any flower and we tried to

477
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,078
run that company while there was a lot

478
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,318
of heat in South Florida and I was

479
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:25,240
trying to stay cool um this is when I

480
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:27,038
was in Jupiter so at that point um I

481
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,120
started growing again I think close to

482
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,558
98 99 I want to say and randomly one day

483
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,959
I never had stolen power in that house

484
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,558
before but for whatever reason it was I

485
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,919
was broke and I was getting desperate

486
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,000
and I had a friend that knew how to

487
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,400
steal power and do the power rig so we

488
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,359
set at my house that way and the day we

489
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,640
were doing it there was a storm rolling

490
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:49,240
in with lightning and stuff was sketchy

491
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,720
so we kind of rushed the job drill the

492
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,480
holes through the wall and ran the whole

493
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,319
thing through the meter to the to a

494
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,440
panel inside the house that he built me

495
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,000
um so I don't know if we didn't ground

496
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,720
it right because we rush that day or

497
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,599
whatever but maybe I don't know like a

498
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,360
month into a batch that I had set up in

499
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,719
the garage the 10 lights while living

500
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,519
there I was on the phone one day this is

501
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,919
when we had cord phones still and I'm on

502
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,839
the phone with a telemarketer trying to

503
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,799
get this lady off the phone and there's

504
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,839
a bad storm going on lightning hitting

505
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,400
and crashing and thunder and like I tell

506
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,720
her like look lady I don't want what

507
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,960
you're selling so I hang the phone up

508
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,679
and the second I hang the phone on the

509
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,558
wall lightning struck the house and

510
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,960
basically zap um half the line coming

511
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,678
into the property there was two lines

512
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,759
coming in and Zapped one of them so

513
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,559
immediately I knew something was up the

514
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,839
house started like dimming and going

515
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:39,599
through kinds of little power surges and

516
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,038
I started smelling burning wires so I

517
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,678
had to go unplug everything immediately

518
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,558
and it was a full emergency mode

519
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,000
basically so like the power um lines

520
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,519
where they met from the outside of my

521
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,960
house got struck by the lightning out

522
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,200
there and melted it completely so one of

523
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,720
the lines coming into the house was

524
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,360
still working while the other one wasn't

525
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,120
so I had to take everything off that one

526
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,439
leg and basically I was broke at the

527
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,038
time and I was just trying to get this

528
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,159
batch done and uh still had a couple we

529
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,759
to go so I took like 10 lights worth of

530
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,240
plants and cran them all into one room

531
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,000
under two lights or three lights at the

532
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,000
time and trying to finish them off under

533
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,159
the melting burning stinky power in the

534
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,480
house which was super sketchy and fire

535
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,159
the whole time but I finished it um got

536
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,000
that out of there cleaned the whole

537
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,600
house up and I had basically the guy

538
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
came over we undid the power but at this

539
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,399
point we had this huge hes in the wall

540
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,720
and I was sketched out the power company

541
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,720
was going to see and you know they're

542
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,400
going to come out and fix it they're

543
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,000
going to have to open my meter so I

544
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,360
waited till like a Friday evening when

545
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,038
everyone was like dying to go home from

546
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,918
work and I called the power company told

547
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:43,798
them my story I needed help the place

548
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,440
got struck by lightning so they sent a

549
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,879
crew out they get up there on the roof

550
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,919
like no gloves or nothing and they just

551
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,039
like fix the [ __ ] up like super fast

552
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,679
never open my meter and it was done so I

553
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,200
took that as an omen like the whole

554
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,080
lightning thing and I was like already

555
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,279
been in that house from 94 and it's been

556
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,000
like five years um I was already

557
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,440
sketched out from being in South Florida

558
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,839
where some of those guys had started

559
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,480
getting in trouble so at that point I

560
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,480
decided to move north another hour to

561
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,960
where Craig and that whole crew was

562
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,079
basically and that's basically in

563
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,558
Florida um we have the Bahamas that

564
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:18,798
block a lot of the surf from hitting the

565
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,759
southern beaches but up there in Central

566
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,400
Florida we get a lot more consistent

567
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,558
surf it's because the waves get around

568
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,280
the Bahama bank so I always went up

569
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,440
there Sur for my whole life and it was

570
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,119
just a matter of time before I wanted to

571
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,240
move up there and did um so it was 999

572
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:39,319
when I bought my house up there um so 99

573
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,599
till 2011 I was living in Bard County

574
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,599
and I was buying houses I bought a

575
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,399
little owner finance when I first moved

576
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,199
up there and then I started growing in

577
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
another house I rented and from there I

578
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,440
bought another house and I started doing

579
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,960
little fixer uppers and this is before

580
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,600
the economy um or the real estate market

581
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,720
took a crash this is like early 2000s

582
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,759
and there this is when they're giving

583
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,679
out loans like candy like here in

584
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,679
America I don't know about there but I

585
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,400
basically got a loan for a $400,000

586
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,038
house hardly showing any income there's

587
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,440
like no income verification back then so

588
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,240
you could just say how much you made

589
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,400
told the banker and they sign you you

590
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,319
know long you got the money they sign

591
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,038
you up and you're good to go so I got

592
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,639
this big ass house up there in the north

593
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,000
side of the county it was like a three

594
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,320
car garage huge poor bedroom on two

595
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,400
acres of property brand new

596
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:34,200
construction um and that was

597
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,679
2004 it was and that was the house I

598
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,159
would end up getting busted at but at

599
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,200
first I was there from 2004 till 2011

600
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,880
and that's when they got me um so during

601
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,240
that time frame I was grown in the

602
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,320
Triangle um chicy fruit G13 I had some

603
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,400
White Widow some of those house plants

604
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,558
still

605
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,840
around Super Skunk CCH PL I was talking

606
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:59,879
about earlier um and yeah it was that

607
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,038
house house uh one day that they would

608
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,799
come get me at basically um somebody

609
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:07,640
tipped them off and this was under the

610
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,960
Obama Administration where at the time

611
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,559
they changed the rules where they can

612
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
come in your house without a warrant

613
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,720
based on saying they they smelled

614
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,798
something outside by the road and they

615
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,400
use that to get in my place so yeah that

616
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,519
tied me up for a solid four years a

617
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,159
little longer um and then after that was

618
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:27,000
over with and I got off house arrest and

619
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,559
probation actually got off probation a

620
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,119
year early luckily

621
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,839
and uh we moved down to Latin America at

622
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,759
that point um my girlfriend I've been

623
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,240
with for 13 years now she was from

624
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,960
Columbia and she was all on board moving

625
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,599
down there she spoke perfect and she's

626
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,759
bilingual three different

627
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,639
languages and uh yeah soon as we got off

628
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,640
I got off probation I got my um passport

629
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,759
renewed through the uh website versus

630
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,679
waiting for the courts to give it back

631
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,119
to me and within a couple weeks I went

632
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,960
down there and started prepping for us

633
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:02,079
to move down there basically

634
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,558
ah and what was life like down there it

635
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,558
was awesome at first um and it was

636
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,558
awesome in the end too but there was a

637
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:12,480
point somewhere in that first year where

638
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,599
we had a home invasion um and at this

639
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,200
point we had given up everything in

640
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,839
Florida I lost everything I had to

641
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,798
foreclosures like we sold everything we

642
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,439
had in garage sales and we pretty much

643
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,599
gave up our life in Florida and moved

644
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,679
down there um and I had two places down

645
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,399
there at the time and we moved from one

646
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,798
we lived in one for six months and I was

647
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,278
growing there everything was fine and

648
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:36,278
then we moved to the bigger place which

649
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:38,599
was older and wasn't really up to date

650
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:42,159
it needed new windows it needed like new

651
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:44,519
security and whatever so within a couple

652
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,960
months of living in that big house they

653
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,519
were like compounds they had like walls

654
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,400
around them the one did and the next

655
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,240
door there was four houses with some

656
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,519
friends of mine and we all built the

657
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,519
project together and I had one of those

658
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,879
places next door so we went from the

659
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:01,519
smaller house to The Big House me and my

660
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,440
my girlfriend of the time and uh I don't

661
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,839
know within a few months of living there

662
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,360
one late night uh I hear the dogs

663
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,278
barking outside and we're going to bed

664
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,158
it's like midnight I look out the front

665
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:13,599
door or the front window and I see a

666
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,039
little blue flashing light at our

667
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,359
driveway at our gate looked like a cop

668
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,679
light and I wasn't growing in the house

669
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,278
we were living in but there was

670
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,080
something going on next door that I was

671
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,519
worried about and I had wheed in the

672
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:27,480
house and um I think we I had a

673
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,359
separated garage that had some equipment

674
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,880
and maybe some trim in it so I was a

675
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,398
little nervous when I see the blue light

676
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,399
out there and next thing you know in the

677
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,519
headlights I see all these bodies

678
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:37,759
running towards us towards the house and

679
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,119
I screamed my girlfriend like I think

680
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,319
the cops are here I think the cops are

681
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,359
here and just like that they started

682
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:45,439
smashing the front door a couple other

683
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,678
went around the back they pepper sprayed

684
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,798
one of the dogs we had on the property

685
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,798
to get by them um they got in the

686
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:55,240
sliding glass door and grabbed me put me

687
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,599
in cuffs um basically cover my face and

688
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,359
put me on the ground they grabbed my

689
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,678
chick who was in the other room

690
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,158
and they kind of like how to separate it

691
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,240
at first and I thought we were basically

692
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,919
getting raided because they were all

693
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,000
wearing police uniforms um they all had

694
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,038
guns they all had mask on they're

695
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,960
wearing like the reflector uniform like

696
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,398
bulletproof vest looking uniforms so

697
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,399
they all looked

698
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:17,879
official so that was scary [ __ ] and uh

699
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:20,479
you know we're in a third world country

700
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,039
thinking we're getting busted um so at

701
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,319
some point I start peeking around and I

702
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:27,119
seen they had my girlfriend tied up in

703
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,558
like speaker wire not handcuffs and

704
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,119
immediately that looked fishy to me and

705
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,038
I was like what the [ __ ] going on and

706
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,759
then I I looked around a little more and

707
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,720
they they're kicking me and like telling

708
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,839
me not to look but they're like stealing

709
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,519
[ __ ] out of the house um they're asking

710
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,720
me for money and and and weed or where

711
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,720
the weed was and where the money was in

712
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,159
Spanish and my girlfriend's translating

713
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,519
to me like look they're going to [ __ ]

714
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,159
kill us if you don't give them something

715
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,558
which you know they picked the worst

716
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,679
possible time to come because we had

717
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:57,798
like $300 cash and I had maybe a couple

718
00:25:54,679 --> 00:26:00,240
ounces of weed uh the garage I said had

719
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,079
some like has some these old Mars Hydro

720
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,759
LEDs that weigh like 100 pounds each to

721
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,439
F like they took those they took the bag

722
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,240
of trim nails out in the garage they cut

723
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,759
open our couch looking for money like

724
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,319
they were adamant to find something but

725
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:16,038
they couldn't um so at some point we had

726
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,759
the we had four Rott rers at the time

727
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:20,200
and that buddy of mine that was living

728
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,319
there for years before we moved there

729
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,720
started collecting these dogs and

730
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:24,519
bringing them down there and live there

731
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,919
with four huge rodes so we had one on

732
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,798
our property that was old and three were

733
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,600
next door where the other houses were

734
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,879
and they're all younger and acting super

735
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,798
mean and barking at the walls when the

736
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,559
guy trying to get over there so they had

737
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,639
my girlfriend they're asking her to like

738
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:41,359
let them over and they asked me to let

739
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,799
them over and I was acting like I didn't

740
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,319
know any Spanish which I kind of didn't

741
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,038
at the time um and basically we both

742
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,480
said the same story in different rooms

743
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:51,798
like they're not our dogs they're super

744
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,440
mean I wouldn't trust them and I don't I

745
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,558
can't get over there myself this

746
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,240
basically the story we told them so they

747
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,038
kept taking stuff from the the house I

748
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,640
had like a I think I had a brand new

749
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:03,759
Mini Split unit ac and a box that they

750
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,799
took that was like the most valuable

751
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,200
thing they found um and at some point in

752
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,480
time it just got silent like they all

753
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,080
left I think they heard some some noise

754
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,679
on this on their police scanners that

755
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,759
something was going on or maybe somebody

756
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,919
had heard something or whatever so they

757
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:21,119
all left in a hurry and it just became

758
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,080
like super quiet and Eerie there's no

759
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,798
sounds of dogs or noises going on

760
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,879
anymore and like I got the handcuffs in

761
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,319
front of me and I went and tied her and

762
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,000
we went for help I went next door and

763
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,240
they never got next door luckily thanks

764
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,679
to those dogs and I went and grabbed my

765
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,359
friend who never heard a thing because

766
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,840
the next door we had pull bulletproof

767
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,959
glass and the place was really more

768
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:43,839
modern and newer and Ral efficient so he

769
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,240
never heard a thing going on at the

770
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,119
house so I went over there and he cut

771
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,839
the Cuffs off me with a pair of bull

772
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,839
Cutters and basically that was just like

773
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:55,199
a full nightmare um so I had to made the

774
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,839
decision if we were going to stay down

775
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,200
there or go back to Florida what we we

776
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,599
going to do because because we like I

777
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,000
said we given up everything at that

778
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:05,240
point in Florida and living down there

779
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,119
was it was beautiful you know but just

780
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,880
this [ __ ] happened but like I said that

781
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,518
I felt like because they didn't get

782
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,720
anything and they didn't find anything

783
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,640
or see anything going on that we were

784
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,759
kind of in the clear I felt like a bit

785
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,880
so I decided

786
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:22,038
to make the call to stay down there and

787
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,880
we went ahead and like fixed up the

788
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:28,038
house and I got new windows and new bars

789
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,880
on the doors and cameras I got a couple

790
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:33,158
guns and we had another dog or two to

791
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,840
our pack and um we made the call to stay

792
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,039
I wasn't growing there anymore obviously

793
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:40,439
after that but um we made the decision

794
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:41,960
to stay there and you know after a while

795
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,320
things started to like just started to

796
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,519
settle and it was going back normal

797
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:49,439
again to this day if a bark a barking

798
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:51,240
dog is outside at night my fiance she

799
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,120
jumps up in her sleep and freaks out

800
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,880
she's got PTSD badly from that but other

801
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:57,918
than that um you know we luckily we made

802
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,360
through safe

803
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,120
I actually had a gun in my head and

804
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,199
they're doing a countdown multiple times

805
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,518
talking about if you don't give us the

806
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,720
weed and the drugs or the drugs and the

807
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,359
money were basically going to kill you

808
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,600
and I just didn't know what was going on

809
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,639
I was playing stupid and somehow we made

810
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:16,798
it through that night that's incredible

811
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,960
I mean you know I can totally understand

812
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,278
why your girlfriend would be so

813
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,278
traumatized that sounds very intense to

814
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,759
say the least and yeah staying down

815
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,640
there bold move how did how did that

816
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,200
play out were you were you growing it a

817
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,480
different place cuz you said you weren't

818
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,240
growing there were you growing somewhere

819
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,798
else and selling the weed locally well I

820
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,200
had a little house next door that I was

821
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:37,480
growing in and that's where they're

822
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,080
trying to get to but like I said the

823
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,000
Rott wers kept them out um and we were

824
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,158
selling the weed to Americans that live

825
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,558
down there and people that would come

826
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,159
and go traveling I had a friend that had

827
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,200
a restaurant there that he would help

828
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:50,880
out um we had a good amount of friends

829
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,960
that lived there for years too that

830
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,278
would you know it it moved pretty good

831
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,880
and actually the prices stay nice and

832
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,200
high there for years too until later on

833
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,000
somebody from California started

834
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,960
shipping containers of weed down there

835
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,398
and brought prices down from like 4,000

836
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,000
a pound to like 2,000

837
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,038
overnight so there was that but actually

838
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,798
now it's legal down there in this in the

839
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:13,038
country we're in um I think it's at

840
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:15,359
least medical and it's getting ready to

841
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,759
go recreational soon I want to say so

842
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,158
things have changed when we were there

843
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:20,119
if you would have gotten caught you know

844
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,320
you're looking at some third world jail

845
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,558
and prison time and definitely way

846
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,398
sketchier than doing time here in

847
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:30,200
America certainly certainly so what was

848
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:32,239
it that uh stimulated you to make the

849
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,080
return to

850
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,079
Florida well um somewhere later on

851
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,558
actually it was covid and the whole

852
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,960
lockdown thing that we thought where we

853
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,440
were was going to be super like lenient

854
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,079
and like easy going but for whatever

855
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,440
reason um they became like super strict

856
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,519
and tyrannical like they had nightly

857
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,000
curfews and the beaches were closed and

858
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,880
there was even Surfers were being shot

859
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,119
at by the cops were like going surfing a

860
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,399
couple times times so at some point we

861
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,839
started to get sick of it they had the

862
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,839
borders closed so we kind of felt

863
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,158
trapped you know at the time so I made a

864
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,638
decision that as soon as the borders

865
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,159
were open again we were going to try and

866
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:12,479
make the callado go somewhere else and

867
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,720
at the time I was thinking Florida

868
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,798
California I wasn't sure but um we ended

869
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,480
up selling with Florida the reason we

870
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:21,798
chose Florida also because at this point

871
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,480
in time I was talking to somebody after

872
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:27,558
I came out who was working in a company

873
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,480
in in Miami Florida and they were

874
00:31:27,558 --> 00:31:32,278
building a huge bro with intentions of

875
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,038
getting a license from the next round of

876
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:35,880
license that licenses that Florida was

877
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:37,839
supposed to give out because in the

878
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,480
beginning um when they gave out their

879
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,079
original amount it was only 22 and there

880
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,519
was all vertical so it's only large

881
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,079
corporations involved in Florida and

882
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,359
they didn't get one at that time for

883
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,720
whatever reason so they're waiting on

884
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:52,678
the next batch and Florida kept kicking

885
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,319
the can down the road down the road

886
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,000
further and further and it kept dragging

887
00:31:54,319 --> 00:32:00,879
on so the second they opened the borders

888
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,798
in the in Central America they we got

889
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,639
back here to Florida actually I found a

890
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,679
house on Craigslist and it was owner

891
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:09,599
finance which always worked out good for

892
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,080
me and because I didn't think I had

893
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,638
credit and I didn't have that much money

894
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:17,240
at the time so we found this place on

895
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:19,079
Craiglist on owner finance um deal and

896
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,759
it was during the lockdown so I couldn't

897
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,359
even actually see it in person we had a

898
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,038
friend come and check out the plays and

899
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,759
do an inspection for us um we did a deal

900
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:27,960
that seemed sketchy through a small

901
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:29,798
title company and I thought we were

902
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,159
getting robbed at some point but it all

903
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:34,558
went through and worked out um so the

904
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,360
guy in Miami I was talking about they

905
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,119
had the company they were still waiting

906
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:39,638
on their license but he made it sound

907
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:41,719
like within a year they would have it

908
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:43,759
for sure and you know I've been to I

909
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,960
visited their grow a couple times from

910
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,798
from where we were living and it had a

911
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,360
super you know high-tech thousand light

912
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:52,480
giant building and they were doing all

913
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,879
these big rooms in and stuff and so it

914
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,440
seemed for sure they're going to get it

915
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,480
it's just a matter of time so my mind we

916
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,639
were coming back back to work there do

917
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,319
some sort of a deal with him um and

918
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:04,638
they're going to grow my genetics and

919
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:08,960
maybe launch my brand there and that was

920
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:10,798
the plan anyway so a year went by and uh

921
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,519
they never got the license yet and still

922
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,638
haven't gotten it to this day and at

923
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,120
some point in time actually it was a

924
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:18,599
couple years gone by since then but um I

925
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,839
had to sell one of my places down there

926
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,678
where we lived in Central

927
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:25,000
America and brought that money back here

928
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,038
and we were kind of living off that for

929
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,240
a while and it was starting to run out

930
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,679
and these guys still hadn't got a

931
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,120
license and things are starting to look

932
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,038
like where are we going to go next and

933
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,278
somebody I had met at one of the emerald

934
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:39,440
cups uh years prior actually the same

935
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:42,000
year I think you were there 2019 I want

936
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,159
to say he's uh one of these guys that's

937
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,440
from Miami he's Dominican and Cuban and

938
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,639
he's part of the whole Washington

939
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,320
Heights New York Haze group um so he's

940
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:54,278
down here in Florida along with another

941
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:56,038
friend of his a partner that was Cuban

942
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:58,798
and we all met at the Aral cup and we

943
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:00,558
talked on social media all the time um

944
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:02,359
They Se that nothing was going on I was

945
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:06,079
sitting around doing nothing and one of

946
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:08,358
them hit me up uh this Freedom Town

947
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,000
Holdings is the name of their company

948
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:12,119
and they got a they got a deal with one

949
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,679
of the big companies here um I guess the

950
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,480
first five or grandfather in the chance

951
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,039
or the opportunity to hire outside

952
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,519
Health to manage their grow for so they

953
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,119
got a deal with one of the big companies

954
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:26,280
here to build a grow um and then run it

955
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,000
for them and basically produce the

956
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,720
flower for this big company so they hit

957
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,239
me up and they're like hey I see you're

958
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,559
not working for the other guys yet they

959
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,439
haven't got a license yet you want to

960
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:38,239
come talk with us maybe so that's how

961
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,200
that started so I went and visited their

962
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,039
grow and we started conversations back

963
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:46,199
and forth about what we could do and how

964
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,440
this might work and uh back and forth

965
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,039
for a few months and like I said the

966
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,838
money was starting to run out I was

967
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:55,199
painting as much as I can and trying to

968
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:58,559
live off art my my fiance she teaches

969
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,679
yoga so we were just kind of getting by

970
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,279
um paying our bills and living here in

971
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:05,759
Florida and then this opportunity came

972
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,839
along so since I couldn't legally grow

973
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,480
here without worrying about things again

974
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:10,799
now I have you know I have a record now

975
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,000
so at this point I didn't want to take a

976
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,960
chance so she didn't want me to do it

977
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,519
either so I jumped on the legal game and

978
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,240
took these guys up on their offer and

979
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,759
since then we've worked out something

980
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:24,439
where you know it's like uh get some

981
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,680
royalties from them growing my genetics

982
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,440
and they have them all throughout the

983
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:31,719
state um I visit the grow every week and

984
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,079
we talk every day you know via you know

985
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:36,358
cell phone or video phone or whatever it

986
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,720
might be um I go there as much as I can

987
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:40,519
it's a couple hours away from me or I go

988
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,719
there every day otherwise um but yeah

989
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,280
that's that's how that whole thing

990
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:45,000
started so I jumped from one company to

991
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,960
another the other company I was really

992
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,199
going to work for they still haven't got

993
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,519
the license and there's you know they

994
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,879
got their grow sitting there just kind

995
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,599
of like collecting dust now I guess

996
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,160
they're finishing up and they should be

997
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,599
getting a license soon but if I had

998
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,118
waited for them we would have been dead

999
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,079
broke and probably back to let America

1000
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,838
by

1001
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,920
now wow that's an interesting Journey

1002
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:04,440
you've come along and do you have any

1003
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,838
plans for the future I know you've

1004
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,838
mentioned the name origin select to

1005
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:12,239
me well yeah that's the brand that we

1006
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,199
got going on here now um so origin

1007
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:17,679
selects is like a side brand within

1008
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:20,199
Freedom Town Holdings um sold that

1009
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:23,799
fluent which is Statewide they have like

1010
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:26,000
33 locations now um and basically it's

1011
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,000
it's a small menu of my personal

1012
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,318
favorites including triangle Kush

1013
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,440
there's OG Kush on there and a couple

1014
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:33,759
different ones we have we have a bunch

1015
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,440
of stuff that we're finding from my

1016
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,839
Siege right now we did some big seed

1017
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,119
hunts of like 100 each we have a y that

1018
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,880
we have we're about to pick a couple of

1019
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,960
which is a wildlife cross OG Kush and

1020
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:52,160
that came from Josh and his

1021
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:55,519
crew um we have Tahiti lime crossed with

1022
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,159
a lemon roale which we're calling Tahiti

1023
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,400
twist but then the state made us change

1024
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:01,639
it because it sounds too much like a

1025
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,960
candy so now it's going to be Tahiti

1026
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,838
Royale um that was what something I made

1027
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,079
down there in Latin America too then we

1028
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,480
have um a handful of others basically

1029
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,359
but they're all pretty much TK or OG

1030
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,199
related um I'm G to try and work on

1031
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,679
getting some seeds made with that

1032
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:22,318
Colombian gold Panama Red that I told

1033
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:24,239
you about earlier with those guys

1034
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:27,000
hopefully um it' be nice to search some

1035
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,799
of those um and some of the guys Freedom

1036
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,599
Town they're all on the haze thing so

1037
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,480
they have a lot of hazes that they grow

1038
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,720
there um they have like a Mexican

1039
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,199
lemonade and a cake boss and a few

1040
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,598
different things that are like Haze

1041
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:40,000
related that take a little longer to

1042
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,760
finish so they're they're trying to keep

1043
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,039
ha get hazes going on in the market here

1044
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,599
um at first the ogs uh here they didn't

1045
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,119
really take off super fast and I didn't

1046
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,838
expect them to because it's more of a

1047
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,119
California thing um but like once people

1048
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:56,318
started to hear the story a little bit

1049
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,160
more and actually go in and try some of

1050
00:37:56,318 --> 00:38:00,239
the FL power you know is starting to

1051
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,960
build up a little of a momentum now and

1052
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,519
they're selling out a lot faster the

1053
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,240
first couple batches actually were like

1054
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,880
I told you about the hurricane earlier

1055
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:08,559
we had some stress from the hurricane

1056
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,200
and the first couple batches were plants

1057
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,519
that had got beat up from the hurricanes

1058
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,799
and then the building was still not up

1059
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,800
the par we were fixing rooms and AC's

1060
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,960
and chillers were not working properly

1061
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,000
and CO2 kept going and you know was like

1062
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,720
the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars

1063
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,519
like it worked great but you had to like

1064
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,598
keep working on it and keep banging

1065
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,880
things around and fixing stuff that's

1066
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,880
that's are like our common joke about

1067
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,039
the

1068
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,039
building that's cool to hear that you

1069
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,559
know from the the story as well as that

1070
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,400
you got the the menu curated by yourself

1071
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:39,199
and I like that we hear a little bit

1072
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,559
about some sativas in the mix I don't

1073
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,358
know if you've actually said it yet do

1074
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,559
you have a soft spot for sativas at all

1075
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:46,679
or you just more of like an indicia

1076
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,480
dude um like I said earlier I like

1077
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:50,199
mixing things up I don't know it's

1078
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,800
something I've always done I guess the

1079
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:54,919
more flavors I have in my collection the

1080
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,359
better at all given times um so I always

1081
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,200
have some sorts of TAA around

1082
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,039
um yeah I'm definitely have a solid spot

1083
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,318
for some good satif I never like growing

1084
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,800
it indoors as opposed to smoking it

1085
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:06,318
because usually growing them the good

1086
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,839
ones indoors or you know you're talking

1087
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:10,800
100 plus days and here in Florida we

1088
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:12,920
didn't really have that option A lot of

1089
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,960
times because you know once things got

1090
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,519
stinky it was time to like start

1091
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,679
worrying about taking things down before

1092
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:20,679
your neighbor started learning what was

1093
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:22,919
going on so because of that we never

1094
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:24,679
even let the triangle or the O well not

1095
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,159
the OG but the triangle I never let back

1096
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:29,559
in the day go beyond 6 days I think was

1097
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,759
the max 56 60 days and it was just

1098
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,159
because the whole house was started to

1099
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,319
sink around the property and your gate

1100
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,118
and your doorway and at that point you

1101
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:38,838
started getting Panic panicky and you

1102
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,800
start taking things down early I guess

1103
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:43,279
so I never even actually ran it a full

1104
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,519
length back then I even had a East Coast

1105
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,040
Sour Diesel for a while back then too

1106
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,719
that was one of the original cuts and I

1107
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,759
think we got that around 94 or no excuse

1108
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,519
me

1109
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,040
2004 um and I ran that one side by side

1110
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,679
with the triangle a lot it came down in

1111
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,400
60 days a lot of times too but it was

1112
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,440
still mostly white hairs and for

1113
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,760
whatever reason it still tasted banging

1114
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,079
and it was everyone loved it but never

1115
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,599
really got a chance to run that a full

1116
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,599
like 75 or 80 Days um the triangle um we

1117
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,680
we've been running in some different

1118
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,440
rooms here we went 80 Days on it

1119
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:18,598
recently and it didn't like that like

1120
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,079
after 70 it started to get bleaching and

1121
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,800
started freaking out a bit didn't really

1122
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,000
look that great at the end compar the

1123
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,839
rooms that come down to like 65

1124
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,800
70 yeah I was going to ask you in fact

1125
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:31,719
you know I hear a lot of varying answers

1126
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,720
I myself I love

1127
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:42,400
OG well I got I was just saying um now

1128
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,599
that we could actually run them longer I

1129
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,318
like 65 to 70 that's my sweet spot

1130
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:48,880
personally when I when I was down there

1131
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:53,239
in Latin America grown them um I was

1132
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,240
pretty much at 65 days on on average um

1133
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:58,000
like back in the day with the TK we

1134
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:59,919
didn't have like this is uh carbon

1135
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,199
filters came around I forget when it was

1136
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,480
close to like around 2000 I want to say

1137
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:08,838
so anything prior to that was just

1138
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,039
super odor like stinky problems outside

1139
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,679
your house so you always had to worry

1140
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,400
about that especially like those those

1141
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,000
plants earlier the super skunk has

1142
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,358
plants a lot of people I know actually

1143
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,880
got busted for growing like a single

1144
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:19,598
light of those those genetics back in

1145
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,000
the day and like a lot of them only got

1146
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,920
probation because it was small small

1147
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,960
vouches but I would pull up to a couple

1148
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,039
friends houses and my car windows open

1149
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,599
just sm all that stuff like blocks away

1150
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,920
like holy [ __ ] you gotta get that stuff

1151
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:35,200
out of here now um so but yeah back then

1152
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,720
before carbon filters everything came

1153
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,719
down sooner than it should have

1154
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,838
obviously it was just because of smell

1155
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,318
we used to made these big garbage cans

1156
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,358
um with pinea and we cut bunch of drill

1157
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:47,639
a bunch of holes around the top of the

1158
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,039
garbage can and put a box fan on top you

1159
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,480
know and fill thing up as much as you

1160
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:55,400
can halfway with like pinea and that was

1161
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,199
our like makeshift smell um cover at the

1162
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,559
time along with like maybe some ozone

1163
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,039
machines back then that were super

1164
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,799
unhealthy to breathe like that I just

1165
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,279
hat hated that stuff we had them over

1166
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,318
the doorways of our houses but they

1167
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,119
didn't really do much but they give you

1168
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:12,239
a sore throat um and I think carbon

1169
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:13,680
filters came around closer to like 98 99

1170
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,759
I want to say or something maybe a

1171
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,879
little sooner but we weren't getting

1172
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,880
them in the stores here until later um

1173
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,559
speaking of carbon filters I never knew

1174
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,079
they were full of like little tiny

1175
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,119
charcoal bees inside until I had gotten

1176
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,960
busted and and uh the cops basically had

1177
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,160
fun of my house with sledgehammer and

1178
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,400
just destroyed probably like six large

1179
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,838
carment filters and they were spread

1180
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,039
across the entire house these little

1181
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,920
charcoal like BBS that basically stained

1182
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:43,279
everything all the carpets all the tile

1183
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,159
the walls like it was some mess it took

1184
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,160
like a month between that

1185
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:51,920
house wow that's

1186
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,919
intense so a few questions ago we were

1187
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,599
talking about sativas and I definitely

1188
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,480
wanted to ask you because I've notice

1189
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,920
how talented you are at Art how has

1190
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,920
cannabis affected your creativity and

1191
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,000
specifically your art do you find

1192
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,838
specific strains you know interact with

1193
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,599
your ability to create art differently

1194
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,440
to others and what's your take on the

1195
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,880
whole cannabis influencing

1196
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,559
art oh absolutely um like as long as

1197
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,880
I've been enjoying painting it's always

1198
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:23,079
had to be weed involved so normally I

1199
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,280
would have my bong and my lighter or I

1200
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,079
use herb iron now CU I don't like butane

1201
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,000
from the lighters anymore

1202
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,839
um and so that was always part of the

1203
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,079
process basically that's you know

1204
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,440
getting super high whether it's TAA or

1205
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:37,119
Indigo or whatever it would be that's

1206
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,318
where my ideas would come from um at

1207
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,440
first it started off my painting started

1208
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:43,199
off as like f surf breaks around the

1209
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,000
world and I was usually just giving them

1210
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:48,598
out as to friends or you know like as

1211
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,039
presents or whatever to family on

1212
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,519
holidays and over a time like once I got

1213
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:55,079
involved with that clothing company I

1214
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,559
told you about earlier crypto clothing

1215
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,559
in the 90s um that's when I started to

1216
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,079
put a little bit more effort into

1217
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:04,119
creating paintings of like beach Scapes

1218
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,160
and surf spots and putting them on

1219
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,519
shirts um and that's when it kind of

1220
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,679
gave me a little bit more of a spar to

1221
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:12,039
like started painting for a living and

1222
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,279
as like a side job kind of thing um

1223
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,639
which I enjoyed so it was went hand in

1224
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,079
hand and yeah I was definitely always St

1225
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:21,358
when I smoked or when I painted I mean

1226
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,760
it was always part of the process for

1227
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,358
sure and since I came out in the last

1228
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,760
five years I never painted weave before

1229
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:29,719
because I never thought it would really

1230
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,160
something be something I would sell or

1231
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:33,719
people would be interested in but once I

1232
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,799
started painting a couple canvas plants

1233
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:37,480
here and there I gave one or two away to

1234
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,960
the guy that was going to do the Miami

1235
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,039
farm and get me down there they're going

1236
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,519
to probably still have them on their

1237
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,318
office walls once they get them up and

1238
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,920
running but uh it was later on after

1239
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,719
that actually that I I think I like

1240
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,880
given Josh a painting and a couple other

1241
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:53,919
people and next thing you know is

1242
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,720
getting a lot of compliments and started

1243
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,559
painting more and then a couple original

1244
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:00,439
started selling and started getting a

1245
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:02,640
little demand for it so now just I don't

1246
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,920
just paint beach scenes or waves anymore

1247
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,118
it's pretty much a mixture of weed um

1248
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,039
I've been trying to do some like

1249
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:14,559
different theme stuff like Jaws um and

1250
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:16,880
Astronaut holding a plan on the moon and

1251
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,559
stuff like that so yeah everyone's been

1252
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,800
loving that kind of stuff and actually

1253
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,280
because of um these themed weed projects

1254
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,440
that actually helped me get an IDE deal

1255
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,440
here in Florida because the 33 stores

1256
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,079
that I'm selling my product out of they

1257
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,119
want to have art in all the stores um

1258
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:35,359
and put a QR code next to them and Link

1259
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,079
them to my website so I've been slowly

1260
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,000
working on getting them to as many

1261
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,680
stores I can I think we're in like four

1262
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,440
right now um but there's GNA be more

1263
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:45,199
coming um so yeah that's that's been a

1264
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,960
good part of the process now and now

1265
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:50,879
that I Incorporated weed to my

1266
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,838
painting wow that's epic to hear and I I

1267
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,760
highly encourage everyone to check out

1268
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:57,119
your website or definitely at least the

1269
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,000
Instagram there they're really awesome

1270
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,960
looking artworks for cannabis I really

1271
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,280
enjoy it myself I uh I I wrote down I

1272
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,800
forgot to ask you earlier and I want to

1273
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,400
touch back on it before I forget you

1274
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,240
know way back at the start of the

1275
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,480
episode you mentioned you had um some

1276
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:13,399
experience with the crippy and I wanted

1277
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,760
to hear a little more cuz it's actually

1278
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,160
one we haven't heard much about um even

1279
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,319
across all the episodes we've done with

1280
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,118
people you know no one's really ever had

1281
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:24,400
too much knowledge about it did you know

1282
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,480
anything about it yeah that's a that's

1283
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,680
almost like a whole episode it's self

1284
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,800
but in a nutshell I can tell you that it

1285
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:32,679
was some of the first food I ever smoked

1286
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,200
like going back to that day I was skiing

1287
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:35,519
school and that guy gave me a ride to

1288
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:38,919
the beach with him and the day I met all

1289
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:42,719
those people um he actually had some

1290
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:44,838
cppy on him that day um cppy with a k um

1291
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,799
basically because it was named that

1292
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:48,920
because I'd find out from him and other

1293
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,599
people that the people that were growing

1294
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,039
it were Surfers up here in Central

1295
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,039
Florida and they were like one of the

1296
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:56,519
guys was a pro Surfer he was probably 20

1297
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:59,079
years older than me um he actually won

1298
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:01,400
the Pipeline Masters Surf Contest in

1299
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:02,920
Hawaii like in the 70s when like nobody

1300
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,760
from Florida was winning those things

1301
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,880
back then it was strictly all Hawaiians

1302
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,640
or Australians so he was the first

1303
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,559
breakout person from Florida to win a

1304
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,519
big event like that he happened to be

1305
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:18,319
growing the crippy up here in Central

1306
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:19,880
Florida and uh along with his crew uh so

1307
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:21,400
that was before my time I didn't really

1308
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,880
know those guys that well but I did know

1309
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,480
a lot of his crew and younger friends

1310
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,720
that were involved like there was a few

1311
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,400
Pro Surfers that uh that guy knew that I

1312
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,399
became friends with years later and a

1313
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,160
couple of them actually moved to the

1314
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,280
same country I was living in in Central

1315
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:39,879
America um so that whole thing was uh

1316
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,519
around from I'd like to say 86 87 and

1317
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,960
then those guys were growing until

1318
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,838
around 89 90 when something happened

1319
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,280
where they got busted and that was the

1320
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:52,799
last of that original Kryptonite which

1321
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,839
it went by at the time and it was based

1322
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,359
on the Kryptonite from the Superman

1323
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:59,558
movies and that's why spell with okay

1324
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,480
and that name came about one day in a

1325
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:03,359
van with all those the same guys I was

1326
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,480
just talking about up at Sebastian one

1327
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,679
day surfing smoking a joint and one of

1328
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,880
the guys named Pat who was a pro Surfer

1329
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,199
at the time said man this stuff is so

1330
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,079
strong it's like Kryptonite from the

1331
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:15,639
movie Superman it was like it would kill

1332
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,839
Superman you know so that was like their

1333
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:19,400
phrase and that's how the name

1334
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:23,078
stuck

1335
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,680
so uh that was the same the first weed I

1336
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:27,800
ever seen that was just like absolutely

1337
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,279
incredible um that that guy that gave me

1338
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,720
a ride to the beach that day he had like

1339
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,079
a vile on him and on the way to the

1340
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,318
beach he was telling me the story about

1341
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,119
it and he told me to asked me if I

1342
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,079
smoked first and of course I was like

1343
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,760
yes and he told me to reach under the

1344
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,720
passenger seat I was sitting in and look

1345
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,319
for a film can and I found it pulled it

1346
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:47,118
out and sure enough it was loaded with

1347
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:50,838
this neon green this vibrant sticky

1348
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,119
stinky weed that they call crippy um so

1349
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:55,078
that was like the first generation of

1350
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:56,920
krippy in Florida um krippy short for

1351
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,240
Kryptonite and like I said it's fell

1352
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,240
with a K so not many people knew that

1353
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:03,798
story about the van and how it was named

1354
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:05,479
after the Superman movies um unless you

1355
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:09,119
knew some of those people I guess

1356
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:12,719
involved so after those guys got busted

1357
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,200
around 90 I want to say Miami mango and

1358
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,558
a couple other people I knew were

1359
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:18,639
getting a new batch of cppy that was

1360
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,000
getting shipped in and I guess it just

1361
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,719
kind of took over the name because the

1362
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,280
name was so popular and it just catchy

1363
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,439
and at some point that name kind of

1364
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,319
became like a household term in Florida

1365
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,400
for weed I guess because that original

1366
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,199
one was so good so the next one that

1367
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,920
started coming in that mango was talking

1368
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,118
about and still talks about was shipped

1369
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,599
in supposedly I've heard stories it came

1370
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:43,240
from Seattle area or from Portland um

1371
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,480
somewhere out there in the Northwest and

1372
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:46,159
the reason they say that is because it

1373
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,119
came in these PBC

1374
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,598
tubes uh wrapped in newspapers from out

1375
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,960
there and I guess that's maybe they

1376
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:54,318
somebody said they they did that to

1377
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,000
throw people off where it came from but

1378
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,480
it definitely wasn't grown here that

1379
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,239
batch that second second generation of

1380
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,760
cppy that was brought in or shipped in

1381
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:06,000
from somewhere um and that one was for

1382
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,480
some reason it's just F Crazy Prices

1383
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,358
like people were selling it for 150 a

1384
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,719
quarter of times I think I want to say

1385
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:17,039
like even Miami mango selling her for

1386
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:19,039
like $500 an allance all the time and

1387
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,639
doctors and lawyers and whoever had a

1388
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,358
lot of money the time we just scooping

1389
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:26,920
that [ __ ] up um so that was the one that

1390
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:29,480
was in the 90s and then at some point

1391
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,519
closer to 2000 there was another one

1392
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,159
came around could be just be name

1393
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,719
playing people you know using the name

1394
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:38,480
again of a popular strain but then

1395
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:40,039
there's one called the Tampa crippy that

1396
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,719
a lot of people swear by and I've seen

1397
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:44,599
pictures of that looks a lot like an OG

1398
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:46,118
G type plan or something but uh

1399
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:48,559
different you know like a little like

1400
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,640
meteor looking um and I haven't tried

1401
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,839
that one myself yet I got SE of it to

1402
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,519
try one of these days soon but um I

1403
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:57,119
haven't actually tried that that

1404
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:58,519
original Tampa version so yeah there's

1405
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,480
like three different versions of the

1406
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:01,838
cppy and then I hear people add in a

1407
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,960
fourth one to the mix saying there's one

1408
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,880
that's kind of like hazy it smells like

1409
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,199
Haze when it smoked which I haden't seen

1410
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,599
anything like that yet um you know and

1411
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,480
then of course there's a guy out there

1412
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,480
in Hawaii that claims his dad and

1413
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:17,000
created crippy and um later find out it

1414
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,920
was actually the crippler that they

1415
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,798
started calling the crippy after maybe

1416
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,200
chasing stories from here in Florida and

1417
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:25,039
trying to add something to his story or

1418
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:28,480
whatever I don't know what it was but

1419
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,400
been talk to that guy anymore um so yeah

1420
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,880
that's

1421
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,599
basically that was uh and and then there

1422
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,480
was also the fact that like I said it

1423
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:40,200
became a household name so just like

1424
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,639
indo or greenbud or kind bud or thing

1425
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:44,279
like that crippy became like a term that

1426
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,199
people use for like anything that was

1427
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,640
good grown indoors um and because of

1428
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:52,358
that like when Alec Anderson first came

1429
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:56,318
out into a podcast years ago um before

1430
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:59,798
hearing my story him and Matt um Burger

1431
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:01,759
Bubba basically told the podcast that

1432
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:04,159
they found the OG seed in a bag of

1433
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,240
Florida crippy you know just using the

1434
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:07,920
the term as loose you know like

1435
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,558
household name like I was talking about

1436
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,599
and they didn't really mean it came from

1437
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,760
a actual strand called the cppy but

1438
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,119
basically that threw people off and that

1439
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,559
might have been why that guy in Hawaii

1440
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,200
actually ran with that story and then

1441
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,280
started telling everyone that the OG and

1442
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:22,639
TK actually came from his dad's trippy

1443
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,920
and whatever so yeah there's that part

1444
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:31,440
of that story um yeah time I ever saw

1445
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:34,000
the crippy like like I said I was 15 and

1446
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,200
um the last time I've seen it was in the

1447
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,719
90s they're real crippy yeah okay that

1448
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,798
makes sense because I was going to ask

1449
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:43,239
you a lot of the times you hear crippy

1450
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:46,318
mentioned it's often in relation to like

1451
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:48,519
some relationship to OG so I guess the

1452
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,679
question is given what you've said that

1453
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:52,519
bud you got that day in the film

1454
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:54,118
canister what was it like was it

1455
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:57,000
anything like

1456
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,838
OG uh um I mean I was super young then I

1457
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,440
just know that it was super fire I seen

1458
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:01,599
it a few more times after that I

1459
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,280
actually grabbed some bags here and

1460
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,160
there from my neighbor I want to

1461
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,720
say um I think my dad used to get it

1462
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:09,920
from him too possibly because I used to

1463
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,078
go through my Dad's closet once in a

1464
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,880
while and I'd find little like ounce

1465
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,599
bags that I take a tiny little half

1466
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,200
grand out of and take it to school of me

1467
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,519
and everyone I seen it was blown away I

1468
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:22,118
remember it was just like something most

1469
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:24,199
neon green you'd ever seen and it

1470
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:25,680
definitely had it kind of did have

1471
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:27,598
actually like a big

1472
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,519
kind of structure like in a sense that

1473
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,119
it was like big Acorn shaped nuggets I

1474
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:34,400
want to say but just different it had

1475
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:36,480
way more kick I think it did to it back

1476
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,920
then you know back then I was younger

1477
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,480
and you know you got the thing with

1478
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,159
Nostalgia and maybe if I seen it now

1479
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,719
maybe not as good at the scen back then

1480
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:47,199
than me or whatever but everybody I knew

1481
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:49,519
back then um that I still talk to that

1482
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:50,639
used to get it swears by that being

1483
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,199
still some of the best stuff they've

1484
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:55,039
ever seen even some older guys I know so

1485
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,798
one guy actually I knew that lived up

1486
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,119
here on the beach that I I used to be

1487
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:59,920
friends with and go surf at his house

1488
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:02,640
all the time he bought like a pound of

1489
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,519
it before they got busted and he kept

1490
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,920
that thing for like two years like I

1491
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:07,000
guess he had a buried on his property or

1492
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,639
something and he' pull out like a

1493
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,679
quarter ounce at a time or maybe it was

1494
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,279
frozen um he would pull a quarter ounce

1495
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:15,440
at a time so like for a couple years

1496
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,160
after it had gone away I was SE and smok

1497
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,720
it at this guy's house up here in the

1498
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:21,879
Melbourne Beach area and it was just

1499
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:24,759
like you know I just remember being in

1500
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,760
like this big a barn shape neon green

1501
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,680
nugget that like I don't think they had

1502
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,160
much like hairs or anything to them it

1503
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:33,440
was just kind of like all pod on pod but

1504
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:34,598
real dense looking and it wasn't sealed

1505
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,599
up it wasn't the kind of stuff that was

1506
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:39,079
being shipped in definitely was grown

1507
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,640
here um I definitely know for a fact

1508
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:42,559
like when those guys got busted grown

1509
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,679
here some of the people that were

1510
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,200
involved like left Florida because they

1511
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:48,078
didn't want to get their family involved

1512
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,960
with the mess that might have come later

1513
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,400
one of the guys dad was like a senator

1514
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,039
here in Florida at the time so he went

1515
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,400
down to Central America his couple of

1516
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:57,079
his friends went to Central America too

1517
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,559
at the same time I guess everyone kind

1518
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:01,200
of scattered um but that original guy

1519
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,798
that won the Pipeline Masters he

1520
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,960
definitely got busted in did some time

1521
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:09,079
he's actually still in Hawaii that guy

1522
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,039
that goes by Crawford the last name um

1523
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:12,640
his son actually now is a surfer and he

1524
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:15,079
served really well I think he's almost

1525
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,318
Pro and um I just think he just wants to

1526
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:18,680
be left alone and people try to reach

1527
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:21,000
him to talk about all this stuff with

1528
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:22,798
him and he just kind of to himself and I

1529
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,880
actually have mutual friends of his but

1530
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,280
I never met him myself people I talked

1531
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,000
to I've asked if they could like reach

1532
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,640
out to him Monday and it's just never

1533
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,760
happened yet maybe one day it

1534
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:35,159
will yeah hopefully one day I'm sure

1535
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,200
everyone would love to hear it that's

1536
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:40,440
interesting to hear all about the crippy

1537
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:42,439
um yeah very interesting you mentioned

1538
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,079
nostalgia in there and I wanted to ask

1539
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:48,679
you this question a lot of people I

1540
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:52,119
think look at OG and TK to an extension

1541
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:54,519
as well in in a sense is sort of the

1542
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,280
last big name before cookies really

1543
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:58,798
rolled onto the scene and just started

1544
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,760
to dominate everything and some people

1545
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:03,280
have the view that you know we've really

1546
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,200
started to bottleneck a lot of genetics

1547
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,319
especially in the context of you know

1548
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:10,759
each strain seems to be in that very

1549
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:13,119
desert menu style sort of um genetic

1550
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,119
lineage my question is would you agree

1551
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,760
do you feel like we've started to

1552
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:18,440
bottleneck and more specifically do you

1553
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,160
think OG and TK were like the last stop

1554
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,000
before that or do you think like that's

1555
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:24,440
not necessarily the

1556
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,599
case I think a lot of good things have

1557
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,358
come across or come around since then I

1558
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:31,160
would say but like as far as the OG or

1559
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:33,759
as far as the cookies and gelato and

1560
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:35,118
stuff goes um I'm not the biggest fan of

1561
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,880
most of them but I've definitely come

1562
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,599
across some really good crosses like

1563
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,358
Skittles um this yog I was talking about

1564
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:43,480
which is incorporat wildlife which is

1565
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:46,078
like cherry

1566
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:48,599
pie um so those are really good I come

1567
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,920
across but they're also acrossed with OG

1568
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:54,920
so it's not like a direct um Cookie by

1569
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,838
itself which cookie has OG in it too so

1570
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,798
I mean that's in there but I know what

1571
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:00,199
you're saying it's basically I hear the

1572
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:02,400
same thing from a lot of people about

1573
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:04,159
the breeding is going too far in that

1574
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,000
direction and most of the West Coast is

1575
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,000
just kind of leaning towards the purple

1576
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,318
gelados and those kind of genetics

1577
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,159
lately and that's what everyone's

1578
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:12,719
breeding with actually have friends that

1579
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:14,000
are on the legal Market out there and

1580
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:15,959
like they can't sell anything that's

1581
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,159
green like everything they grow has to

1582
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,199
be purple or the buyers come and they

1583
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:21,480
just like pass it up and they won't even

1584
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:23,199
buy it or they basic have to sell

1585
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:27,400
something in green for like $1,000 less

1586
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,279
a pound type thing so that's part of it

1587
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,200
pretty sure because such you know the

1588
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,480
West Coast plays a big part in this

1589
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,798
whole weed thing and they have a lot of

1590
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,798
hip-hop scene a lot of rap

1591
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:40,719
culture pretty sure you know burner from

1592
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,798
cookies and a lot of people had a big

1593
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,439
part of all that as far as like making

1594
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,559
these genetics blow up like they did and

1595
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,119
the rappers all singing about them and

1596
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,079
you know the sherbets and this that and

1597
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:54,920
the other so yeah it's it's hard to say

1598
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:57,119
that um um whether it's it's being Bott

1599
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,720
NE in that direction completely but I

1600
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,920
mean I definitely in the underground

1601
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,118
scene there's definitely a lot of people

1602
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,280
growing some radical sativas and mixing

1603
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:08,160
up you know skunks andh stuff like that

1604
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,400
you know like Tom mccormic selling a

1605
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:10,838
bunch of different seeds from like the

1606
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:14,280
Northern Lights now and bringing back

1607
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:15,318
all those old genetics and uh skunks and

1608
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,079
there's definitely a lot of hazes

1609
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:19,199
getting mixed in the work now now that

1610
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:22,839
New York's coming on up there they love

1611
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:24,279
the hazes so like my buddy here that one

1612
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:26,038
of the owners of the company he's from

1613
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,319
that scene there like I said he's got a

1614
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,680
friend up there named white boy Kev and

1615
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,480
he came out of hiding recently too and

1616
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:34,838
so he's all up in the scene he's he's

1617
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,519
one of the the the Dominican crew that

1618
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:39,880
was selling the piff and the black hayze

1619
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:41,559
over there for years so yeah I mean

1620
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,119
that's I was actually up at an event up

1621
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,960
there recently the scene up there is

1622
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,798
blowing up like everyone up there is

1623
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,159
buying shitloads of weed it's probably

1624
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:49,960
one of the biggest markets in America

1625
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:52,078
right now even though they're fumbling

1626
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,599
their legal game and legal licensing and

1627
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,519
all that stuff right now like the state

1628
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,200
keeps postponing everyone's getting

1629
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:00,199
[ __ ] um the underground scene out

1630
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:02,598
there is crazy like we went to pcon

1631
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:04,199
recently and it was just out of control

1632
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:06,519
everyone had tables like was a flea

1633
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:09,159
market just selling tons and tons of

1634
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:11,440
hazes and all kinds of Exotics that um

1635
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:14,199
like an African Haze are in too and a

1636
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,920
couple like really cool um plants you

1637
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:19,199
know that weren't just strictly gelato

1638
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,599
or whatever so it's good to see there's

1639
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,719
a mix of everything going on right now

1640
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,440
and um I would say the West Coast Market

1641
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:27,199
definitely is leaning towards that more

1642
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,880
than everywhere else I would say yeah it

1643
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:31,558
is awesome to see you know the

1644
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,039
Resurgence of uh the haze and to an

1645
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:35,839
extent I've seen like you know a lot of

1646
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:37,720
sour heads given a bit of a push so

1647
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:40,199
really cool to see things coming around

1648
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:42,519
and I wanted to ask you do you have any

1649
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:44,078
plans to make any seeds if so what sort

1650
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:46,599
of stuff would you want to

1651
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,200
do I have a couple little collabs going

1652
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:50,760
on at the moment I'm still going through

1653
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:53,798
seeds that I in myself while stuck on

1654
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,640
lockdowns um but out of that stuff we

1655
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:58,038
found a lot of interesting stuff for my

1656
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:59,519
menu here in Florida um I have another

1657
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:04,920
project going on which going to be

1658
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:06,798
mostly ogs out west um at the moment um

1659
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,599
so yeah I'm working on a few things I'd

1660
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,079
definitely like to get a little bit more

1661
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:12,960
into it and start putting some other

1662
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:14,839
genetics together with the OG and TKA

1663
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,960
like for example I was talking about the

1664
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:19,519
Colombian gold Panama Red would be a

1665
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,039
really nice proc I think to one of them

1666
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:24,199
um so we're working on things like that

1667
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,359
I gave my buddy uh some TK back proces

1668
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:29,318
that I had worked on a couple times so

1669
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:31,199
it's like actually bx2 now so he's going

1670
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:34,159
try and find a couple nail on there that

1671
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,919
we can maybe use and so yeah there a few

1672
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:38,639
projects going

1673
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,880
on yeah that's cool and I guess you know

1674
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:44,920
as a bit of an extension who are some

1675
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:48,559
breeders whose work you admire or

1676
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:51,400
enjoy um personally I have gone through

1677
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,880
a nice collection of swamp boys gear

1678
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:57,160
archive seeds so when I was living down

1679
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,280
there and Central America um before I

1680
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:01,598
created

1681
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:03,839
Origins um I had reached out to Chrome

1682
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:06,318
after hearing stories about those guys

1683
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:08,679
being related to Triangle and at some

1684
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:11,400
point I realized that the guy we got our

1685
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:13,159
cut from was associated with them or

1686
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,519
partners with them or worked with them

1687
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:17,960
or something they were just close

1688
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:21,119
friends I guess so we hit it off at

1689
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,880
first and um this before Origins was

1690
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,720
around they sent me a nice care package

1691
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,720
down there um and out of those I found

1692
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:31,000
the lemon Royale to be my favorite I

1693
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:33,399
found a real nice female and I found a

1694
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,159
male and I made bunch of seeds with that

1695
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,760
mail a couple other males I had down

1696
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:40,960
there like a donkey dog OG and um

1697
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,480
actually Matt Ry gave me a banana tie

1698
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:46,079
which I found a nice mail from I had a

1699
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,318
platinum sherb and a couple other males

1700
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,000
that I collected pollen and just little

1701
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:52,798
like projects here and there just

1702
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,798
paintbrush projects and I actually did a

1703
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:58,358
a couple closets that I set up a mail

1704
01:01:55,798 --> 01:02:00,358
the Lemar in and a mail of the donkey

1705
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:02,400
dog so all the seeds I made down there

1706
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:04,838
were just small projects but made a lot

1707
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,240
more than I expected to actually some of

1708
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:11,239
the stuff is archives work too I had his

1709
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:12,919
P Loco and his uh Tahiti lime which I

1710
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:16,199
found a real nice one I had a black

1711
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:18,318
triangle from bod I had a love triangle

1712
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:20,679
also from Bodie um that was actually one

1713
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:22,318
of my favorites down there had like a

1714
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:25,159
kind of a cherry Play-Doh kind of

1715
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:28,400
aftertaste smell

1716
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:30,920
um so yeah out of the seeds at this

1717
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,039
legal spot now we've been doing like 50

1718
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,480
to 100 at a time and out of those

1719
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:38,799
bouches we've been finding some real

1720
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:42,440
nice stuff um the lemon rale I had down

1721
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:45,000
there had a real Tangy lemon tree but

1722
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:47,318
like gas kind of mix going on and it

1723
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
made good size plants that was that was

1724
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:53,400
my keeper and I made a bunch of seed

1725
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:57,318
with that one um hit it to the triangle

1726
01:02:53,400 --> 01:03:00,039
back cross I hit uh I hit the original

1727
01:02:57,318 --> 01:03:02,400
TK the original G with the mail I had of

1728
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:05,720
it so just little batches from those we

1729
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:09,559
been finding stuff in um we recently

1730
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:11,598
went through 60 yog that TR gave me that

1731
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:13,760
were super nice we ended up keeping like

1732
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,318
eight then we got a narrow down still to

1733
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,799
two

1734
01:03:15,318 --> 01:03:20,519
um the Tahiti lime I crossed to the lon

1735
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:23,920
we found one that was real similar in

1736
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:24,920
chirps to the original uh lar I had down

1737
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,240
there

1738
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,960
so yeah I've been working with those

1739
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,639
guys things for the last few years um

1740
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,519
archives definitely made some nice stuff

1741
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:35,078
I like all this Moon B gear I like all

1742
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:38,639
the face off

1743
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:40,920
crosses um other than that I've had I

1744
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,358
have this plant some game here called

1745
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:47,159
the Platinum

1746
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:51,480
TK um which was in-house seeds Platinum

1747
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:54,598
cush I think it was kush mins cross to a

1748
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:57,278
bully cush um that the guy selected and

1749
01:03:54,599 --> 01:04:00,240
said had a very TK leg trait bully Kush

1750
01:03:57,278 --> 01:04:02,798
was from C junkie and that was a

1751
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:06,118
triangle to Triangle backcross I think

1752
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:07,798
it was BX so yeah just kind of like

1753
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:10,760
trying to stay within that frame but

1754
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:12,838
find different stuff um trying to like

1755
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,720
keep it to where it's TK or OG related

1756
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:17,038
for you know for my

1757
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:18,598
menu um but yeah like right now I'm

1758
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,880
working on a project at West with some

1759
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:24,760
guys that are probably going to be the

1760
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:26,039
92 OG and the ghost OG and the TK

1761
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,359
and then they're going to be hitting up

1762
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:31,559
with some of their stuff soon so maybe

1763
01:04:28,358 --> 01:04:33,880
doing some reversal projects as well

1764
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:36,640
hopefully that's cool to hear and you've

1765
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:39,079
got me thinking I wanted to ask you like

1766
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:41,879
as a company that's offering like

1767
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:43,720
primarily ogs in today's market do you

1768
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,480
find there is still the demand there or

1769
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:47,639
do you feel like people want that you

1770
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:50,880
know purple gas candy

1771
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:53,400
thing well what we do is uh we only do

1772
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,160
like small Bates at a time that way they

1773
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,680
don't sit around too long on shelves so

1774
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,920
we do like probably 10 lights for

1775
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:02,318
example and that that will feed 30 plus

1776
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,318
Stores um so by the time the next batch

1777
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:08,199
comes out that one sold out and so I

1778
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:10,639
have I'm gonna probably have one genetic

1779
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:12,038
in all the rooms so it'll be like 11

1780
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:15,199
different ones going at all times I'm

1781
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:18,720
GNA have a sour diesel a couple of G's

1782
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:21,159
the TK then I have like a lemon crust I

1783
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,239
have the Tahiti lime and a couple other

1784
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:25,759
Tangy ones I have the cheddar Koy which

1785
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:28,318
is from my friend in Hawaii gave some

1786
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:32,359
seeds and um that one's super different

1787
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:35,318
too that was like a big island koi cross

1788
01:05:32,358 --> 01:05:36,440
to Mo I think was from chog gentics

1789
01:05:35,318 --> 01:05:40,318
which was like a

1790
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:42,119
cheese um crost and I think what else

1791
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,480
was in that one I think there might have

1792
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:47,318
been like a Hell's Angel OG and cheese

1793
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,559
cross to that big island so yeah there

1794
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:52,358
some different stuff um and then we have

1795
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,720
we're working on like I said getting

1796
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:57,598
some sort of more like sativa thing on

1797
01:05:54,719 --> 01:06:01,118
my menu as well soon um so yeah trying

1798
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:02,640
to mix it up as far as EOG and the TK at

1799
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,920
first the first couple batches that went

1800
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,558
out the market wasn't really ready for

1801
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:09,358
yet and it kind of sat for like a month

1802
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:11,000
month and a half even and when they

1803
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:12,759
first went out we had we had some

1804
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,920
packaging issues where the packaging

1805
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,760
room humidity sensors were off and like

1806
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,119
some of the stuff was going out good

1807
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,599
some of it was going out a little bit

1808
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:22,519
moist so we had to correct all those

1809
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:24,160
issues and and basically almost had to

1810
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:26,400
do like a relaunch to get it out there

1811
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:28,118
again and and once we fixed that things

1812
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,318
have been really good and things have

1813
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:30,358
been selling out every time and

1814
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,239
everyone's been really happy with

1815
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:33,798
everything and a lot of people here in

1816
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,879
Florida like our Market's 10 years

1817
01:06:33,798 --> 01:06:37,079
behind the West Coast you know because

1818
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,880
just because the way things have always

1819
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,440
been so people here aren't as educated

1820
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,079
and the majority of the people here that

1821
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,480
are in the market have a med card which

1822
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:48,798
the market here is completely

1823
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,719
monopolized and like it's all you know

1824
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:53,278
it's in favor of these big companies and

1825
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:55,480
until that changes we can't have any

1826
01:06:53,278 --> 01:06:57,239
home growth and um they was actually

1827
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,318
trying to go recreational next year

1828
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:00,358
sponsored by one of the biggest

1829
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:02,199
companies here now but they haven't had

1830
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:04,318
hung grow added yet which no one's

1831
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:06,480
really happy about um we'll see what

1832
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:08,880
happens with that but um yeah I think

1833
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,278
when the when the market kind of like

1834
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,480
comes

1835
01:07:10,278 --> 01:07:14,599
to uh gets a little bit closer to

1836
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,318
recreational and people's you know like

1837
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:18,880
right now you have to go to a doctor in

1838
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,599
twice a year and it's cost like $150 or

1839
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,119
$200 a year I think it is to keep your

1840
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:23,480
med card going and then there's the

1841
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:24,880
whole thing with the guns here where a

1842
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,798
lot of people just don't want to have a

1843
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,278
med card because they can't have a legal

1844
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:32,559
gun so yeah a lot of things got to

1845
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:34,278
change first um before out here like

1846
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,960
basically people are just not educated

1847
01:07:34,278 --> 01:07:38,079
like I said like in California so

1848
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,720
they're slowly getting there you know

1849
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:43,318
we're catching up fast but same time

1850
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:46,000
we're still way behind um so it' be nice

1851
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:47,759
to see um if if it went recreational

1852
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,079
then obviously it's going to open up for

1853
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,480
everybody more hopefully they're going

1854
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:52,119
to get out more licenses and maybe

1855
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,400
they'll even let people have smaller mom

1856
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:56,278
and pop businesses eventually but as of

1857
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,880
right now it's just these huge

1858
01:07:56,278 --> 01:08:00,278
Juggernaut companies that are running

1859
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,960
things and I don't know if there the

1860
01:08:00,278 --> 01:08:04,639
governor here or just politics in

1861
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:07,278
general big Pharma whatever is really

1862
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:09,000
behind it the most but it's stayed that

1863
01:08:07,278 --> 01:08:10,358
way since we've been back here and we

1864
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,880
were hoping it would change by now a

1865
01:08:10,358 --> 01:08:15,400
little more but it still happens yeah

1866
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,920
certainly I think we can only hope uh

1867
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,679
you know cannabis laws worldwide relax

1868
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,880
for for everyone's benefit I can

1869
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,399
appreciate your frustration with that

1870
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,119
for sure I've got a

1871
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:27,719
I got a bit of a left of field one for

1872
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:29,798
you but I wanted to ask you cuz I think

1873
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:31,679
you might have an interesting answer

1874
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:35,198
what do you think the genetics might be

1875
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,880
of TK and OG if you didn't know yourself

1876
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:38,919
about you know the Emerald Triangle and

1877
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,719
the Hindu Kush and maybe maybe a better

1878
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,838
way to phrase it is what would you pitch

1879
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,880
as an alternative genetic combination

1880
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:48,079
that could make the TK or the

1881
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,199
OG I would definitely jump into the

1882
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:52,880
category of Northern Lights along those

1883
01:08:50,198 --> 01:08:55,000
lines because you know like I said the

1884
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,400
the plant that triangle came from out

1885
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,719
there the Northern Lights came from um

1886
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,198
and then also the last several years

1887
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,838
there been a lot of information come out

1888
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:06,198
from Neville and other people talking

1889
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:07,640
about the modern day Kush lines are very

1890
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:10,678
much like the

1891
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:15,039
nl2 and then on top of that like going

1892
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:17,399
back to the late 90s again Miami mango

1893
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:19,158
used to get this cut of the Northern

1894
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:20,479
Lights too I don't know if it was from

1895
01:09:19,158 --> 01:09:23,479
somebody brought back seeds from

1896
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,318
Amsterdam or if it was an actual cut

1897
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:27,238
brought from out west somewhere or what

1898
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:28,719
but it was some of the definitely some

1899
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:32,000
of the best Northern Lights I've ever

1900
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:35,960
seen and he just called it nl2 but it

1901
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:39,119
definitely had a very uh popcorn kind of

1902
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:41,239
like TK structure to it but and left a

1903
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:43,238
really like nice aftertaste after you

1904
01:09:41,238 --> 01:09:44,959
smoked it it like kind of Linger on your

1905
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:46,718
palette for a while type thing and uh it

1906
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,439
was one of my favorites for personal and

1907
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,920
I I never grew it but mango would get a

1908
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,479
pound of it here and there and he would

1909
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,679
always call me up and I would come grab

1910
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,839
ance once in a while um we didn't hang

1911
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:58,279
out a whole lot back then but we you

1912
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,600
know we communicated through mutual

1913
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:01,880
friends and um like like I said there

1914
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,280
was definitely a handful of times I

1915
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,400
grabbed that off him that was one of my

1916
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:07,679
favorites that was coming around and you

1917
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:10,519
know it definitely had shape um that I

1918
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:12,079
remember of like these big chunky Acorn

1919
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,239
popcorn nuggets you know a little bit

1920
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:17,158
more dense maybe um some of the stuff

1921
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:19,359
going around about then so that was good

1922
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:20,960
good call it was probably NL for sure

1923
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:22,719
involved whether it was what numbers or

1924
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,039
whatever you know like I said Neville

1925
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,319
even CLA GES that all the modern day

1926
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:29,960
kushes were basically from his NL Alles

1927
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,759
or that he was breeding with out there

1928
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,079
at the

1929
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,400
time yeah yeah that's that's a good

1930
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,238
answer I can understand where you're

1931
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:40,599
coming from there so I got one last one

1932
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,919
before we do the final five questions

1933
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,679
and I wanted to know what sort of plants

1934
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,480
in general do you think cross well with

1935
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:50,679
TK and OG well me personally I haven't

1936
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,519
had a whole lot of experience breeding

1937
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:55,039
um you know most of the stuff that I've

1938
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,760
come across has been ACD that all um

1939
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,319
those little projects I did on lockdown

1940
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,039
were pretty much my only experience with

1941
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,920
breeding um i' I've learned a few tips

1942
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:04,359
and tricks here in there from you know

1943
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,440
actually from like Matt ryot when we

1944
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:08,839
first met was talking about reversals

1945
01:11:06,439 --> 01:11:10,119
and teaching me stuff about that um a

1946
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,319
few other people along the way here and

1947
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:15,238
there G me some tricks and some tips but

1948
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:17,198
I haven't really had a whole lot of like

1949
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:18,799
hands-on experience breeding yet I'm

1950
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:20,319
looking forward to it and I have all

1951
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,400
kinds of things in my mind how I like to

1952
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:26,279
do things but just haven't had the space

1953
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:28,238
um really didn't do it yet and this

1954
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:30,639
legal spot we're at we've had

1955
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:32,158
conversations about setting up a room

1956
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,960
just for strictly for breeding but it

1957
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:35,198
just hadn't come to fruition yet

1958
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,520
hopefully it happens

1959
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,519
soon yeah hopefully that happens all

1960
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,920
right well let's get into the final five

1961
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,880
so the first one is what's the single

1962
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,520
most memorable or impactful cannabis

1963
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,199
experience you've had doesn't have to be

1964
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:50,520
the most potent weed but just what's

1965
01:11:48,198 --> 01:11:52,319
left the greatest

1966
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,480
impression well it'll probably have to

1967
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,439
be some of those first ones like like

1968
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:57,959
the stuff we were just talking about the

1969
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:59,599
Kryptonite I would imagine um that was

1970
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,399
just something magic about that stuff

1971
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,320
that you know it was it was the best of

1972
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:05,920
the best that we've seen back at that

1973
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:08,119
time um so that's definitely comes to

1974
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,600
mind um that

1975
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:12,079
Hawaiian um skunk I was talking about

1976
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,079
earlier that we would pitch in on his

1977
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:17,519
kids that was one of

1978
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:20,238
them uh I really enjoyed having the

1979
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,760
Juicy Fruit for years um which is what

1980
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:25,359
this col this Colombian and Panama kind

1981
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:28,440
of reminds me of I said that was another

1982
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:30,439
good one um obviously the triangle when

1983
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:33,198
we first started growing that uh it

1984
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:34,759
wasn't really for for selling and it was

1985
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:35,799
more or less for growing for ourselves

1986
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,560
because it was making these skinny

1987
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,320
little plants at first until we figured

1988
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,639
you had to top it and get it pretty big

1989
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:44,198
before you T turned it um so that was

1990
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:45,639
kind of like an aha moment when we

1991
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:47,599
figured that out and started like being

1992
01:12:45,639 --> 01:12:50,880
able to put pounds out of that for

1993
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,800
people um yeah and obviously like when I

1994
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,800
learned all the stuff related to the OG

1995
01:12:52,800 --> 01:13:00,239
Kush in my story that was an AA moment

1996
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:02,920
too definitely it's still still uh still

1997
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:05,279
going yeah that's a good answer I like

1998
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,880
that I like that so on the other end of

1999
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,840
the spectrum what's a strain where

2000
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,639
everyone you knew was hyping it up

2001
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:15,560
you're getting really excited to try it

2002
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:15,560
you finally try it and you're a bit

2003
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,760
disappointed

2004
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,760
um well there's a lot I still haven't

2005
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,119
seen I'd like to see like I've never

2006
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,639
actually grown

2007
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:29,599
the chems yet I've had flower form of

2008
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:31,520
almost all of them um I've had the 91

2009
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,159
and yeah I did kind of resembled some

2010
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:36,760
gassy notes to it for sure my friend in

2011
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:38,158
Hawaii sent me some small amounts um

2012
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,239
then I also had somebody send me some

2013
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:42,279
chamd which I was expecting to be like

2014
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:45,079
the alltime best ever I don't know if it

2015
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:47,719
was the real cut or not but to me it

2016
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:49,719
just didn't didn't remind me of any sort

2017
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:54,158
of OG or TK like everybody was saying it

2018
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:57,198
did um it's you know more on that funky

2019
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:59,960
almost like GMO bad breath kind of funk

2020
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:02,079
and onions and mushrooms smell I

2021
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:04,359
remember um so I wasn't a huge fan of

2022
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:06,559
that it looked really nice um but I was

2023
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:08,238
expecting it to be just way different as

2024
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,159
far as I mean it was definitely Stony I

2025
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,959
remember um I don't know like I said

2026
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:14,559
whether if it was the original cut or

2027
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,359
not I heard there's multiple cuts out

2028
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:20,080
there just like TK and all all of them

2029
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:22,759
basically have imposters going

2030
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:24,399
around yeah certainly I could appreciate

2031
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,960
that for sure

2032
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:28,599
so next situation right I'm going to

2033
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,600
drop you off on a desert island and you

2034
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,880
only get to take three strains with you

2035
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,400
for the rest of time it can be clone or

2036
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,520
it could be like a pack of seeds what

2037
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:38,238
three things are you going to take well

2038
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,320
just based on this old memory I've had

2039
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:43,519
recently of the juicy fruit that one

2040
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:47,359
comes to mind definitely the

2041
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,840
TKA and probably one of the sour diesels

2042
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,719
maybe even like the East Coast our

2043
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,920
diesel that I had I know like since then

2044
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:54,480
there's there's all this information

2045
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:56,560
about different cuts of the East Coast

2046
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,479
hour diesel I don't know which one I had

2047
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,039
honestly we got it from a friend of ours

2048
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:05,839
here in Florida traded a TK cut for it

2049
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:09,158
and that was around 2003 or four um and

2050
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,400
that was one of my favorites for sure um

2051
01:15:09,158 --> 01:15:13,839
now wait let me take all those back

2052
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:15,599
definitely the TK the Juicy Fruit and

2053
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,760
that hash plant number four that I had

2054
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,360
back in the day that would be the top

2055
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,600
choice right there beautiful stuff

2056
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:25,559
beautiful stuff okay so on to the final

2057
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:27,120
one I've got a time machine for you oh

2058
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,000
no no sorry sorry I've skipped I've

2059
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:31,319
skipped ahead I've got too excited let's

2060
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,238
go back all right so in this one you've

2061
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:37,479
lost your entire genetic library right

2062
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:40,039
you got nothing all you can do is have

2063
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:41,759
one pack of seeds can be something

2064
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:44,119
you've got now or just you know

2065
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,480
something that is available what would

2066
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:47,960
you restart your genetic collection with

2067
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:50,359
just one pack of

2068
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,920
seeds oh that's a tough

2069
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:53,759
one

2070
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,560
um hm

2071
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,119
one pack of seeds well it's not going to

2072
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:02,199
be a pure anything

2073
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:04,639
obviously um if I can get a hold of some

2074
01:16:02,198 --> 01:16:07,319
of those super skunk half plant seeds

2075
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:10,319
again that we had in our collection that

2076
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:12,119
would be the all time greatest because

2077
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:13,359
like I said if you Pop s of those seeds

2078
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:15,840
back in the day you're going to get

2079
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:17,719
eight they were almost worthy of keeping

2080
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,400
definitely five for sure that were like

2081
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:21,600
holy [ __ ] and they all had like

2082
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:23,158
different like variations and smells and

2083
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,239
whatever but they're all extremely

2084
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:27,638
stinky so yeah I'd have to go with that

2085
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:30,479
Super scunt Cash

2086
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:32,000
plant I think we may have some overlap

2087
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:33,359
then so now on to our real final

2088
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,679
question which is that I've got a time

2089
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:39,119
machine for you you can go back to any

2090
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:40,840
