oh thank you so much for joining us

59
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,439
first question I'd love to ask you tell

60
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,080
me a little bit about you what was your

61
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,598
first experience with cannabis oh wow

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,180
first experience with cannabis uh was

63
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,939
probably like fifth or sixth grade here

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,340
in the states uh one of my friend's

65
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,680
older brothers had some and we ended up

66
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,780
on like a Friday or Saturday night in

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,000
grade school

68
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,979
uh getting completely blasted and

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,159
staying at his house and watching movies

70
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,179
and pretty much ever since then it was

71
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,579
uh

72
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,500
not always a daily part but definitely

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,300
something that had been been regular

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,419
throughout the years uh grade school

75
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,879
high school college uh and even into now

76
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,559
with you know being an adult but I guess

77
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,539
that was the that was the first true

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,580
experience that actually like seeing it

79
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,378
smelling it smoking it

80
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,379
um all of that stuff which [ __ ] that

81
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:27,780
would have been like

82
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:29,039
93 or 94 or something like that so A

83
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,140
long time ago

84
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,479
that's amazing and do you happen to

85
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,639
remember what was like the first kind

86
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,780
bud you got in terms of like a stray

87
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,699
name or like what was sort of going

88
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,979
around at the time

89
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,560
so not in grade school really I think it

90
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,539
was kind of hit or miss on whatever we

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,819
could find being that that young and

92
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,579
finding stuff out I will say that once I

93
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:53,158
got out of college or out of high school

94
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,680
and into college uh in Baltimore on the

95
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,959
East Coast there was definitely some

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,540
some things hazes and and sours and

97
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,560
diesels and things like that would come

98
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,378
around

99
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,519
not all the time but every so often uh

100
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,780
and there definitely would be kind of

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,340
like a heads up that there's some

102
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,438
there's some good smoke coming through

103
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,378
those would be the first ones which was

104
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:16,139
kind of like you know 2 000 to 2003 and

105
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,659
there I mean in in high school being in

106
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,120
the middle of the states in Missouri

107
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,500
there wasn't a ton I I do remember you

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,418
know at one point it was like driving 45

109
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,339
minutes each way to pick up a bag that

110
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:29,099
had stems and seeds in it and stuff like

111
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,959
that from from way back in the day

112
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,199
um so probably the opposite of kind bud

113
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,060
in uh in high school compared to what I

114
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,139
was able to find uh being in college on

115
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,660
the East Coast

116
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,060
oh man I'm jealous those East Coast guys

117
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,740
talk uh very loyally about some of the

118
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,780
hazes they got back in the day that's

119
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,978
that's cool so

120
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:48,659
um I know you've had significant

121
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:51,120
industry experience do you want to give

122
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,040
us a little bit of an idea of how you

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,840
sort of came to be working with purple

124
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
scientific and a little bit on your

125
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,239
background

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,939
yeah so

127
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,680
um yeah I mean I so I live in Denver

128
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:06,779
Colorado uh and since 2008 2009 I've

129
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,759
been involved with the medical industry

130
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,439
here in Colorado

131
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,540
um I lived in a lovely little place

132
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,579
called Aspen and helped get the first

133
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,680
Patient Collective together and had a

134
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,139
grow facility there that we operated out

135
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,300
of for a while uh then moved to Durango

136
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,418
and started a dispensary there and had a

137
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,340
big uh grow facility and that kind of

138
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:28,500
worked its way from being in the

139
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,918
mountains to to moving down to Denver so

140
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,240
in 2012 when we moved to Denver

141
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,918
um I worked on various different

142
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,720
projects breeding projects grow

143
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,839
facilities

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,560
um and then in 2014 I was hired to kind

145
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,599
of start staff train and set up uh the

146
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,459
first recreational testing facility in

147
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,439
Colorado which was called Steep Hill

148
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:52,739
Colorado

149
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:55,259
and through that work of about eight to

150
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,879
nine months uh that took me into a

151
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,919
different aspect with purchasing

152
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,800
dispensaries here so we had a shop in

153
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,120
Denver we had a shop in Colorado Springs

154
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,520
also had grow facilities in each one of

155
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,800
those cities uh had a production lab

156
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,139
that was in Colorado Springs as well and

157
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,020
that was pretty much like 2014 all the

158
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,180
way through 2019 uh and currently I

159
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:18,538
still am involved with a a place that's

160
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,259
in Arkansas and just finished up a long

161
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:23,699
part of a place that's in Portland Maine

162
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:26,160
so it's been different aspects whether

163
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,680
it's working on training staff or

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,020
Staffing up or designing facilities or

165
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,720
overseeing grow facilities and

166
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,879
dispensaries and that kind of brought it

167
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,160
to purple so I am from St Louis Missouri

168
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,079
where purple is headquarters and the

169
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
guys that founded purple found me

170
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,800
through some friends and we talked about

171
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,719
that and I am the person who did all the

172
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,460
beta testing so we took the first couple

173
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,319
purple devices and worked them through

174
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,019
our facility in Denver and in Colorado

175
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,879
Springs uh and all the other facilities

176
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,799
that I I worked with after the beta

177
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,879
testing got a device as well so Arkansas

178
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,319
main Washington in Alaska and all the

179
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,360
different places that we were working in

180
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,660
so when I got out of the Colorado

181
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,340
industry uh purple was looking for a

182
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,680
global salesperson and also needed

183
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,198
somebody that was more uh

184
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,379
cannabis saturated I guess as opposed to

185
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,120
it being science and engineering they

186
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,519
wanted to have an aspect that was kind

187
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,699
of uh core culture cannabis and that's

188
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:27,000
where I fit in and I've been with them

189
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:30,000
I mean I started with them in 20

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,620
19 uh I took a little bit of time off

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,538
last year because we had our our second

192
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,399
kid and then was back at it again with

193
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:38,098
this year and we've done

194
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,859
everything from the U.S to Europe to

195
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:42,538
Canada to Mexico we just finished up in

196
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,699
Thailand

197
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,379
um I I think it's safe to say that I'm

198
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,439
I'm hoping at some point soon we'll have

199
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:51,240
something in Australia but we uh we kind

200
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,699
of focus globally on how many countries

201
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,860
we can get it into and obviously my

202
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,879
background of cultivation and breeding

203
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,500
and nutrients and all the different

204
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,439
stuff that's kind of how we use it on

205
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,300
the sales aspect uh one to teach people

206
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,399
why they could have a device and also

207
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,360
how how best to use the device and

208
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,359
that's

209
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,120
got me to where we are today which is a

210
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,240
a long strange trip for sure

211
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,038
wow what an incredibly extensive uh

212
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,960
range of History you have there and

213
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,699
congrats on the new child recently

214
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,859
that's exciting

215
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,080
um you segued perfectly to what I wanted

216
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,360
to sort of start with which was how long

217
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,219
has the unit been in development for and

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,979
what was the sort of process around that

219
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,778
like from your perspective at least

220
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,179
so the two gentlemen that started the

221
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:39,379
company uh they worked with a different

222
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,478
outfit that used near infrared

223
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:44,879
spectroscopy and and I can from here on

224
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,680
out we'll say nirs

225
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,080
um but near infrared spectroscopy is the

226
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,579
actual sensor and what makes the unit

227
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,959
work

228
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,740
um so in

229
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:58,379
layperson terms there's a Tungsten bulb

230
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,839
that blinks it reflects light there's a

231
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,700
sensor that captures that reflection uh

232
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,620
an infrared light is not something that

233
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,899
we get to see with the human eye so

234
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,580
there's a reflection and kind of a a

235
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,339
pattern that gets picked up by this

236
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,139
sensor and because of that reflection

237
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,839
and what that sensor picks up that's how

238
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,419
it's able to delineate what potency

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,279
moisture content extracts flowers

240
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:23,039
Etc and all that kind of stuff

241
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:25,860
um so there was a company in 2015 and

242
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,199
2016 that was using near infrared

243
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,440
spectroscopy and it was hellaciously

244
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,339
expensive and had to be kind of kept on

245
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,680
a table top and uh vibrations and

246
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,360
walking didn't work well with it uh and

247
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,159
the two guys that started purple worked

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,860
at that company and kind of watched it

249
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,860
fail and why it failed one price point

250
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,620
two application and also I think a big

251
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,600
part of it is not being as mobile

252
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,060
um as most people would want it to be so

253
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,620
in 20 2017 they started working on the

254
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,379
purple device which is about the size of

255
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,600
a hockey puck it does fit in a normal

256
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,360
pocket or a cargo pocket it fits in a

257
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,879
backpack Etc and the development was at

258
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,440
least when I got brought in I was

259
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:09,240
contacted because they knew friends of

260
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
mine in St Louis and they needed to try

261
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,740
to get this thing on cannabis and they

262
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,719
had been working on data models and all

263
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,419
of the engineering and Cloud space and

264
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,580
and how to actually make it work with a

265
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:22,199
device that was small enough and an app

266
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,420
on the phone

267
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,240
um so I mean I was they had done some

268
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,219
testing with cannabis but I was the

269
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,440
first person to kind of like really

270
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,700
keep the tires and do things so we

271
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,339
brought it in and within the first week

272
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,620
we were trying to do 100 tests on it

273
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,300
um wrote up some Sops you know any

274
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,700
flower that would come out we would test

275
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,500
all of the the different genetics it

276
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,060
also would go to regulated testing in

277
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,339
Colorado so we would have those lab

278
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,958
results that would come back and that's

279
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,420
what I did is I kind of supplied purple

280
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,399
with this is what this lab has said and

281
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:55,139
this is what we found out

282
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,639
um and then we started getting into you

283
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,659
know how much more we could do with it

284
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,919
obviously harvested cured flour is great

285
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,539
um but there's there's a lot of

286
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,099
knowledge in a facility to be able to

287
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,039
check something in week two of flower

288
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,839
week four of flower week six a flower

289
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:13,139
and getting into like Fino hunts and and

290
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,700
breeding and keeper selection it was

291
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,559
like you know how much more data can we

292
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,000
get and and I told purple at that point

293
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,859
I was like you know

294
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,360
we have to pay for our data right now

295
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,480
through regulated lab and that could

296
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,039
cost us 60 to 80 grand a year the fact

297
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
that I can have a bunch of other data

298
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,078
that's somewhat free at a certain point

299
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,579
with unlimited testing allows me to

300
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,399
understand certain things about the

301
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:36,958
facilities so you know we would we could

302
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,879
figure out when we needed to change

303
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,099
balls we could figure out that in the

304
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,360
winter time when it was colder out we

305
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,920
would have a little bit higher potency

306
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,079
than when the summer time and it was

307
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,819
super hot and we hadn't changed filters

308
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,739
in the the heating and air conditioning

309
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,620
units and you can get into you know hot

310
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,419
cold hot Corners cold Corners how your

311
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,799
irrigation system is working so you know

312
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:57,539
we notice plants at the back of the

313
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,559
table weren't getting as much water or

314
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:00,179
applied to the front of the table

315
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,159
closest to the reservoir we're getting a

316
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,139
ton of water and we could you know kind

317
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,439
of equate what we could see in the

318
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,600
facility with what the potency was doing

319
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,720
um and those things were were feedbacks

320
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,940
that got back to purple and we had it in

321
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,040
I think at one point we were doing

322
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,140
almost 100 tests a week in four

323
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,319
different states on four different

324
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:24,059
facilities but it was a blessing that

325
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,339
some of those facilities had the same

326
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,439
genetics somehow that they found in

327
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,940
their state and put them in the facility

328
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,519
to try to grow

329
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,459
good crops at every one that would have

330
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:40,679
the same genetic whether it was lemon G

331
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:42,479
or orange mints or cookies and cream

332
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,278
um rude boy or G like a lot of the

333
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,920
things that people really wanted to

334
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,419
smoke at that time which was 2018 to

335
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,519
2020

336
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,778
um kind of like the after the rise of

337
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,039
the Jungle boys and the orange cookies

338
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,019
and a bunch of other things that had

339
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,299
occurred on the west coast things had

340
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,940
migrated around the country

341
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:02,399
um so that was the development uh in

342
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,579
2019 it went into actually like public

343
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,159
sales and that's when I kind of started

344
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:10,979
with them as as the global sales

345
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,620
director was because all that background

346
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,060
in beta testing it was then well you

347
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,379
know I can talk to the people that want

348
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,719
to get this whether they're home growing

349
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,578
or a facility and as I say you know

350
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,440
whether it's black white or gray Market

351
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:24,599
the more data you can have the better

352
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,459
for any business owner

353
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,940
um and that's kind of where it went from

354
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:32,099
development to what it does now and I'm

355
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,440
and I think there are probably

356
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,480
over a hundred thousand different test

357
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,700
results in the database

358
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,740
um it is ran on a cloud-based system it

359
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,420
does work on your phone the unit can go

360
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,519
anywhere so you know I've tested stuff

361
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,078
in the middle of a field and I've tested

362
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,320
stuff in a basement and I've tested

363
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,539
stuff in a facility and I've taken it

364
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,820
everywhere when I travel at least for

365
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,679
work we always have a device somewhere

366
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,760
and now that we can do extracts it's

367
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,500
kind of the same thing that we're

368
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,179
testing a lot of rosin and a lot of

369
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,259
hashish and other things that are

370
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,259
happening

371
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:07,259
but I would say that you know is it at

372
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,600
least two and a half devoted years of

373
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,939
development but prior to that they had

374
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,220
another two years of understanding near

375
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,980
infrared spectroscopy and kind of how

376
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,560
that was a benefit and here in the

377
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,839
states uh the FDA the Food and Drug

378
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,638
Administration has endorsed near

379
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,899
infrared spectroscopy for many different

380
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:31,200
things so uh the amount of hops and beer

381
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,720
the amount of moisture and cat litter uh

382
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,278
the amount of so I mean near infrared

383
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,820
spectroscopy can literally do anything

384
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,559
from counting to reflection uh to what

385
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,480
we use in the Cannabis industry so it's

386
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,578
a big thing so most John Deere tractors

387
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,440
have near-infrared spectroscopy

388
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:47,698
somewhere within them and that's how

389
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,079
they let you know that if you know the

390
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,179
tire tread's getting low or something

391
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:52,500
else is happening with the device

392
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,198
um so it can be trained on a lot of

393
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,000
different things and in the states that

394
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,399
was kind of the the thought from the

395
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,339
Science Background is that one it is

396
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,620
used in production and two it's a great

397
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,360
way to train this device to to do it for

398
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,459
cannabis people that is Affordable at

399
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,980
that point

400
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,599
yeah brilliant uh what a range of

401
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,899
different Avenues we could choose to

402
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,600
discuss it in I I totally agree I'm a

403
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,220
big fan of infrared spectroscopio seen

404
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,920
it in many different applications it's

405
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,800
definitely a phenomenal technology I

406
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,740
would love to talk about how the unit is

407
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,659
set apart from other units because

408
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,539
whenever I read people discussing the

409
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:36,120
purple I think that some of the maybe

410
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:38,338
points they raised which they think

411
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,778
maybe is why they wouldn't get it I

412
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,339
think they're they're not correct most

413
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:43,439
of them I think there may be quoting

414
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,240
aspects of a different unit that they

415
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,579
don't like so for example I've heard a

416
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,740
lot of people say the purple doesn't

417
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:51,359
give you Real Results it's just matching

418
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,680
it to a database and I'm like no that's

419
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,600
that's not true there's like a white

420
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,519
paper online and you can read through it

421
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,740
and it explains how it actually works

422
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,720
what are some of the things that set the

423
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,778
unit apart from some of its competitors

424
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,100
in your mind the term white paper is

425
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:06,720
definitely from you know the Science

426
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,180
World which I don't think

427
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,459
uh civilians lay people non-science

428
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,679
people understand but a white paper is a

429
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,838
document that's written goes into peer

430
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:18,239
review is fact checked and then after

431
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,699
that it's able to be published and it's

432
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,620
supposed to be rooted in fact for people

433
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,838
to know that so that's one thing that we

434
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,120
do at purple that's a little different

435
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,279
um we do work with Labs all over the

436
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,899
country in the states

437
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,759
um and soon we'll be working with a

438
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,839
couple Labs that are in Europe

439
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,539
um and the white paper that you're

440
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,060
referencing I think talks about there is

441
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:42,539
a variance within the device and there's

442
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:46,679
also a variance of the device next to uh

443
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:48,719
uhplc hplc's GCS and other equipment

444
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:51,419
that is found in a regulated testing lab

445
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,459
so the variance on the device itself is

446
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,740
actually at 10 of the readout value

447
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:58,559
which means that if the device reads 20

448
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,879
you're really looking at like 18 to 24.

449
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:05,399
now contrasting that variance to an hplc

450
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,338
or other device variances most of them

451
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,199
are looking at like a 20 variance and

452
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:13,019
some of that comes down to calibration

453
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,900
techniques and use techniques and how

454
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:18,720
they dissolve and homogenize things

455
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,480
before it goes into the hplc OR into the

456
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,459
uhplc so with the purple you grind up

457
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,400
the flower the flower sits right on the

458
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,380
sensor the light blinks and it takes a

459
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,120
graph of that light when you send

460
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,160
something to a regulated lab there's a

461
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,439
person that homogenizes that into a

462
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,298
solvent and then that gets sprayed into

463
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,940
the device at a certain point to be read

464
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:42,179
so there's some other things that happen

465
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,759
when you're diluting or liquefying

466
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,500
something to then have it ran through a

467
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,839
different type of system as opposed to

468
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,220
near infrared so I think that's some of

469
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,579
the misconception that people understand

470
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:56,339
is that a regulated lab is regulated by

471
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:57,779
that state there is no set thing you

472
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,819
know like here in the states we talk

473
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,558
about it a lot with cars like if you

474
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,839
take your car to an admissions place and

475
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,519
they check the emissions all across the

476
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,418
United States it's the same emissions

477
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,639
check

478
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,559
that is not the case in Cannabis Testing

479
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,880
what what's tested in Oklahoma could be

480
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,918
different than what's tested in Colorado

481
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,179
can be different than what's tested in

482
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,500
Missouri

483
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,840
um and so I think the white paper is

484
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,940
what we kind of do to have a little bit

485
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,859
of an anchor in science that allows

486
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,279
people to understand yes this is how the

487
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:28,859
device itself works and on CBD we're

488
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,558
less than one percent away from an hplc

489
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:34,339
and with THC because the number is

490
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:37,740
larger we're at 1.9 percent either way

491
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:39,839
and we also work with different Labs

492
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,240
almost every month to calibrate our

493
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,619
machine with theirs and also now we're

494
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,179
seeing a lot of labs that want to

495
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,058
calibrate their machine with ours

496
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:50,160
because in the Science World near

497
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,980
infrared spectroscopy has a little bit

498
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,900
more of a stable aspect because you

499
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,360
don't use solvents you don't have to

500
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,940
homogenize things it's actually a

501
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,259
constant sample that is put on there and

502
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,640
with the purple I mean you grind up the

503
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:04,798
weed you put it in the sample holder it

504
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,240
does it you know I have a lot of people

505
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,519
that as soon as they test it they put

506
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,298
that that into a bowl and smoke it so

507
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,319
it's not damaged it's not thrown away

508
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:15,359
that's another thing I think with the

509
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,099
regulated Labs it kind of changes a

510
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,019
little bit is that when you send them a

511
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,279
sample and they do all that you can

512
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,500
never really see that sample again or

513
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,259
use it again and I also think a big

514
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,079
misconception especially in the states

515
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:30,419
which I I see kind of seeping into other

516
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,798
markets right now is that people say

517
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,240
there's no way that that's right and

518
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,160
you're like you were saying it matched

519
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,079
this to a database

520
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,419
um there's a graph on every single

521
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,279
sample that comes out that is unique yes

522
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,759
there are a hundred thousand other

523
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,019
graphs that we know but every time you

524
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,298
calibrate that machine and every time

525
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:50,519
you put in a new sample that graft is

526
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:53,038
unique from Peaks and valleys and where

527
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,240
spikes are and how it all works and I

528
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,119
think that's also just a lot of people

529
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,519
don't understand near infrared as

530
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,139
opposed to hplc's or grass chromatology

531
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,079
and all the other different aspects that

532
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,299
happen uh and you know three years ago

533
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,178
regulated Labs could put their foot down

534
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:11,220
and say that it was a 30 percent and

535
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,780
everybody would say yeah it is I think a

536
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,640
lot of people know now that regulated

537
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,440
labs are going to say it's 36 because

538
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,020
the client wants to say it's 36 percent

539
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,820
and there's not really a bias with us

540
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,740
we're not in the room running the purple

541
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,418
Pro for the people like the purple Pros

542
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,940
ran by that person it gives them a

543
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,100
number that is unbiased and also I mean

544
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,660
you know there's not people paying us a

545
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,699
hundred grand a year to run all of their

546
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,798
samples and I think when you have Labs

547
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,600
that are for profit there's a little bit

548
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,700
of human error and bias that kind of

549
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,859
comes into some of that so I think

550
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,019
that's that's part of it and I mean I

551
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:44,759
I'll tell you like I tell everybody you

552
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:46,798
know you can you can hit up my DM you

553
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,740
can hit up my email I talk about this

554
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,660
all day with people but a lot of it is

555
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,700
believing is seeing it so I see a lot of

556
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,500
test results from labs and I see a lot

557
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,298
of test results from purples

558
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,859
and I still to this day I don't think

559
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:03,000
there's a single human that can tell me

560
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:05,699
a 33 THC is different than a 26 THC in a

561
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,400
blind taste test I don't I I see why

562
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,840
they do it for sales but I don't think

563
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,940
that there's a human palette that can

564
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,538
tell me the difference within four to

565
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,980
six percent on any now a 12 and a 28 I

566
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:19,440
get it I think most people can tell the

567
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,480
difference I I have yet to see somebody

568
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,580
that could tell me this one is the 32

569
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,140
and this one is the 28 or something like

570
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:27,538
that

571
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,059
yeah some interesting discussion points

572
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:32,400
there for sure and um we'll dive into

573
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:33,779
that a bit more I did want to ask you

574
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
specifically this was one of the

575
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:37,918
questions I wanted to ask because uh

576
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,720
full disclosure to everyone listening

577
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,580
you know the the crew at purple were

578
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,500
kind enough to send me a unit to play

579
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:45,119
around with and test out so that I could

580
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,880
talk about it and I think it's a great

581
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,798
unit hence why we're having this chat I

582
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,559
found pretty quickly that some of my

583
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:55,139
favorite buds were not testing above

584
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,819
like 23 you know they were they're in

585
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,400
that sweet spot in my mind which was

586
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:01,319
like sort of 20 to 23 most of my

587
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,140
favorite buds are around there some of

588
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,939
my favorite sativas or maybe 18 19 a

589
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,340
little less but still in that same realm

590
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,980
and it got me wondering you know like

591
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,720
what you said a lot of these 36 tests

592
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,819
you read you know I just I can't accept

593
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,460
that as truth to be honest so I wanted

594
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:18,839
to ask you specifically and and sorry I

595
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,340
should add I had that exact same thought

596
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,379
you mentioned like when I'm doing these

597
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,759
tests there's no one in the room knows

598
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm doing these like there's no reason

599
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,200
for me to suspect any bias on purpose

600
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,480
part because you like you don't know

601
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,159
who's doing what at any time so it made

602
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,038
me think you must have seen a lot of

603
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,200
purple tests what is the highest Bud

604
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,480
you've seen tested on purple in terms of

605
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,220
the actual percentage it registered and

606
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,140
what do you think is like because you

607
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,360
know you see Labs sand 36 or whatever

608
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,280
what is the highest percentage you would

609
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,839
just accept as a believable figure

610
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,639
before you're like you know what I just

611
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:51,418
have reservations anything could be that

612
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,900
high

613
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:56,580
uh yeah great questions so first you

614
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,798
know on our flower model right now which

615
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:01,199
is about to be updated if it does

616
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,658
register over 30 it says greater than

617
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,480
30. so we don't do anything technically

618
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:09,299
over 30. I have seen some some flowers

619
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,960
in the past year that have hit that over

620
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:14,639
30 Mark now I didn't analyze any samples

621
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,740
to see if they had been rolled in key

622
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,419
for not I you know I'm not like they're

623
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,519
showing me a bud it's mostly somebody

624
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,500
screenshotting their result and sending

625
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,179
it to us so at that point I think

626
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,058
whatever they put on that sensor

627
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:29,460
probably did register over 30.

628
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:31,678
and I think to your point about your

629
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,100
favorite Buds and the effect and the

630
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,259
potency there's a whole different

631
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:38,879
Universe of terpenes that kind of

632
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,319
interacts with how the cannabinoids and

633
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,419
the terpenoids work together and I think

634
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,460
that's a whole different discussion on

635
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:47,159
why certain things feel certain ways

636
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,159
right like that mercine level of above

637
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,500
0.3 or below 0.3 and and how that works

638
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,640
with indicas and sativas

639
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,619
um that's a whole different thing that I

640
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,759
get into a lot when we talk we talk to

641
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:00,000
breeders and I think you're right like

642
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:03,298
most sativas promptly register in that

643
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,980
18 to 22 percent range but they have a

644
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:07,200
whole different terpene profile that

645
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,298
makes it a different effect on on a

646
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,298
person and I also think the same about a

647
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:14,400
lot of indicas I think and this is my

648
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:16,019
complete personal opinion but

649
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,580
unfortunately to me most of the stuff

650
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,558
that people are smoking nowadays is a

651
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:24,240
hybrid of some sort there's not a lot of

652
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:26,460
true Indica gene or true sativa Gene and

653
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,019
a lot of the stuff that people get that

654
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,460
they grow so you know there's a lot of

655
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:32,460
seeds being made there's a lot of

656
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:36,000
genetics out there it's almost like uh

657
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,880
dogs where I would say 93 of them are

658
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,380
all mutts of some sort there may not be

659
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,140
purebreds anymore and I think that is

660
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,059
where the the terpene effect comes in in

661
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,240
and and and changes a lot of the stuff

662
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:50,639
like myself I really like citruses and

663
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,019
you know limonene and and all kinds of

664
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,940
different things that I enjoy when I

665
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:58,980
smoke and that gives me a certain effect

666
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:01,200
whether it's a 18 a 22 percent or a 28

667
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,140
um and I guess the highest value that I

668
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,819
would say and and again this is just

669
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,940
after seeing

670
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:11,759
I mean I I can probably say in the past

671
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,320
eight years I've seen at least a quarter

672
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,519
of a million Resorts I may even be able

673
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,439
to say I've seen a half a Million

674
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,819
results on different stuff just because

675
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,679
of my work

676
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:22,500
I mean when it when there's stuff that's

677
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,360
in that 27 28 range

678
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,640
usually if I get to actually see the

679
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:29,158
flower I'm like that's really good butt

680
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,440
and it's mostly because of

681
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,299
The Green Thumb or cultivator that made

682
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,820
it knows what they're doing with the

683
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,319
recipe and their environment I think you

684
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:39,599
could give that same genetic to somebody

685
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:42,538
else and they would never touch 27 they

686
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,459
probably hit 22-23

687
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:46,019
um but you can noticeably see when bud

688
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,058
is really good and then you can also see

689
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:52,259
like a lot of the pgr and the stuff that

690
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:53,819
isn't necessarily as as grown because of

691
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,099
a green thumb and it's more because of

692
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,899
what they're thrown in the water I don't

693
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,278
see all those pgrs really topping the

694
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,259
charts on a lot of stuff now the bud

695
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,480
looks great and it's super dense it

696
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,859
feels like a golf ball I mean it's what

697
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,960
a lot of people make it into on like

698
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:10,979
that West Coast feel

699
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,980
um that stuff you know I would say 24-25

700
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,480
I don't know I believe that there's

701
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,480
probably going to be plants that could

702
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,538
hit that 30 Mark or 30 plus Mark I know

703
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,919
that as sheesh and concentrates and you

704
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,640
know loud resins and all this different

705
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,799
stuff are hitting you know 80 plus 95

706
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,360
plus 99 whatever you want to call it on

707
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,619
the distillate

708
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,359
um so I mean I think there's there's

709
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,459
obviously an increase in flower

710
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,259
potential to be higher because

711
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,860
concentrate numbers are continually

712
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:43,200
getting more stable at a higher level

713
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,599
um but me personally I I would say most

714
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,298
of the stuff that I see a 30 plus

715
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,759
percent result I would assume is in that

716
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:52,740
2728 range

717
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,619
um and unfortunately I hear all kinds of

718
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,298
back door stories about you know they

719
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:58,859
take the sample off the plant from the

720
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,359
best plant and they you know run it in

721
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,579
the trim bin and roll it around and keep

722
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:05,278
and send it off to the lab and hitting

723
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:07,019
34s or the lab is able to let them know

724
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,400
when they haven't calibrated the device

725
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,139
and it's probably best to get in some

726
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,059
samples before we run calibration next

727
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,919
week I think that's where the whole

728
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:16,619
money and the greed and the for-profit

729
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,720
messes up a lot of stuff but yeah I mean

730
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:20,639
my personal I you know my sweet spot

731
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,960
that I tell everybody is if I if I can

732
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,700
find the right terpene percentage and

733
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,860
it's 25 to 27

734
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,019
I you know I would I would purchase and

735
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:29,819
smoke that weed all day long till the

736
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:31,440
cows come home because I know that's the

737
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:32,819
sweet spot for myself

738
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,980
I think it's different there's some

739
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,418
people that like the florals and the

740
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,058
berry flavors some people like the

741
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:42,778
Citrus flavors you know anything I think

742
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:45,599
that has that gassy musky kind of East

743
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:47,700
Coast diesel top to it

744
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,000
um you know that could be in that 19 to

745
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,620
21 range but that terpene profile is

746
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,778
gonna give you the effect that you want

747
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,819
I think that's that's the difference on

748
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:58,319
you know how how far you want to get

749
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:00,658
into these jeans which you guys at the

750
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,038
podcast do a lot of which is awesome

751
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,659
um but I think that you know everybody

752
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:06,119
wanting to know a number

753
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:08,580
it's hard to work that number but

754
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,558
I mean yeah I I would say the top is you

755
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:12,899
know that 27 to 29 is what I would

756
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,519
assume most of the top stuff is and I

757
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:18,059
think most people's sweet spot is you

758
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,579
know 23 to 26. that's when you see and I

759
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:22,079
would say just by means and medians and

760
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,579
how math works that's the most of the

761
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,619
weed that you see you see some great

762
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:27,000
stuff on one end of the bell curve you

763
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,139
see some really bad stuff on the other

764
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,419
end and the stuff that's in the middle

765
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,820
is what you're going to see the most of

766
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:35,220
yeah what a great answer that's um

767
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:37,678
that's that Echoes many of the real life

768
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,679
experiences I've had I've got a buddy

769
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,659
shout out to the Garden he uh he he saw

770
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,419
the purple unit you guys gave me and he

771
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:47,100
quickly bought his own and he tested his

772
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:49,440
his best buds and this guy's a really

773
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,579
good grower and it came out at 27 and I

774
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,620
was like well there you go that's that's

775
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:53,939
the new highest percentage I've seen but

776
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,500
I believe it because I've tried his butt

777
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,880
and it's as you said it's it's in that

778
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,619
top tier where you're like I'd love it

779
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,020
what's interesting is when I first

780
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:05,399
started thinking about the unit in

781
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:07,918
theory I wondered is this gonna feed the

782
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,900
Paradigm of people chasing numbers and

783
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,120
then quite shortly after I actually got

784
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,019
the unit for me at least it was the

785
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,939
opposite it largely confirmed what I

786
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:20,398
already knew which was that some of my

787
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,019
favorite strains I didn't think they

788
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,379
were the most potent it was more about

789
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:27,418
the effect that I enjoyed and so to me

790
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,820
it might sound a bit counter-intuitive

791
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:31,799
but I sort of felt like it it reaffirmed

792
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:33,418
to me that I'm not chasing numbers the

793
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:35,460
things I like is the things that I smoke

794
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,740
and I say hey this is great and the

795
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,019
number never really mattered do you feel

796
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,940
like that's one of the ways which purple

797
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:43,740
will change the market because I thought

798
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,899
there is a big discussion in the

799
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,240
community at the moment about how not so

800
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:50,639
much like me and you the real like you

801
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,220
know um down the rabbit hole really

802
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,440
hectic Advocate but the more average

803
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,419
consumer who does walk into a dispensary

804
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,460
and just sees numbers you know do you

805
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,200
think that um we might be able to change

806
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,240
some of the mindset through showing

807
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,819
people that some of the buds they really

808
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,200
like may not actually be like 30 for

809
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:08,700
example and so like numbers are

810
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,940
important but they're not the be-all

811
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,980
end-all yeah I mean I think that's at

812
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,259
least what we see here

813
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,538
um there's a lot of states that start

814
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:20,398
out and the higher percentage cannabis

815
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:22,740
is sold at a higher price so I feel like

816
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,019
as a customer you're already stuck in

817
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,179
that box right like you have 20 bucks so

818
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:29,940
are you gonna buy one gram at 20 are you

819
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:31,919
gonna buy two gram of 15 so I mean the

820
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,778
the decision making process at the

821
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,720
counter to paste buy something a

822
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:38,640
dispensary is already kind of slanted

823
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,140
that way unfortunately and if you knew

824
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,500
that the numbers weren't

825
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:46,200
a hundred percent true uh maybe that

826
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,440
would change your buying decision I do

827
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,019
think that Within

828
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,600
I I would say within like 30 to 36

829
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:56,278
months of any State starting you see

830
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,719
things start to change from a supply and

831
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:59,940
demand status right like there's more

832
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,220
Harvest there's more flour there's more

833
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,860
things available to purchase so then the

834
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,079
pricing starts to change and people have

835
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:08,879
sampled many different things so you

836
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,579
know it's always funny when you hear

837
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,500
about a lot of blue dream or green crack

838
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:16,079
and certain genetics that here in the

839
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,839
states kind of get like that Noob

840
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,099
starter whatever bad rap you start to

841
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:21,599
notice that those are the ones that fall

842
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:23,639
in that middle of the road on the

843
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,398
potency but they have the effect that

844
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,259
people want and I think that that's

845
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,479
where the education comes in is that

846
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:32,460
there are a lot of Brands and companies

847
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,558
that are going to educate customers that

848
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,159
it's not about the number it's about the

849
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:40,440
effect and I usually try to win training

850
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,760
or speaking with Bud tenders and

851
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,740
dispensaries you know it's just like

852
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,839
everything else like when you eat sour

853
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,700
cream and onion chips you really like

854
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,859
sour cream and onion flavor it's not the

855
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,600
fact that it's the best potato it's the

856
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:53,879
fact that you like the terpene profile

857
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,859
and I tell a lot of people you know I I

858
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,960
would tell them to to purchase on their

859
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:00,240
nose more than on the the number itself

860
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,340
if you like how something smells check

861
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,359
it out that doesn't matter if it's a 20

862
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:08,339
or a 27 or 13 if you like the if you

863
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:10,558
like the flavor you're going to enjoy

864
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:12,839
that and there's also this you know

865
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,819
it kind of like Looms in the background

866
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,099
but the tolerance changes too right as

867
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:19,619
you have exposure to more cannabis your

868
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:22,139
tolerance changes so anything can knock

869
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:24,719
your socks off when you start but after

870
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,179
you know 30 to 36 months of regularly

871
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,159
using cannabis your tolerance goes up a

872
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:30,600
little bit and your purchasing starts to

873
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,778
change oh I always need something that's

874
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,759
at least 20 but smells like gas well

875
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:37,740
that may not always be on the the shelf

876
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,658
so we got this other one that's 20 but

877
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,460
it smells like cherries and I think

878
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:44,039
that's something that the education of

879
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,899
the customer also changes but

880
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,359
unfortunately there's still a lot of

881
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:50,819
places that sell based on the number

882
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,459
and if the number was backed by some

883
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,778
stable concrete understanding I think

884
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,460
it'd be different like when you go and

885
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:59,278
buy a 32 ounce soda it's always supposed

886
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,659
to be 32 ounces some places may put a

887
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,579
lot more ice in it so you get less

888
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,559
liquid some places may not put ice in it

889
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:06,898
so you get more liquid but that Cup's

890
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,960
always 32 ounces you know you could buy

891
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:11,639
34 in Oklahoma it's not the same as a 34

892
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,880
in California and it's not the same as a

893
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:17,220
34 in Oregon and unfortunately that's

894
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,840
what you know kind of messes up the

895
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,259
buying experience for a lot of people

896
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:24,538
but I would agree that I think with the

897
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:26,398
purple a lot of people think it's going

898
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:27,720
to be about the number and I and I tell

899
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,038
people that all the time like I get it

900
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,460
if you guys want to know the highest

901
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,538
number and also as a person that knows

902
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,340
the device

903
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:36,720
if you want to get the highest number

904
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,519
then there's a certain way to do that

905
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,319
you got to pick the flower on the top

906
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,058
with the most light penetration and

907
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,819
grind that up and it's got to be a cola

908
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:46,558
and you can get the biggest number but

909
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:48,538
if you want to get real about it you

910
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,579
want to homogenize that plant so take

911
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:52,798
some lower some middle some tops grind

912
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:54,178
it all up mix it all together and test

913
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,398
that that's going to give you the

914
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,580
average of the plant not what the best

915
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,018
one is now as a grower I always want to

916
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,460
smoke the best Cola that's on the best

917
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,620
plant that's why you're doing it right

918
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,140
like that's the that's the filet mignon

919
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:08,519
that's the best cut but at a certain

920
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,260
point you run out of that and then

921
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:11,699
you're smoking ground beef and all the

922
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,260
hot dogs and everything else that come

923
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,398
from the plant so might as well know

924
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,619
what your numbers are for the whole

925
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,239
thing but I do think that most people

926
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,940
that get the purple that are like

927
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,678
yourself or or me it's not about trying

928
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,358
to get to that 30 plus number it's about

929
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,039
all right I really like these genetics

930
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:28,378
and this is what they're coming out at

931
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,599
but if I did this to this in my grow

932
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:32,759
room could I get two percent higher or

933
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,500
could I get a percent higher and I think

934
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,720
that that educate hates a lot of people

935
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,639
but I hope it goes away from the numbers

936
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,019
and I'm a guy that sells a device that

937
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,019
gives you a number so you know that's

938
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:46,199
very contradictory to what I do for my

939
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,759
living but as a cannabis Advocate you

940
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,678
know I think numbers are cool for

941
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,060
everybody to understand the data I don't

942
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,679
think that's the foundation of the

943
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,759
triangle you know I think the terpenes

944
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,980
and the genetics and everything else

945
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,300
that happen I think the potency in that

946
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,980
data is something that people need to

947
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,140
know and a lot of people don't have

948
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,639
access to get that number so I think

949
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:04,739
that's that's where it comes into play

950
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,759
but I I would agree with you I I don't

951
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:07,618
think numbers are going to be that

952
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,760
important five ten years from now I

953
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:10,800
think it's going to be terpene numbers

954
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,119
that are important or flavonoid numbers

955
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,099
that are important or whatever

956
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,980
technology comes out next that can do

957
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:19,200
more to understand the plant those will

958
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,480
continue to be important at that point

959
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,598
yeah what a brilliant answer I love that

960
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,000
I love that I uh I did want to ask you

961
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,760
there is a very healthy community of

962
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,500
users who I don't know how to phrase

963
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,780
this they sort of are developing their

964
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,519
own Sops for how to test the product

965
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,400
it's like you know the hardcore purple

966
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:41,338
fans and uh shout out to my buddy uh

967
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,480
plant-based 978 Mass C he he was the one

968
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:45,059
who actually introduced me to the unit

969
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,559
he bought it and uh he was like hey man

970
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,239
this is a cool device have you seen it

971
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:50,519
and that was what sort of stimulated us

972
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,399
to get in touch but he gave me some tips

973
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,619
and he said oh you know I when I test

974
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,320
samples I grind them up I put them in

975
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,480
the like the little black overlay uh

976
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,280
holder that you put on top of the unit

977
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,079
to mount it

978
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,300
um and then he says before I test it you

979
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,760
know I I take that black unit off and I

980
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,280
quickly give the sensor a clean and then

981
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,599
I put the black overlay back on top for

982
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,920
people who have the unit they'll know

983
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,320
exactly what we're talking about right

984
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,880
now and and it got me realizing that

985
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,859
there are you know people trying to

986
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,559
figure out like the most optimal way to

987
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:24,598
test the samples do you have a certain

988
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,920
little protocol you run through for how

989
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,480
you test the sample and would you be

990
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,180
willing to share

991
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,639
I'll run through what I would say I I

992
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:33,779
tell people to do for there's one for

993
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,759
home growing and there's one for

994
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,140
obviously a larger facility so on the

995
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,000
home growing aspect but I tell most

996
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:40,559
people to do is one it so the device

997
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,420
comes with you're talking about a black

998
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,519
overlay we call that the sample holder

999
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,380
and it lays on top of the device and

1000
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:47,940
makes sure that your sample is right on

1001
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,099
the sensor

1002
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,380
um and we say a third of a gram to half

1003
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,320
of a gram what I will tell you to do is

1004
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,300
is first on Sample prep uh we just put a

1005
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,119
video up on our social media but you

1006
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,099
actually want to grind the Cannabis with

1007
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,780
the funnel pointing up a lot of people

1008
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,760
put the funnel right on that thing and

1009
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,099
grind it and it doesn't get as fine as

1010
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,839
it needs to so you actually Grind With

1011
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:11,880
The Funnel on the grinder and give it

1012
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,858
you know five six seven turns get it

1013
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,599
real fine then you're gonna put that

1014
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:17,338
into the overlay like you're talking

1015
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,559
about the sample holder and then I take

1016
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:21,059
my pinky and I just post it down on the

1017
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,578
top a little bit and what that does is

1018
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:25,559
it makes sure that the whole sensor is

1019
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,599
in contact with cannabis

1020
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:29,578
prior to doing this

1021
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,519
I have suggested to some people you can

1022
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:34,019
use an isol alcohol wipe and give the

1023
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:36,719
sensor a little wipe if you don't want

1024
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:38,099
true cross contamination it does come

1025
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,358
with a brush so you can just scrub it

1026
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:43,740
off if you'd like

1027
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:46,259
but going into you know science

1028
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:47,639
as opposed to non-science and as I say

1029
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,079
it I'm like there's the science grower

1030
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:51,059
and then there's the non-science grower

1031
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,980
so for the science grower I tell them to

1032
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,480
calibrate it after they do the iso wipe

1033
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,280
every time go ahead and calibrate it

1034
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,659
takes another 15 seconds but you know

1035
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,820
it's calibrated it's on a white

1036
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:01,980
reference it gives it to you so I'm

1037
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,240
gonna hit it with an ISO pipe that I'm

1038
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,280
gonna put on the puck which is the

1039
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,559
calibration Puck calibrated take that

1040
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,300
off put on the sample holder grind it

1041
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:11,519
upside down put it in there tap it with

1042
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,680
the pinky put the thing on it and hit

1043
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,800
run and that would be one complete test

1044
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:19,019
right there now after I run it that one

1045
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,940
time I'll then run that same sample

1046
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:23,699
probably two or three times and then

1047
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,079
I'll have most likely at least two of

1048
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:26,460
the same numbers I may have three

1049
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,440
different numbers depending on how it

1050
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,539
all works with our variants so what I'm

1051
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,119
saying is you could get a 20 a 21 and a

1052
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:35,219
19 well your average is 20 at that point

1053
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,079
if you want to do those in technically

1054
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:40,078
for science talk it needs to be five

1055
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:41,099
seven nine Etc in the Cannabis world I

1056
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,140
tell a lot of people as long as you're

1057
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,420
doing three you're doing more than one

1058
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,460
and I'm understand everybody's in a

1059
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,800
hustle to try to get stuff done so that

1060
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,838
would be the home growing aspect on the

1061
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,460
large facility aspect we're going to

1062
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:54,960
have them grind up all their samples and

1063
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,880
keep them on pieces of paper and label

1064
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,679
all those pieces of paper and then

1065
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,660
they're doing an ISO wipe and like every

1066
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,699
fifth or every 10th test they're going

1067
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:04,500
to do a calibration again but after

1068
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:06,419
every sample they're going to do an ISO

1069
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,539
wipe or some of them use like you know

1070
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,680
an ISO spray bottle and spray it down

1071
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:12,599
same type of thing though before you

1072
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:14,879
start calibrate it your fifth or your

1073
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,980
10th or whatever start working in a

1074
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,599
calibration step and then you know that

1075
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,579
the unit has been calibrated after a

1076
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,619
certain amount of tests all the time

1077
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,539
but the same thing would come into play

1078
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:26,519
We would tell them in large facilities

1079
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:28,980
that you run want to run each sample

1080
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:31,019
five times record those five in your

1081
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,400
database then you can go back and see

1082
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:34,139
what it is

1083
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,180
um and even at that point I get into the

1084
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:38,400
an aspect we have a notes section in the

1085
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:39,838
app which you know about uh but we get

1086
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,139
into some of that coding you know what

1087
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:45,119
room number what row what table what

1088
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:48,960
genetic and we're able to kind of get

1089
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,300
them into a standardized aspect so

1090
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,579
purple as a company doesn't have an sop

1091
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,099
that we give out with the device but if

1092
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:58,560
you ever contact us depending on what

1093
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,800
you want to have done with the device we

1094
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,539
can get in to an sop so you know we're

1095
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,220
talking about homogenizing crops and

1096
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:06,838
doing it that way if you want to go with

1097
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:08,639
the biggest number like I've said before

1098
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,838
you take the best coal on the top of the

1099
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,400
biggest plant that has the most light

1100
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,259
overlay that's always going to be your

1101
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,400
biggest potency number

1102
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,020
um and then you know if you want to get

1103
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,539
your least potency number which some

1104
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:19,858
people are into go into your lowers and

1105
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:21,300
take some of your popcorn and grind

1106
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:22,980
those up and check those is out and then

1107
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,720
you'll have your top of the mountain and

1108
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:28,380
your Valley you can kind of understand

1109
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,939
how your canopy Works within itself

1110
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,140
um but I mean yeah if anybody has any

1111
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,079
questions that they want to talk about

1112
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:35,578
sampling sample prep how to use the

1113
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,800
device for certain stuff we're always

1114
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:39,660
available for those talks and I I think

1115
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,060
you're right though there there are

1116
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:43,440
people that have multiple sample holders

1117
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:45,119
so you know they're only going to use

1118
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,099
the sample holder with one genetic and

1119
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,019
then take that off and a lot of the

1120
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,599
large facilities do that as well they'll

1121
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:52,800
buy you know two devices and five sample

1122
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,140
holders and a bunch of different

1123
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,880
Grinders and there's somebody cleaning

1124
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:59,159
the grinder and doing an ISO wash on

1125
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,740
that before they do another one that

1126
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:03,779
happens a lot in the lab setting

1127
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,819
um and you know we can even get into how

1128
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,619
you got to rinse it out with three

1129
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,420
different types of water and all that BS

1130
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,700
and stuff that obviously is more

1131
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,039
scientific but we've dealt with that

1132
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:16,500
person in a white coat all the way down

1133
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:18,000
to you know myself being Barefoot with

1134
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,739
long hair in my own garden trying to

1135
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,480
test out what I want to do but yeah any

1136
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:22,919
of those will work

1137
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,800
um and depending on what you want to do

1138
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,420
we we can advise how that may be better

1139
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,740
or worse on what you're trying to do for

1140
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,960
an sop

1141
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:32,819
yeah that's great and just to clarify

1142
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,980
because you sort of touched on it

1143
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,380
um do you know of dispensaries or

1144
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,940
grow-ups that use the purple as their

1145
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,358
primary testing unit and like don't

1146
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,220
really engage in like say hplc or gcms

1147
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:46,500
anymore or do you think it's it's more

1148
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:47,879
of like a companion tool for other

1149
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,460
things as well

1150
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,559
well so I know in the States you have to

1151
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,240
use third-party regulated testing for

1152
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,759
your labeling so I can't say that

1153
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,319
anybody has replaced that in the

1154
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,760
regulated lab

1155
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,200
um I do know in the grand the black

1156
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,640
market there are people that are using a

1157
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,858
purple and not sending stuff out to

1158
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:08,159
testing Labs anymore and I do know in

1159
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:10,380
the white Market here that there are

1160
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,879
probably at least 20 off the top of my

1161
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,400
head that are using it internally

1162
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,599
because it's cheaper so they can every

1163
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,220
Harvest you know they're only going to

1164
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,260
send the sampling that has to get

1165
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:21,779
sampled because it's going to cost them

1166
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,359
400 they're still running a bunch of

1167
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,180
tests and probably before Harvest and

1168
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:29,460
after before Harvest at Harvest and in

1169
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:31,980
the Cure so our device does measure

1170
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,420
moisture content and water activity uh

1171
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,219
so here in Colorado there's a term

1172
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,559
called the colorado crunch but if you

1173
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,239
leave any weed out here it gets super

1174
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:41,219
dry because we're at six thousand eight

1175
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:42,779
thousand feet and there's no humidity I

1176
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:44,699
mean today I think outside of my house

1177
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,380
is like ten percent eight percent

1178
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:47,578
humidity

1179
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,500
um so there's a lot of people that are

1180
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:52,079
checking throughout the Cure not

1181
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,239
necessarily for the potency to rise as

1182
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,740
it will in curing anyways but more on

1183
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,019
that moisture content when they get down

1184
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:59,399
to that 10 to 12 they know it's

1185
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:01,440
perfectly cured and they want to start

1186
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,940
putting it in their cans to seal it up

1187
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,980
or putting it in their containers or

1188
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,179
their jars or whatever so there are a

1189
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,760
lot of dispensaries in the states

1190
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:11,279
currently that use it as a companion in

1191
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,900
two potency testing or what we would

1192
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,940
call like a full lab test they have to

1193
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,760
do potency they have to do microbiobials

1194
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,679
heavy metals pesticides terpenes are not

1195
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,599
mandatory anywhere so that's a whole

1196
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,618
different conversation

1197
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,300
um but yeah I mean there's a lot of

1198
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:26,280
women in fact

1199
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,500
of those 20

1200
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,359
I think four or five of them are

1201
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,579
multi-state operators that probably

1202
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,679
amount to

1203
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,359
50 plus facilities across the country

1204
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,739
and I know that there's a device in

1205
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:40,139
every one of their facilities because

1206
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:41,939
that's part of what I I deal with for

1207
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:44,219
work

1208
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,079
that's fantastic I love that and you

1209
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:47,759
just you've touched on concentrates

1210
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,760
earlier but you've just mentioned

1211
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,859
terpenes now I've I've heard rumors that

1212
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,839
terpenes are going to be something which

1213
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:56,460
will be able to be tested in the future

1214
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:59,460
are you able to tell us any more about

1215
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:03,240
that or is it under lock and key

1216
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:05,159
I mean it's somewhat lock and key so we

1217
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:06,838
we have an extract model that'll come

1218
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,539
out with the same device so that's just

1219
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,818
a software update we also have a new

1220
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:13,800
update coming on the flowers which will

1221
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,059
be about potency and other things that

1222
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,039
it can do

1223
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:20,159
in the terpene conversation the only

1224
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,559
thing I can say is that unfortunately

1225
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,199
the terpene testing will not happen with

1226
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,659
near-infrared spectroscopy because of

1227
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:30,960
the viscosity and the liquid of terpenes

1228
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:33,480
does not reflect that well so it would

1229
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,500
be a different device I think a lot of

1230
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,659
people can

1231
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,219
understand with that sentence that

1232
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:40,139
there's a lot of things being looked at

1233
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:42,480
I think there are things that could be

1234
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:44,039
developed but unfortunately it won't be

1235
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,318
the purple Pro that would do the

1236
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,420
terpenes it would be a different thing

1237
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,818
that would have to do the terpenes

1238
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,440
um and same when we get into heavy

1239
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:54,000
metals and pesticides like when you're

1240
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,800
working on parts per billion with

1241
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,099
pesticides and the regulated testing

1242
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,619
that reflection isn't really there

1243
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,720
um but I can't say you know as a a

1244
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,838
full-blown terp head that I am and what

1245
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:09,239
I love to do uh there's a lot of talks

1246
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:11,219
on on how a new device or a new

1247
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,358
technology would be able to do terpenes

1248
00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:13,919
so

1249
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,500
you know it's not under lock and key

1250
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,119
that much because I'll talk about it but

1251
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,460
it is under lock and key that it won't

1252
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,858
be the purple Pro and I don't know how

1253
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,380
fast that'll occur either

1254
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:27,059
um mostly because technology is to

1255
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,240
measure terpenes

1256
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:32,880
have not been found to be mobile and

1257
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,739
small enough so I mean like uh the

1258
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,838
purple Pro itself is about the size of a

1259
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:38,639
hockey puck the coaster that you put

1260
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:41,699
your drink on if it was an inch and a

1261
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,318
half tall it's about that size

1262
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:45,179
um and so there's some limitations with

1263
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:47,519
technology to do terpenes that we're

1264
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:49,618
still trying to work out so

1265
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,119
I think if I can say that we're trying

1266
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:52,740
to work it out I know something's

1267
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,119
hopefully coming at some point in the in

1268
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:55,439
the future but it won't be the near

1269
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,300
future

1270
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,159
that's great to hear I know a lot of

1271
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,160
people are very much Keen to hear more

1272
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:04,078
about that I um I wanted to ask you

1273
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,019
about one of the most interesting things

1274
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,180
from a a private discussion we had uh

1275
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:10,858
last time we spoke was how you were

1276
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:13,318
talking to me about how the unit can be

1277
00:46:10,858 --> 00:46:15,179
used for Fino hunting and as someone who

1278
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:17,460
does a lot of Fino hunting and a bit of

1279
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:18,719
breeding myself I was really Keen to

1280
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,720
hear more because that sounds like

1281
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,338
revolutionary what sort of role do you

1282
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:25,559
see the unit playing and how have people

1283
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:27,259
used it to Aid in their final hunts that

1284
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:30,599
you're aware of

1285
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,760
so the biggest the biggest way I can

1286
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:36,119
describe an infino hunting is that and

1287
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,700
and from a breeding life and project and

1288
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,700
I mean I've been involved with

1289
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:43,199
tens and tens I can maybe say a hundred

1290
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:45,960
but definitely over 50 different

1291
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,179
breeding projects in my previous stuff

1292
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,619
with purple I've worked on probably 10

1293
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:51,659
or 12.

1294
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:53,940
but with Fino hunting obviously we're

1295
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:56,879
looking for a keeper or we're looking

1296
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:59,460
for multiple Keepers and before it used

1297
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,660
to be a couple different you know little

1298
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,119
columns that you were trying to check

1299
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:05,399
yeah it has bag appeal yeah it matures

1300
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,619
fast yeah it has weight yeah it has good

1301
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,780
color but in Fino hunting there weren't

1302
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:13,200
a lot of people that were actually uh

1303
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:15,180
able to access data on potency so the

1304
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,039
first thing with the the purple Pro was

1305
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:18,960
all right you just finished a final hunt

1306
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,480
and these are the 10 that you wanted to

1307
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,039
keep based on the other criteria let's

1308
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,920
test them and get you a number to see

1309
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,838
where they at and mostly like we talked

1310
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,220
about at the beginning of this there

1311
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,779
most of the people are finding out that

1312
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:34,019
the ones they really like are you know

1313
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,420
20 to 24 and so they probably had some

1314
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:38,159
28s 29s and 27s that they threw away

1315
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,260
because maybe it didn't have bag appeal

1316
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,299
maybe it wasn't color maybe it didn't

1317
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,099
yield the most and I will say

1318
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,300
specifically not yielding as much as

1319
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,700
other pants

1320
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,039
does have some indication on potency I

1321
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:52,739
don't know why it is but less buds

1322
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:54,599
usually means more potency and more buds

1323
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,759
sometimes means less potency for some

1324
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,400
reason within how the plant does all of

1325
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,099
it so that's where we started in 2019

1326
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,720
and that was on a Fino hunt that I ran

1327
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:06,780
with a bunch of genetics from an orange

1328
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:08,879
mints line that that we created with a

1329
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,460
bunch of other really great uh stuff

1330
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,720
from the female side so at that point we

1331
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,579
were like all right well now obviously

1332
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,919
when we run a final hunt we're gonna

1333
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:18,720
have to keep all these seeds and we have

1334
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,180
to keep everyone and test them to figure

1335
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,098
out which one is the keeper because if

1336
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:24,598
we're throwing away High potency who

1337
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,800
knows what else we're throwing away with

1338
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:28,859
the ones that we didn't keep because

1339
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,780
you're only keeping 10 out of 200 or 5

1340
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:32,400
out of 100 or whatever

1341
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,740
so the next round that we went through

1342
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,420
was with uh an outside source and a very

1343
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:38,338
good friend of mine that's here in the

1344
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,680
States and what we started doing is we

1345
00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:43,199
started testing samples in week two week

1346
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:45,559
four week six week eight and what we

1347
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:49,500
could see is with the purple Pro device

1348
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:53,219
you can start to see CBG translate into

1349
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,659
THC and CBD so week two there's not a

1350
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:56,399
lot going on and we're I mean literally

1351
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:58,980
drying out you know a couple leaves

1352
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,079
grinding them up doing it Whatever by

1353
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,780
the time we got to week four we started

1354
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:06,359
to see little bits of THC showing up

1355
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,819
throughout the Fino hunt by week six we

1356
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:10,619
were able to see most of them but also

1357
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:14,338
how the numbers correlated you know like

1358
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:17,039
hey you know seed number 17 is at six

1359
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:19,739
percent already in week six but seed

1360
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:21,599
number 10 is only a two well do we want

1361
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:23,759
to keep the two is the two magically

1362
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,619
gonna get bigger so then you know by

1363
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,900
week six week eight you're starting to

1364
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:29,519
see real numbers by week eight if you

1365
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,800
want to go into 10 and 12 and all that

1366
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:34,079
stuff with your sativas you start to see

1367
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,000
a bunch of other stuff going down so now

1368
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,859
through those projects what what we have

1369
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,280
understood and the last application that

1370
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:43,799
we did was we did a 400 seed hunt with a

1371
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,720
breeding company and by week six we were

1372
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,900
able to get them from 400 seeds down to

1373
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:51,118
150 seeds so what this did was save on

1374
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:54,240
water save on nutrients save on labor

1375
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,880
save on light space and by week eight we

1376
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:59,699
were down to like about 60 or 70 seeds

1377
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,220
total of the 400 and then they wanted to

1378
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:04,679
grow those out through completion and by

1379
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:06,779
saving space labor nutrients and

1380
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:08,399
everything else they were able to take a

1381
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,619
previous Fino hunt that they had done

1382
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,559
and started to work those seeds faster

1383
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:16,680
so the room that had 400 seeds that now

1384
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:19,380
only has 60 or 70 seeds has room for

1385
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:21,598
your gen 3 of whatever line to be tested

1386
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,760
and grown out by the 10 that you're

1387
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,039
trying to keep there my cultivation

1388
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,420
background I was like was you know more

1389
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:29,099
importantly than anything if we can just

1390
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:32,280
save you on water and labor and you go

1391
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:34,380
from 400 seeds to 80 seeds that's fast

1392
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,119
then that's what we need to do so I

1393
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:38,818
don't think there's you know a huge way

1394
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:40,680
to change a lot of that stuff but that's

1395
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:43,139
that's how it goes on how it can work in

1396
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:45,659
Fino hunting is that not only can we

1397
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:47,879
save actual dollars but we're able to

1398
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:49,679
kind of increase the projects as fast as

1399
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,200
possible so you can work on things

1400
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,940
faster and you can find a real keeper

1401
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:55,500
with a potency now right like you you

1402
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,720
look at a lot of those seed packaging

1403
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,300
and they have a potency number on them

1404
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,919
and also they say how fast they're going

1405
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,660
to mature I mean if they haven't been

1406
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,338
tested and they don't know a lot of

1407
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:06,838
those numbers don't don't have they

1408
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:08,880
don't mean anything they're just put on

1409
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:11,039
there to fill space

1410
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,140
yeah certainly certainly

1411
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,000
I uh had one last question for you

1412
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:17,338
before we wrap up

1413
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,619
I I wanted to ask you because I think

1414
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:22,679
anyone who's got a purple will probably

1415
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:25,880
have discovered this same thing

1416
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:30,058
um there are a bunch of really weird

1417
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:33,660
high production quality smear ads for

1418
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:35,940
purple online and it's and it's it's so

1419
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:38,879
weird because like you can tell it's

1420
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,740
like [ __ ] but it seems like there's

1421
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,240
so much money being put into making

1422
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:45,118
these ads or maybe I'm giving them too

1423
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:47,159
much credit but it's so odd I will ask

1424
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,500
is this is this one of the the tea bag

1425
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:51,838
videos that's from Canada because that's

1426
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,400
one of the ones I hear about well yeah

1427
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,380
it made me think is this some

1428
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,119
disgruntled employee because it's and

1429
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,500
and the claims they make are ludicrous

1430
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,960
like there's ones on YouTube where it's

1431
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:03,539
like someone's like I owned a dispensary

1432
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,780
and bought 10 pounds of CBD Bud because

1433
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:08,039
the purple said it was THC and it's and

1434
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,599
it's just these weird [ __ ] where you're

1435
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:11,818
like well wouldn't you like that's just

1436
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,500
on you mate that's a stupid statement to

1437
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:15,599
make right but but what I'm interested

1438
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,760
in is it seems like it's very much like

1439
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,559
a targeted campaign and maybe from like

1440
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,540
a company like a competitor or something

1441
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:23,940
like it's very off-putting like what's

1442
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:26,039
the deal with that so originally what

1443
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,760
had happened is that in Canada there was

1444
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:31,858
a a podcast of video cast or whatever

1445
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,380
um and they had put some Lipton iced tea

1446
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:38,460
or something on the device so obviously

1447
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:39,539
we we spent years testing cannabis we

1448
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,338
don't put

1449
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:43,079
you know grass from your lawn and a

1450
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:44,818
bunch of other stuff on there so there

1451
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,440
was a video of putting some Lipton tea

1452
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:49,019
on there and it read out that it had THC

1453
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,940
in it and I guess you know from from our

1454
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:52,380
science core they're like well if you

1455
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,940
know it's looking nice tea you know that

1456
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,318
I mean that doesn't matter it's you're

1457
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,119
trying to test cannabis and see what's

1458
00:52:55,318 --> 00:53:00,539
up with that or hemp you know one of the

1459
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,640
two so that that video definitely went I

1460
00:53:00,539 --> 00:53:06,058
would say somewhat viral and it wasn't

1461
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,739
from any competitor there is there is no

1462
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:09,599
disgruntled employee we only have like

1463
00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:11,759
six employees total so it's not that

1464
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,818
aspect but I do know that there are

1465
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,339
people that make other devices that grab

1466
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:18,659
that video and kind of ran with it

1467
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:20,699
um and I do know that there are some

1468
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:23,519
competitors that I'll I'll never waste

1469
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:25,618
time naming but they they have put a lot

1470
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,659
of money into it and I think

1471
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,858
you know in internally at purple what I

1472
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:30,058
tell everybody I'm like hey if people

1473
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:31,619
are trying to hack you down and people

1474
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:33,480
are trying to do that obviously

1475
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:35,700
something's working well you know we

1476
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,079
have thousands of devices out across the

1477
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:39,000
whole entire globe that are doing

1478
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:40,619
something but every now and then you

1479
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,659
have one of those that'll that'll pop up

1480
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:44,099
the funniest one about the one that you

1481
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:46,379
mentioned about buying the 10 pounds of

1482
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:49,019
CBD is that in Amsterdam currently

1483
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:51,480
there's 50 different coffee shops just

1484
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:53,759
in Amsterdam that use it throughout

1485
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,679
their purchasing process every single

1486
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,440
day for that exact reason that they

1487
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,539
don't want to buy CBD so about a year

1488
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,119
ago there was an influx of this hemp in

1489
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:06,300
CBD flower that they were trying to sell

1490
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,980
to coffee shops in Amsterdam and our our

1491
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,380
European distributor who does an

1492
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,460
unbelievable job started coming in and

1493
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,079
they're like no we'll test it for you

1494
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,699
now we'll test it for you and that

1495
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:17,519
eventually made every coffee shop pretty

1496
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:20,219
much buy one and all of that CBD heavy

1497
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,019
hemp flower then started to migrate down

1498
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:23,699
to Spain because they were trying to

1499
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:26,219
sell it at the coffee shops in Barcelona

1500
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:27,598
everywhere else so those people that own

1501
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:29,279
those businesses and the people that own

1502
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,680
the businesses in Amsterdam talk all the

1503
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,000
time so a lot of the places in Barcelona

1504
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,098
all have a purple as well and before

1505
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,139
they buy anything they test it on there

1506
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:39,300
and it's because there's nowhere else to

1507
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:40,858
test anything so in Amsterdam there's no

1508
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,599
regulated labs in Spain there's no

1509
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:44,098
regular labs in Thailand there's no

1510
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,980
regulated labs

1511
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:49,019
they use the purple Pro not as like a

1512
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,639
mandatory regulated lab but they do use

1513
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:52,440
it for their purchasing power so they're

1514
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,358
like hey man you know this is only eight

1515
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,940
percent I'm not paying you the same as

1516
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:58,858
the guy that just brought us the 16 but

1517
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,619
I will I will tell you you know the the

1518
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:04,679
I think it is it is funny that they're

1519
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:06,240
considered smear ads or Etc because a

1520
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:07,799
lot of the people talk to me about them

1521
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,419
they're like dude I saw this crazy video

1522
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,039
like what's up with that I know you work

1523
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,180
at purple I'm like well this is the

1524
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,858
perfect time for me to tell you about

1525
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:15,838
the purple Pro now so I think it's

1526
00:55:13,858 --> 00:55:17,759
backfired in that realm

1527
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,139
um but the tea bag went is is a funny

1528
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,819
one just because like I tell people all

1529
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:23,519
the time if you put a cucumber on there

1530
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:24,960
like did you did you smoke the Cucumber

1531
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,179
like you know what it is it's about

1532
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,619
human logic and then it's about device

1533
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:30,058
logic

1534
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:31,858
um and the device is not supposed to

1535
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:33,300
tell you what everything is it's not

1536
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:34,318
going to tell you what a banana plane is

1537
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,180
it's going to tell you what what

1538
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,759
cannabis or hemp is because that's

1539
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:40,558
obviously what it's been developed to do

1540
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,420
um but it is it is a it is a really

1541
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:46,200
funny question I would say

1542
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,760
probably once every two weeks somebody

1543
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:49,259
that I'm speaking with wants to ask me

1544
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,819
about it and and same thing like with

1545
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,440
what you just brought up I'm like I got

1546
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:53,639
no issue talking about it like as soon

1547
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,380
as you get a purple Pro in your hand

1548
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:57,358
you'll figure out what you want to

1549
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,400
believe but I will say there's some

1550
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,779
unbelievable production and editing that

1551
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,338
they've put into those videos I mean

1552
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,079
they they look like they're really nice

1553
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:08,279
videos for sure

1554
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:10,500
yeah it's so um it's so weird because it

1555
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,559
feels like to me is such a backfire like

1556
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:16,318
this the videos are so disingenuous it's

1557
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:18,599
obvious from the word go and it's just

1558
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:21,300
like yeah it's just like [ __ ] get

1559
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,220
someone from like PR on your team

1560
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,780
because this is not a good PR move for

1561
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:27,239
the the company trying to do this it's

1562
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,160
just yeah it's so unbelievable that it

1563
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:31,500
makes you want to go get the purple and

1564
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:33,118
try it out I feel like it's it's so

1565
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,818
far-fetched it's almost like I gotta see

1566
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,500
this for myself it's like when you watch

1567
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:39,599
a bunch of crazy [ __ ] on TV and you're

1568
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,818
like there's no way it's that bad and

1569
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,160
then you want to go grab it's it's it's

1570
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:46,679
an interesting tactic but yeah I mean I

1571
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:49,019
I hear about them I see the funniest

1572
00:56:46,679 --> 00:56:50,460
part is is that I mean I have a lot of

1573
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:53,699
friends in the Cannabis industry in the

1574
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,260
states and so I get sent you know DMS or

1575
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:56,939
texts or all like dude have you seen

1576
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,559
this one this is the craziest I've ever

1577
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,659
seen I'm like yeah man and then

1578
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,040
literally like the next thing is like oh

1579
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:03,598
[ __ ] my buddy wants to buy one of those

1580
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:04,558
I forgot to hit you up last week and I'm

1581
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,880
like all right well let's get them a

1582
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,059
purple Pro

1583
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,318
um it's it's it is hilarious to me but I

1584
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,760
would agree with you it's you know

1585
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:13,259
somebody's putting some time and effort

1586
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,720
into that I just don't think it's

1587
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:18,319
working out the way they want to yeah

1588
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:20,759
hugely hugely what's that old saying um

1589
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,980
focus on building your Castle rather

1590
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,500
than knocking others down so there you

1591
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,539
go well yeah glad to hear it did strike

1592
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,219
me as a poor business decision on their

1593
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:31,318
part but whatever you know it brings

1594
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:32,939
eyes to you love it I think that pretty

1595
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:34,199
much runs over most things I wanted to

1596
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,880
chat about with you today was there

1597
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:37,558
anything you wanted to touch on that we

1598
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,480
haven't mentioned so far

1599
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:41,579
no I mean I think the biggest thing you

1600
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,338
know from from my background and what I

1601
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:45,780
love to do like you know if you're if

1602
00:57:44,338 --> 00:57:48,058
you're on the fence about trying to grow

1603
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,440
something try some out grow something

1604
00:57:48,059 --> 00:57:53,160
you got to kill a lot of plants before

1605
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,780
you're ever going to grow a 27 or 29

1606
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:56,338
um so you know the further the further

1607
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,260
you get down that Journey the better the

1608
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:59,759
fruit gets and you got to start the

1609
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:02,160
journey at some point so you know I I

1610
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,960
hope everybody can can get as involved

1611
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:05,879
as they want to if you're just a smoker

1612
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,440
then that's great too if you want to try

1613
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,420
to figure out if you're a green thumb
