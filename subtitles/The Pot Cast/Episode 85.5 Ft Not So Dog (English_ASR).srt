huge shout out to not so dog for giving

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,420
us so much of his time we're very

102
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,459
grateful here to talk all things history

103
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:17,699
reading politics

104
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,019
and so so much more so without further

105
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,639
delay

106
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,620
one thing I found really interesting

107
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,060
about what you just said there was you

108
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,459
know you said that the chem 4 you think

109
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,040
it might have like some nl5 Haze in it

110
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,739
and you've said that the D is probably

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,419
the 91 crossed to the super skunk

112
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,579
so then my question becomes what do you

113
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:38,039
think the 91 is like you know we

114
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,959
discussed in our first part that it may

115
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,319
or may not be the park but I'd love to

116
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,659
hear just even generally like Afghani

117
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,459
and uh what sort of Vibes do you think

118
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,860
it'll be

119
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,000
well it's a great mystery but what I

120
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,740
will say

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,959
is that

122
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,120
um

123
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,620
CSI and I have this Theory

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,000
that

125
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:06,360
possibly

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,579
the chem 91 itself is an S1 already

127
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,800
because when we he when it when it got

128
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,800
S1

129
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,500
those seeds are so uniform

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,180
right like there's there's you know

131
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,319
there's some variance and potency and

132
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,259
there's a little bit of variance in

133
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,300
flavors and stuff like that but the look

134
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,460
and the growth pattern and all that it's

135
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,978
like very narrow

136
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,379
yeah right

137
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,300
um and so and that's you know that's

138
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:39,180
obviously observation

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,579
it's weird in the sense that

140
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,160
uh I'll bring up his name again or

141
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:47,339
whatever but uh because he's just so

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,020
prolific but he's told me that basically

143
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,299
there's almost nothing in his collection

144
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:56,399
that passes on potency

145
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:59,400
as consistently as the chem 91.

146
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,258
yeah you know that it you know it

147
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,359
doesn't look that great and a lot of

148
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,639
times it's it's dark it's not that

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,319
Frosty you know it has these weird

150
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,538
leaves that likes to eat itself

151
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,819
sometimes and you know like the leaves

152
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,860
yellow and look all funky and start

153
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,139
dying on you and stuff but the actual

154
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,840
weed itself

155
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,840
um you know it really is potent it

156
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:24,959
affects most humans pretty strongly

157
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,959
right and so

158
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,478
I you know I don't actually believe it's

159
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,120
related to the puck at all

160
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,459
um I've seen I've grown the puck I've

161
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,620
grown hybrids of the puck

162
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,000
um I know there's a rumor that it's like

163
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,639
you know and some people strongly

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,680
believe that it's from Oregon and that

165
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,538
like there was this dog Bud that got

166
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,160
crossed to the puck and that's what they

167
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,620
got

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,199
um again that would be the type of thing

169
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,840
that the puck lives

170
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,120
right and so does the chem 91 and so if

171
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,579
we ever get genetic testing that's that

172
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,899
specific one would hope they'd be able

173
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:02,899
to tell mother and child

174
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:10,500
but I don't see very many growth

175
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,520
similarities or Buzz similarities in it

176
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,879
um

177
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:18,060
you know at the at the first uh you you

178
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,339
actually visited us the the

179
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,699
um at one of our uh can Illuminati

180
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,619
parties that happened after Emerald cup

181
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,439
um at the the second year but that for

182
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,740
the year before that that you weren't at

183
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:34,560
uh you know I had all these kinds of

184
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,300
theories about it and CSI was like

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,689
what if it's just an S1 what if it's

186
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,220
just an NL leaning S1 of nl5 haze

187
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,259
[Music]

188
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,199
and I was like [ __ ] you know I didn't

189
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,360
want to believe it but

190
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,879
um it's that's the funny thing about it

191
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,780
is there's so little known you can

192
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,680
almost insert your pet Theory into it

193
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,478
and uh

194
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,220
you know because we don't know the

195
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,918
grower

196
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,780
the as far back as we can trace the chem

197
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,120
91

198
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,918
um are the middlemen

199
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,439
at best

200
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,258
so there's nothing verifiable on what it

201
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:16,500
was really uh we we do know that it came

202
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,620
that it was weed in 1991

203
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,598
and so you can look at you know uh

204
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,000
strains or around back then and you can

205
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:28,139
try to think of this or that or whatever

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,399
I wouldn't Hazard to guess

207
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,319
um but to me I've always kind of

208
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,838
considered it as some kind of throwback

209
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,839
ancient Afghan

210
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,700
some kind of like weird Kush

211
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,539
you know

212
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,300
um

213
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:44,819
just because it was you know

214
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,879
it's its effect is so Indica it is a

215
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,300
little taller than a lot of afghans

216
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:53,759
you know it has some stretch to it

217
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:57,059
um which is unusual but I wouldn't

218
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,740
Hazard to guess because you know I was

219
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:02,819
just barely starting to smoke weed back

220
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,339
then and I don't think we uh you know I

221
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,320
think our best hope is for genetics to

222
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,720
prove the relationships between these

223
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,459
things but that won't necessarily tell

224
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,580
us where it came from

225
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:17,338
that'll just tell us what came after

226
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,720
sure yeah I can agree and just to

227
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,220
quickly clarify because you sort of

228
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,600
alluded to it but I'd love to just get

229
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,519
it firmly because I remember I asked

230
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,159
skunk bi the same thing

231
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,459
do you think that the chemdog does have

232
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,899
some amount of sativa component in its

233
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:34,018
lineage

234
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,278
I could buy that yes

235
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,600
I could

236
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:41,458
yeah very interesting it's Paul you know

237
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,639
in in a sense

238
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:47,518
um it's kind of it's kind of lanky uh

239
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,580
you know uh it's it's certainly not some

240
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,259
like squat Afghan thing like the puck or

241
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,360
like

242
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,419
um like purple Urkle or you know

243
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,000
something that like grows super slow and

244
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:02,219
super tight inner nodes has a certain

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,879
amount of stretch to it

246
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,399
um I take it 10 weeks

247
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,980
so it goes you know

248
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,278
um 70 I know there's debate on when to

249
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,080
take it I take it upper 60s you know 70

250
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,679
days that's when I find to be the

251
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,480
potency to be the best for me

252
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,059
you know there's been people that have

253
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,339
started taking it earlier because it

254
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:30,000
tests higher earlier

255
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:33,000
in terms of like THC percentage

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,480
um but I don't care about THC percentage

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,519
I care about my preferences

258
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,080
you know so

259
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,639
um and it seems like when you take it 70

260
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,800
days

261
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,679
um it likes to fall in that like 18 to

262
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:49,259
22 percent range

263
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,838
but if you take it in at 55 days it

264
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:54,120
tests at like 29 percent

265
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,180
but I think it's worse wheat yeah

266
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,299
interesting I mean you're a good person

267
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:02,939
to ask this one to what sort of genetics

268
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,039
in general do you think pair really well

269
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,899
with the chem dog style genetics do you

270
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,120
think like so for example do you think

271
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,679
sort of pairing it with other cushy

272
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
similar sorts of plants do you think

273
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:14,278
really radically different crosses tend

274
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,500
to do pretty well from your experience

275
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:21,299
what do you think are good pairs usually

276
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,019
reading in general radically different

277
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:27,439
is all is usually better than very

278
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,440
similar

279
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,720
as a general rule

280
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,700
um you know

281
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,379
I've gone on record saying this a whole

282
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:40,440
bunch uh I think uh chem skunk

283
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,700
is unbelievable hybrid

284
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,519
you know

285
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,519
um because chem brings you know skunk

286
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,759
tends to not be that potent really

287
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:54,060
um chem brings the potency and the skunk

288
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,939
brings Aromas and it brings Frost and it

289
00:11:54,059 --> 00:12:01,859
brings you know some stretch and stuff

290
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:05,100
like that so uh I am a big proponent of

291
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,639
crossing radically different things and

292
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,440
seeing what comes out uh I don't think

293
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,958
that sometimes when you cross things

294
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,120
that are too similar to one another you

295
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,679
don't actually get that much interesting

296
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,480
progeny

297
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,219
you know and I think that's kind of

298
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,920
happened with cookies

299
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,980
uh where they crossed way too many of

300
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,740
the similar things together for too long

301
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,120
and they lost certain aspects of of

302
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,379
quality in there and then they can't

303
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,039
find them again

304
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:37,259
so I think the best thing for chem dog

305
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,360
to cross to is something that you think

306
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,059
is like got really good growth traits

307
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,379
and is really terpy but maybe lacks

308
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,739
potency

309
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:49,620
and you want some added heft to the bud

310
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,659
and you want to add some potency

311
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,120
um adding potency would be the number

312
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,240
one reason I would cross chem dog to

313
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,240
something yeah you mentioned skunk in

314
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,919
there is a nice counterpart you've got a

315
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,139
decent amount of experience with the

316
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,539
super skunk and I'd love to ask you you

317
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,700
know how how would you describe the

318
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,699
super skunk what was it like was it like

319
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,820
rks to you was it something different do

320
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,959
you think it came from

321
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,760
uh the sssc skunk stock that skunk VA

322
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,879
talks about when he says that the story

323
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:27,000
he was told from his mentor is that it

324
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,639
was like an F2 of some skunk stock what

325
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,919
do you think it is genetically and what

326
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,600
was it like from your memory

327
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,539
uh well the

328
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,579
certainly the um what it's like from the

329
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,860
memory I'll chat about and that can just

330
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:43,259
be my personal thing

331
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,019
um you know I've I can I've communicated

332
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,620
a bit with uh I guess we'll call them

333
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,600
skunk va's Mentor you know uh

334
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,659
but he

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,440
he's kind of like a

336
00:13:53,659 --> 00:14:01,019
uh older tour rainbow hippie and like a

337
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,320
lot of the guys that you interview or

338
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,720
talk to that bred in the 80s they didn't

339
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,639
really keep very good notes

340
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,379
and they kind of hodgepodged things

341
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,980
together

342
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,740
um

343
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,860
my understanding of it which does not

344
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,360
negate what he said whatever is that

345
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,480
you know

346
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,700
um dude had stuff from Neville and stuff

347
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,920
from SSC that was skunk

348
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,899
right which makes sense because in the

349
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,778
80s those are the really the only two

350
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,339
major seed banks that existed and he

351
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:34,799
crossed

352
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,420
um he crossed these various different

353
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,939
things together

354
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:41,399
okay over a number of years and he used

355
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,360
to call it the skunky skunk

356
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:47,759
okay and then I I believe in 1990 the

357
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,899
super skunk as a strain came out from

358
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,439
Neville

359
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:56,759
and I think that he took his skunky

360
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,940
skunk and crossed it to the super skunk

361
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,519
okay and I believe when some people call

362
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,660
it the skunk six or whatever that was

363
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:09,060
this the number six Fino of that cross

364
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,799
now could it have been he made that

365
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,958
cross to the super skunk and then made

366
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,240
f2s and then it popped out of there too

367
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,219
sure you know

368
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,278
um he's light on detail when it comes to

369
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,379
that and I do believe that you know uh

370
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,179
skunk VA you know he told a different

371
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,860
story a long time ago and I don't think

372
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,120
it has anything to do with lying or

373
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,800
anything like that I just think it's

374
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,320
like different pieces of information

375
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,759
come to you at different times

376
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,500
right

377
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,919
um and on top of that the guy that made

378
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,740
it got into some trouble uh with some uh

379
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,019
you know some Grateful Dead types things

380
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,019
and went on the run for a while

381
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,578
so it wasn't like dude was around okay

382
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,620
um when it comes to my own experiences

383
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:53,219
I'll just I'll say this

384
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,860
um it was lime green

385
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,720
uh it was fast I would say it was done

386
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,459
about eight weeks

387
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,320
okay

388
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,939
um if you took it longer it had a

389
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,300
tendency to harm

390
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:11,600
uh the Herms had live pollen

391
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:11,599
right and it sometimes would Herm early

392
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:16,019
so but that makes sense right because it

393
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,399
takes four or five you've made seeds it

394
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,759
takes four or five weeks after

395
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,159
pollination for a full seed to form

396
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,659
so if you pull down some chem dog or you

397
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,240
pull down some super skunk and there's

398
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,338
tiger striped viable seed in there at 60

399
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,720
days

400
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:37,019
that pollination had to happen

401
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,240
much earlier right so

402
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,419
um the super skunk wasn't the end-all

403
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,579
be-all that everybody makes it out to be

404
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,219
um it wasn't

405
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,958
it was moderate potency

406
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,120
right

407
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:54,719
um it grew fast it was very lime green

408
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,120
it was very frosty it it was it was

409
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,980
light and what I mean by that is like

410
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,620
you could put a really big bud on a

411
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,659
scale and you would be surprised at how

412
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,000
little it weighed

413
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:08,338
like it was it was I don't want to say

414
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,119
dense it was like well-formed

415
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:16,619
but not particularly dense

416
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,318
right you know uh and You Know It uh it

417
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,798
didn't smell like skunk at all in veg

418
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:24,838
but as it grew I would say probably two

419
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,240
three weeks before you harvested so

420
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,839
maybe like week six on

421
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,179
it was a real problem how bad it smelled

422
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,759
I mean people talk about like that lost

423
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,320
skunk terp I remember pulling up in my

424
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,419
driveway

425
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,058
with my windows down and getting out of

426
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,919
my car and being like Oh no

427
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,319
it was kind of like in the era before

428
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,580
carbon filters a lot of people actually

429
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:53,399
stopped growing it because it was a bust

430
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:56,399
it was really really hard to contain the

431
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,340
aroma in humans typically have a really

432
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,080
sensitive nose to that kind of that kind

433
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:04,558
of like

434
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:07,500
Funk that kind of skunk you know

435
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,720
um and so I could not you know people

436
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,660
talk about carbon filter Killers you

437
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,600
know this was before carbon filters but

438
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,538
I could not contain the smell

439
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,579
I couldn't it the last couple weeks a

440
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:24,720
harvest it was like before Harvest it

441
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:26,759
was like oh man you know uh I would pump

442
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,779
it into my attic I would put it through

443
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,179
like

444
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:33,119
um you know UV generators and then have

445
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:35,340
like a 30-foot run and tubing to let the

446
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,500
UV try to kill it I would blow it in my

447
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:39,058
garage I would do all these different

448
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,119
things because it was kind of the era

449
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:44,339
before carbon filters became popular it

450
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,339
still reeked to high heaven

451
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,500
it rigged like crazy

452
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:52,079
um and what was interesting about that

453
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,058
is I didn't know I didn't nobody in my

454
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,240
circle ever talked about terpenes or

455
00:18:54,058 --> 00:19:00,359
anything like that but today I would say

456
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,038
that the thing that made it skunky was

457
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,199
pretty volatile

458
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,359
in the sense that

459
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,700
the two weeks before Harvest it wreaked

460
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,558
during Harvest it reeked and for that

461
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,620
first three or four weeks after you cut

462
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:18,259
it it really stank but the older it got

463
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,259
the more generic green weed it became

464
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,900
right

465
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:27,440
um and you know it was best fresh

466
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,120
like as soon as you could get it to burn

467
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,798
that was when it was the best in fact

468
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,239
Staten Island and I we used to grow it

469
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,879
you know um

470
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,339
we used to grow rooms of it together and

471
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,440
we would like the the dog often because

472
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,538
it was denser it often took three or

473
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,000
four weeks of like drying and curing

474
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,079
before it got like its best self

475
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,660
yeah

476
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,519
so we would often smoke Super Skunk

477
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,500
incessantly

478
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,660
for two or three weeks

479
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,259
until

480
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,360
the chem dog kind of came into its own

481
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,058
because we learned if we smoked the chem

482
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,879
dog too fresh it just wasn't as good of

483
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,980
an experience as if we waited

484
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,360
and if you waited too long for the Super

485
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:15,058
Skunk it got worse so if I used to if I

486
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,038
made hash from the skunk it would

487
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:19,918
actually keep in the jar it would keep

488
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,259
the skunk Aroma for a while but I can

489
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,900
remember smoking a bunch of like six

490
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:27,538
seven eight week old super skunk

491
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,880
and like the flavor was mostly gone and

492
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:31,019
it would almost go to like generic green

493
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,299
weed

494
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:36,298
so whatever the terpenes or whatever the

495
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:37,980
theols or whatever the components that

496
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,900
made that aroma

497
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,960
they were somewhat volatile and maybe

498
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,419
they oxidized and they were they only

499
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,660
lasted for a period of time

500
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:49,500
in fact when I was talking to you about

501
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,980
um

502
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,859
uh you know what would I breed chem dog

503
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,519
to the whole idea of breeding chemdog

504
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:02,699
and skunk together was to get the frost

505
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,740
and the stretch and the lime green and

506
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,980
the flavor of the skunk

507
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,380
onto something more potent

508
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,019
because it wasn't that potent I bet if

509
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,280
you I bet if we had it today and you

510
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,918
were testing it it would probably come

511
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,599
out in the mid teens

512
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,360
and I don't think I don't think it would

513
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:25,379
be nearly as potent as like death star

514
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:28,439
or TK or sour diesel or you know I mean

515
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:31,380
to me Sour Diesel is chem skunk

516
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,298
at its at its core that to me was was

517
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,539
the Super Skunk the super skunk was not

518
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:39,000
a perfect strain it harmed

519
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:40,558
um it's uh and then obviously sometimes

520
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,960
too it's like when it Herms it's like

521
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,759
back then it wasn't such a big deal but

522
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,440
even still if you had little white seeds

523
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,019
or little immature anything in the weed

524
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,820
people were gonna complain

525
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,740
um a lot of people got rid of it because

526
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:54,418
of how it smelled and a lot of people

527
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,940
got rid of it because they got tired of

528
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,559
occasionally it herming out and throwing

529
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,019
a bunch of live pollen on their plants

530
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,359
and creating

531
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:06,480
immature to mature seeds like obviously

532
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,599
when you're trying to grow uh seedless

533
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,759
getting seeds is a pain in the ass

534
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:15,000
and um it's one of those things about

535
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,859
preservation where now for the last 10

536
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,400
15 years people have been falling all

537
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:22,918
over each other to try to find that terp

538
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,960
when there was a lot of people that had

539
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,299
that terp back in the day

540
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,519
and chose to go in a different direction

541
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:32,339
with weed than that

542
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,658
in fact when I got in trouble and I lost

543
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:35,759
it

544
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:37,860
um I couldn't get anybody to help me

545
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,480
back it up

546
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,939
to be fair

547
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,558
people wouldn't help me back it up there

548
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,620
you go there you go and look you

549
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:49,139
mentioned the sour diesel being skunk

550
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:50,819
Cam and something I certainly noted

551
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,120
myself was that when I look at those

552
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:57,000
early Polaroid skunk VA took of the

553
00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:00,058
super skunk that structure undeniably

554
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,919
looks like the sour d but I've also

555
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:04,558
heard you and many other people talk

556
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,500
about how sour d supposedly comes from

557
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,178
the diesel II so I'd love to hear how

558
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,359
does that all play together do you think

559
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,740
it's like just skunk onto chem or do you

560
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,119
think how do you think that plays into

561
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,579
diesel too

562
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,339
well again

563
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:22,558
um is one of those things that genetic

564
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:24,899
testing is the only real way to solve

565
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,538
the debate but if I had to make an

566
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:31,559
educated guess not being there I would

567
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:35,400
say that uh we'll call them weasel I

568
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:37,558
would say that the weed that weasel had

569
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,740
um was from Greg

570
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:42,599
and Greg was growing according to his

571
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:46,919
conversations with Staten Island he was

572
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:49,500
growing hybrids of skunk

573
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,880
Cam that he loved

574
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:57,720
and that skunk tended to throw Herms

575
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,960
into its progeny right and according to

576
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,440
you know uh swell and vondo they were

577
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,058
buying sacks of this weed and they were

578
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,340
collecting you know they found some

579
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:11,720
seeds 12 or 15 seeds over the course of

580
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:14,939
x amount of of purchases over time right

581
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,759
and that's what they popped that became

582
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,740
diesel one and Diesel 2.

583
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,919
right and then apparently

584
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,740
it harmed and they found seeds in diesel

585
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,419
too that lead to

586
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,159
sour

587
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:32,280
so I'm not going to sit here and and

588
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,440
claim you know uh that I know all the

589
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:35,579
steps and again it was young Partiers

590
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,779
and there was some different things

591
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:41,879
going on and it's a multi-stage accident

592
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,500
none of it was intentional

593
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,100
right

594
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:50,700
um but you know when I look at Sour

595
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:53,579
Diesel or the diesel family I can see

596
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,100
both parents

597
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:58,019
I can see skunk and I can see cam in it

598
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,480
does that mean it's the only thing in it

599
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:03,538
I can't say that for sure

600
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,980
but you know I've grown

601
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,919
um I've grown

602
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,500
you know uh M now for

603
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,900
I don't know 20 plus years right easily

604
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,220
and uh I grew the skunk for quite some

605
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,140
time

606
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,259
um the sour the original Sour Diesel

607
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,419
cutting I have even does the same weird

608
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:23,700
Leaf rust eating itself thing that

609
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:26,038
chem91 does

610
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,519
and then sometimes you crack a jar or

611
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:31,319
Sour Diesel and just reeks like skunk

612
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:33,538
you know and you see that like you said

613
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,899
you see that structure

614
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:39,240
there's an undeniable similarity right

615
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,798
like if you've seen Sour Diesel Spears

616
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,380
and you look at some of those old

617
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,839
Polaroids from skunk VA

618
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,700
it's not a big stretch to say that man

619
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,139
that spear really kind of looks like a

620
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,679
diesel spear

621
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,900
yeah so I'm not saying I know the

622
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,820
complete recipe to Sour Diesel but I

623
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,798
would say that the basis of it or a

624
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:00,720
large percentage of its genetics are

625
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,538
chem skunk

626
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,640
I would bet money I would bet money yeah

627
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:07,859
certainly certainly and then so I guess

628
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,380
the next question is what do you think

629
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:12,479
the differences are between some of the

630
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,159
more popular Sour Diesel Cuts you know

631
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,319
so you hear about Sour Diesel you hear

632
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,720
about East Coast Sour Diesel the

633
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,879
charcoals cut all these other ones do

634
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,440
you think they're most likely just s1s

635
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,659
of each other or do you think some of

636
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,538
them are just like hybrids but very much

637
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:30,299
leaning and then as a final follow-up do

638
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:32,158
you think the very original Sour Diesel

639
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,379
is still with us or what we have

640
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,900
circulating nowadays is all sort of

641
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,159
offspring

642
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,100
um

643
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,400
okay well I'll take that in chunks I

644
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:47,579
would say that this I can say for a fact

645
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,519
is that when Sour Diesel Sour Diesel was

646
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:51,658
probably the most popular strain in

647
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,298
America

648
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:57,120
for at least 10 years

649
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:58,259
okay in Mendocino County and Humboldt

650
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,719
out here

651
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:03,359
like there's a lot of strains now where

652
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,538
there's sort of like the the demand

653
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,678
might be high but it's also shallow

654
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:09,778
right

655
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,919
where in the sense with Sour Diesel and

656
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:13,619
it's heyday

657
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,600
if you had good Sour Diesel it was

658
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,979
basically endless the amount that you

659
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,038
could move

660
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:23,880
and nobody cared about lineage the I've

661
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:27,599
had I got a sour diesel cut on 2000 and

662
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,980
it came helpfully labeled sourdie

663
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,339
I don't know anything about its history

664
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,940
before that but what I can say is that

665
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:38,278
in that era it basically if it had the

666
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,620
nose and it had the look

667
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:43,019
like you know it's like a broker would

668
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,298
come by and they would open up the the

669
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,679
contractor bag of turkey bags and they

670
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,700
would stick their nose in it and they

671
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,220
would look up and they would be like

672
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,679
this is gonna work

673
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,960
like they'd still look at it but like

674
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,580
they it's like if the nose hit them that

675
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,278
strongly it's like they knew it was

676
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:01,558
going to work so

677
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,500
in the first wave of Sour Diesel nobody

678
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,899
cared about names it was like there was

679
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,058
one Sour Diesel cut and then like if

680
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,298
your broker liked it that was the cut

681
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:14,759
forums came into play like much like

682
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:16,500
you know the dog gets called the skunk

683
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,419
uh VA cut

684
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,700
because he was the first person on the

685
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:24,059
Forum sort of hyping it up

686
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,980
in a way right and like forums add names

687
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:27,538
to things

688
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,519
right

689
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:32,038
um like the choco cut

690
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,019
was the cut of Sour Diesel that came

691
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:36,538
from choco

692
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:38,038
the Amish cut was the cut of Sour Diesel

693
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:40,379
that came from

694
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:42,359
from shroomy

695
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,980
the res cut

696
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,798
you see what I'm saying

697
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,319
so it's like it's almost like a tie to

698
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,940
like well you know who spread it out or

699
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:53,339
who'd you get it from

700
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,980
and what happened is is that

701
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:57,480
no one really cared back in the day what

702
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,940
the lineage was

703
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,159
then Sour Diesel sort of got supplanted

704
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,080
a bit by cookies and Skittles and all

705
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,778
that and now it's sort of had another

706
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,759
wave in the sun in the last three or

707
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,798
four years and everyone's gotten

708
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:14,460
incredibly interested in the oldest

709
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:16,379
realest best diesel cut out there

710
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,360
but the problem is there's not like 15

711
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,100
or 20 cuts that have sour diesel

712
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:23,579
attached to them

713
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:25,859
I did in 2017 or something like that I

714
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,599
did this sour experiment where I was

715
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,759
like all right I'm gonna see I think my

716
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,158
headband is a renamed sour or something

717
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,839
like that maybe I got my Sour Diesel I'm

718
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,159
going to gather up all these sours and

719
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,839
I'm going to grow them side by side

720
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,600
indoor and in my greenhouses and I'm

721
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:42,359
going to figure out which ones mine are

722
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,759
and which ones are which ones are just

723
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:46,558
the same but different names

724
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:47,940
so I gather up eight or nine of them and

725
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,339
I grow them all side by side and they're

726
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,200
all [ __ ] different

727
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,980
and none of them are mine and I'm like

728
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,100
well

729
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,740
man you know and so there's East Coast

730
00:29:56,099 --> 00:30:03,778
Sour Diesel there's New York City Diesel

731
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:07,079
there's choco there's Amish there's

732
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:08,759
um res cut there's you know there you

733
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,359
can go through the list now the last

734
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:15,259
four or five years there's been Albany

735
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:17,759
you know Manny this that whatever else

736
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:19,619
and from what I understand from what

737
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,940
Vando and swell and Manny and these

738
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:22,859
other guys say

739
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,500
I don't think there was just one cut

740
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:28,139
even in the beginning

741
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,919
right like there was diesel one and two

742
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,899
and then you know he found Sour Diesel

743
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,899
in a bag of diesel too

744
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:39,418
but there was a few seeds

745
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:41,158
right and then Vando took according to

746
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,960
vondo he took some of those same seeds

747
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,059
and when he moved West he popped some of

748
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,640
them in LA

749
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:49,379
resdog did this thing which annoys the

750
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,038
crap out of me

751
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,778
which is you take a famous cut and you

752
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,919
make seeds with it and you name your

753
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:57,919
seed line the cut

754
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:05,759
so when RES dog is selling Sour Diesel

755
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:08,640
seeds how many of those seeds do you

756
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,679
think got named Sour Diesel

757
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,759
every one of them

758
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,380
right

759
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,179
and then when you've got a strain that's

760
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,799
that popular

761
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:20,519
that literally it's the most popular

762
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,918
strain going for probably a decade how

763
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,079
many bag seeds on a strain that

764
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,240
sometimes Harms

765
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:29,579
get found

766
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,558
and named

767
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,359
and so now it's like in the last three

768
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,519
or four years we've been trying to like

769
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,500
piece together what's what

770
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,418
and it's like a big family with

771
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,759
obviously like a lot of different cuts

772
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,259
involved and people have been putting on

773
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,940
their like Sherlock Holmes hat and

774
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,038
trying to sort it all out

775
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,580
and the deeper you go the more confusing

776
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,579
it gets

777
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,360
so far at least

778
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:56,220
and part of the problem like one of the

779
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:59,339
good things about like the chem dog

780
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,778
story is that Greg gave the chem dog to

781
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:02,759
Staten Island

782
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:05,278
he took it West

783
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:07,140
he ended up giving it to skunk the A and

784
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,940
he gave it to and you know I see

785
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,340
Collective got it and then I got it

786
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,259
right and so there's like really good

787
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:15,240
provenance of this person to this person

788
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:16,679
to this person and it ties back all the

789
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,778
way to the beginning

790
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,679
we don't really have that with sour

791
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:21,679
diesel very well

792
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:26,940
so so it's a big family with at least a

793
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:28,918
dozen to 15 cuts

794
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,019
that all have the d The Sour Diesel

795
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,419
moniker

796
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:35,639
and 25 years later we're trying to

797
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:37,259
figure it out

798
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,480
and everyone's convinced that they have

799
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:42,599
the oldest realist bestest

800
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,000
the right one the real one

801
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:48,240
ain't that the truth and you actually

802
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,720
must be a bit of a psychic on the

803
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,220
download because you predicted how I was

804
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,440
strategically lining these questions up

805
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,259
to ultimately get us to this one which

806
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,538
is I want to talk about res I want to

807
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:02,460
talk about splitting the art from the

808
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:05,700
artist you know I think he's a great

809
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:08,940
little uh piece to analyze for that

810
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:11,640
because I think undeniably he has to be

811
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,880
the person who's the most polarizing yet

812
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,799
equally has you know some work that is

813
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,919
really regarded by many to be quite

814
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:22,319
stand out and even more impressively is

815
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,120
that evidence has come out you know

816
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,339
about how he was just breeding in a few

817
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,439
tents and like you know like it all

818
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:30,000
seems very unimpressive which makes you

819
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,820
think like maybe there was some

820
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,220
legitimate skill involved there what's

821
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:36,839
your thoughts on the res situation in

822
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,179
terms of separating the art from the

823
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,220
artist do you have any soft spots for

824
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:44,038
his work

825
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,919
well you kind of have to

826
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:49,140
separate the art from the artist

827
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,940
because I'll tell you that in

828
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,600
researching

829
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,519
um

830
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,558
we have this like running joke amongst

831
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,558
my small group of friends when we start

832
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,038
battling about like the 80s or 90s or

833
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,658
something like that which is like which

834
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:06,119
untrustworthy [ __ ] do you put in your

835
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:09,358
corner that you're gonna go to bat for

836
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:11,159
because they all have warts

837
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,878
right

838
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,980
um and you know you look at I could pick

839
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:20,398
apart Sam Skunk Man

840
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,760
you could throw darts at Neville Shanti

841
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,980
you know you can you can I mean there's

842
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,000
uh you know uh Jim Ortega you know all

843
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,460
these different things and I'm not

844
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,780
throwing it out there to like knock any

845
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,760
of those people I'm just saying that

846
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,419
like humans are complicated

847
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,859
right and just because you do something

848
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:41,219
cool in weed

849
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:42,960
doesn't mean you're not an [ __ ]

850
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,480
you could be a narc you could be a wife

851
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,579
beater you could be a drug addict you

852
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,838
could be in general like not the

853
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:52,199
greatest person

854
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:54,719
and still produce cool beans that make

855
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,279
an impact

856
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,379
right

857
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,500
and so

858
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,200
um res is an interesting case in the

859
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,300
sense that even like my buddy high and

860
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:08,819
Lonesome will say like even long go on

861
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,960
the forums before all the the things

862
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,300
happened

863
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,000
he was kind of a jackass

864
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,500
you know he wasn't the nicest Homie by

865
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,400
any means right

866
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:23,519
and then you know he got supposedly you

867
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,260
know one of the more famous people in

868
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,539
weed in trouble

869
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,060
and he might be there's a big debate in

870
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:31,800
the community I didn't talk about this

871
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:33,000
um when we talked about the legal scene

872
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,220
but there's a big debate in the

873
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,358
community about what's knocking what's

874
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:39,598
ratting

875
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:42,838
doxing what what ethics are acceptable

876
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,640
right and there's a lot of people that

877
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:45,900
do things that I consider to be ratting

878
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,179
these days

879
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,680
that are perfectly that suffer no

880
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:54,179
consequences

881
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:56,699
right res is probably the person in the

882
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:59,399
community as far as like publicly being

883
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:01,739
shamed he's like the think of another

884
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,220
person that got publicly shamed for

885
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:04,219
ratting

886
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:09,659
he's not the only person that did it

887
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,820
there's a list

888
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:13,379
you know yeah just to your last question

889
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,760
like who else is being shame that much

890
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:20,099
like no one really no one you know

891
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,500
um you know so should should he be

892
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:25,280
excluded uh you know do I think he

893
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:28,619
deserves like some kind of extra special

894
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,300
you know you're a scumbag no

895
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,500
but I I think there should be more

896
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,500
people in the room with him

897
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:38,879
because because to me

898
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,039
like when it comes down to it if you

899
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,380
want to do something illegal

900
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,259
and you get caught

901
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,460
and you shut your mouth

902
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,579
right

903
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,800
and you just be quiet and you you accept

904
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:55,079
that what you did had some risk to it

905
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,900
and you go down

906
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,579
and not everyone does that

907
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,619
right and there can be all kinds of

908
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,539
nuance to it and you can say oh they

909
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,640
already knew so much about all these

910
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,779
different people

911
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,858
I was just filling in some blanks you

912
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,320
don't know what it'd been like to go

913
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,699
away for that long or whatever but when

914
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,920
it comes down to it it's like you're

915
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:15,299
throwing someone else under the bus

916
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,480
to get

917
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,700
a better situation for yourself

918
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,079
and people can have whatever views they

919
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:25,319
want on that

920
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,420
I don't approve and I generally speaking

921
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,220
don't engage with people that are

922
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,720
willing to do that some of that is just

923
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:32,699
self-preservation because I'm like well

924
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,679
if they did it once

925
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:36,598
why would ever why would I ever talk to

926
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:38,460
him about you know

927
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,380
I mean imagine like you hook up with

928
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,260
someone right and and you find out that

929
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,980
like she murdered her last husband

930
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,740
you might be like man

931
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,900
I'm gonna reevaluate things

932
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:54,199
oh that was an extenuating circumstances

933
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,539
you know but it would be red and and so

934
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:59,159
separating the artists from from the art

935
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,380
you really have to do with cannabis

936
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:03,420
because there's a lot of

937
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,800
people that you could pick apart on a

938
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,539
personal level that have done cool

939
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,820
things in wheat yeah certainly right

940
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,320
um and you know he got ostracized for a

941
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,059
long time

942
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,640
and then he sort of came back and I

943
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:19,920
think he came back because the scene has

944
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,739
expanded enough and enough time has

945
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,260
passed that like he couldn't have ever

946
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:28,019
come back in the Forum era because it

947
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,760
was too small of a group of people and

948
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:32,820
he would have been hella ostracized but

949
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,359
even when he came back on IG he had to

950
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:39,660
turn comments off on his posts

951
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:42,119
because it would just devolve into a

952
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:45,420
open Warfare in the in that comment

953
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,140
section underneath his IG posts

954
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,820
um

955
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:50,578
and uh you know there's there's

956
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:54,119
Defenders of him out there

957
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:57,240
um you know I don't know him personally

958
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,920
um but you know it does seem like the

959
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:02,039
one of the better ways to become a good

960
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,280
breeder is to have excellent starting

961
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,858
stock

962
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,700
so res working with Sour Diesel and

963
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:14,219
chemd and chems in general

964
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:15,358
you know I love those strains so the

965
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,159
likelihood that he's going to make

966
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,659
something decent out of them is pretty

967
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:20,639
high

968
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:24,118
you know I mean I'd even say that about

969
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:25,739
Neville like half of a good half of

970
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,200
Neville's success

971
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:30,539
was he got to be the first person to

972
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,519
cross Haze to Northern Lights

973
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:34,679
he got to be the first guy to cross the

974
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,500
Northern Lights to skunk he got to

975
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,239
collect the best of a lot of these

976
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,139
American breeders who didn't know each

977
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:43,259
other

978
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:45,539
and then blend those things

979
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,599
that's a really big component like I I

980
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:50,219
mean I'll I'll I'm a Neville backer and

981
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,740
you know and so I think he definitely

982
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:54,000
had the eye and he was really good at

983
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:57,179
seeing

984
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,519
quality and knowing what to go for but

985
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:02,699
it's undoubtable that like he got skunk

986
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,199
one he got Haze he got G13 he got

987
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:07,199
Northern Lights he got these different

988
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:09,598
things and he got to blend them first

989
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,759
yeah that matters

990
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,960
because he started with really good

991
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,960
genetics

992
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,579
and so I think res dog has really good

993
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,320
genetics

994
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,760
and that helps

995
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:25,019
and

996
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,940
um you know I I can understand why

997
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:28,320
I mean he it's funny in the sense that I

998
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,320
know people that know him and he's not

999
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,300
even sure what the res dog cut of Sour

1000
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,838
Diesel is or who named it that or where

1001
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,839
it came from

1002
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:39,618
and he's got his name on it

1003
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:44,879
he's not even sure how that occurred

1004
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:47,519
you know

1005
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,760
yeah that's a that's a very interesting

1006
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:54,059
perspective and I think for me the sort

1007
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,500
of the thing that to me gave me I sort

1008
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:57,358
of thought was like the beautiful end

1009
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,599
outcome of it all was that when I spoke

1010
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:04,078
to Gypsy who did do jail time because of

1011
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,000
res he had actually he says that he made

1012
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,740
his peace with it he said I don't I

1013
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,920
don't hold the guy accountable he said

1014
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:13,979
you know like he basically says I blame

1015
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,780
the laws in America the insane penalties

1016
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,699
that were being imposed on people he

1017
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,800
said why why would you throw your life

1018
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:21,838
away it makes sense to me that you would

1019
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,859
do that but regardless I understand your

1020
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,299
point of view but I thought that's

1021
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:27,000
that's beautiful at least he doesn't

1022
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,680
hold him still to this day accountable

1023
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,960
you know

1024
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:32,879
I could I could I could say something

1025
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,159
about that I won't get too specific but

1026
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,440
let's just say that like obviously like

1027
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,759
when you're involved with hippies on

1028
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,679
dead tour

1029
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,560
you know there was a lot of ways that

1030
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:46,559
weren't exactly legal that they

1031
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:49,199
we people did in order to stay traveling

1032
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,338
around the country without a job

1033
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,139
you know

1034
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:53,699
and sometimes people got in trouble and

1035
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:55,500
sometimes people went to prison over the

1036
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:57,539
things that they were doing

1037
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,699
and it was really interesting there was

1038
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:01,800
times that there was people that I

1039
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:03,118
thought were total scumbags

1040
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,380
okay

1041
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,119
bad people

1042
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,680
and they got busted

1043
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,480
and they kept their mouth shut and they

1044
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,419
went away for a long time

1045
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,338
and there was people that I loved and I

1046
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,079
thought were good people and I

1047
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:17,519
personally cared for a bunch and when

1048
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,859
they got in trouble

1049
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,838
they did whatever they had to do to get

1050
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:23,759
out of that trouble

1051
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:27,000
and so I think it's one of those things

1052
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,520
to speak to gypsy's point it's very very

1053
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,838
difficult to say what you would do

1054
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:35,159
if you're facing significant prison time

1055
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,880
right

1056
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:41,940
like without actually facing it

1057
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,338
everyone of course would like to say I

1058
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,280
would never

1059
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:48,960
but then they're like you know you can

1060
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,400
talk to us and you can give us this and

1061
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,260
this and this and we already know so

1062
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,059
much about these different people and

1063
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,500
you're not even all that important we

1064
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:57,119
actually want these other folks and we

1065
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,920
already know so much about them and if

1066
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,079
you can just fill in a few little blanks

1067
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,220
here and there we're going to massively

1068
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,400
reduce

1069
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:07,379
you'll spend a year not 10.

1070
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,519
right and they're scumbags about it in

1071
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,380
the sense that they'll be like if you

1072
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,300
have kids if you have a lady if you have

1073
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,579
this or that or whatever they're going

1074
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,800
to use whatever strings they can pull on

1075
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:19,039
to get what they want from you which is

1076
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,039
information

1077
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:24,779
and not everyone is going to hold up in

1078
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:26,639
that environment

1079
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,800
there's not

1080
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,118
you know and so you can judge people but

1081
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,380
like I said there was people that I was

1082
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,280
like man if that person ever got in

1083
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,220
trouble

1084
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,619
everybody would be doomed

1085
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:39,959
and they kept their mouth shut

1086
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:43,380
so it's really hard to tell

1087
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,539
until you're faced with it yourself

1088
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,160
that's my experience at least you know

1089
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,739
it's very difficult

1090
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:52,379
um and uh you know that doesn't that's

1091
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:54,659
not me making excuses

1092
00:43:52,380 --> 00:44:00,059
because I do feel strongly like I just

1093
00:43:54,659 --> 00:44:02,279
personally I don't you know like if

1094
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:05,039
I don't think other people should suffer

1095
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,380
for actions you're taking

1096
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,880
so it's like if you don't want to go to

1097
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,220
jail or you don't want to go to prison

1098
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,900
for something then don't

1099
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:15,659
do it

1100
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,220
yeah I mean there's there's a thing I'll

1101
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:19,618
tell you honestly like I'm from the mid

1102
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:21,480
I'm from Chicago originally

1103
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:24,420
when I moved out to California there was

1104
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,699
a lot of money to be made if I wanted to

1105
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,838
ship a bunch of California weed back to

1106
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:30,419
Chicago

1107
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,858
and I wouldn't do it because I was like

1108
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
I would rather just grow weed in

1109
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:35,159
California and have it stay in

1110
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,358
California

1111
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:38,159
right

1112
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:40,559
I don't want to be involved in some

1113
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,838
smuggling thing where I get in trouble

1114
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:46,500
and then I have to go back and do a

1115
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:48,599
prison sentence or whatever in Illinois

1116
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,579
and then beyond probation

1117
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,980
if somebody else wants to take that risk

1118
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:54,539
that's fine it's that's not what I'm I

1119
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,699
don't want to do that

1120
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:57,838
right and so sometimes people take risks

1121
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:58,919
because they're trying to make a lot of

1122
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,818
money or they're trying to do this or

1123
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:04,740
that or whatever and it ends up you know

1124
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:06,659
if you're gonna smuggle

1125
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:08,279
which is kind of like when they brought

1126
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:09,299
down Gypsy and all that different types

1127
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,980
of stuff if you're gonna break

1128
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,200
International borders and you're going

1129
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,338
to do all that kind of stuff they're

1130
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,259
probably going to come down on you

1131
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:18,119
pretty hard

1132
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,700
certainly I mean historically at that

1133
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:22,619
time right it um the the penalties would

1134
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:25,439
not LAX at all there were not lacks at

1135
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,400
all so I I don't it's not like I you

1136
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,200
know

1137
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,160
it's like there's a thing where I can

1138
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:34,980
still judge you and forgive you hmm

1139
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:36,480
interesting does that make sense yeah no

1140
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,858
I get it it's always interesting to hear

1141
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,119
the range of opinions because as we said

1142
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:42,000
at the start it's such an interesting

1143
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,680
case analysis but earlier on before we

1144
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,960
started talking about Reds and we were

1145
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:48,000
talking about Cam and skunk you

1146
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,280
mentioned the clear chain of provenance

1147
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,519
in the way the cutting had moved about

1148
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,339
and I wanted to quickly ask you the

1149
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,159
provenance of the TK because obviously

1150
00:45:56,338 --> 00:46:02,219
you know TK Origins Marty has come out

1151
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:03,960
and you know I haven't had a chance to

1152
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:05,699
speak to him yet so I'm not really sure

1153
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,380
what this hitch is but I'd love to hear

1154
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:09,480
do you think that's sort of the story

1155
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,640
you're going on as to where the TK came

1156
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,740
from and you know as a loose follow-up

1157
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:17,519
do you think that the TK is sort of the

1158
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:20,059
quote mother of all ogs

1159
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:24,420
uh no and no

1160
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:26,940
and the the reason why the reason why I

1161
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,099
say that is that see this this is the

1162
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,858
hard part too with like telling history

1163
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:34,380
and stuff like that is that uh you get

1164
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:37,500
people's feathers ruffled

1165
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,599
um but really simple I wasn't there so

1166
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,460
again it makes it hard for me to make

1167
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,500
definitive statements but what I can say

1168
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,139
is that

1169
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,599
TK Origins has told

1170
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,279
three different stories about the

1171
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,500
origins of TK

1172
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,960
and he's written them all out

1173
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,760
you know he told a certain version on

1174
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,980
icmag

1175
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,619
and then he told a certain version to us

1176
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:04,139
on like our server and now he's got a

1177
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:06,180
certain version that he tells on

1178
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:10,139
Instagram

1179
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:12,358
right and they don't match up

1180
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:14,759
like he wrote all the words

1181
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:19,019
so what do you do in a situation where

1182
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:21,240
the person's story from him typed out by

1183
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:23,338
him does not match up

1184
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:25,439
are we talking about like big or small

1185
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:28,980
discrepancies I guess

1186
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,480
pretty big so just in a nutshell I mean

1187
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,400
I could I could after the show I could

1188
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,440
send you because I have them saved I

1189
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,619
could send you the things but on the

1190
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,318
when he first wrote about it on icmag he

1191
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:43,680
he talked about

1192
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:46,739
um he was he was young and he got hired

1193
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:48,419
by the guys that he was working for

1194
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:53,459
um in 1994

1195
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:56,579
to go to Amsterdam and mule back seats

1196
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,440
and they he went they bought five or six

1197
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:00,420
different strains he listed them all out

1198
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,858
you know I can't remember off the top of

1199
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:06,480
my head but it was like Hawaiian indica

1200
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:09,119
and AK-47 and and uh nl5 Haze a few

1201
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,219
different ones on there they they came

1202
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,900
back they had this cut called Emerald

1203
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:14,338
Triangle that the only thing they knew

1204
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,858
about it was it came from the Emerald

1205
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:19,440
Triangle they were growing that they had

1206
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:21,659
this 12 light room that was very

1207
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,539
difficult to move around in once you had

1208
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:27,239
it all set up he was being paid to be

1209
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:29,219
the house sitter Waterboy run run the

1210
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:31,259
grow for these older cats

1211
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:32,338
they put in five or six of these new

1212
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,079
strains

1213
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:37,858
they grew a bunch of the Emerald

1214
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:41,300
Triangle and at the end of that

1215
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:41,299
um they found some seats

1216
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:47,879
that's the first version

1217
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:49,500
so that's 1994 right

1218
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,119
um then he came out when he talked to us

1219
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,780
on the server

1220
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,818
um he told us that he went there in 1991

1221
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,099
and he bought Hindu Kush directly from

1222
00:48:56,818 --> 00:49:01,079
Neville

1223
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:05,818
okay

1224
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:08,700
um and then now on Instagram he talks

1225
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:10,920
about how he went in 1989

1226
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:14,098
and he and the guys that he was with

1227
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,559
bought Hindu Kush directly from Neville

1228
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:18,599
right the problem that I have with that

1229
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,578
is that Neville didn't sell Hindu Kush

1230
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:22,800
in 1989.

1231
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:25,140
you can go look at his catalogs in 89

1232
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,000
and 90. there's no Hindu Kush in there

1233
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:30,900
the other thing he told me is that he

1234
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,179
turned 18 in 1990.

1235
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,240
which means that if his bosses hired him

1236
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:40,139
in 1989 to go mule seeds they were

1237
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:44,598
hiring a 17 year old kid to do so

1238
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:44,598
I somehow doubt that they hired a minor

1239
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,539
right to smuggle seeds for them

1240
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:53,279
so if I'm going to believe any of his so

1241
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:56,099
it's basically like

1242
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,339
his first story was 1994.

1243
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:02,579
his second story was 1991. his current

1244
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:05,039
and most modern story is 1989.

1245
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:07,200
he went from We Bought five or six

1246
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,659
different seeds I don't know what harmed

1247
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:12,960
or what or what through pollen but it

1248
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:15,059
ended up seeding the Emerald Triangle to

1249
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,519
I know specifically it was Hindu Kush

1250
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:21,719
even though Hindu Kush isn't even listed

1251
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:25,679
on the six strains on his first story

1252
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:30,059
right so how do how do you parse that is

1253
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:31,799
it 1994 is it 1991 is it 1989 is it the

1254
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:33,900
first five or six strains that he listed

1255
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,900
when he first wrote the story

1256
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:39,180
is it Hindu Kush how did he get Hindu

1257
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,980
Kush from Neville in 1989 when Neville

1258
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:43,799
didn't sell anything in his catalog in

1259
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,960
89 or 90 that was labeled Hindu Kush

1260
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:49,140
and he'll say I was there you weren't

1261
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,579
there bye

1262
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:53,159
but

1263
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:56,039
he wrote out all those stories and

1264
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:58,858
posted them himself

1265
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:01,318
so if I'm going to believe anything I

1266
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:04,440
would believe the first story he told

1267
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:07,079
which is that he was 22 years old or

1268
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,000
something you know 23 he got hired by

1269
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,339
these guys to run a room they brought

1270
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,039
him out to Amsterdam to mule some seeds

1271
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:16,619
he got they got five or six strains they

1272
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:18,779
grew them all up it was mostly a room of

1273
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:20,818
Emerald Triangle they don't know what

1274
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,859
hit the Emerald Triangle

1275
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:24,599
they ended up lightly seeding the weed

1276
00:51:22,858 --> 00:51:27,299
but it was still valuable and it got

1277
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:30,680
sold and that's where the that's where

1278
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,680
this that's where it got found

1279
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,660
that I think is probably the most

1280
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,358
believable

1281
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:39,058
if it's true now

1282
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:41,460
if you want to extrapolate from that

1283
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:43,559
he estimates that there was 25 or 30

1284
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,940
pounds of lightly seeded weed that they

1285
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:48,180
sold

1286
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,500
I don't think that the TK and the cut

1287
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:51,719
that

1288
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,579
um Matt Bubba and Josh D brought to La

1289
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:56,338
are the exact same one

1290
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:58,859
I have a tendency to believe that there

1291
00:51:56,338 --> 00:52:01,259
was a few phenos that got found in this

1292
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:02,400
lightly seeded weed that ended up in

1293
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,819
Florida

1294
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,980
I think how many I can't say at least

1295
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:09,058
two maybe three or four

1296
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,679
okay

1297
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:14,579
and out of those three or four strains

1298
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:16,440
comes the

1299
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,900
um this is a joke but the 34 different

1300
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,460
phenos of OG Kush that we have today

1301
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,720
right

1302
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,740
you know

1303
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:24,419
um

1304
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:27,299
I think it's one of those things that

1305
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,858
like you know as people get famous they

1306
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,359
need to come up with more detail than

1307
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:32,880
they had

1308
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:34,380
you know um and like some people might

1309
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,519
say I'm calling him a liar or something

1310
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:38,338
like that

1311
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,559
I just don't know how you take three

1312
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:42,239
different stories that he all typed out

1313
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,839
and posted

1314
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:49,799
that are from three different years

1315
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:51,599
and have fairly different details

1316
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,420
and it's like okay so if he's telling

1317
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:57,300
the truth which version do you believe

1318
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:59,099
was he lying on the first story is he

1319
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,680
lying on the second story is he lying on

1320
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:04,380
the current story is it a mishmash

1321
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,699
how do you know

1322
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,559
it'd be one thing if it was all

1323
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:10,799
consistent

1324
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,780
what if what if he had turned just to

1325
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,480
play deva's Advocate before we move on

1326
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:20,819
what if he made a mistake and he didn't

1327
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:23,280
turn 18 in 91 but he turned 18 in 89.

1328
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:25,019
that that could theoretically reconcile

1329
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,440
the difference between story two and

1330
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:31,318
three but not one and then the others I

1331
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,900
guess not not the first story that he

1332
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:36,480
posted that as the real tri-tip or

1333
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,220
whatever on icmag where he says 1994 and

1334
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,619
not the list of strains that he gave

1335
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:42,659
that doesn't include Hindu Kush sure

1336
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:43,920
another problem is that he says he got

1337
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:46,500
it from Neville

1338
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,300
and I mean I can you can I'm sure you

1339
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,880
have them but if you don't like there is

1340
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:53,220
nothing in Neville's catalog in 1989 or

1341
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,260
1990 that says Hindu Kush

1342
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:57,058
I guess you know that's that's really

1343
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,319
interesting to hear that perspective and

1344
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:00,000
that's good because I'd heard there were

1345
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,739
discrepancies but I never knew what they

1346
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,880
were specifically but my follow-up

1347
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:08,098
question is do you think that it was in

1348
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,800
fact Hindu Kush to whatever this Emerald

1349
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:12,539
Mountain strain is or do you think the

1350
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,280
lineage might be something because I

1351
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:17,039
think somewhere someone said oh Emerald

1352
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,280
Triangle that was a sort of hinduy cushy

1353
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,480
type plant I mean he said he said that

1354
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:25,260
they called it

1355
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:27,838
Kush because of the

1356
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:29,760
you know they you know the Emerald

1357
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,980
Triangle so it might not have been a

1358
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,900
Kush at all you know Emerald Triangle

1359
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,760
could you know but I don't know I wasn't

1360
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,519
there that I can't

1361
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,220
all I know is that he wrote multiple

1362
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:44,818
stories that don't seem to add up we

1363
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:45,959
know that from we know that the TK came

1364
00:54:44,818 --> 00:54:49,139
from Florida

1365
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,480
we know that the cut that Josh D and

1366
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:54,239
Matt Bubba brought out from Florida to

1367
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:57,539
LA in 1996 or whatever came from Florida

1368
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,799
we have pictures of that weed yeah uh

1369
00:54:57,539 --> 00:55:02,880
and

1370
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,859
it obviously likes Sour Diesel Kush

1371
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,260
became extremely valuable and extremely

1372
00:55:04,858 --> 00:55:10,139
sought after and it went from one or two

1373
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,240
or three cuts to several dozen

1374
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:16,078
yeah sure

1375
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:20,039
and people had an intention to you know

1376
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:22,500
muddy the waters a little bit right

1377
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:23,639
um and you know a lot of times like I'm

1378
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,440
not throwing it out there or whatever

1379
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:27,719
but I mean I think that for a while

1380
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,599
people thought in California Swamp Boy

1381
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:32,519
seeds you know uh Ricky and chrome and

1382
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:35,220
those guys were the guys that like they

1383
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:36,480
were the TK guys hmm like they were the

1384
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:37,980
people that sprouted it they were

1385
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,960
responsible for it

1386
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,659
yeah I've had that and then it kind of

1387
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,519
came out that they just got it early

1388
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:46,259
certainly look it sounds like it's one

1389
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:48,059
of those ones where we'll have to wait

1390
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,099
and see and as you've said a few times

1391
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:52,260
to a few questions you know I'm sure at

1392
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:54,240
one point genetic testing will help

1393
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,480
yield some answers but you're you're

1394
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,219
also asking a bunch of questions about

1395
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,400
uh a bunch of weed strains that

1396
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:06,058
originate in the early to mid 90s

1397
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,099
at a time when prohibition was high and

1398
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:09,119
information and the internet didn't

1399
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,920
exist

1400
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,079
and a lot of this information is

1401
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:16,980
percolated out very slowly

1402
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:19,500
yeah long after the the initial

1403
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,760
events occurred

1404
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,358
yeah

1405
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,859
I mean that that [ __ ] uh that dude

1406
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:27,539
from Hawaii I don't even like saying his

1407
00:56:25,858 --> 00:56:30,058
name but that dude from Hawaii will tell

1408
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:32,940
you that it all originates from crippy

1409
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:34,140
that that you know that the the surfer

1410
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,179
is brought it out and it's actually

1411
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:39,539
Hawaiian originated from Neville but

1412
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:41,759
Hawaiian and then it went to Florida

1413
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:43,259
and then the guy Alec I mean it's one of

1414
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,059
those things where you start pulling on

1415
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:47,460
it and it's like there's unknowns and

1416
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:50,579
how do you resolve those unknowns

1417
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:53,460
true well look let's you know we've been

1418
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:56,640
gone for basically three hours now let's

1419
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,559
do some more fleshed out light and fun

1420
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:01,318
ones before we wrap up and I've I've

1421
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,460
written some special ones that sure I

1422
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:03,960
think I think we'll still be able to

1423
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,119
have a good little chat about them but

1424
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,818
there's some interesting ones and so the

1425
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:12,300
first one I want to throw by you is did

1426
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:14,519
you ever get to try the Francine strain

1427
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,318
from Staten Island that skunk VA spoke

1428
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:17,219
about or was that gone by the time you

1429
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:19,019
met him

1430
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:22,078
it was gone

1431
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:25,079
I didn't try it but that that is the

1432
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,059
reason why Statin got

1433
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,800
um got the skunk at least

1434
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:30,599
um

1435
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:32,460
and uh Statin got rid of it because it

1436
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:33,780
had horrific mold

1437
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:37,800
okay

1438
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:40,559
it had really really bad mold problems

1439
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,640
um and you know obviously like I don't

1440
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,400
know if you've ever had this happen to

1441
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:45,960
you but if you've ever had a crop you

1442
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,579
harvest the crop and you realize that

1443
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,500
it's riddled with mold it's very

1444
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:53,579
depressing

1445
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:55,858
um and so he dropped it in favor of uh

1446
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:58,859
other strains he did have

1447
00:57:55,858 --> 00:58:00,179
a very nice glass piece by

1448
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:00,960
um

1449
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:05,578
um

1450
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:08,818
by Bob that he uh uh only had smoked the

1451
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:10,920
Francine out of huh and he never ever

1452
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,119
smoked any weed again out of it so it

1453
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,639
was just kind of like this like museum

1454
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:16,680
piece or whatever but unfortunately it

1455
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:20,039
you know there was a huge fire in the 17

1456
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:22,558
fires his house burned down and uh he

1457
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,119
lost all that glass then

1458
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,420
but

1459
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:28,680
um yeah I was you know I don't I don't

1460
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,780
really I don't really like to tell this

1461
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:33,598
part of it so I won't but I will just

1462
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,059
say that skunk VA and Staten Island were

1463
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,240
best friends

1464
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:40,798
um they had a falling out and then I

1465
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:43,078
ended up sort of being for that next

1466
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,000
that Next Period sort of like statins

1467
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,940
best friend

1468
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,460
um so uh skunk VA and him were friends

1469
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,780
before I knew him

1470
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,059
um and that's when he grew the Francine

1471
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:56,819
by the time that I met him he had

1472
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:58,740
replaced it with the skunk and the chem

1473
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:00,739
and it wasn't he wasn't growing it

1474
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:03,838
anymore so I never saw it or smoked it

1475
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:07,078
yeah no it's interesting okay and then

1476
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:10,558
similarly would you have any interest in

1477
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:12,180
growing out either say the purest Indica

1478
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,099
because I know that that you know that

1479
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:16,558
seems pretty interesting or on the other

1480
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:18,539
hand once Tom's finished any of Tom's

1481
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,619
Hayes either of those strike you as

1482
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:26,818
interesting uh Toms Hayes certainly

1483
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:27,539
yeah I Haze is uh I I love Haze very

1484
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:30,239
much

1485
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:32,460
it's uh it's very difficult to find a

1486
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,779
good one uh part of the part of the

1487
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:37,199
problem with Haze is that it takes

1488
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,940
forever and that only about

1489
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,798
um five or ten percent of them are

1490
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,539
really super nice

1491
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,179
so you have to go through a lot of mids

1492
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:48,179
and a lot of garbage to find the

1493
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:50,159
exceptional ones but

1494
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:52,980
I would definitely lean much more

1495
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:55,318
towards that because I do think the

1496
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:57,298
provenance of him getting it I believe

1497
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:59,699
him that he went there in 1994 from

1498
00:59:57,298 --> 01:00:02,219
positronics and got it I believe that

1499
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:04,500
he's like reprode open pollinated at a

1500
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:06,419
few different times

1501
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,818
um I went to I went to his I went to his

1502
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:11,338
house not that long ago and uh saw the

1503
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:12,420
little project he had going on so I

1504
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:15,900
would be I would be definitely

1505
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:17,519
interested in in that the purest Indica

1506
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,960
I don't know how I feel about that one

1507
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:22,559
really

1508
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,119
um for a variety of reasons but uh I I

1509
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,760
think

1510
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,619
um in general I think that we have if

1511
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,799
you want to talk about chems and cushes

1512
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:35,039
and the I think we have a lot of really

1513
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:36,000
really exceptional afghanis to choose

1514
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,759
from

1515
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,099
and I think we have less sativas to

1516
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,500
choose from than afghanis

1517
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:45,298
so if I had to choose which one at this

1518
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:48,179
point in my life I'm more interested in

1519
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:50,219
it would be sativas

1520
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:52,019
simply because we already have such a

1521
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:54,480
big blessing of indicas

1522
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:57,659
that are available and out there

1523
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,760
yeah true that's a really nice answer I

1524
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:02,460
like that so we've been talking about

1525
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:05,339
you know nl5 Hayes and Neville I now

1526
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:08,400
want to ask you if you could ask Neville

1527
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:10,798
any two questions what two questions

1528
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,818
would you want to ask Neville

1529
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:13,818
oh man

1530
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:20,099
huh all right it is a good one

1531
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:22,558
um

1532
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:25,740
I've been blessed in that I get to talk

1533
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,660
to some of Neville's old friends still

1534
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:30,719
that helped him with a lot of projects

1535
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:34,618
so in recent years I've been able to get

1536
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:37,199
a lot more in depth with a lot of the

1537
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:40,798
questions that I had as best as could be

1538
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:43,980
answered I met Neville several times in

1539
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:46,920
in Holland but I was young and and

1540
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,659
Starstruck and I I would love to say

1541
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,519
that I had some like deep penetrating

1542
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:53,460
conversation with him

1543
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:55,858
but I did not you know I did not have

1544
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,599
any kind of deep or or involved combo

1545
01:01:55,858 --> 01:01:59,578
with them and the few times that I was

1546
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,798
in the same room with him

1547
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:04,680
um he's significantly older than me you

1548
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:06,000
know and I was a dumb kid

1549
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:09,659
um but

1550
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,298
I uh if I had to ask him

1551
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:15,118
I would probably ask him and I kind of

1552
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:17,219
know this already but I would kind of

1553
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,880
ask him

1554
01:02:17,219 --> 01:02:21,118
um

1555
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,519
one of the things that he lost did he

1556
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,260
still think were most current like

1557
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,380
were the things that he regretted the

1558
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,380
most

1559
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,920
and

1560
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:34,619
you know and why

1561
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,559
you know because you know for instance

1562
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:40,500
if you read a bunch of his posts out of

1563
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:43,019
all the seeds he got from Sam Skunk Man

1564
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:45,298
um he only got about seven or eight of

1565
01:02:43,019 --> 01:02:48,838
those hazes to pop

1566
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:51,480
and by 1991 he only had one left because

1567
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:53,400
they were long flowering and a huge pain

1568
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,440
in the ass and he didn't realize there

1569
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:58,920
was anything special about them

1570
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:02,940
until he'd made a few mistakes

1571
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,858
so he never actually got like almost I

1572
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:08,880
think all of the commercially available

1573
01:03:04,858 --> 01:03:10,139
seed stock was all from Haze C

1574
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,818
you know but

1575
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:13,858
um there was one year that he released

1576
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:17,039
Haze B but he never really got a chance

1577
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:19,500
once he knew what he had to play around

1578
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:23,460
with them so I guess my second question

1579
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:25,139
would be if you had all seven hazes that

1580
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,179
you popped

1581
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:28,980
what directions which ones would you

1582
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:30,779
cross and why and where would you want

1583
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:33,240
to go with them

1584
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,740
brilliant I love that pondering thoughts

1585
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:36,179
for a soul I definitely would be

1586
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:38,818
interested to hear what his answers are

1587
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:42,058
and now I want to remix it same question

1588
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:45,659
you get to ask two questions to Sam the

1589
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:48,839
skunk man what are you gonna ask Sam

1590
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:50,399
would he would would he be would he have

1591
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:53,880
to be honest with me

1592
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:57,180
he he has to be honest with you uh what

1593
01:03:53,880 --> 01:04:01,380
Afghan did he use in Skunk one

1594
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:04,558
and when he was making skunk one is the

1595
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:06,500
Mexican Colombian part of it Pollyanna

1596
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:09,059
from Rob Clark

1597
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:11,159
aha that's beautiful thoughts there

1598
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:12,480
that's what I would ask him if he had to

1599
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:15,480
be honest

1600
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,599
do you believe that the Colombian that

1601
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,159
was used in Skunk is the same one that

1602
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:22,318
was used in Hayes as the internet

1603
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:25,139
stories say

1604
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:27,058
you know I don't know

1605
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:30,058
um part of the problem with the haze

1606
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:33,359
story is that until it gets to Europe

1607
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:35,460
there's only really one guy telling it

1608
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:37,318
you know supposedly there's a Hayes

1609
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:39,119
brother or two that's alive but they've

1610
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:40,318
never decided to come out there and talk

1611
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,720
publicly

1612
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:45,119
so you only have Sam and I can tell you

1613
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:47,219
from The Forum days he has been

1614
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,798
defending everything he says is the

1615
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:51,719
absolute truth for 25 plus years

1616
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:54,659
vigorously

1617
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:57,318
uh on cannabis world he used to go by

1618
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:59,219
the handle know it all for sure

1619
01:04:57,318 --> 01:05:02,699
and he would

1620
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:05,699
fight people like intensely on all this

1621
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:07,798
different stuff and you know

1622
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:09,539
um there's a big debate whether like you

1623
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:11,759
know there's no doubt his impact on

1624
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:13,858
things but like the other part of it is

1625
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,240
that the one other guy that was around a

1626
01:05:13,858 --> 01:05:17,578
bunch

1627
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,739
was Rob Clark

1628
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:22,740
and their best friends

1629
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:25,919
and he won't refute anything that Rob

1630
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:28,798
says or that that Sam says

1631
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,019
so it's really hard to get

1632
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,000
um you know like if you do if you do a

1633
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:36,179
study and you get a result you hope

1634
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,519
somebody else can get the same result

1635
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:40,078
yeah it would be it would be and that's

1636
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:42,239
kind of like the scientific method or

1637
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,798
whatever is like can different people do

1638
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:44,818
the same experiment and get similar

1639
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:46,980
results

1640
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:48,539
I would love if there was five or six

1641
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,579
different people

1642
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:52,739
that were all talking about the skunk

1643
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:54,660
and the haze and that era

1644
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:56,639
and we're willing to put what they

1645
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:59,039
remember down on paper because what we

1646
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:01,798
basically have is Sam's version

1647
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,400
and so how do you battle that

1648
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:08,159
uh I know that that Rob was working with

1649
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,660
a bunch of Mexicans and Colombians me

1650
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:13,920
and a few friends have a sneaking

1651
01:06:09,659 --> 01:06:15,139
suspicion that the that the um

1652
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,079
the the

1653
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:21,058
uh sativa side of skunk one is from

1654
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:22,980
Rob's work

1655
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:25,619
yeah

1656
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,539
but it's hard to say I mean I'll tell

1657
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:30,000
you do you remember how you know Matt

1658
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:33,180
and I did those interviews with mag oh

1659
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,338
don't go there was this my next question

1660
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:37,618
no go for it yeah of course they're

1661
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:41,279
incredible well I will say that like

1662
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:43,019
when he got all those skunks in 1978 it

1663
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,660
was Rob who delivered them all to him

1664
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:47,219
too true and that was you you're such a

1665
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:48,960
mind reader because I was about to say

1666
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:51,358
you know having done those incredible

1667
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,818
episodes with mad Jag how has your

1668
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:55,920
perspective changed on Rob Clark

1669
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:57,179
I have always had a high opinion of Rob

1670
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,579
Clark

1671
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:01,679
one of the first three books I bought to

1672
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:04,798
teach myself how to how to anything

1673
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:06,480
about weed was marijuana botany

1674
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:08,519
um it's a little bit simple these days

1675
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,659
but for some for

1676
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:13,980
in an era where there was almost no

1677
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:16,798
verifiable information about how the

1678
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:19,920
cannabis plant worked to have Rob come

1679
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:21,960
out with a very simple primer laying out

1680
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,639
how to breed and how it worked and what

1681
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:27,659
it did

1682
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:31,078
um he was invaluable to me in teaching

1683
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:34,139
a lot of Basics about cannabis

1684
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:36,180
you know uh and it seems like you know

1685
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:38,759
he did a lot of work it's he's kind of

1686
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:40,739
quiet about it I think if I had to guess

1687
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:44,039
I would say he lets

1688
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:47,519
Sam shine with some of his work

1689
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:49,440
and doesn't care about it that much in

1690
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:52,318
terms of like who gets the credit

1691
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,179
but that would be for him to say

1692
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,460
um I do think it's interesting like

1693
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:58,440
speaking of magic or whatever that Sam

1694
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:00,179
always insists that his seed company was

1695
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,679
him and only him and nobody else was

1696
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:03,960
involved but him

1697
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:06,719
but then when mad Jag bought like a

1698
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:09,720
ridiculous amount of seeds in 1978 it

1699
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:11,818
was Rob who flew them out and gave them

1700
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:14,219
all to him you know

1701
01:08:11,818 --> 01:08:15,960
do you not think that it's interesting

1702
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:18,738
because what I took away from that

1703
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,539
moment when I heard that was these guys

1704
01:08:18,738 --> 01:08:24,238
must have felt like they were still

1705
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:26,039
small fry for Rob to have delivered that

1706
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,079
order in person for what was what was

1707
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:30,359
like three or five grand or something it

1708
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:32,100
was five grand in 1978 it was the

1709
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,719
biggest purchase of seeds that they had

1710
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:37,920
ever done at that point

1711
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:39,539
right and but it's still still small fry

1712
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,000
in the scheme of things right so I

1713
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:43,859
thought to myself they must have been

1714
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,319
really giddy like wow there's a big sale

1715
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:50,039
for us considering they'd hand delivered

1716
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:52,920
it yeah and and Magic still has the

1717
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:53,519
original packaging they came in

1718
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,039
um

1719
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,440
he does so that's pretty crazy and he's

1720
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:00,060
got you know real experience and like

1721
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:02,460
what they were like back then and all

1722
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:05,940
that and you know he said Rob had just

1723
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:07,560
incredible collection of killer weed

1724
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:10,079
um when he when he when he got hand

1725
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:13,620
delivered the seeds or whatever

1726
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:16,920
um you know I I think

1727
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:20,039
this is indisputable although Sam won't

1728
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,060
like it but I think when Sam went to

1729
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:24,000
Holland

1730
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,739
he gathered up a bunch of seeds from

1731
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,140
people he knew

1732
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:32,459
and brought them out there

1733
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:35,460
Hayes skunk he got the Durbin poison and

1734
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:37,020
The Afghani one from Mel Frank

1735
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:39,239
you know

1736
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:41,219
um so it wasn't all just his work I

1737
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:43,259
think some of it was Rob's work some of

1738
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:45,779
it was Mel Frank's work some of it was

1739
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:48,000
his work some of it was the haze

1740
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:50,339
people's work because even he admits

1741
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,380
that it's like you know

1742
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:53,759
um he didn't do the haze it was like he

1743
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,039
got seeds of it

1744
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,600
you know

1745
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:59,399
and uh you know but there's

1746
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,039
inconsistencies in his story too he'll

1747
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:04,079
swear that he was never busted and then

1748
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:05,579
I've watched videos of Mel Franks saying

1749
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:07,319
oh well he went to Holland after his

1750
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:08,640
second bust

1751
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:10,738
foreign

1752
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,320
you know so some of these things are

1753
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:15,659
like Old-Timers covering for each other

1754
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:17,759
you know but you got to realize the era

1755
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:21,359
that they were into

1756
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,579
uh and most of it I will say for anybody

1757
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,339
that is listening to me

1758
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:29,279
um my experience with seed breeding is

1759
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:31,380
whoever gets famous there's a small

1760
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:34,198
group of friends or Associates around

1761
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:37,380
them that helped at various stages

1762
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:40,619
that don't get the credit

1763
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:43,079
so I do not believe that Sam was like

1764
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:45,479
alone with no helpers with no partners

1765
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:48,000
with nobodies contributing that he was

1766
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:49,979
doing it all himself that every strain

1767
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,319
he used was original to him and no one

1768
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:54,839
else ever had it

1769
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:57,599
can I prove it wrong no but

1770
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,699
you know I uh

1771
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,520
um I also think that from what Neville

1772
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:03,960
said and from what Corel from sssc and

1773
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,800
some of these other guys said is that

1774
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:10,020
the skunk that he brought over at first

1775
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,880
was much different than after he had

1776
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:14,880
done some open pollinations in his own

1777
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,219
line breeding in Amsterdam

1778
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,140
and you know he bred it in a way that

1779
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:23,399
they didn't prefer

1780
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:26,820
so but Rob Rob is one of the more

1781
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:30,420
important people in cannabis in his era

1782
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:32,219
he wrote a he wrote some lasting books

1783
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,840
um he he got some information out there

1784
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:36,119
I definitely think he did a lot of

1785
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,179
underground breeding and I think he's

1786
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:40,920
responsible for more than he wants to

1787
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:43,020
admit

1788
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:47,100
so would I wish that he would just come

1789
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:48,960
out and say it all sure but despite that

1790
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,480
he still did it and we still benefit

1791
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,840
from it so

1792
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:58,198
huge kudos to rob the the next question

1793
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:00,779
I have for you is that photo of Neville

1794
01:11:58,198 --> 01:12:03,119
in the hash Den in Afghanistan I think

1795
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:05,639
it's got to be the most iconic cannabis

1796
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,960
photo of all time do you agree or

1797
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,600
disagree

1798
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,340
it's pretty iconic

1799
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,020
um you know I think Neville gets a lot

1800
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,579
of credit in the sense because he was

1801
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,100
first

1802
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:19,439
he certainly suffered more than most

1803
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:22,380
seed breeders being first

1804
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:23,939
and struggled a lot more

1805
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:26,100
um you know he got bitter in the end

1806
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,238
because people you know stole so much

1807
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,520
stuff from him

1808
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:31,919
but it's actually kind of interesting in

1809
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,360
that regard of I don't know if he's told

1810
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,960
this story so it's not like it's secret

1811
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:38,639
and he and he wrote it on Mr nice but

1812
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,279
do you know what he had to do to prove

1813
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,840
he wasn't a DEA agent didn't you have to

1814
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:43,619
like shoot heroin in front of him or

1815
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,239
something

1816
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:47,158
yeah

1817
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:49,819
because they figured no de agent would

1818
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:53,399
do that and it just turns out that he

1819
01:12:49,819 --> 01:12:55,679
was a heroin addict

1820
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:58,619
so he could do that without dying but

1821
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:01,319
his photographer Clyde OD'd over there

1822
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:02,939
and almost died

1823
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:04,500
Jesus

1824
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:07,379
um so it was very sketchy I mean he went

1825
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:10,079
over there and dealt with the muhajidin

1826
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,000
you know when the Soviets were you know

1827
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:15,238
were right in the middle of their big

1828
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,779
Afghanistan war there was a lot of stuff

1829
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:20,339
going on over there you know and um it

1830
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:22,380
is pretty interesting to think that if

1831
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,940
you like weren't a heroin addict

1832
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,679
you probably would have either had to

1833
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:27,059
refuse and maybe been killed by The

1834
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,100
muhaj Deen

1835
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,780
or you would have done it and OD'd and

1836
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:33,539
died because you didn't have a tolerance

1837
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:36,840
because you weren't a heroin addict

1838
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:39,019
huh right place right time

1839
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,699
it's funny how life works sometimes

1840
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:43,320
interesting stuff I'm sure everyone's

1841
01:13:41,698 --> 01:13:45,719
Keen to hear more about that and maybe

1842
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:47,219
at some point we'll hear more I have

1843
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:48,658
this opinion I've held it for a while I

1844
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:51,600
think I might have even said it once or

1845
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:54,539
twice I think sub cool space queen mail

1846
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:58,079
the mail he calls space dude I think

1847
01:13:54,539 --> 01:14:01,198
that is maybe the best male we have

1848
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:04,079
access to like it's still around it's

1849
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:06,299
it's empirical evidence it produces nice

1850
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,399
crosses I think it may be the best smell

1851
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:11,400
that we have what comes to mind when I

1852
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:12,839
say that and agree slash disagree

1853
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:15,000
uh

1854
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:18,840
uh I will say that uh

1855
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,899
with the reversals revolution

1856
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:24,900
males are few and far between

1857
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:27,719
also say that males

1858
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:30,238
um typically get traded much much less

1859
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:33,359
than females so

1860
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,678
there really isn't like a collection of

1861
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:38,339
Elites

1862
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:40,140
in terms of males that get passed around

1863
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:42,779
right

1864
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:45,060
um so males are sort of like the the

1865
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:46,619
secret sauce if you were

1866
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:50,179
and

1867
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:50,179
um you know I uh

1868
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:56,340
I would say and I I've been trying to

1869
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:58,800
figure out if it exists for forever to

1870
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:00,840
me the most impactful male in cannabis

1871
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:03,360
is probably the haze female

1872
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:06,600
yeah and I hear rumors that it's alive

1873
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,679
and I hear rumors that it's not

1874
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:10,380
you know

1875
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,699
but as far as like an impactful it

1876
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,980
doesn't mean we can get our hands on it

1877
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:15,719
but as far as an impactful male that's

1878
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:19,379
like made a bunch of hybrids that have

1879
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:23,158
gone on to be like crazy

1880
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:24,179
um you know uh just influential in the

1881
01:15:23,158 --> 01:15:27,539
scene

1882
01:15:24,179 --> 01:15:29,880
that is probably the Primo mail that's

1883
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:31,019
existed

1884
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,900
um but

1885
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:36,300
I don't have any experience with his

1886
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:38,399
space I mean that male really so I can't

1887
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,860
really comment on how good it is or not

1888
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:44,399
but I will say

1889
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:46,619
that before all this reversal stuff

1890
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:47,299
existed

1891
01:15:46,619 --> 01:15:50,340
um

1892
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:53,219
Matt likes to call it the shotgun method

1893
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:55,619
but really there's there's no way to

1894
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:56,939
test to see if a male actually does what

1895
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:58,679
you want unless you grow out it's

1896
01:15:56,939 --> 01:16:00,658
progeny

1897
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:02,699
which is very time consuming obviously

1898
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:04,859
because you have to like make seeds and

1899
01:16:02,698 --> 01:16:08,460
then grow them out and then see

1900
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:10,198
and so when people find males back in

1901
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:12,300
the day it used to be that all those

1902
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:14,639
seed companies the males were the

1903
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:16,619
backbone and the most important part of

1904
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,739
their breeding process

1905
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:22,079
they were hoarded incredibly

1906
01:16:19,738 --> 01:16:24,718
because once you found a male that

1907
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:27,119
passed along desirable traits that you

1908
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:29,158
were looking for it took so much time

1909
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,198
and effort to figure that out

1910
01:16:29,158 --> 01:16:33,479
that you typically held onto it never

1911
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:36,799
passed it around which means no one else

1912
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:36,799
ever got to experience it

1913
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:41,939
I don't know if I answered your question

1914
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:43,319
or not but that's about as close as I

1915
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:45,419
can come

1916
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:47,340
no that's good and it's it's a very

1917
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:50,158
interesting point that you know with the

1918
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:52,079
Advent of how popular reversals are does

1919
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:53,698
it even is it even really that relevant

1920
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:57,000
anymore which is I can certainly

1921
01:16:53,698 --> 01:17:00,059
understand that so on to the second last

1922
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,060
question for our part two will people

1923
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:05,219
ever be able to buy your seeds

1924
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:06,179
probably

1925
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:09,899
um

1926
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:10,920
I have uh it's kind of a running joke in

1927
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:14,460
the crew

1928
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,658
right where I haven't commercially said

1929
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,420
yes yet

1930
01:17:15,658 --> 01:17:20,339
because you know I watch what all my

1931
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:22,619
friends go through when they sell seeds

1932
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:25,380
and it just looks so attractive getting

1933
01:17:22,619 --> 01:17:29,760
people calling you a hack or a chucker

1934
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:32,579
you know or a Herm breeder or a fake or

1935
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,320
this or that and sort of like

1936
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:36,899
um you know it's really hard to accuse

1937
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:39,179
you of being a a money-grubbing scumbag

1938
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:41,119
when you're not making any money off it

1939
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:44,219
you know

1940
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:45,539
so and then the other part of it too is

1941
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:49,260
that all the breeding that I've ever

1942
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:51,899
done has been for me and to try to breed

1943
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:54,300
weed that I liked and to create weed for

1944
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:56,219
my friends that we liked I never

1945
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:58,380
actually and by doing that it's

1946
01:17:56,219 --> 01:18:01,020
incredibly freeing

1947
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:03,539
because you literally don't have to care

1948
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:06,300
what the public thinks

1949
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:09,119
so once you're in a commercial seed

1950
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:10,860
situation you kind of have to try to

1951
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:12,420
make things that you think people will

1952
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:14,460
like

1953
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:16,380
yeah if you want to make money off it if

1954
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:19,260
you're fine with just making what you

1955
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:22,159
like and if it bombs it bombs

1956
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:25,020
you know but in the way seeds are now

1957
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,759
anytime if I made if I made seeds and I

1958
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,140
passed them out there would be a bunch

1959
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,280
of people that would there would be not

1960
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,719
a bunch but there would be some people

1961
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:32,219
that would be like oh he's been building

1962
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:34,560
this

1963
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:36,779
um you know this group for a while just

1964
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,780
to like have a market to sell his seeds

1965
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:41,099
oh we knew this was coming you know or

1966
01:18:39,779 --> 01:18:42,719
then people grow them out and they're

1967
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,280
not what they want or they Herm are they

1968
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,079
this or that and it just goes to show

1969
01:18:44,279 --> 01:18:46,859
that I'm like I'm a shitty breeder or

1970
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:50,760
whatever

1971
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:54,119
uh so with all that being said I do

1972
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,679
think I'm going to release some seed

1973
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:57,960
um probably before the end of this year

1974
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,460
and it is going to be stuff that

1975
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,039
interests me

1976
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:04,158
and hopefully people like it and if they

1977
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:06,960
don't they don't

1978
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:08,698
I like that I like that we'll wait and

1979
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,340
see what comes I'm sure it'll be very

1980
01:19:08,698 --> 01:19:13,919
exciting it could also fail too I mean

1981
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:15,600
it's actually like in it's actually in

1982
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,460
progress right now but we'll see it's

1983
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,280
gonna I'm gonna try to do

1984
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:24,239
so I'm gonna try to do some reversals

1985
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:25,859
you know and if it works out uh you'll

1986
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,559
know about it

1987
01:19:25,859 --> 01:19:30,479
and I don't want to reveal too much I'll

1988
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,420
I'll leave the finer details for you to

1989
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:35,639
really reveal in due time but I would

1990
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:37,440
love to know what what are you reversing

1991
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:40,079
at least

1992
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:42,238
uh well

1993
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,859
I'll say this

1994
01:19:42,238 --> 01:19:47,039
um

1995
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:49,679
there are there are a number of projects

1996
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:53,039
that I have going and I kind of balance

1997
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:56,579
them between my own interests

1998
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:58,619
and then things that I don't think are

1999
01:19:56,579 --> 01:19:59,698
generally speaking out there in the

2000
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:02,460
public

2001
01:19:59,698 --> 01:20:04,738
right because even though I've held chem

2002
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:07,739
91 forever

2003
01:20:04,738 --> 01:20:09,359
there's a lot of people doing reasonably

2004
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:11,698
you know doing some pretty good breeding

2005
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:15,238
work with it there's no like shortage

2006
01:20:11,698 --> 01:20:17,279
you know of of chem 91 beans out there

2007
01:20:15,238 --> 01:20:19,079
right so if you're going to make an

2008
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,479
impact or something like that in this in

2009
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:23,939
the seed world you might as well bring

2010
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:26,218
out things that are not very circulated

2011
01:20:23,939 --> 01:20:29,158
so at least you're adding some new

2012
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:32,579
wrinkle or some new genetics to the

2013
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:33,839
larger pool that's out there so that in

2014
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:34,679
a sense

2015
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,100
um

2016
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:39,779
you know uh is a big driver because if

2017
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,340
you're gonna do it you might as well try

2018
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:42,960
to like break some new ground or

2019
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,659
whatever

2020
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,119
um so there's some things that could be

2021
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:50,158
in the works in terms of like that uh

2022
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:51,899
that headband cut that I call the LA

2023
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:54,839
because I don't think it's very well

2024
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:56,759
circulated and it's one of my favorites

2025
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,020
um that that definitely is going to be

2026
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:01,020
something

2027
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:03,120
um my Maui cut that I have

2028
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:05,280
um also not particularly well circulated

2029
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:09,479
so and I have some really cool ideas

2030
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:12,238
with it uh possibly the Flowrider OG cut

2031
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:14,698
that I have which is also not very well

2032
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,139
circulated but it's in cookies

2033
01:21:14,698 --> 01:21:19,079
um and so it's a combination of

2034
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:20,880
something that's rare that people could

2035
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:22,859
you know maybe take in a different

2036
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,500
direction but then also something that

2037
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:27,839
to be fair commercially something that I

2038
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,579
think people would be

2039
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,500
um interested in

2040
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:33,059
you know I had friends talk me out of

2041
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,619
you know it's not like I'm gonna do like

2042
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,920
some Bodhi thing right off the bat and

2043
01:21:34,619 --> 01:21:40,738
like release like extreme sativas that

2044
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,658
are a huge pain in the ass and uh you

2045
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:44,339
know would take forever and would you

2046
01:21:42,658 --> 01:21:45,839
know you're trying to you're trying to

2047
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,159
like balance what would people be

2048
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,500
interested in what would be something

2049
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:51,899
new what would be a different wrinkle

2050
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:53,399
you know and to me it's it's

2051
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:57,479
um it would be a cool way to get

2052
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:58,500
genetics out there that uh aren't that

2053
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:00,539
spread

2054
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,880
with the LA it's a little bit cheating

2055
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:03,960
in the sense that I gave it to CSI and

2056
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,560
he released

2057
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,658
La by TK and la by chemd which got like

2058
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,300
very warmly received and a lot of people

2059
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:14,639
found winners in that and so it sparked

2060
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,860
some interest so it leads me to believe

2061
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,840
that perhaps

2062
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:20,939
um that could be both fun for me and

2063
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,260
commercially viable

2064
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:25,738
you know

2065
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:26,940
so uh and then I'll say this and this

2066
01:22:25,738 --> 01:22:28,259
might get me into some trouble or

2067
01:22:26,939 --> 01:22:31,198
whatever but

2068
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:35,360
uh it turns out that there's a lot more

2069
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:35,359
chemds out there than people think

2070
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:42,900
and um that opens up some room maybe for

2071
01:22:40,859 --> 01:22:44,339
I might do some chemd work not only

2072
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:45,359
because I love it and I think it's super

2073
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:48,239
potent

2074
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:50,579
but also because I think there's four or

2075
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:53,279
five cuts out there

2076
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:56,460
um at least that go by the moniker of

2077
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:58,198
chemd and even some ones that people are

2078
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:02,520
absolutely sure is is

2079
01:22:58,198 --> 01:23:04,559
the one might not be the one that I have

2080
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,900
doesn't mean mine's special or whatever

2081
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,360
I'm just saying that like it kind of

2082
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:11,639
fits into that like get something a

2083
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,859
little different out there

2084
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,780
um and then you know those things if

2085
01:23:13,859 --> 01:23:17,519
those things actually work they would

2086
01:23:15,779 --> 01:23:20,238
probably get crossed to a bunch of

2087
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:23,580
things that are I hold in my collection

2088
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:26,158
that I think would be interesting

2089
01:23:23,579 --> 01:23:27,719
you know some sativas some Afghans some

2090
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:29,299
purples some this some that some

2091
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:32,399
different things it probably would be

2092
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:34,440
very old school grouping of cuts because

2093
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:37,079
that's kind of where my collection leans

2094
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:39,419
I don't have a whole bunch of new ZaZa

2095
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:42,300
so you're not going to see a list of uh

2096
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:44,399
of things that are wildly popular in the

2097
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:47,640
last four or five years it would

2098
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:50,399
probably be blends of classics

2099
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:52,320
you know I mean my whole breeding career

2100
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,719
I basically just like made seeds for me

2101
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,579
and friends and given them away

2102
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:59,340
so the whole idea of like starting a

2103
01:23:56,579 --> 01:24:02,519
seed company is a little odd

2104
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:05,159
um but uh you know I have so many good

2105
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:07,620
friends bugged me about it

2106
01:24:05,158 --> 01:24:09,599
um that it might be time

2107
01:24:07,619 --> 01:24:12,960
so we'll see

2108
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,120
here here that's exciting stuff so

2109
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,279
on to the final question for this

2110
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:19,019
interview it's sort of a two-parter but

2111
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:21,779
I'd love to hear it you're going to

2112
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:24,179
theoretically start a company from

2113
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:26,340
scratch you've lost everything you've

2114
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:29,460
got you're starting fresh you can pick

2115
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:31,619
one pack of seeds to presumably find a

2116
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:33,600
male from that and then start the

2117
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:36,779
company with that

2118
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,640
here's the two-parter to it one possible

2119
01:24:36,779 --> 01:24:40,738
outcome is you're gonna do it and it's

2120
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,719
what's available today has to be

2121
01:24:40,738 --> 01:24:46,319
something that's currently commercially

2122
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:48,000
available and then the part B is you

2123
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:49,979
could sort of do the time machine thing

2124
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,619
where you could pick a pack from it

2125
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:54,899
throughout time you know and choose it

2126
01:24:52,619 --> 01:24:57,359
so what would your two options be in

2127
01:24:54,899 --> 01:24:59,039
each scenario well

2128
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:00,420
um

2129
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:01,979
boy

2130
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:04,020
so

2131
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:05,459
if we're talking about one pack of seeds

2132
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,500
from today

2133
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:09,600
you got to realize that because you said

2134
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:13,140
I would you'd get a male to start it

2135
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,000
that eliminates probably 95 percent of

2136
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:17,460
the current market

2137
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,219
because we've been doing reversals now

2138
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:23,158
for a good 15 years so the amount of

2139
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:24,539
people that are releasing regular seeds

2140
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:26,519
is

2141
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:28,738
very small

2142
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:30,719
well let's let's Jazz it up you could

2143
01:25:28,738 --> 01:25:33,718
you can equally you can get a pack of

2144
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,819
CSI you know chemd cross headband and

2145
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:38,760
get a female and reverse it that's also

2146
01:25:35,819 --> 01:25:41,599
cool you just it just has to be one pack

2147
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,600
one pack

2148
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:47,158
um well I would say if I can if I can

2149
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:48,900
pick all females and reverse it

2150
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:53,279
I'm gonna cheat and I'm gonna say I

2151
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:55,379
would get a pack of lad from CSI simply

2152
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:58,460
because those are two of my all-time

2153
01:25:55,380 --> 01:26:02,279
favorite strains that I would have lost

2154
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:05,520
and I would like to hunt through those

2155
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:08,279
both to refined leaners that of the

2156
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:11,159
things that I lost and I also think that

2157
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:12,960
it's just incredibly Fireweed both of

2158
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:14,219
them so the chances that you would have

2159
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,380
good things

2160
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:17,039
and then

2161
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,920
um

2162
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:21,840
if if we're talking regular seed

2163
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,480
right

2164
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,760
um this might sound nuts but I would

2165
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:27,959
probably if I can get some [ __ ] from I

2166
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:34,800
would probably try to get some of that

2167
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:37,198
uh op uh Haze that uh Tom is working on

2168
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:40,440
if we're going actual like regular males

2169
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:42,599
and stuff like that you know

2170
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:44,399
um because that that ties back to way

2171
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,560
way way back

2172
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,179
you know and there's a lot of diversity

2173
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,500
in there and you could take that and you

2174
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:52,699
could cross it to a lot of modern

2175
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:55,079
indicas and a lot of different new new

2176
01:26:52,698 --> 01:26:56,819
and it's so different

2177
01:26:55,079 --> 01:26:58,319
that you could get some cool stuff

2178
01:26:56,819 --> 01:27:01,559
perhaps

2179
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:04,099
and then if I go back in time

2180
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,100
boy

2181
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:09,260
if I could go back in time

2182
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:14,279
I'll cheat a little bit

2183
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:17,399
and and say something that most people

2184
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:19,738
probably won't think of

2185
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:23,479
um but I would probably go back and try

2186
01:27:19,738 --> 01:27:23,479
to get early Pearl

2187
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,620
and the reason I say that is because one

2188
01:27:26,698 --> 01:27:31,138
of Neville's oldest friends that I chat

2189
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:33,779
with told me that the last five six

2190
01:27:31,139 --> 01:27:36,060
years of Neville's life he was crossing

2191
01:27:33,779 --> 01:27:38,639
a bunch of Mexicans together

2192
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:40,080
because out of all the stuff that he had

2193
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:41,760
one of the things that he was really

2194
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:44,819
hunting to find he'd done a bunch of

2195
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:47,100
haze work in Australia with the the um

2196
01:27:44,819 --> 01:27:49,319
the Outback you know and all that type

2197
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,120
of stuff but he was really looking for

2198
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:53,279
this certain sweetness and the certain

2199
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:55,738
Buzz that he got from those Mexicans

2200
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:58,198
that came from the early Pearl

2201
01:27:55,738 --> 01:28:00,419
and so I figure

2202
01:27:58,198 --> 01:28:02,698
um if he loved it that much that out of

2203
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:05,399
everything he ran through as he aged he

2204
01:28:02,698 --> 01:28:07,919
really wanted to refine that

2205
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:09,839
uh maybe going back in time into the

2206
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,880
late 80s and getting some early Pearl

2207
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,159
when it was still legit before it got

2208
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:16,520
lost would be that would be something

2209
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:16,519
cool

2210
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,400
that's beautiful

2211
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:21,839
really cool to hear I wouldn't have

2212
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:23,158
thought of that that's a I'm gonna have

2213
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,679
to dig more into the early pill

2214
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:28,079
obviously I tried a little sample of

2215
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,520
Pips uh silver Pearl and it was

2216
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:31,738
beautiful so I can only imagine the

2217
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,860
early Pearl equally special

2218
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:36,539
I think uh with that being said we're

2219
01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:38,279
just about at the end of it for this one

2220
01:28:36,539 --> 01:28:40,198
did you have any general comments or

2221
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:41,460
shout outs you'd like to make

2222
01:28:40,198 --> 01:28:44,039
um

2223
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:45,239
I meant sure I say this a lot but I'll

2224
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:48,719
say it again

2225
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:52,919
is uh growey that you love

2226
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:55,800
uh if you're breeding try to find two

2227
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:58,079
plants that you like qualities of each

2228
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:01,980
and you hope maybe you can get those

2229
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:04,139
qualities in the progeny itself

2230
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:06,000
so therefore like don't breed for what

2231
01:29:04,139 --> 01:29:08,039
you think other people will like breed

2232
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,179
for what you think you would personally

2233
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:11,399
like

2234
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:13,859
that's the best way to do breeding is to

2235
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:16,799
look for things that you enjoy

2236
01:29:13,859 --> 01:29:19,259
and when it comes to preservation

2237
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,300
nobody can preserve everything but if

2238
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:23,219
you can hold on to one or two or three

2239
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:25,380
things during this storm that's going on

2240
01:29:23,219 --> 01:29:27,539
right now if you can find some old

2241
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:29,100
things that really speak to you and you

2242
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:30,899
really love

2243
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:33,780
um you can't hold everything but even

2244
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:35,759
holding on to one or two or three old

2245
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:39,719
maybe even currently unpopular things

2246
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:41,639
but really really do it for you

2247
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:43,198
um that can help preserve it for better

2248
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:45,119
times ahead

2249
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:47,519
you know and then

2250
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:49,500
beyond that thanks to all the weed nerds

2251
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,080
and everyone else that like listens to

2252
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:54,119
my homies show all the time and I

2253
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:56,819
appreciate uh there being enough

2254
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:59,460
interest for him having me back and

2255
01:29:56,819 --> 01:30:02,460
listening to me Babble for hours on end

2256
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,239
so that's always good and

2257
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:07,380
um

2258
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:09,000
you know uh we will uh if you know if I

2259
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,039
do decide to release seeds to the public

2260
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,840
or whatever I'll certainly like pass it

2261
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:16,319
out through him and the various things

2262
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:18,480
and you know a small Core group of

2263
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:19,799
enthusiasts can keep something cool

2264
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:21,238
going

2265
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,980
so even though you're out in the middle

2266
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:24,718
of nowhere even though you feel isolated

2267
01:30:22,979 --> 01:30:28,198
even though it's something if enough of

2268
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:30,600
us work towards the same goal

2269
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:33,779
um we can kind of keep the fire burning

2270
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:36,239
uh through some tough times

2271
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:38,819
and that's that

2272
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:40,859
a truly beautiful and inspiring

2273
01:30:38,819 --> 01:30:43,079
sentiment and I think I speak first of

2274
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:45,420
all when I say we're very excited for

2275
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:47,359
the idea of an upcoming seed release

2276
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:51,600
we'll have to wait with baited Breath

2277
