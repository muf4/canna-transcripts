79
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,959
so without further ado

80
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,459
let's get into it

81
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,319
amazing amazing and by the way I love

82
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,060
the name wheelchair for Australian

83
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,699
that's got to be the best

84
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,979
I mean if we just go back you you spoke

85
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,439
about the the genetic drift you've seen

86
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,840
in plants and a question that comes to

87
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,878
my mind about that is do you think a

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,700
similar thing happened with the original

89
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,219
Sour Diesel because it seems like so

90
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,839
many people would just the original Sour

91
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,519
Diesel was the best thing they'd ever

92
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,739
had you know they people talk about the

93
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,200
delivery services in the 90s and how

94
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,239
it's just so good and now it sort of

95
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,339
feels like it's been lost in a sense

96
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,560
what do you think has happened to the

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,738
real Sour Diesel

98
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,738
yeah I mean you know it's it's probably

99
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,198
has drifted a little bit I mean some of

100
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:25,819
the cuts that I've gotten back recently

101
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:29,220
have gotten that kind of variegation

102
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:31,500
that mosaic

103
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,400
um but I don't think it's the Mosaic

104
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,899
disease but it is some type of um

105
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:43,500
virus I believe I I've been seeing it a

106
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:46,019
lot on a lot of older cuts

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,019
um you know has that kind of little

108
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:52,379
variegation to it like the like the

109
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:54,359
chemd does but you know the chemd has

110
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,100
always had it since day one

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,580
so I mean

112
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,220
um yeah so I think some of the sour

113
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,800
diesel is I mean you got to think about

114
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,860
it I mean that stuff you know I always

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,639
been around since you know 95.

116
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,240
so you know how many years is that you

117
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,699
know and so it really reaches the point

118
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,400
um you know you get a cutting

119
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,680
um you know how how many generations old

120
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,379
is that by now by the time you get it

121
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,478
you know so and you know even you know

122
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,219
like a lot of people that I know they

123
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,699
don't keep mothers they just go from

124
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,639
clone to clone so you know after a long

125
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,978
period of time uh you know there's got

126
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,978
to be some type of genetic drift that

127
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:44,459
happens and uh

128
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:46,500
yeah it's really hard to explain I guess

129
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,680
some streams are a little bit more

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,079
hardier than others uh I guess I have

131
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,560
seen I guess indigos kind of dud out

132
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,219
faster than sativas but

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,680
um

134
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,560
yeah I think some of the

135
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,500
um some of the sours are getting kind of

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,660
old so and that's why I kind of decided

137
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,959
to you know start to do some back

138
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,539
Crossing and I got into the back cross

139
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,299
fours but that really wasn't my

140
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:18,180
intention I really wanted to do the back

141
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,259
cross three and

142
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,840
um I have back cross three F twos that

143
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:29,639
I'm um I just popped they're going to be

144
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:32,219
working into F3 Sour Diesel so

145
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,100
um yeah hopefully you know and a lot of

146
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,100
the uh the back crosses a lot of the

147
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,220
reports uh the stuff that we've grown

148
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,280
out a lot of it is you know like the

149
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,220
old-time sour so you know it's going to

150
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,219
be really just you know trying to shift

151
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,560
through you know some of those genetics

152
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:57,000
and trying to find you know the perfect

153
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,579
sour so I mean um yeah we've you know

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,639
grown some of it out in the in the

155
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,560
warehouse and we're excited with you

156
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,699
know one of the funerals that we found

157
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,560
that were was super sorry and so I think

158
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,160
um you know from the reports that we've

159
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,800
been getting from the back Frost threes

160
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:20,460
uh have been all just really good people

161
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,340
excited saying that the sour is back

162
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,138
that's really exciting to hear I mean

163
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,899
out of all the sour cuts that are in

164
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,120
circulation at the moment which one do

165
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:33,239
you put sort of your weight behind in

166
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,899
terms of the one you like the most

167
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,720
well to me I mean they're all the same I

168
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:44,459
mean everyone says well you know this

169
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:47,160
choco and res and this one and that one

170
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,799
and and really you know back in the day

171
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,860
there was only one you know when I when

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,259
I first got the sour diesel I got it

173
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,720
from AJ's girlfriend

174
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:01,139
that was the only cutting that they had

175
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:05,039
you know and so that was the original

176
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:08,900
you know and how that's you know you

177
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:13,560
know become all these different types of

178
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:16,198
uh fenos that people claim

179
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,680
um is probably because of genetic drift

180
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,680
you know and how people maintain their

181
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,639
mother and their cuttings over the years

182
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,620
so you know they're you know

183
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,278
you know if I have a cutting and you

184
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,799
have a cutting and both of us uh

185
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,979
uh you're growing Organics and I'm using

186
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,319
salts and we're just going from clone to

187
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,639
clone to clone to clone you know after

188
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:48,420
10 or 20 years uh you know my shower

189
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,159
could be different than your shower a

190
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,519
little bit you know even though the

191
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,740
genetics you know are different or the

192
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,940
same you know there could be certain

193
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:02,700
qualities that are had evolved to the

194
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,620
conditions that it was growing in over

195
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,100
the years and that's one thing I think

196
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,620
cannabis does it evolves so if you have

197
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,778
it in you know in a shitty [ __ ]

198
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,879
condition over a long period of time

199
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:17,338
what do you think is going to happen you

200
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:21,179
know so um

201
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:22,980
yeah yeah I think it's probably only

202
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:26,099
more recently people are starting to

203
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,379
realize how detrimental it is to have

204
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,480
those subpar conditions for the mothers

205
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:32,458
something I was interested to ask you

206
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,920
about is there's a lot of notable

207
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,778
strains throughout history that come

208
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:38,519
from sort of kambag seed that were maybe

209
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:39,778
lost like you know earlier on in the

210
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,600
episode you referenced the original

211
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:45,240
guava things like that it made me wonder

212
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,820
were there any other genetics you know

213
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,639
over say the 90s or the early 2000s

214
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,800
where you really liked them and they

215
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,360
weren't chem genetics but maybe they got

216
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,458
lost and they just sort of don't get

217
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,778
mentioned because the chem tends to take

218
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,599
the Limelight

219
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:04,439
you know yeah well I specifically

220
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,899
remember a hash plant uh that my friend

221
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,640
used to get and that was from an indoor

222
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,480
grower

223
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,539
um

224
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,180
and we used to call the guy whose guy's

225
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:17,099
name was Dave Dave Lincoln and he used

226
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:18,838
to have a Lincoln beard so that's why I

227
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,778
used to call Dave Lincoln and my friend

228
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,720
met him in the Staten Island Hydro Store

229
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:27,720
he was in there shopping one day and

230
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,200
this guy other guy odd character was in

231
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,620
there and they just you know started a

232
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,839
conversation and hit it up and so this

233
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,019
guy was going uh back and forth to

234
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,500
Amsterdam and had gotten some hash plant

235
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:45,179
seeds and I specifically remember this

236
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,100
stuff because the [ __ ] used to blow me

237
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:51,078
away

238
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:55,560
and it used to you know leave the room

239
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:58,859
in you know almost in a light perfumey

240
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:02,759
kind of pungent smell to it almost like

241
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,339
a haze like smell to it you know but I

242
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:09,240
remember this stuff was just you know

243
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:13,079
super potent and I I never I know the

244
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,120
age AJ he was able to get some early on

245
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:19,639
and

246
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,519
um yeah unfortunately the guy uh Dave

247
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:26,039
he wound up going

248
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,320
on vacation somewhere and left some

249
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:32,519
drunk to

250
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:36,600
you know to take care of his place and

251
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:39,659
so the guy somehow or another winds up

252
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,720
locking himself out of the apartment and

253
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:45,179
he was like banging on the door the

254
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,019
neighbors called the super and the

255
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:51,679
police they opened the door and as soon

256
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:55,620
as you open the door it was just like

257
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,599
bam you walked into his room I guess and

258
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,578
so

259
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,360
unfortunately yeah that house plant

260
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:05,819
wound up you know coming to an end and I

261
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,639
never you know wound up seeing anything

262
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,278
quite like that ever again you know I

263
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,980
could only assume that those genetics

264
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,320
were probably coming from Neville you

265
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:21,300
know because you were talking probably

266
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,620
the late late 80s early 90s so

267
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,799
um you know I would assume that those

268
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,039
you know genetics came from Neville but

269
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:31,620
you know that was one specifics strain

270
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:34,500
that I remember back in the day and

271
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,980
there was like a couple you know stuff

272
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,220
that they used to call Kush and Northern

273
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,820
Lights and you know those two things

274
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,519
were very kind of and when you say kush

275
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm not talking OG Kush it was a

276
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,659
different type of crush and not Bubba

277
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,759
Kush so

278
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:56,819
um yeah I mean I can't really remember

279
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,939
exactly what you know that could I just

280
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,940
remember it was like super crystally and

281
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,760
just this bomb and you know I also

282
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,760
remember some Northern Lights that used

283
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:14,819
to be around that was kind of mediciney

284
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:17,100
and Piney and uh yeah so um I mean man

285
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,440
there were some really good streams that

286
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,778
you know used to be around back in the

287
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,880
day and and some really good time I

288
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:27,958
remember getting this tie weed that was

289
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:30,958
just unbelievable it was called the um

290
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,958
uh

291
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,839
the golden eagle tie

292
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,719
and

293
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,579
the thing about the golden eagle time my

294
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,700
friend in Time Square wound up getting

295
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:48,299
it and it used to come in kilos and the

296
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:51,000
kilos were wrapped in cellophane and so

297
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:55,500
the brick was wrapped up and then they

298
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,559
had a stamp on of a golden eagle and

299
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,480
um the funny thing about the story is

300
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,719
you know that stuff only came around

301
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,200
once it was back in 89 I specifically

302
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,079
remember it because I remember getting

303
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,860
some of it and taking it to the Grateful

304
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:17,879
Dead show and it was uh it was a

305
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,278
memorable run and we I don't know we had

306
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,439
a bunch of people there and my friend

307
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,480
had a van and we had I don't know like

308
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,700
three or four cars I don't know there

309
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,339
was like eight or ten people hanging out

310
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,980
we're getting ready to go into the show

311
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:34,019
and I had this [ __ ] tie weed this

312
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,000
Golden Eagle Tire weed I rolled up two

313
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,578
joints and I lit them both up at the

314
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,440
same time and then we were all in a

315
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,719
circle I'm smoking on Two Joints I I

316
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,060
passed one one way and the other one the

317
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,759
other way and so we you know we smoked

318
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,979
we smoked those two joints and there was

319
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,659
a lot of people there and so I figured

320
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,300
oh you know maybe you know everyone

321
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:57,000
didn't get high enough so we smoked

322
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:59,939
those two joints I wound up packing a

323
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,860
bowl and like everyone just dropped out

324
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,740
I mean you know when when I thought

325
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,360
everyone was like no that's numb

326
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:09,180
everyone just [ __ ] bailed you know

327
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,579
and I just specifically remember that

328
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,578
and I just remember man this [ __ ] must

329
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:17,519
be really good you know so you know that

330
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:20,638
that I I remember and I remember getting

331
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,980
big huge seeds in it too that really big

332
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,560
seeds and eventually I lost them to the

333
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,079
cops but anyway

334
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:32,879
um the funny thing about the story is

335
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,719
that there's a book called Thai Thai

336
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,240
stick

337
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:41,579
I don't know if you're familiar with it

338
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:46,379
yeah yeah yeah and so I kind of became

339
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:47,698
uh friendly with the author and

340
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:53,100
um

341
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:54,958
one of want someone that

342
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,079
that I'm uh

343
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,879
someone that my friend knows a mutual

344
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,399
friend

345
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:04,980
um they see those stamps of the golden

346
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,879
eagle and they framed them in a picture

347
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,940
frame and they took a picture of it and

348
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,480
he sent it to me

349
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,959
and

350
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,139
um I I recognized it right away and so I

351
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:20,399
I made a PO I posted that Golden Eagle

352
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:24,440
stamp

353
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:29,159
and the author of the Thai stick book

354
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:33,839
recognized that stamp and actually knew

355
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:36,539
of that particular load and knew of that

356
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,639
particular load that that came because

357
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:40,919
they were they were coming they were

358
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,159
those stamps were coming from you know a

359
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:47,759
particular group of people in which he

360
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:51,360
documents in that book and

361
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,980
um yeah and actually he has a picture of

362
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,620
um I think it was in one of the

363
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,139
newspapers they had busted part of that

364
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,039
load or something but they have a

365
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:04,919
picture of that load of the eagle stamp

366
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:08,818
in there and everything so yeah that was

367
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:11,160
like a real amazing uh you know a thing

368
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:13,619
that kind or came another amazing thing

369
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,699
that came full circle of was actually

370
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,979
being able to uh track track and he

371
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,199
actually knows the actual person that

372
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,519
you know he tells a story the guy went

373
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:29,039
up into Laos into this farm and you know

374
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,359
I started to fall you know you know you

375
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,298
know they I mean these guys were

376
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,939
smuggling you know the tie back back

377
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,500
then and so I mean they real instead of

378
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,538
buying it from people they actually

379
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,519
started their own Farm that's how deep

380
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:44,220
they started getting into it you know

381
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:47,339
and you know if you really get if you if

382
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,720
you if you get into the book uh Thai

383
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,240
stick

384
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,298
um yeah it's all documented so I mean

385
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,120
that was uh an amazing thing I thought

386
00:17:54,298 --> 00:18:00,480
that you know I which wound up you know

387
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,459
uh coming through but but really the uh

388
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,480
really the internet has really been an

389
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,179
intricate part of of cannabis the Evolve

390
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,700
you know evolving everything and putting

391
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:16,380
you know being able to figure out these

392
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:18,419
stories of the tie and the chem dog and

393
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,820
you know you know being able to

394
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,880
communicate with someone around the

395
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:27,178
world and you know when it first came

396
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,520
out it really gave us the ability to

397
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:32,100
someone in New York to talk to someone

398
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:36,900
in California and actually like the

399
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:38,000
concept of mailing clones and and all of

400
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,740
that

401
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,679
you know you know like like if you

402
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,480
really think about it like you you know

403
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,700
like how is that going to work that

404
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,599
you're gonna mail me something in the

405
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:55,259
mail and like so you know all of that

406
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:59,159
was just you know very new and and fresh

407
00:18:55,259 --> 00:19:02,460
and uh yeah you know it was just amazing

408
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,620
and really you know you know I'm I'm a

409
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,360
product of the internet you know if it

410
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,639
wasn't for the internet you know I

411
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,740
wouldn't be who I you know and the

412
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,600
people that's that's helped me I

413
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,419
wouldn't be who I am you know because

414
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:18,599
how else are people going to know about

415
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,880
you find out about you you know or even

416
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,740
connect with you and in that and in the

417
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,860
beginning it was never really about

418
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,200
being trying to be about trying to be

419
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:30,659
someone in the industry it was just

420
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,140
trying to trying to

421
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,919
make your hustle in trying to make money

422
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,799
to pay your bills and feed your family

423
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:43,799
and and and so on so you know in the

424
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,440
very beginning you know no one was ever

425
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:50,639
you know trying to be you know some kind

426
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,700
of big kind of a breeder or you know we

427
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,520
just kind of evolved into that and um

428
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,340
you know we were just Hustlers you know

429
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,500
from the very beginning so kind of being

430
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,720
in the right place at the right time and

431
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,720
just taking advantage of the situation

432
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:11,640
you know and merely having the the balls

433
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,160
to really you know do something that was

434
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,259
illegal you know at the time where

435
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,980
people now you know it's it's pretty

436
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:22,819
easy for anyone to you know to to jump

437
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,380
in and and you know become a Instagram

438
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:28,259
seed breeder

439
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,539
yeah I mean I've been reflecting on that

440
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:33,119
point myself a lot recently that like

441
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:36,058
any perceived struggles people have

442
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,099
these days probably quite minimal

443
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:40,319
compared to what you know yourself and

444
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,538
some of the other sort of original guys

445
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,939
really had to go up against so you know

446
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,759
kudos for for taking the risk at a time

447
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,400
when you know the the punishments were

448
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,900
arguably incredibly worse

449
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,460
um I'd love to just link back though

450
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,280
when you were talking about the hash

451
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,360
plant that was lost it it brought to

452
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,918
mind

453
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,719
um I'm wondering what what's your

454
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,059
thoughts on the Skelly hash plant you

455
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,160
know it's it's often a a really well

456
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:07,079
received cutting among the chem heads

457
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,120
and as a sort of a follow-up to that do

458
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:11,480
you think there's a link between Skelly

459
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:15,359
and the chem 91

460
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,120
uh I don't think so I mean I think the

461
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,519
the hash pen itself

462
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,939
um it's kind of greasy you know there's

463
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:27,179
no come in it whatsoever it's more of a

464
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,220
raw Afghani type of plant

465
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,740
um very similar to other hash plants

466
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,220
that I've seen in the past hash plant

467
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:39,720
number one being one of them

468
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:42,839
um I mean it's uh I mean it's an old

469
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,740
it's a very old uh cutting

470
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:51,298
um it can be very tricky to uh to dial

471
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:55,259
in uh it doesn't clone very well

472
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:58,319
um yeah it's you know uh it's I mean

473
00:21:55,259 --> 00:22:01,500
just just just describe it it's you know

474
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,779
I would describe it as you know as a a

475
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,058
heavy Afghan

476
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,579
um you know which can be kind of bland

477
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:11,099
to some people uh you know because

478
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:13,859
there's not a lot of you know a lot of

479
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:16,139
flavor and there's more of a dankness to

480
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:19,139
it you know

481
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,580
um so I don't I don't really see a real

482
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,860
you know

483
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:25,500
um between the two of them it's kind of

484
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:28,259
a night and day because that the the

485
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,099
hash the Skelly grows really kind of

486
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:36,058
short and bushy and you know kind of

487
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:39,959
like a typical hash plant Afghan land

488
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:43,558
race type of a plant where the cams are

489
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:48,480
you know a little more stretchy and more

490
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:51,119
terpy and uh yeah I mean I can kind of

491
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,159
see there is a little bit of a similar

492
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,979
similar you know they have similar

493
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:59,520
traits to them but a lot

494
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:04,140
different where I would describe the

495
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:08,240
Skelly as probably a pure Indigo in the

496
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:11,640
chems kind of more of a little bit of a

497
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,419
hybrid sativa they just have that little

498
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,679
bit more uh achieve a hybrid to them it

499
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:21,780
seems in growth and and structure and

500
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,538
everything too

501
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,879
yeah certainly I've I've had similar

502
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:29,279
thoughts myself you know about I guess

503
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,679
to me the Skelly hash plant has some

504
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,480
similar taste to the chem dog but as you

505
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,340
said that's just sort of an Afghani

506
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,200
taste I guess it doesn't really explain

507
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:40,139
why there's such a dramatic difference

508
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,819
in the way they grow and whatnot but

509
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,679
sort of I guess at the heart of the

510
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:46,798
question is like what do you think are

511
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,840
the genetics in chemdog and as a bit of

512
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,599
a follow-up I remember I spoke to

513
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,000
Peabody years ago and and he said you

514
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,798
know like look Joe Brand's the only one

515
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,480
who probably really can give you any

516
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,879
more information than what already

517
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,380
exists do you think we'll ever get that

518
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,299
information from Joe or someone

519
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:10,140
no I mean I don't think no one really

520
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:13,440
knows you know uh I mean I suspect it's

521
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:17,520
got to be you know obviously sometime

522
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,460
some type of Afghan I mean uh just by

523
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:23,879
you know by the the chem 91 just by the

524
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,919
dark the dark leaves you know which is

525
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,200
kind of similar to the Skelly you know

526
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,980
they get that really kind of Darkness to

527
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,679
them the the shiny Darkness to them

528
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,679
um so there's definitely some you know

529
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:41,940
Afghan influence in there

530
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:45,419
um you know uh I I'm hearing you know

531
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,140
I've heard some rumors of

532
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,759
um

533
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:54,480
of the dog Bud being in Oregon

534
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:56,700
in in in uh in uh dead family

535
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,400
um I'm trying to get some um some more

536
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:05,460
information on that

537
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:07,320
um but that was from an outside Source I

538
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:11,400
mean the

539
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:16,439
the rumors all go back to that same area

540
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:19,400
of Oregon and in Washington you know so

541
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,679
I I you know I have to believe it it

542
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,179
probably came out it definitely came out

543
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,220
of there

544
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:28,380
um it could be some type of Northern

545
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,759
Lights

546
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,778
um thing

547
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:36,119
um but you know that you know uh I would

548
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:39,179
like to you know if and I'm sure you

549
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,759
know guys like Greg McAllister in summer

550
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:46,320
older head and older heads than me can

551
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:49,679
probably answer this question of plants

552
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,899
that were fuel you know that cami

553
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,120
fueliness now I don't know if that was

554
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:59,580
ever a tree of any of the NL tree and NL

555
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:02,399
strains or any of the Afghans that these

556
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:04,319
guys got back in the day but there's got

557
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,980
to be someone that's out there that

558
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:12,538
could recognize I mean I mean that that

559
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:14,640
that you know diesel uh chemi uh

560
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:19,319
whatever you want to call it you know

561
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:21,659
that's a specific terp you know and so I

562
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:27,000
mean I'd have to think it's got to come

563
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:30,299
out of the so the Afghans or cushes you

564
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,400
know from from from those regions of of

565
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,740
hashmaking

566
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,720
um so I mean it you know and you'd

567
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,620
really have to go back to some of those

568
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,819
regions and you know I mean do you know

569
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:47,879
do these chirps still you know uh

570
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:51,000
survive in their original form was it

571
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:55,140
something that was was crossed you know

572
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,298
into a sativa uh type of a plant or you

573
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,400
know there's a lot of different you know

574
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:01,500
uh a lot of different questions because

575
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,200
I think you know the chem itself is

576
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,359
quite complex you know and then you know

577
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,940
if you look at the 91 the way that it

578
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,819
grows you know very similar to an OG

579
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,400
Kush you know um a lot of you know there

580
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:17,418
you know a lot of people like me uh

581
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,360
think that they're um they're definitely

582
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:24,020
related to some form or another uh just

583
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:27,959
by the way that you know that it grows

584
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:30,119
bud structure refuelingness now

585
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,159
obviously there's you know a terp

586
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,359
difference and it must have been

587
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,720
something that was something different

588
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:38,278
that was brought in uh so

589
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,220
um so really you know really getting

590
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:43,740
back to you know the the origin of that

591
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,659
fueliness now where did where does that

592
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,798
originate from and I don't think anyone

593
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:52,980
could really answer that question

594
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:55,740
yeah it may well be one for the ages

595
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,720
as sort of a follow-up to that question

596
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,120
did you ever have any sort of

597
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,278
relationship with Joe brand and did you

598
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:09,359
ever see the chem one two or three

599
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:13,759
uh I never personally met Joe uh we had

600
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:17,219
many conversations over the years online

601
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:21,900
uh we're always one step away from

602
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:27,058
meeting but couldn't for whatever reason

603
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:30,960
um I met p-bud first before I met Joe

604
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:34,619
um you know unfortunately Joe

605
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,460
um you know fell off over the years

606
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:40,278
um due to a bad drug habit

607
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:45,000
um you know

608
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:47,700
me Peabody Greg you know lots of other

609
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,819
people have always kind of you know

610
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,000
reached out and you know

611
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:57,658
tried to help him and you know he I mean

612
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,099
he really could have been uh someone in

613
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:05,220
the industry but unfortunately chose a

614
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,980
different path he definitely has a place

615
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,278
in history and

616
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:15,000
um has a story to tell

617
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:19,259
uh but unfortunately other other demons

618
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,319
or or you know

619
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:24,898
or winning the fight and so you know we

620
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:28,740
haven't you know heard from Joe and and

621
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:31,319
you know in in a few years so I I don't

622
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:35,759
know if he's still with us or not I mean

623
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:39,178
he could possibly uh the last time I uh

624
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:43,200
reached out to someone that had tabs on

625
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:45,840
him uh they couldn't locate him so

626
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,380
um yeah we we don't know the status of

627
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,658
Joe and we you know we we you know we

628
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,120
hope and pray that you know he could you

629
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,520
know get his [ __ ] together and you know

630
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,939
there's there's there's there's always a

631
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:02,940
place in history and uh a new beginning

632
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,038
for him if he wants but you know these

633
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,558
are things that you know that we we

634
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,798
can't control other people's

635
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:14,819
um actions unfortunately it can only go

636
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:17,940
uh forward with ourselves so um yeah

637
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,079
that's you know that's pretty much it on

638
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,298
him

639
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,158
yeah no that's that's a good response

640
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:26,398
that's a good response

641
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,440
so on a recent episode we had Mr Bob

642
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,479
Hemphill on and we're sort of talking

643
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,919
about the hash plant 13 and I know that

644
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,558
you've had a little bit of experience

645
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,299
with that one and I was wondering if you

646
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,740
had any sort of insights you'd be

647
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:39,778
willing to share with us because there's

648
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,819
such little information about it out

649
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:45,778
there

650
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:48,418
yeah well the hash plant 13 uh yeah I

651
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:49,099
mean I recently

652
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:53,159
um

653
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:55,859
I unraveled the mystery behind that you

654
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,340
know I had purchased some land race

655
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:02,038
seeds from someone and when I grew them

656
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:04,519
out it was just that

657
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:09,960
the the the

658
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:14,339
salty onion garlic skunk that's

659
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:17,100
unmistakable to uh HP 13 and when I

660
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,599
smelled it I was like that's it you know

661
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:22,500
and so

662
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:26,038
I had been searching uh for that stream

663
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:29,419
for quite some time because it was

664
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:33,839
always a mythical strain that was around

665
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:37,860
New York City at the same time that uh

666
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:40,439
hash plant was but I never ever got to

667
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:41,519
uh sample it but I always heard about it

668
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,038
so

669
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,099
you know when I saw you know and over

670
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:52,859
the years I saw multiple breeders offer

671
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:54,298
that uh strain but uh it never uh you

672
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:57,119
know I

673
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:59,460
well I grew it out from two different

674
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,759
people and the first person I grew it

675
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:07,380
out from it was not you know anything

676
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:10,019
that I really uh thought was uh worth

677
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,600
keeping and then when I grew up the

678
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:16,798
second breeders pack that's when I

679
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:20,219
that's when I found the real deal and uh

680
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:23,298
recently I was at uh the New York City

681
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:27,120
uh Gene Trader show

682
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:29,278
and you know that's you know my that's

683
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,259
my stomping grounds New York so when I

684
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,259
went home when I went to that I was like

685
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:37,500
it was like it was like a homecoming uh

686
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:39,599
a lot of my old friends came out a lot

687
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,319
of my old customers a lot of people I

688
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,418
you know worked with you know and so uh

689
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:47,579
a friend of mine came out you know that

690
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:49,919
I had known for a long time and

691
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:53,879
introduced me to the breeder of the

692
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,759
hb-13 Eddie this guy named Eddie uh

693
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,980
Eddie originally was from New York uh

694
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,200
was in the New York City scene in the

695
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,839
90s

696
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,360
uh he created he was a grower he created

697
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:10,879
HP 13.

698
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:13,500
and then he moved to uh Maui in Hawaii

699
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,539
so when he moved out there was a whole

700
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,839
bunch of people from

701
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:21,558
um from New York at that time that uh

702
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:24,778
moved out moved out to Hawaii

703
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:28,918
and they there was a whole whole scene

704
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:31,798
that that that started out there and

705
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,620
that's kind of where uh the that's how

706
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,960
the HP 13 wound up being in Hawaii

707
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:39,658
because those guys brought brought it

708
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,500
over there and that's how some of those

709
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:46,200
uh other guys got a hold of it out there

710
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,278
so uh

711
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,460
so yeah I mean uh I mean when I when I

712
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,419
re you know I got the original hb13 as a

713
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,899
cutting

714
00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:00,360
uh it was a little bit tired

715
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:02,879
and um

716
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:05,219
and it always you know it always you

717
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,820
know when it was growing it always had

718
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,800
that really you know uh real the Terps

719
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:14,220
were just amazing when you smell it just

720
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,500
very very unique you know but it was a

721
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,838
hard it was a hard plant to grow and it

722
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,059
always it was about

723
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,639
I mean if you had any kind of bugs in

724
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,519
your in your grow they would just you

725
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,200
know for some reason it was you know

726
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:30,480
just one of those plants that the you

727
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,598
know the mites would just they would be

728
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,579
on the HP 13 but the plant next to it

729
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,740
they wouldn't be on so it was just one

730
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:41,460
of those type of plants where you know

731
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:44,098
the bugs just loved it and

732
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:48,119
um yeah I mean over the years it kind of

733
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:50,639
it's kind of lost some of its Vigor and

734
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,820
some of the Terps and stuff it had

735
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,338
gotten tired over the years and so yeah

736
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,280
the original cutting um you know I wound

737
00:34:56,338 --> 00:35:02,338
up doing some breeding with it and then

738
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,320
I just eventually I I unfortunately lost

739
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:07,320
it but

740
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,720
um the the special thing about it was

741
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,000
just Terps about it and you know a lot

742
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:14,759
of people used to you know used to say

743
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,338
the same exact thing that they're saying

744
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,980
about the sour you know that they they

745
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:23,460
say about the hash brown that early on

746
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,980
it was really strong and really terribly

747
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,980
this and that and now it's kind of weak

748
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,679
and weak on you know week week across

749
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,780
the board so you know when I when I

750
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:40,319
picked it up you know you know I I

751
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:43,019
brought it back to uh uh a bx1 and you

752
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,480
know and then kind of just uh it kind of

753
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:48,300
just fell off from there you know I have

754
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,000
all that original stock

755
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,880
um but you know when I found you know

756
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,659
the original mother plant you know I was

757
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,460
really excited and so I I'm hoping you

758
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:02,639
know I'm going to be doing some breeding

759
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:06,679
with that uh real soon actually I'm I

760
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:09,799
mean I got it right now and um

761
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:14,639
unfortunately that I had a

762
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:17,480
HP 13 back cross I popped some seeds and

763
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:20,460
um a few plants that I wound up getting

764
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,400
uh they were all female so like

765
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,320
sometimes you pop seeds we'd hope to

766
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,059
finding a male and they'll come out

767
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,740
female and

768
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:31,619
yeah that's what that's a little

769
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:34,979
disappointing for me but uh I'm

770
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,960
unfortunately for me I have uh some

771
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:40,500
pollen stored away

772
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,320
so I'm gonna I have some UW back cross

773
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:47,460
pollen and

774
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:52,680
um that was the UW yeah that was the um

775
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:56,820
the original cross was double dog hp1

776
00:36:52,679 --> 00:37:00,838
Puck times the UW

777
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:03,660
and then I back crossed the UW twice

778
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:07,980
and so the UW hash plant

779
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:10,139
kind of has it it's almost a little

780
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:15,420
similar to uh

781
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:18,179
the HP 13 and probably similar to the

782
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:22,519
hash plant that I remember back in the

783
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:27,419
day because it kind of has like a very

784
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:31,199
distinctive kind of pissy skunky like

785
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:34,320
it's really hard to describe but when

786
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,039
you smoke it it's got that pungent kind

787
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,079
of

788
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,779
smell kind of just like when you smoked

789
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,980
a Bubba Kush when you smoke the Bubble

790
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,040
Kush

791
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,679
yeah this is the the spiciness in the

792
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:49,320
air so there's there is you know some of

793
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:52,500
these hash plant kushes out there that

794
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,720
that's got this kind of spiciness to it

795
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,320
you know which is

796
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:01,799
um very unique in in Indigo because you

797
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:06,500
don't really find that like spicy like

798
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:11,039
kind of uh pungent Haze hazy type of

799
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:14,719
smell you know in the Indigo so uh I

800
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:17,219
find those ones really uh interesting

801
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,779
yeah definitely definitely it sounds

802
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:21,358
like a killer

803
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,700
um I might be confused here but one of

804
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,199
our listeners was wondering because it

805
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:26,819
might be the same plan we're talking

806
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,618
about but hopefully you can clarify for

807
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,160
me they were just wondering how you

808
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:34,800
would describe the hash plant slash Puck

809
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,199
slash Double Dog mother you used in the

810
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,400
HP 91 cross you made is that the same

811
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,059
plan or is it different and how would

812
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,059
you describe it

813
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:49,500
yeah no uh yeah no it was more kind of

814
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:52,618
puckish you know kind of you know more

815
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,639
uh more Indica

816
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,519
um

817
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:58,500
yeah all that stuff kind of just kind of

818
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:03,179
leaned toward the puck because it was

819
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:05,838
really you know the HP one you know and

820
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:09,319
uh the puck were kind of like very

821
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:14,719
similar plants this very kind of short

822
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:19,740
short indigos kind of leafy single Cola

823
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:24,719
uh in a fat nugs uh kind of blandish and

824
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:28,919
and taste and and and and Terps uh more

825
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:31,078
of a you know heavy uh Stoney in Indica

826
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,280
type of a plant

827
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:38,039
yeah nice great I was gonna say

828
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,920
um I used to have this cutting I got

829
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:44,579
from your seeds that I missed so much it

830
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,440
was from the skunk OG did you ever hear

831
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:49,220
much back from customers about that I

832
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:53,099
had this killer cart I loved it

833
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:55,559
uh yeah I mean uh

834
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,838
uh we kind of I got a little bit of

835
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,199
feedback but it wasn't something that

836
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,539
really gained a lot of traction

837
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:06,838
um it's kind of funny how sometimes

838
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:09,179
those things work out you know

839
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,279
um sometimes it only takes someone one

840
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:13,858
person like you to find something like

841
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,560
that and then start blowing it up and

842
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:19,559
then it just starts creates a lot of

843
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:22,619
interest and uh and that's kind of how

844
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,420
those things work like you know the the

845
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,880
only way I could describe it is they

846
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,338
kind of take a life of their own like I

847
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,800
could say what I want about how good

848
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:35,039
they are but until they get into

849
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,260
somebody else's hands and and and and

850
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,440
especially if it's someone that has any

851
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:43,079
kind of influence or following and if

852
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,358
they start blowing it up and just that's

853
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,940
the only way that I can describe like my

854
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,940
whole the way everything has kind of

855
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:52,500
evolved for me it wasn't really what I

856
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,679
did with everything is what everyone

857
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,380
else do with my genetics you know and I

858
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,440
made them but you know other people

859
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,900
actually have made them famous more

860
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,579
famous than I have for me you know you

861
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,338
know I'm saying people have gone out and

862
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:11,880
won awards with them people have you

863
00:41:08,338 --> 00:41:13,980
know you know when something's that good

864
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,160
it just kind of stands out and it takes

865
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,539
a life of its own so you know like I

866
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:20,578
said it doesn't really matter what I

867
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:22,739
think or say about it it's what you say

868
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:24,539
and what everyone else thinks and says

869
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:26,219
you know and when I show you something

870
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:27,960
that good you're going to be like wow

871
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:31,078
that's amazing you know what I mean and

872
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,480
you show your body and then it just you

873
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,099
you know before you it just takes you

874
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,440
know that's the only way I can describe

875
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,079
it's uh you know

876
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,720
yeah no I I totally agree with you again

877
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,820
I guess people may be a bit apprehensive

878
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,799
if a breed is telling you you know this

879
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,539
is the bee's knees like maybe maybe

880
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,220
they've been sold something that wasn't

881
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,900
very good before in the past so yeah

882
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:53,699
when someone else blows it up it's like

883
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,500
hey this is there's no reason for me to

884
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:57,000
say it's good if it's not

885
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,260
um but that's interesting to hear and

886
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,019
another thing I was thinking about

887
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,119
earlier today was your star cookies

888
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:06,239
cross it was sort of like the original

889
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,160
GMO right because like you know star

890
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,598
dog's like a lot of chem D in it right

891
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,819
and then it's crossed to The Forum

892
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,039
because it's sort of like its own GMO in

893
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,440
a way before GMO was big did you ever

894
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:19,679
find any phenos like GMO in there or is

895
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,679
sort of a bit different no not fully

896
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,419
like that really like the GMO is just I

897
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:28,379
don't know it's just kind of like an

898
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:30,599
army it just it's uh

899
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,400
I don't think they've been able to find

900
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,440
anything

901
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,440
the same cutting

902
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,320
you know I'm sure it's been remade and

903
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,599
it's just like it's you know it's just

904
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,500
one of those things that one in a

905
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,300
thousand seed or whatever whatever it

906
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,420
was uh

907
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,079
um they can't they can't duplicate that

908
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:57,659
you know so and that was really because

909
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,460
you know it was very chemd heavy you

910
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:02,699
know when you met you know when you

911
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:07,380
smell you know GMO you just get like

912
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:08,098
full garlic fuel you know

913
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,619
um

914
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:14,700
yeah so I mean the blend of that was

915
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:15,720
just kind of an amazing thing and really

916
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:18,000
um

917
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,459
I don't think that they can duplicate it

918
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,519
I mean uh I forget the name who made

919
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:27,240
what was the name of the I think it was

920
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:30,719
mamako seeds okay right and I know that

921
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:33,598
he's remade them I know that he's remade

922
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:37,559
him so I don't hear of anyone you know

923
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,720
finding that and I kind of kind of look

924
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:42,559
at the same thing as the motor breath

925
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:46,919
you know the motor breath was

926
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:49,440
sfbog times chem D and so when you when

927
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,139
you get a bag of that stuff and you

928
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,079
smell the motor breath it smells heavy

929
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:59,940
camdi I mean you know but when you smoke

930
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:03,480
it it tastes like OG you know so

931
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:06,960
um it's just one of them things where

932
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,420
you know the genetics just you know fell

933
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,579
into place and it was uh you know a

934
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:16,380
winning ticket but

935
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:17,880
um to try to recreate that I mean I

936
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,180
think you're probably better off

937
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,818
breeding with that to recreate it than

938
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:26,059
to try to use the original appearance

939
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:29,880
because there's going to be so much

940
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:32,219
diversity in the gene pool and you

941
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,740
probably got to go through who knows how

942
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:38,578
many seeds to find that you know it is

943
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:41,338
in there but how you know often is it

944
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:43,920
going to pop up you know that one in ten

945
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:46,739
one or who who knows and and if other

946
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,099
people aren't finding it you know then

947
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:54,358
that must tell you that it's it's a rare

948
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:56,880
it's a rare thing so uh yeah

949
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,500
yeah hugely hugely I think I can't

950
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,180
remember who it was but someone came on

951
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,280
the show a while back and said oh you

952
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:04,440
know GMO it's just it's just chemd

953
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,200
dressed up like cookies and it made me

954
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,519
think like sounds kind of true to me but

955
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,939
I guess it sort of made me start

956
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:14,099
thinking about how it's funny that you

957
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,200
need to dress the chemd up like cookies

958
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,720
for people to be more interested like

959
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:20,879
it's sort of a weird concept because for

960
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,919
people like you know in the real chem

961
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,200
Die Hard fandom like that you know you

962
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,000
don't need to sell them on camd but the

963
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,379
sort of newer generation needs it to

964
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,239
look like cookies to be able to really

965
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,900
get into it

966
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:37,618
well you know to me you know I grew the

967
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:40,380
GMO and chemd in a warehouse in

968
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:42,240
production I both got both of them

969
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,059
tested

970
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,039
and actually the GMO tests higher than

971
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:50,460
it can be if you could believe that you

972
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:53,699
know that the GMO was in 28 you know the

973
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,980
chemd was maybe like 25.

974
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:59,699
and I could take you know both of those

975
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:01,380
buds side by side and I could smoke that

976
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:04,559
GMO

977
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:07,740
and then when I smoke that chemd it

978
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,019
would just rip apart you know the jam um

979
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:12,358
you know the GMO has a little bit more

980
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:14,159
of the cookies a little bit more sativa

981
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:17,818
so it's got a little bit more of an

982
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:21,420
upper and up to it you know where the

983
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:23,759
chemd I mean just I mean that [ __ ] just

984
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,099
rips right through you I mean there

985
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,460
there's no up to it it will just

986
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,838
devastate you so even though the chemd

987
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,260
was

988
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:38,219
um tested lower than the GMO it smoked

989
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:42,420
way stronger you know it was for me uh

990
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:43,219
the the GMO is nice uh it could be a

991
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,260
little

992
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:49,858
unsatisfying for me at times because of

993
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:53,640
the sativa um tip to it uh the seam

994
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:57,358
could be said uh to the chem sister you

995
00:46:53,639 --> 00:47:02,400
know come sister is a very garlicky

996
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:05,519
onion uh very uh chemd Terps same exact

997
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,559
thing but it's more on a sativa and tip

998
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,659
to it and so

999
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:10,199
um it does not give you

1000
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:13,139
um

1001
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:15,838
uh that devastating High yeah I would

1002
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:19,739
describe it more kind of like the GMO is

1003
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:22,318
a little bit upper more sativa uh so

1004
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:24,719
that's why like the G I mean the Kemp's

1005
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:29,159
sister has never really been a real

1006
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:30,959
popular you know popular thing and then

1007
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:34,199
you know getting back you had to ask me

1008
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,760
uh about the chem one two three and four

1009
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:37,379
and

1010
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,900
um yeah I

1011
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:46,019
grew the chem one from an inspector uh

1012
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:48,980
it grew uh

1013
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:51,619
it it grew

1014
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,780
very no

1015
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:56,940
yeah yeah

1016
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:59,519
for me I don't know some people said it

1017
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,440
was nl5 Haze a little bit like I don't

1018
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,980
know to me it was like kind of blandish

1019
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:08,579
like I I didn't really I I didn't really

1020
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:11,880
see anything special about it I didn't I

1021
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:14,039
didn't catch any I don't know I I bred

1022
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,000
to it a couple times and lost it but

1023
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,000
like

1024
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,059
I mean to me it wasn't even like

1025
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,980
smokable head stash for me I thought you

1026
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:30,000
know the two was a little bit more uh

1027
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:34,019
was a little bit nicer uh

1028
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,980
and but still nothing real special you

1029
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:40,980
know it's kind of weird because uh as

1030
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,900
you know as you get to the three you

1031
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:46,800
know I thought the three was probably

1032
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:50,220
better than the one in the two and then

1033
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,920
uh and the three was very similar to the

1034
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,139
four and

1035
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,740
um but

1036
00:48:54,139 --> 00:49:00,179
grew shorter uh and was a little more

1037
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:03,899
citrusy I would say

1038
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:06,719
and but it wasn't really uh

1039
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:10,680
it wasn't really a strong smoker it was

1040
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:12,899
nice I mean and then you had the four so

1041
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:15,299
really out of all of them I thought the

1042
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,660
you know the four was really the best

1043
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:23,280
one out of them all overall uh smoke

1044
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:25,559
best yielded best uh grew the best and

1045
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,740
everything so I'd really want the reason

1046
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:31,139
why really the one two and three aren't

1047
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:34,318
really relevant because

1048
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:36,598
you know they just never you know you

1049
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:39,059
know I don't know there's never was

1050
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,039
really that good and you know when

1051
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:43,980
you're talking about

1052
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:46,440
um you know having you know

1053
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:50,219
a number of different plants you could

1054
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,740
have and uh the space that you have and

1055
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:55,318
everything so you know a lot of that you

1056
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,419
know you take into account where you

1057
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:59,759
know it just doesn't you know it just

1058
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,579
doesn't make it you know it just gets it

1059
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,280
gets cold out and you know you move on

1060
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:08,940
to something else that's better

1061
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,640
so uh but yeah the the three and the

1062
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:15,059
four were definitely the the standouts

1063
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:18,719
out of the one two three four uh the two

1064
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:21,000
you know was better than the one uh the

1065
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:24,358
one you know and both of them and all of

1066
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,539
them were kind of really more uh heavy

1067
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:30,358
Indigo more uh

1068
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:34,318
yeah even like you know I'm trying to

1069
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:39,799
think you know in in a lot different too

1070
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:42,420
from the the 91 the the D and the sister

1071
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:45,060
you know where

1072
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:49,440
you know and it's kind of weird because

1073
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:51,358
you got like the 91 which you know is

1074
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,720
Fury and

1075
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:57,299
skunky but not it's not real super

1076
00:50:54,719 --> 00:51:01,500
chirpy you know it's more kind of got

1077
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:04,559
that blandish Afghan tip to it you know

1078
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,960
with the darker leaves and the dark you

1079
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,240
know even the even the fan leaves and

1080
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,880
stuff you know the sugar leaves are

1081
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:14,939
darker and everything and then you know

1082
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:19,920
you compare that to the the the the the

1083
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:21,659
the you know the skunky uh garlic oniony

1084
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,400
uh

1085
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:29,519
of the of the chem D in a sister and

1086
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,039
then you kind of get into the more Piney

1087
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,940
chemi

1088
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:36,179
um

1089
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:39,059
you know little little you know like a

1090
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:42,659
little citrusy on on the you know the

1091
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:45,240
three and the four and stuff so uh yeah

1092
00:51:42,659 --> 00:51:48,299
it's just interesting that you know the

1093
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:51,679
the different uh profiles that that that

1094
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:54,119
came out of that whole line

1095
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,739
yeah definitely I mean there's a lot

1096
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,900
there's a lot of stuff sort of locked in

1097
00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:01,679
there isn't there what you just said

1098
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:03,240
made me think of something which you

1099
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:04,919
know never popped to mind before but I'd

1100
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,259
love to know if you knew anything on it

1101
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,180
which is there's another guy out there

1102
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:12,240
relatively unknown breeder named

1103
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:14,159
Incognito and he breeds with like chem

1104
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,139
one two three and four I think it's

1105
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:19,799
legit yeah do you know who he is or how

1106
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:23,940
he ties into it yes yes yes yeah no we

1107
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:27,119
we know who he is uh you know we we had

1108
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,700
a little bit of a disagreement uh you

1109
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,940
know some some years back and you know

1110
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:36,179
we don't really talk but uh I know that

1111
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:39,838
that money Mike uh was friends with him

1112
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:43,139
and he did have uh and gave him the chem

1113
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:46,558
three so I know that his cam 3 is

1114
00:52:43,139 --> 00:52:51,118
legitimate now I can't really speak on

1115
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:54,000
his one or two uh chem cuts

1116
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,700
um I know that he had you know he's up

1117
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,858
in Massachusetts

1118
00:52:55,699 --> 00:53:02,039
and I know that he you know had friends

1119
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:04,380
who were friends with you know uh I

1120
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:09,058
think some of the chem family so he's

1121
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:11,700
been able to uh you know Source uh those

1122
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:13,880
genetics through those people but uh as

1123
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:17,399
far as I know he does have you know

1124
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,619
legitimate uh kind of genetics

1125
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,700
Ah that's cool to hear that's cool to

1126
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:22,318
hear

1127
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:24,239
um in your in your prior answer you

1128
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,679
referenced you know like some of them

1129
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,558
weren't really what you'd call head

1130
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,719
stash and it sort of made me wonder what

1131
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,000
to you qualifies as head stash given

1132
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,459
you've got such a superb sort of

1133
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,338
foundation of like what's good weed to

1134
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,780
you and what's not what are the sorts of

1135
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:43,558
things that would make something fall

1136
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:47,460
into the head stash category for you

1137
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:51,000
well you know it's you know it's hard to

1138
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:53,818
say but you know like when I go you know

1139
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,500
for head stash I'm looking for you know

1140
00:53:53,818 --> 00:54:00,058
something that you know I'm looking for

1141
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:03,838
fuel I'm looking for you know chem or OG

1142
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:05,760
or sour you know diesel you know I I

1143
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,799
need something I need something that's

1144
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,319
gonna you know that's gonna you know

1145
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:13,318
that's gonna get me high

1146
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:15,838
um but you know I'm I'm a connoisseur so

1147
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:18,719
I like you know all different you know

1148
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:22,920
sides of the spectrum so you know I like

1149
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:27,899
a really good Haze also you know and so

1150
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:31,500
you know and what really makes it for me

1151
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:35,039
is when I take a hit

1152
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:38,280
off a joint or off a ball or bong or

1153
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:41,460
whatever and I take a really big hit and

1154
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:45,180
I hold it and you know you get that long

1155
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:48,119
expansion you know and you blow that you

1156
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:51,598
blow that hit out and as you're blowing

1157
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:53,760
that hit out you know you you now all of

1158
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,980
a sudden you you know you start to get

1159
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,339
the Head Rush you start to feel the

1160
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:02,760
effects of of that now and I'm just

1161
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:05,779
talking about one hit you know and even

1162
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:10,500
like with a good Haze like I could take

1163
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:14,220
uh a hit off of a really good Haze and

1164
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:17,159
and and and just close my eyes and blow

1165
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:21,000
it out and then feel the effects of the

1166
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:23,519
third eye and the headband and just the

1167
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,699
different you know effects that you feel

1168
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:31,440
inside your head you know and you just

1169
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:34,199
get you know uh a feeling of uh a warm

1170
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,358
fuzzy blanket that that's put over you

1171
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:38,939
you know that's how the chem makes me

1172
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:40,380
feel you know so you know there's a lot

1173
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,500
of different strains that are going to

1174
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:46,619
give you different effects but you know

1175
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:50,460
in the end for me you know I I want to

1176
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:53,700
be able to take one big hit and blow it

1177
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,780
out and then be able to be like whoa

1178
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:57,419
that's

1179
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:00,240
you know that's something and there's

1180
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:02,639
not a lot of strains that can really you

1181
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:05,818
know that really you know hold up to

1182
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:08,098
that test you know so you know um you

1183
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:11,159
know I'm willing to you know try

1184
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:14,460
anything that anything that's good but

1185
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:17,279
you know in in today's you know today's

1186
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,838
world there's not a lot that you know

1187
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,780
that you know

1188
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:24,058
that that that cut it and most of the

1189
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:27,240
stuff that does is really closely

1190
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:31,740
related you know the chems eogs the

1191
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:34,618
sours the hazes you know the the there's

1192
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:38,098
not a lot of different diversity out

1193
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:39,838
there uh sort of speak uh you know and

1194
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:42,720
it depends on what you're you know

1195
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:45,480
smoking for you know I describe what I

1196
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,818
what I smoke for some people are just

1197
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,039
about the flavor you know I'm not one of

1198
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:52,858
these guys that just take a hit and

1199
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:55,558
blows it out quick and you know enjoys

1200
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:57,900
the flavor of it you know like I said

1201
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:00,720
when I take a big hit I'm gonna hold

1202
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:03,059
that I want to feel that lugging lung

1203
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,919
expansion and then I want to you know

1204
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:07,980
blow out a cloud that's going to make me

1205
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:11,400
cough and make and make my head you know

1206
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:13,079
to explode yeah brilliant it's funny as

1207
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,960
you were saying that it made me stop

1208
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:17,579
thinking that feeling you describe you

1209
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,380
know like you take the hit you hold it

1210
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:21,780
and the feeling comes over you and the

1211
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,000
third eye it's almost it's almost like a

1212
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,700
human experience for good weed across

1213
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,440
the board isn't it it's it's funny well

1214
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:30,480
sometimes you know and then sometimes

1215
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:33,300
you know you know you feel that and I

1216
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,460
just with the head but with the really

1217
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,680
good stuff you get the full body effect

1218
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:39,838
so you know I mean the warm fuzzy

1219
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,118
blanket that's what I describe it as so

1220
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:44,099
you know in some streams you'll just get

1221
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:47,160
that strictly head high where you're

1222
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:48,720
just getting that but you know uh so you

1223
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:53,279
know that's really the difference

1224
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:56,578
between you know Indica in sativa and

1225
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,559
for me it has to do with you know the

1226
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:00,359
burning of the cannabinoids and the

1227
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,059
vegetative matter because I don't get

1228
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:04,980
those same effects with hash or any kind

1229
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:07,079
of concentrated or something with the

1230
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:10,019
vegetative matter the burning of the

1231
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:13,980
vegetative matter that just the

1232
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:16,380
combustion of those cannabinoids uh just

1233
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,599
there's just something special about

1234
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:21,180
flower

1235
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,940
for me the effect that I just don't get

1236
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:25,318
that with hash or any type of

1237
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:28,260
concentrate

1238
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:30,838
yeah here I can agree to that

1239
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,359
so I just wanted to quickly take us back

1240
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:34,858
to talk about the KMD for a moment

1241
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,539
because you were talking about it

1242
00:58:34,858 --> 00:58:38,940
earlier and you were referencing the

1243
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:40,858
chemcis and a few other cuts and I guess

1244
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:43,200
what I'm wondering is what's your take

1245
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:45,539
on the situation given there's so many

1246
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:46,919
different chemd cuts going around you

1247
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:49,440
know I think I've seen like three or

1248
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,480
four different ones now and you know

1249
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,019
there's the original one and the

1250
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,480
variegated one and the the chem CIS and

1251
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:59,579
the chem DS1 from Bundy and all that

1252
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,199
where do you how do you lay out the chem

1253
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,599
is there one candy in your mind that's

1254
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:04,980
the real one or how do you view the

1255
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:07,260
situation

1256
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,500
uh there's only been one real one now

1257
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:14,160
it's a variegated one and and I think

1258
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:18,239
what's what what it what's happened uh a

1259
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:21,179
lot is a lot of people are mistaking the

1260
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:23,639
chem sister as the chem d

1261
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:27,659
ude and then yeah and then you get into

1262
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:31,019
the Bundy thing and you know maybe some

1263
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:32,460
other s1s that could come into play

1264
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:34,440
um I could just

1265
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:38,400
um you know speak from personal

1266
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:43,858
experience that we back you know in back

1267
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:47,358
in the day uh popped a chemd S1 and it

1268
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:51,358
was a very very close to the original

1269
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:55,199
but a little sweeter we called it the

1270
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:58,500
chem D3 or something like that

1271
00:59:55,199 --> 01:00:01,318
um we had that around for a little while

1272
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,239
um but we uh but we let that go

1273
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:06,239
eventually

1274
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:10,618
um but so really my point is is really

1275
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:15,719
like you know um anyone can really find

1276
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:19,740
um that type of Fino in in an S1 you

1277
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:22,739
know in in a chem dog it's C chemd seeds

1278
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:24,659
so you know depending on the situation

1279
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:26,479
you know if it you know if it's

1280
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:31,019
self-harmed or whatever

1281
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:34,260
uh so uh yeah I mean so all of that kind

1282
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:37,139
of muddies the water a little bit and uh

1283
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,819
so unless you unless you you know unless

1284
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:41,578
you don't know what the original is

1285
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:45,358
you're not gonna know and yeah it is

1286
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:48,200
some type of chem dog or whatever but uh

1287
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:52,619
yeah the other you know the the original

1288
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:55,980
D you know uh grows a certain way it

1289
01:00:52,619 --> 01:01:00,420
grows kind of uh medium to sure it's not

1290
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:04,679
really stretchy uh in sativa like like

1291
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:06,480
the like the um 91 grows and the sister

1292
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:10,078
so

1293
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,940
um yeah so you know it's really trying

1294
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,579
to really know the real uh

1295
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:17,039
characteristics of you know of the real

1296
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:19,200
thing and compared to what you have so

1297
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,358
it's you know kind of hard to say you

1298
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:23,159
know

1299
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:26,338
the same thing with you know with a lot

1300
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:28,139
of the strains now the ogs the sours and

1301
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:30,900
now it's starting with the chems where

1302
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:34,379
you know there's just so many different

1303
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:38,460
names and a lot of them are the same

1304
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:38,460
thing but just mislabeled

1305
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:44,460
yeah hugely hugely

1306
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:46,618
it it made me one day a lot of people

1307
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:49,559
these days have been running a lot of

1308
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:51,000
s1s of both the 91 and the D and I think

1309
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:53,339
that's probably because they're now sort

1310
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,260
of more available to people but a lot of

1311
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:57,599
coolfinos popping their heads out and as

1312
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:59,460
you've referenced a few times now some

1313
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,500
sort of more fruity ones coming out of

1314
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,699
those seeds which to me was quite

1315
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,780
surprising you know I guess I never

1316
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:06,239
really thought there was a lot of

1317
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:08,819
fruitiness inside the cam have you ever

1318
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,858
popped any bag seeds or s1s and found

1319
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:12,298
something like just really that blew you

1320
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:14,880
away where you were like I did not

1321
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:17,579
expect to find this in these seeds

1322
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,640
yeah actually we find kind of like a

1323
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:23,039
maple and there's like a maple type of

1324
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:26,400
uh Chino that comes out of some of the

1325
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:29,460
star dog stuff and I've seen some of it

1326
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:33,539
come out of uh some of the chemd stuff

1327
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:38,059
too and it's more of an astringent kind

1328
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:41,880
of an Afghan eye you know I would think

1329
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:43,280
uh but you know that terp is uh very

1330
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:47,818
distinguishable

1331
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:51,000
and uh yeah it does come out

1332
01:02:47,818 --> 01:02:52,920
um the maple stuff but uh the fruity

1333
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,679
stuff we haven't you know I haven't

1334
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:59,159
really gotten

1335
01:02:54,679 --> 01:03:01,199
no not much fruit add out of out of out

1336
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:04,639
of the comes out of out of the stuff

1337
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:08,219
that you know that we've run uh

1338
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:11,639
yeah uh he has more than that Maple the

1339
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:14,219
maple stuff is you know uh and like I

1340
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:18,719
said it's more of a real kind of an

1341
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:21,118
Afghan I feel type of uh terp yeah

1342
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,159
that's so very very interesting I guess

1343
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,619
you know time will tell and I think I

1344
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:27,899
should maybe clarify when I say fruity I

1345
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:29,220
think the reports I had read were sort

1346
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,039
of like

1347
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:33,838
um maybe sort of near that guava end of

1348
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:36,058
things like sort of uh what did they say

1349
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:38,519
uh like grapefruit so I guess like you

1350
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:41,519
know it's a bit of bitterness slash not

1351
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:43,920
like the most yeah well we found some

1352
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:46,079
kind of a little Citrus like like I said

1353
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,720
we found a little bit of Citra there was

1354
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,660
a little bit of citrus in the threes

1355
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:53,578
so you know I I would think that's

1356
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:55,679
probably what you know they were

1357
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,960
referring that you're referring to is

1358
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:59,940
kind of like a little citrusiness yeah

1359
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,099
that explains it perfectly

1360
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:04,079
there's been one question that I've been

1361
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:05,579
wanting to ask you for like six or seven

1362
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,519
years now because it's just so

1363
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:09,900
conflicting all over the internet but

1364
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:12,059
um basically I was wondering if you

1365
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,980
could give us the back story on the day

1366
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:16,619
wrecker because everything I had read

1367
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:18,838
about it said that it was basically gone

1368
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:21,180
but you still see people saying you know

1369
01:04:18,838 --> 01:04:23,400
I've crossed this to the day wrecker and

1370
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:27,480
I'm like isn't it gone

1371
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:31,019
well you know referring back to my

1372
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,760
original post on the internet on on

1373
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:38,280
overgrow

1374
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:43,440
I had referred to the chem 91

1375
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:45,839
you know uh as uh the original diesel

1376
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,179
which which it was you know it was

1377
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:51,000
called the diesel originally you know

1378
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:53,818
that you know so we not we never called

1379
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,798
it original diesel it was just called

1380
01:04:53,818 --> 01:04:58,380
diesel people like yo you got that

1381
01:04:55,798 --> 01:05:01,500
diesel [ __ ] you know so you know that's

1382
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:06,140
how that really first came about you

1383
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:09,179
know and uh and really uh

1384
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:12,719
the uh

1385
01:05:09,179 --> 01:05:15,659
the the underdog you know and so I had

1386
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:17,879
which I had referenced previously you

1387
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:20,460
know people would be like yeah that you

1388
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:24,358
know the underdog which was the Super

1389
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:26,940
Skunk NL times 91 and people used to

1390
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:28,679
refer to that as the day record they'd

1391
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,720
be like yeah that [ __ ] wrecked my day

1392
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:34,199
you have more of that day wrecker [ __ ]

1393
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:39,358
you know so I referenced that as as that

1394
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:41,639
you know and so uh and that in in all of

1395
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:44,460
these other little names that I had you

1396
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:46,618
know the the day record and the headband

1397
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,420
and the headband was another one be like

1398
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:50,460
yeah you know that [ __ ] gave me a

1399
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,838
half-ass mode that got a headband thing

1400
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:55,318
you know like you know we're talking

1401
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:57,179
about the third eye and whatnot so all

1402
01:05:55,318 --> 01:06:00,420
of these things were all referenced to

1403
01:05:57,179 --> 01:06:04,199
the cam so when I made that original

1404
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:07,680
post I named all of those all of those

1405
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:10,259
names I named the headband all that

1406
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,838
stuff and what happened was that people

1407
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:16,200
just kind of picked up on those catch

1408
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:18,119
names on the internet and and being like

1409
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:21,598
you know they might have found some kind

1410
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:23,579
of S1 or got some kind of diesel that

1411
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,039
they didn't know what it was or whatever

1412
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:28,798
and they just came up with oh we'll call

1413
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:31,920
it the headband or we'll call it you

1414
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:34,460
know Underdog or you know and so like

1415
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:38,159
all these names have kind of been like

1416
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:40,139
hijacked from the original

1417
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,779
yeah I guess it makes sense you know

1418
01:06:40,139 --> 01:06:44,940
people just either knowingly or

1419
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:47,700
unknowingly he's using the inappropriate

1420
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:49,858
names so with that being said then when

1421
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:51,480
people talk about original diesel or

1422
01:06:49,858 --> 01:06:55,019
diesel and they talk about like you know

1423
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:57,000
the DNL nl5 Haze sort of components to

1424
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:58,619
all that do you think there's maybe less

1425
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,239
truth to that than what the internet

1426
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:01,980
maybe makes out at times do you think

1427
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:04,078
it's maybe all just cam or do you think

1428
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:06,179
it's it's just so convoluted it's hard

1429
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,359
to track it all

1430
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:13,159
yeah uh I don't know it's kind of hard

1431
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:16,558
to tell you you know uh

1432
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:19,199
it's yeah I mean because people have

1433
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:21,960
just just changed you know

1434
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:24,179
people just you know because back in the

1435
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:28,019
in back in those early days like names

1436
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:31,139
weren't really you know as big as they

1437
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:33,420
are now yeah I mean so like like we just

1438
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:37,558
kind of you know that's kind of like how

1439
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:40,139
the pith and all these other Haze type

1440
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:42,780
of church and you know these were just

1441
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:44,818
all kind of the crippy Israel kind of

1442
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:48,240
just catch names you know back in the

1443
01:07:44,818 --> 01:07:49,818
day you know so you know they weren't

1444
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:53,759
really

1445
01:07:49,818 --> 01:07:56,699
anything specific you know some things

1446
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:59,760
were but like uh some things were just

1447
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:01,500
kind of like catch names so people just

1448
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,140
kind of just

1449
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:06,260
you know they just you just you know

1450
01:08:04,139 --> 01:08:09,000
they just kind of you know someone just

1451
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:11,640
made up made you know thought that you

1452
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,739
know we'll name it this to sell it you

1453
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:16,798
know and that's what happens too is like

1454
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:18,358
people would change the name of the

1455
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:22,439
product

1456
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:24,600
because they couldn't sell it under the

1457
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:26,579
original name for whatever reason

1458
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,960
because they were given a clone and they

1459
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:29,640
weren't supposed to get it so they

1460
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,039
couldn't call it

1461
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:35,539
oh gee Christie Cole had to call it

1462
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:39,060
Underdog or or you know so that you know

1463
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:42,420
a lot of the names have been changed for

1464
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:45,900
a lot of different reasons you know so

1465
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:48,539
um and a lot of it has to do with just

1466
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:51,719
making money really

1467
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:53,278
yeah yeah I can understand that and the

1468
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:56,359
other thing is so the other thing is too

1469
01:08:53,279 --> 01:09:00,779
like if I if you if you never have seen

1470
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:04,560
uh a certain strain and if you've never

1471
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:07,920
seen Underdog or or or whatever and I

1472
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,440
and I and I tell you it is this you know

1473
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,960
you think you know you gotta think it is

1474
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:16,079
because you don't know the difference

1475
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:18,539
and so you know so you go thinking it's

1476
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:21,059
the real deal and now you're spreading

1477
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:23,278
that as gospel and because that's the

1478
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,259
only thing that you know and so that's

1479
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,600
kind of how these things get started and

1480
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:30,238
then then it just kind of gets a life of

1481
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,400
its own and it kind of just overtakes

1482
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,500
the original

1483
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:37,979
story I guess

1484
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,500
yeah certainly certainly I mean yeah

1485
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:43,019
that happens with a lot of things right

1486
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:45,298
so if we get back to sort of the the

1487
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:47,819
timeline that you were traveling on in

1488
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:49,619
your whole journey when you started to

1489
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:51,420
develop you know you referenced earlier

1490
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:52,500
that you wanted to make a mail and you

1491
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,298
were like well I'm going to use the

1492
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,340
stronger stuff I have which is the chem

1493
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:58,979
when you started doing all of that was

1494
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:00,779
that with the long-term goal of wanting

1495
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:03,319
to breed or was it more of just like a

1496
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,319
fun project

1497
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:08,759
no for me it was just about preservation

1498
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:11,039
because you know I would you know back

1499
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:14,100
then it was hard to get clones so when

1500
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:15,899
you got a clone it was you know and and

1501
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,539
if you lost it you never knew if you can

1502
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:21,179
get it back so you know my theory was

1503
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:25,019
well I'm getting all of these clone only

1504
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:27,779
strains I gotta try to make some kind of

1505
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:30,719
representation and see form for for

1506
01:10:27,779 --> 01:10:34,738
preservation you know even if I get like

1507
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:37,380
70 70 to 80 percent of the original of

1508
01:10:34,738 --> 01:10:40,439
the original thing and I I consider that

1509
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:42,600
a home run so that was really what you

1510
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:45,238
know my thought process was really just

1511
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,940
about preservation in case we lost the

1512
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:50,879
camera the shower or whatever it was at

1513
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:55,019
least I'd have some type of uh seed

1514
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,880
stock to fall back on in in in use

1515
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,699
because otherwise it would be gone

1516
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,039
completely

1517
01:10:58,698 --> 01:11:06,000
yeah sure understandable

1518
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:09,000
so at what point did Top Dog officially

1519
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:14,119
become a brand

1520
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:20,158
um I think well I had been selling seeds

1521
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:21,899
on Ice she mag but not under the top I'm

1522
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:25,979
not sure I I

1523
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:30,420
don't know if I yeah I don't think I

1524
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:36,000
really officially made the brand until I

1525
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:38,520
crossed over until into uh THC form or

1526
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,800
you know because because I up at to that

1527
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,699
point you know I had

1528
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,600
um

1529
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:48,419
I I I was selling some seeds on

1530
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,460
um seed Bay that's how I first started

1531
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,260
selling seeds was on seed Bay and that

1532
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:53,100
was just for

1533
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,679
um

1534
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:57,860
that was just for seed credit you know

1535
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:01,079
they wanted all your banking information

1536
01:11:57,859 --> 01:12:03,539
and wanted to do a bank transfer and

1537
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:06,420
back then that was just like are you

1538
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:08,939
crazy you know what I mean so I was just

1539
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:13,199
like all right I'll start selling seeds

1540
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:15,479
and you know we'll see how it goes and

1541
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,579
um you know I'll build up you know some

1542
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:21,238
money some seed credit and I'll just buy

1543
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:22,979
a whole bunch of packs on on seed bad

1544
01:12:21,238 --> 01:12:24,718
you know that was you know so that's

1545
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:26,339
what I did at first so I wound up

1546
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,819
getting all the all these different

1547
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:32,039
stuff I I got you know I forget I had

1548
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:34,259
you know like a thousand dollars worth

1549
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:36,479
of you know credit or two thousand

1550
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:39,060
something like that and so like wow this

1551
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:39,959
is you know a lot and so

1552
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:43,080
um

1553
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,380
so really what started to happen in over

1554
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:49,920
at the icmag was that's when RES was

1555
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:53,699
really in his prime and you know he was

1556
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:56,100
you know doing his sour crosses and at

1557
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:58,079
that time you know he was just he was

1558
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:00,120
just rolling over everyone you know

1559
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:03,238
stepping on everyone's toes like he

1560
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:05,158
wound up getting the chem D and at first

1561
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:08,099
you know he said he wasn't going to

1562
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:11,819
breed with it and then and then it

1563
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:15,600
turned into a charity auction and then

1564
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:19,079
he was going to give give Greg a Rolex

1565
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:21,840
for compensation it just went from one

1566
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:26,579
thing to another and just evolved into

1567
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:29,699
where he [ __ ] them you know so uh what

1568
01:13:26,579 --> 01:13:33,420
what was happening was he was making icy

1569
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:35,039
mag and Gypsy so much money like you

1570
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:38,039
know he I mean these guys are doing

1571
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:41,640
drops and making like 50 Grand in the

1572
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:44,340
drop and 100 Grammy doing stupid numbers

1573
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,260
I mean and you know when he was you know

1574
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:48,840
starting to do all this he was getting

1575
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:51,900
called out I was calling them out other

1576
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:54,600
people were calling them out and so I

1577
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:59,039
really reached the point where we became

1578
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:01,980
you know a detrimental you know a threat

1579
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:04,800
and so they just kind of muted us and

1580
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:07,678
they you know wound up uh deleting us

1581
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:10,679
and all of this stuff and they banned

1582
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:14,460
yeah they wound up Banning me and

1583
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:17,219
deleted my account so I went over to THC

1584
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:21,779
former and

1585
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:24,719
um that's where uh the the the the top

1586
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:27,479
dog uh brand was really long

1587
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:31,198
officially I guess you could say where I

1588
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:34,979
was actually getting getting money

1589
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:35,939
getting paid for you know the the seats

1590
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:38,879
that

1591
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:41,399
um that I was selling you know and you

1592
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,900
know and eventually you know logic you

1593
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:46,559
know because that you know I mean he had

1594
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:49,198
everyone over there he had OG Rascal and

1595
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,380
just I mean everyone from back in the

1596
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:55,979
day because everyone left RC Megan

1597
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:58,800
he he you know he had a he had everyone

1598
01:14:55,979 --> 01:15:01,559
over there and he just wound up [ __ ]

1599
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:06,179
everyone you know he [ __ ] me he [ __ ]

1600
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:08,640
everyone and uh yeah the guy is just you

1601
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:10,560
know even to this day I think he's just

1602
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,840
doing the same thing just scamming

1603
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:15,960
people just trying to get newbie

1604
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:19,020
breeders on there get trying to get them

1605
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,658
to send him seeds and then he never paid

1606
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:23,760
in and he never pays you and that's

1607
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:26,158
basically how it used to work you'd have

1608
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,920
to sell your you know send the seeds up

1609
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:31,198
front and then they would sell them and

1610
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:35,219
then they would send you the money and

1611
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:39,839
so uh I wound up going to Spain and

1612
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:41,819
getting cash from uh logic in person one

1613
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,659
time and

1614
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:46,079
um

1615
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:50,219
yeah and then after that he just you

1616
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:52,979
know he just [ __ ] me so uh but by that

1617
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:56,779
time uh

1618
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:59,639
that's you know kind of like

1619
01:15:56,779 --> 01:16:01,738
when you know I guess that's like kind

1620
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,920
of like the early beginnings of

1621
01:16:01,738 --> 01:16:06,059
Instagram by that point I believe you

1622
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,239
know and

1623
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:12,000
uh yeah yeah what an interesting

1624
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:13,919
progression it all took and that sort of

1625
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,219
makes sense to me now because I remember

1626
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,899
being on I see mag and you see some big

1627
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:20,640
name people are banned and I'm like how

1628
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:22,319
did this person end up getting banned

1629
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,360
but I guess it's as you said you know

1630
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,299
sort of a bit of shady stuff on the back

1631
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:29,698
end of it or

1632
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:32,219
yeah well he anyone I mean if you you

1633
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:35,279
know if you wind up calling any you know

1634
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:38,279
Rez out or you know they just saw that

1635
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:39,599
saw that as a threat for them to their

1636
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:42,179
money you know because that was their

1637
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:45,480
Cash Cow so they had to protect him so

1638
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:48,119
you want I mean all you know yeah that

1639
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:52,259
all kind of backfired on all of them in

1640
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:54,840
the end so yeah interesting stuff what

1641
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:57,140
I've always found interesting is the

1642
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:00,719
sort of parallels between

1643
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:02,820
yours and res dogs chem D lines how you

1644
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,039
both kind of use the Afghan mail

1645
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:07,079
initially obviously he used the Hindu

1646
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:09,119
course you use the Afghani number one

1647
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:11,519
but they're generally speaking you know

1648
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:12,658
sort of from a similar general area of

1649
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,060
the world

1650
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:17,099
do you think that the Afghan one paired

1651
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:19,199
better with the chemd than the Hindu

1652
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:22,199
Kush

1653
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:25,500
yeah well he you know I was the first

1654
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:28,198
one to to get the candy you know and

1655
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:31,679
breed with it you know so I I had that

1656
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:34,500
you know going for me you know so you

1657
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:37,980
know he had to copy he had to try to

1658
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:42,539
copy me somehow but the the Hindu curse

1659
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:45,178
that I grew was very leafy the the you

1660
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:48,658
know I thought this uh the plant itself

1661
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:51,600
was more in had more uh sachiva in it

1662
01:17:48,658 --> 01:17:56,279
because it was thin leaves it kind of

1663
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,840
grew more stretchy and leafy and it I

1664
01:17:56,279 --> 01:18:00,840
didn't like the structure of the plant

1665
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,600
it was more floppy you know a thinner

1666
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,900
stemmed and everything and I thought

1667
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:10,280
that it didn't smoke as well either you

1668
01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:14,039
know the um the Afghan kind of had a

1669
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:17,639
mediciney kind of piney uh tip to it the

1670
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:19,500
Afghan one and a thicker stem and

1671
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:22,800
thicker Buds and everything about

1672
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:24,539
structure so I thought overall that you

1673
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,520
know that plant was the better plant to

1674
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:29,579
use

1675
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:32,820
yeah certainly certainly

1676
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:36,059
and I guess as just a sort of a general

1677
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:38,698
one how do you feel given you know res

1678
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:40,980
has returned to the scene and um is

1679
01:18:38,698 --> 01:18:44,339
looking slash in the process of

1680
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:45,779
releasing new seeds

1681
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:49,380
um yeah it's kind of funny because he's

1682
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:52,079
using my uh Afghan I mean African Haze

1683
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:54,840
you know and you know he had you know

1684
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:57,079
some good things to say about me in the

1685
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:00,600
very beginning of his return how he

1686
01:18:57,079 --> 01:19:03,600
admired me and Cornbread Ricky and a few

1687
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:07,739
other people but you know after I kind

1688
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:11,159
of spoke out uh uh over a couple of

1689
01:19:07,738 --> 01:19:14,639
things she kind of you know uh withdraw

1690
01:19:11,158 --> 01:19:16,219
withdrew those uh you know those claims

1691
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,920
but uh

1692
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:22,500
yeah I mean you know uh you know the the

1693
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:25,739
the the paperwork kind of speaks for

1694
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:29,819
itself I think it was Sun grown mids

1695
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:31,459
that um that published all of the Court

1696
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:36,599
documentation

1697
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:40,260
uh which shows that res dog was a Queen

1698
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:42,120
for a Day and for what people but if

1699
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:45,900
people don't know what that means that

1700
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:48,238
means that you get to go in and spill

1701
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:50,759
the beans on everything that you know

1702
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:53,158
and none of that stuff will be held

1703
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:56,880
against you just as long as you don't

1704
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:59,219
lie about what you're telling so you

1705
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:01,739
know they they had the the scene in

1706
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:05,100
Goodfellas when the guy goes in and he

1707
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:08,459
was the Queen for a Day and you go in

1708
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:12,420
and you you tell him everything and what

1709
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:14,698
they hope to do is you you collaborate

1710
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:17,219
the stuff that they know

1711
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:19,919
and you tell and then you tell them

1712
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:21,779
stuff that they don't know because you

1713
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,880
don't know what they don't what they

1714
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:25,800
know and what they don't know so when

1715
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:28,199
you go in there and spill your guts

1716
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,900
you're basically going there and telling

1717
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:33,539
everything every exact thing that you

1718
01:20:30,899 --> 01:20:36,779
did and everything that you know and

1719
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:40,738
implicate other people and so on and so

1720
01:20:36,779 --> 01:20:44,519
forth so that's what that is and so you

1721
01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:48,238
know there's people that say that

1722
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:52,440
um you know that the the story that I

1723
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:55,939
got was that um Dutch grown was going to

1724
01:20:52,439 --> 01:21:00,238
be bringing a shipment of seeds back to

1725
01:20:55,939 --> 01:21:03,059
uh England and got caught in um in

1726
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:06,238
Massachusetts at the airport and

1727
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:08,219
supposedly someone routed them out and

1728
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:11,099
the Customs was looking for them when

1729
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:14,760
they made you know went through there so

1730
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:20,159
uh I guess at that point you know she is

1731
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:23,219
supposedly was an an ex law enforcement

1732
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:27,539
uh person and I guess that she spilled

1733
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:29,158
her guts and led them back to Res and he

1734
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:32,060
spilled his guy you know everyone just

1735
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:35,879
routed on rolled on everyone in the end

1736
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:39,239
and you know uh so you know the the

1737
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:41,219
paperwork you know clear clearly shows

1738
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:41,939
that so

1739
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:47,000
um

1740
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:50,759
yeah so I mean you know uh you know it

1741
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:54,539
kind of just goes to show you know you

1742
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:57,300
know the people still support him and in

1743
01:21:54,539 --> 01:22:00,359
this day and age of Instagram I don't

1744
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:05,279
think there's really anything that you

1745
01:22:00,359 --> 01:22:07,500
can really say or do and you know then

1746
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:09,000
people were still you're still going to

1747
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:12,238
get people that they're going to support

1748
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,880
you you know so no matter how low you go

1749
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:16,859
you know if you're gonna you know if

1750
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,100
you're gonna copy someone and rip off

1751
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:24,658
their genetics or if you're a known rat

1752
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:28,199
or or or whatever you know I I I don't

1753
01:22:24,658 --> 01:22:30,179
know how how low the bar goes to where

1754
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:34,139
you know it reaches the point where

1755
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:36,060
people are gonna support you so I mean I

1756
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:39,780
mean that's just the way that it goes on

1757
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:44,580
you know and uh on Instagram uh no

1758
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:46,500
matter uh who you are or what you do you

1759
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:48,359
know there's always people are going to

1760
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:51,359
hate on you and there's always people

1761
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:54,119
that are going to support you so

1762
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:57,179
um you know it depends on you know uh

1763
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:59,279
your character and you know how you want

1764
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:03,060
to conduct yourself and perceive

1765
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:06,119
yourself so I mean I've always been you

1766
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:11,400
know up front in in everything that I I

1767
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:12,738
do and open and transparent you know and

1768
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:16,619
so uh

1769
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:18,839
no one can really say you know anything

1770
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:22,800
but the truth

1771
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:25,140
yeah certainly I think there was some um

1772
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,940
some screenshots maybe just one or two

1773
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:29,100
of the paperwork that have existed for

1774
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:31,979
some time and they they look pretty bad

1775
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:33,840
but they sort of existed in isolation so

1776
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:36,178
as you said yeah when sun grow mids

1777
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,159
posted all of the documentation it was a

1778
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:39,779
much more interesting and longer sort of

1779
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:41,339
read and it sort of painted a more clear

1780
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:44,340
picture didn't it

1781
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:46,980
I guess if we sort of just jump back to

1782
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:48,480
the chem d one of the questions I've

1783
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:51,899
been wanting to ask you for a number of

1784
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:54,539
years is what were the reasons you chose

1785
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:55,859
to work with the chemd as opposed to the

1786
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:59,279
91.

1787
01:23:55,859 --> 01:24:02,399
I didn't have the 91 at the time uh well

1788
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:04,259
I only had the the the uh chemd so that

1789
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:07,979
was like the best thing that you know we

1790
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:11,760
had at the time uh at that time uh even

1791
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:14,218
Greg lost the 91. so I mean at that time

1792
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,400
I think skunk VA was the only one that

1793
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:19,920
had it and so that didn't really

1794
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:22,139
resurface until you know a few years

1795
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:25,859
later until you know everyone kind of

1796
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:28,739
got connected on on the internet

1797
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:31,559
okay yeah that makes sense I've noticed

1798
01:24:28,738 --> 01:24:33,119
that chem people tend to fall into like

1799
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,840
one of two camps of like they're either

1800
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:38,399
Die Hard 91 or die hard chemd and you

1801
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,319
know I like them both I see the merits

1802
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:41,939
to both of them I think you know D is

1803
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:44,639
probably a lot better commercially and

1804
01:24:41,939 --> 01:24:46,319
probably you know applicable to a wider

1805
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,060
number of people

1806
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:51,299
um but I'm interested where do you fall

1807
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:54,360
are you die hard chem 91 or chemd

1808
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:57,480
uh Kennedy for sure you know the chemd

1809
01:24:54,359 --> 01:25:01,979
just has that way more stronger effect

1810
01:24:57,479 --> 01:25:05,399
for me uh it's way more terpier uh the

1811
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:09,119
91 is nice don't get me wrong uh I think

1812
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:11,819
it falls a little short on um on

1813
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:14,640
strength and it's definitely you know

1814
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:19,139
doesn't really have uh that same

1815
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:21,360
um taste and stuff to it you know it's a

1816
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:23,579
little more blandish more kind of

1817
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:26,219
Afghani you know where you just kind of

1818
01:25:23,579 --> 01:25:29,158
got that little Blandy you know it's

1819
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:33,719
kind of like a skunky cheminess but

1820
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:35,639
there's not a real over over terp file

1821
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:39,380
on that so

1822
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:42,900
um it's still uh smokes really strong

1823
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:46,380
you know so uh you know it's definitely

1824
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:49,859
uh it comes in probably it definitely

1825
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:53,960
comes in second and and all the chems uh

1826
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:58,319
you know I would read them chemd uh 91

1827
01:25:53,960 --> 01:26:00,779
uh chem four sister is how I would rate

1828
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:02,579
him and then the three probably and then

1829
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:05,639
going down the rest of the line but

1830
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:07,679
that's just me personally yeah no good

1831
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:10,380
answer good answer

1832
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:13,139
so I read some old Forum posts and what

1833
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:14,819
I sort of realized from them was that in

1834
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:16,319
the early days there was actually like a

1835
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:18,299
lot of people posting that they wanted

1836
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:20,158
your genetics but I think like there was

1837
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:21,840
only a limited number of packs sort of

1838
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:24,299
available through the sites you were

1839
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,860
referencing earlier and then there seems

1840
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:28,380
to sort of be this shift at some point

1841
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:30,059
where like the availability went up and

1842
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:31,440
it made me wonder was that sort of like

1843
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:35,039
the point when you were like I'm gonna

1844
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:39,238
do this full time or was it coincidental

1845
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:41,760
well you know early on uh

1846
01:26:39,238 --> 01:26:44,158
yeah I mean

1847
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,380
I'm trying to think you know really I

1848
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:49,379
didn't really probably start getting you

1849
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:51,020
know gaining traction until

1850
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:52,940
you know

1851
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:56,040
2009

1852
01:26:52,939 --> 01:27:00,419
2010 you know that's about when you know

1853
01:26:56,039 --> 01:27:04,800
Kyle Cushman won that one one that uh

1854
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:08,880

1855
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:13,500

and

1859
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:23,698
um yeah so really you know by that time

1860
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:26,400

1861
01:27:23,698 --> 01:27:30,359
to you know started to get popular and I

1862
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:33,359
was like very you know 2010 2011. now

1863
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:35,698
that was really when the star dog really

1864
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:39,000
started to gain traction after that

1865
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:42,178
after that uh well it had gotten written

1866
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,399
up on high times and then you know it

1867
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:47,100
had won the cup and so that's really

1868
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:49,799
when it really started you know gaining

1869
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:53,280
traction and stuff so

1870
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,960
um yeah so really really what happened

1871
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:57,059
you know so I you know that's when I

1872
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,100
really started you know decided to

1873
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:01,199
really you know um

1874
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:05,100
you know start exploring get you know

1875
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:07,559
kind of you know kind of uh put my toe

1876
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:10,380
in the water so to speak you know we did

1877
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,960
that first High Times thing but we

1878
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:14,279
didn't sell any seeds you know we we

1879
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,560
weren't

1880
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:18,779
you know we were really green at the

1881
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,280
time so we were kind of

1882
01:28:18,779 --> 01:28:22,859
you know we didn't know what we were

1883
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:24,380
getting into we really had to like you

1884
01:28:22,859 --> 01:28:28,079
know uh

1885
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:30,000
survey the [ __ ] situation and seeing

1886
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:33,899
what other people were doing and what we

1887
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:37,139
can get away with and everything so

1888
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:39,899
um yeah so we we came to Denver in 2011

1889
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:43,020
and a lot of people came up to us and

1890
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:45,000
wanted to buy seeds and you know we were

1891
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:46,860
just kind of like overwhelmed and being

1892
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:51,179
like yeah this you know can really you

1893
01:28:46,859 --> 01:28:54,420
know be something and so uh we uh you

1894
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:58,260
know we did the so we did the show the

1895
01:28:54,420 --> 01:29:02,279
next year 2012 and then we started

1896
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:05,400
selling seeds you know at the shows and

1897
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:07,198
you know by that time you know and

1898
01:29:05,399 --> 01:29:11,179
that's pretty you know pretty you know

1899
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:15,839
and that's really uh kind of coincides

1900
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:16,739
with uh you know the internet thing and

1901
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,619
um

1902
01:29:16,738 --> 01:29:22,500
because we you know we were over at THC

1903
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:24,539
former and then there was another site

1904
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,399
that and then and then there was a bunch

1905
01:29:24,539 --> 01:29:29,880
of other sites that started popping up

1906
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:30,839
at that same time uh for

1907
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,060
um

1908
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:38,100
I'm trying to think of the other one we

1909
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:40,440
were on uh it was uh can't

1910
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:43,500
a collective I think the account of

1911
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:47,419
collective so I you know uh yeah I was

1912
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:50,460
having trouble with with DJ uh with uh

1913
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:52,440
logic and then so I went and then I

1914
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:54,619
started going over to Canada Collective

1915
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:59,819
and that was right around

1916
01:29:54,619 --> 01:30:05,279
2012 and I wound up going to Amsterdam

1917
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:09,359
in 2012 and meeting uh meeting a bunch

1918
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:12,300
of people out there and and you know um

1919
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:14,880
and so that you know uh but what

1920
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:17,940
happened was in um

1921
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,940
in 2013

1922
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:27,659
yeah I think it yeah it was in 2013 I

1923
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:28,979
wound up uh getting uh arrested uh

1924
01:30:27,658 --> 01:30:33,779
driving

1925
01:30:28,979 --> 01:30:36,718
uh coming back from my grow house and

1926
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:40,019
um what happened was I was up up at the

1927
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:42,179
house it was I was uh Memorial Day

1928
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:46,139
weekend

1929
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:48,420
in the septic system was broken one of

1930
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:51,420
the pipes got clogged

1931
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:54,179
so you know I couldn't use a shower or

1932
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:56,639
the water or anything like that so I was

1933
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:59,158
up there cutting and usually you know I

1934
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:01,980
would cut and then take a shower change

1935
01:30:59,158 --> 01:31:05,099
my clothes and you know go home

1936
01:31:01,979 --> 01:31:09,178
so I couldn't take a shower so I washed

1937
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:12,239
up and I changed my clothes and I drew I

1938
01:31:09,179 --> 01:31:15,300
was driving home and

1939
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:17,939
you know I had maybe like a a gram or

1940
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:19,560
two of flour on me and a little pipe you

1941
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:23,759
know I never traveled with a lot of

1942
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:25,679
stuff and so I'm driving and not paying

1943
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,320
attention and I'm going down the hill

1944
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:31,440
and I'm doing 82 and the speed limit is

1945
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:33,779
65. I'm going down the hill and then it

1946
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:36,238
goes up the hill and so at the top of

1947
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:38,519
that Hill there was a cop underneath the

1948
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:41,039
bridge and he was shooting radar going

1949
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:43,080
down the hill now so as soon as I

1950
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:45,539
started going down and then I started

1951
01:31:43,079 --> 01:31:48,779
going up he got me and I knew that he

1952
01:31:45,539 --> 01:31:51,658
got me so when I passed him he pulled

1953
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:53,039
[ __ ] out and he pulled me over you

1954
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:54,899
know and then I rolled down the window

1955
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:57,658
the first thing he said he smelled

1956
01:31:54,899 --> 01:32:00,359
marijuana and if I had marijuana in the

1957
01:31:57,658 --> 01:32:02,460
car you know and so I knew like you know

1958
01:32:00,359 --> 01:32:05,880
I was in trouble at that point you know

1959
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:08,698
so he rips me out of the car searches

1960
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:11,579
the car and there's an empty uh

1961
01:32:08,698 --> 01:32:13,619
fertilizer bottle in my trunk and then

1962
01:32:11,579 --> 01:32:16,619
they start asking about where am I

1963
01:32:13,619 --> 01:32:18,359
coming from you know and if I don't and

1964
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:20,639
then they start asking me about growing

1965
01:32:18,359 --> 01:32:23,759
weed this and that you know these are in

1966
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:25,440
the New Jersey state troopers you know I

1967
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,840
told them I was coming from New York

1968
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:30,178
State fishing I had my fishing gear with

1969
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:33,179

1970
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:36,179

1972
01:32:36,179 --> 01:32:41,039
was in [ __ ] I was in I was in danger

1973
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:43,380
and the only thing that they had to do

1974
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:46,198
was call the New York state troopers and

1975
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:48,600
be like yeah run this guy's name they

1976
01:32:46,198 --> 01:32:50,599
would have ran my name and saw my name

1977
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:53,340
would have popped up on the utilities

1978
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:55,320
you know I you know all the bills were

1979
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:57,779
in my name so they would have saw that

1980
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:59,399
you know I had an electric bill they

1981
01:32:57,779 --> 01:33:02,819
would have taken a look at the electric

1982
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:05,219
bill and seeing that I had high usage so

1983
01:33:02,819 --> 01:33:07,559
it had been one foot one red flag after

1984
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:09,359
another red flag after another red flag

1985
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:11,100
they were they would have saw that they

1986
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:13,500
would have sent someone up to the house

1987
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:16,380
to do a walk around round to do some

1988
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:19,619
type of investigation so I I had this

1989
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:22,500
all premeditated so after that you know

1990

2030
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:10,320

2031

01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:27,539
his landlord and I was able to rent uh I

2037
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:31,920
had a house for rent that I was able to

2038
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:33,479
grow in and so you know I decided that I

2039
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,480
was going to

2040
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:39,658

year and grow and see how I liked it you

2042
01:35:39,658 --> 01:35:46,079

2043
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:48,779
started back up and you know um started

2044
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:52,738
making seeds again and you know things

2045
01:35:48,779 --> 01:35:54,658
you know we're going good and I decided

2046
01:35:52,738 --> 01:35:58,198
at that point that I was going to buy a

2047
01:35:54,658 --> 01:36:01,679
house you know so I the lease was over I

2048
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:03,599
got kicked out of there uh I had to rent

2049
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,480
for a short while and then I bought a

2050
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:09,060
house up in the mountains

2051
01:36:05,479 --> 01:36:10,259
and uh but then I still had a house in

2052
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,760
New Jersey

2053
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:14,159
so

2054
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,020
um so I had to house up in the mountains

2055
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:20,638
and then we started looking at another

2056
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:23,760
house down in the Denver area and so we

2057
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:25,319
sold sold our house in New Jersey and

2058
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:28,980
you know we

2059
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:31,380
move full time to Colorado

2060
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:34,079

decided to move here it was pretty much

2064
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:46,019
full time because the whole time when I

2065
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:47,819
was uh back in New Jersey I worked for

2066

2071
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:07,019
till like 3 3 30 and then I would drive

2072
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:08,579
into New York City and I had an

2073
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:11,400
apartment in New York City and that's

2074
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:15,719
where I sold weed out of and so I did

2075
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:18,299
that you know Monday Tuesday and then on

2076

hours to my grow house and I would water

2078
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:27,059
everything and then I would turn back

2079
01:37:24,119 --> 01:37:30,359
around and that was my day two hours up

2080
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:32,820

you know so I I did that for like 12

2085
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:47,699
years

2086
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:51,059
12 years I did that you know and and you

2087

2096
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:20,880
um you know that there was a good

2097
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:23,279
Prospect of the seed thing happening and

2098
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:26,400

system and you know have to go to jail

2101
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,920
or probation or whatever because when

2102
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:37,380
you do when you're on all that stuff

2103
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:41,039
they're in your life like it's very hard

2104
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:43,619
to operate on an illegal thing without

2105
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:45,000
you know getting jammed up and if you do

2106
01:38:43,619 --> 01:38:47,579
then you're definitely going to go to

2107
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,439
jail so I decided I wasn't going to be

2108
01:38:47,579 --> 01:38:51,899
taking that chance I'll just go to a

2109
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:54,899
state where I can grow I'm not going to

2110
01:38:51,899 --> 01:38:57,539
be growing for production I just need to

2111
01:38:54,899 --> 01:38:59,939
grow for seed production so I'm not

2112
01:38:57,539 --> 01:39:03,119
going to be doing you know this big huge

2113
01:38:59,939 --> 01:39:05,939
room which I which I and that's what I

2114
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:09,300
originally would do was was I was

2115
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:12,238
originally a grower for production and I

2116
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:14,460
used to do these little side seed side

2117
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:16,919
things on the side you know and I that's

2118
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:19,139
kind of how it started and then it just

2119
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:20,520
kind of evolved into where the little

2120
01:39:19,139 --> 01:39:24,480
side thing

2121
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:26,699
seed side thing became bigger than than

2122
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:30,299
you know growing for you know production

2123
01:39:26,698 --> 01:39:31,859
so you know uh once I saw that you know

2124
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,579
I had that

2125
01:39:31,859 --> 01:39:35,039
um

2126
01:39:32,579 --> 01:39:38,579
you know that that possibility was out

2127
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:40,439
there I just decided to run with it and

2128
01:39:38,579 --> 01:39:42,119
um you know luckily it's all it's all

2129
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:45,779
worked out for me

2130
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:47,939
yeah well what a run I mean kudos for

2131
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:49,859
driving upstate two times a week for 11

2132
01:39:47,939 --> 01:39:51,960
years that's brutal dude I bet you're

2133
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:54,658
sick of driving

2134
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:57,359
yeah no I put on I mean I used to put it

2135
01:39:54,658 --> 01:40:00,779
uh probably like 30 000 miles a year on

2136
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:02,639
my vehicle easily wow you know well

2137
01:40:00,779 --> 01:40:04,619
while you mentioned it you've stimulated

2138
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:07,079
a thought and I want to quickly ask you

2139
01:40:04,619 --> 01:40:09,238
before I forget it I was talking to Bob

2140
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:11,639
Hemphill and he was telling me about

2141
01:40:09,238 --> 01:40:13,319
this strain that they grow in Upstate

2142
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:15,300
New York never heard about it before

2143
01:40:13,319 --> 01:40:19,139
it's called the Shire

2144
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:21,420
it's like a super silver sour diesel

2145
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:23,579
hybrid something like along those lines

2146
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:25,800
but he said like goes for like a hundred

2147
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:27,539
days it's like in Upstate New York these

2148
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:30,179
guys love it and like they swear it's

2149
01:40:27,539 --> 01:40:33,719
the best have you ever heard of that one

2150
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:36,239
I've heard of the Shire but I'm not over

2151
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:39,000
familiar with it

2152
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:43,319
um it almost sounds like a res dog cross

2153
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:45,439
but I don't know if that's true or not

2154
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:45,439
um
