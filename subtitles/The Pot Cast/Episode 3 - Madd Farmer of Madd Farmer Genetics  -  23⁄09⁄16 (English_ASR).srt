so let's go back to the start so how did

18
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,160
you get into weight you know I think I

19
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,170
know the answer this one but you know

20
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,269
was it was it a friend influencing you

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,680
was it more of a family thing and and

22
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,969
what were some of the strains that were

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,970
around when you first started smoking

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:19,978
well I've been in it I've been in it as

25
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,819
long as I can remember I was born into

26
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,060
it

27
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:28,679
it was something my mom and dad had

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:33,180
always done my whole family all my dad's

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:36,390
brothers sister they you know they all

30
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,270
smoked it wasn't something that they hid

31
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,379
from us it was something back in the day

32
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:48,149
that we knew not to to talk about with

33
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:53,819
others but it was a family affair

34
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:58,109
and my parents were honest with us about

35
00:01:53,819 --> 00:02:01,978
it back then it wasn't questioned called

36
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:05,489
medicine it was it was basically called

37
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:10,199
getting high but we knew it as what we

38
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:13,829
knew it and you know the 70s were kind

39
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:18,859
of a different generation and I grew up

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:21,719
in the 70s and 80s and being around it

41
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:27,150
it was a different experience my brother

42
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:29,189
and I both kind of stayed on the path if

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,939
you will I kind of deviated from the

44
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:36,300
path for a few years because I went to

45
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:41,009
school and tried to go mainstream with

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:44,360
things but it wasn't my passion and I

47
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:48,120
could tell I wasn't happy doing

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:54,120
mainstream work and the nine-to-five

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:56,879
that most people most people do and at

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,300
plus I I was diagnosed when I was 24

51
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,960
with SLE and so that kind of changed my

52
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,140
life forever and I went back to my roots

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:11,400
because I knew the benefits at that

54
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:15,169
point it had become more of the topic

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,860
about them the medical aspect of

56
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:24,569
cannabis and I was taking so many

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,700
different medications that everything

58
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:32,039
would make me nauseous all the time I

59
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:36,419
couldn't keep food down it's just I felt

60
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:39,419
sick all the time and there were certain

61
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:43,199
strains that really really were

62
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,839
beneficial and finding certain strains

63
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,139
sometimes weren't as easy even in the

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,030
circles that I have it wasn't the

65
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,599
easiest thing to find certain strains

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:59,939
and so I decided my wife and I after

67
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:03,269
long discussions we we sat down and we

68
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:06,120
just decided you know what I'm going to

69
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:11,000
leave my job I couldn't do any more I

70
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,610
had become addicted to Big Pharma's

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,189
wonderful narcotics and it was just it

72
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,419
was killing me my kidneys were shutting

73
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:26,038
down my liver wasn't working properly it

74
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:27,750
was down to 20% and I couldn't do that

75
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:32,899
we had a

76
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:35,370
we had a daughter on the way and it just

77
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:37,919
it was a time it was a time that we

78
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,930
needed to make a decision and when I

79
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,310
look back now it was the best decision I

80
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,970
ever made

81
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:50,360
and I I have my dad to thank for that

82
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:54,420
because it was him that you know really

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,840
really showed us what what what pot was

84
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:03,689
about even before it was the medicinal

85
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:06,149
factor it was a way of life and that was

86
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:08,219
the reason that was the reason I was was

87
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:12,500
born into the family that I was born

88
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,930
into this is this is something that's I

89
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,779
like it wasn't when an artist paints and

90
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,990
then he says that when he's doing it

91
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:25,859
it's just something that he loves it's

92
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:28,769
it's it's an expression of himself and

93
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,290
that's how I feel about what we do is

94
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:34,740
when I'm with the plants I just feel

95
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:40,160
they're an extension of Who I am and I

96
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,160
express myself through the plants

97
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,150
what a what a kind of you know a

98
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,529
powerful recount of how you got into

99
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:50,549
this you know so thanks for sharing that

100
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:53,339
no it's amazing if you look back at it

101
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,540
now and you think everything was meant

102
00:05:53,339 --> 00:06:01,049
to happen the way it happened and I'm

103
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:04,200
just a firm believer in in that it's

104
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,629
because things that have happened with a

105
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:11,879
cannabis and without cannabis have all

106
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:14,069
led me back to cannabis and I just know

107
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:18,060
that that was the start and I think

108
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:22,199
that's why that's my what one of my you

109
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,720
know clearest recollections is the fact

110
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,149
that it was meant to be and that's why I

111
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,250
remember it being only five years old

112
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:34,919
and just having that thought I mean

113
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,889
it-it's it's like a picture in my mind I

114
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:41,220
can see it I can smell it I mean it was

115
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:44,669
a giant enormous outdoor calli skunk

116
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,640
plant and I mean it the entire house I

117
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,410
mean everything everything smell like my

118
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,579
dad had just brought the skunk into the

119
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:57,930
house and I it's a vivid pungent pungent

120
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:59,969
memory in my head nice so so it sounds

121
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,709
like the whole family was growing kind

122
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,890
of the whole time you're growing up at

123
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:07,889
what point did you decide to transition

124
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:10,289
from grower to breeder or maybe more

125
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,120
should I say back in those days was

126
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,950
there the distinction where people just

127
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,319
farmers and a lot of people made their

128
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:18,930
own seed for the following season or you

129
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,670
know was there still a somewhat of clear

130
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,470
distinction as there is today between

131
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,410
say growers and breeders and if so when

132
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,470
did you decide to make the transition

133
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:32,010
well as as far as it was back in there

134
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:36,210
was no coin term of a breeder when my

135
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:39,209
dad and I won't I won't say his name but

136
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:40,949
my dad had a best friend and between

137
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,589
those two

138
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:47,219
they were the best growers they were

139
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:52,109
doing things back then and this is in

140
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,220
the mid to late 70s that people are just

141
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,590
now starting to do

142
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:00,090
now with the no-till experience that it

143
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:04,139
was kind of when I look back now it's

144
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:06,750
mind-boggling but when they needed to

145
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,629
continue the lines that they had it

146
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,120
would be a email that they would have

147
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:15,110
from the same lines that they that they

148
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,030
had and they would have one and it would

149
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:21,930
pollinate you know the surrounding

150
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:24,119
plants and then that would be the seeds

151
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,209
that they would continue on you figured

152
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,788
they would do one pollination and they

153
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:35,610
would have enough seeds for years of

154
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:38,098
growth and so there was no coin term of

155
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:43,038
breeders back then it was just farming

156
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:47,850
and and they were farming cannabis and

157
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:51,870
as far as for me getting into the actual

158
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:57,200
art of breathing it was specifically for

159
00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:00,720
my my medicinal benefit I wanted to I

160
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:05,580
wanted to create strains that were going

161
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,050
to help me with my the symptoms of my

162
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:13,129
lupus my SLE

163
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:15,919
and that's what led me down the road of

164
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:19,710
doing it of getting into it because

165
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:23,429
there were certain lines that were more

166
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:26,759
beneficial for me and it was the reason

167
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:30,059
why I am so heavily involved with with

168
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:34,769
purple pot is because of the the

169
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:37,289
medicinal benefits that it it offers me

170
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:41,370
for my particular disease so that was

171
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:46,529
the reason that I got back into breeding

172
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:50,100
and then it became as much of a passion

173
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:52,980
as actually growing and it was something

174
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,250
that I just absolutely fell in love with

175
00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,240
and it just grew from there and it just

176
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:02,850
blossomed from there yes so on that same

177
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,720
idea I was actually wondering do you

178
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:11,250
think that it's possible to predictive

179
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,889
we breed a strain for a specific need so

180
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,929
we here you know certain strains are

181
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:17,339
good for say IBS or you know in your

182
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:21,000
case you just mentioned you know certain

183
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:23,069
strains are good for SLE do you think

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,409
that you could say I'm gonna cross this

185
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:27,389
strand with this strain and I predict

186
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:29,759
that it will be good for Crohn's or

187
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,259
something based on the parents lineage

188
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,389
maybe or something like that or do you

189
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:35,068
think like Knights it's not a really a

190
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:36,839
predictable thing it just turns out

191
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,399
certain strains are good for certain

192
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,149
things but I doubt we'll ever be able to

193
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:46,919
predict it

194
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:49,139
oh no absolutely absolutely I for me I

195
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,278
said the two strains that come to mind

196
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:56,129
that I have personally found the most

197
00:10:52,278 --> 00:11:00,708
medicinal benefits from our lavender and

198
00:10:56,129 --> 00:11:06,360
purple Urkel they just have a quality

199
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:07,948
about them that it with nausea for

200
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,129
instance and that's been my biggest

201
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:14,219
issue is the nausea and the stomach the

202
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:17,909
the cramping in the the pain with the

203
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,069
IBS and the Crohn's because I've had 13

204
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:22,610
surgeries so it's been a rough rough

205
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:27,269
road and the idea of entering

206
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:29,509
medications and everything so the

207
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:33,659
lavender in the purple article I can

208
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:38,250
pick him up and though I've been smoking

209
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:40,588
him for so many years I don't get stoned

210
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,519
on him per se anymore I mean I'll have a

211
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:48,720
nice little relaxing buzz but I don't

212
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:51,629
really smoke those two you know to

213
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,750
really get high i smoke those for a

214
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:59,220
purpose and I don't really go anywhere

215
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:03,328
without them but I can take either one

216
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:07,290
of those and I can work those and the

217
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:09,750
progeny from those eighty percent I

218
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:14,099
would say of the time are gonna carry

219
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:17,039
the same benefit as as the mom as long

220
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,430
as you're male selection is proper and

221
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:23,639
you're staying either within the line

222
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:28,019
or as close to the line as you can

223
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:31,259
you're gonna carry that trait and that's

224
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:34,620
the reason why I had stayed within those

225
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:37,470
lines but for me that I cannot be

226
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,560
without those those two strings and I've

227
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,930
had those two strings for over 16 years

228
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,199
now oh wow

229
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:48,779
so I was actually gonna say yeah I read

230
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,120
online that ye the Oh Kolkata has been

231
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,819
in your family's possession for over 25

232
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,509
years that's really impressive if it is

233
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:00,330
true how how did you get the Kolkata and

234
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,830
you know if you did know kind of a bit

235
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,879
about its history that you wouldn't mind

236
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,190
sharing you know it's one of those

237
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,169
strains where it'll speculate about the

238
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:12,570
genetics but you know it's kind of hard

239
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:16,079
to know what's true well it's not been

240
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:23,820
25 years that we've had it it would

241
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:27,060
probably be closer to 19 around 19 maybe

242
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,060
maybe 20 still yeah

243
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:32,759
yeah well it's anytime you can keep a

244
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,939
plant that's designed to have one season

245
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,919
it flower sentence then I'll live for

246
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,860
that long you've done something right

247
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,829
and we have we have quite a few moms

248
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,649
that we've had for 10 plus years 12 plus

249
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:51,960
years but my babies have been with us

250
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:52,740
for the longest time and we've kept them

251
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:59,670
alive

252
00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:04,620
herckel is a she she has a mystique it's

253
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:08,129
it's it's just what she is and that's

254
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,889
true the true identity behind purple

255
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:13,740
oracle truly truly isn't known and the

256
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:18,000
reason is is because the name game

257
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:21,090
wasn't this huge oh I have I have this

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,830
line or I have this line it was you know

259
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,080
we had sensimilla you either had

260
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,030
seamless or you didn't and my family was

261
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,340
known for producing the best seedless

262
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:34,088
marijuana that most people had ever had

263
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:41,069
ever seen so if there wasn't a name

264
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:43,779
so back then and a lot of the land race

265
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:47,169
the land race crossings were starting to

266
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:50,438
come because you had South American weed

267
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:52,719
that was really into into parts of

268
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:55,899
California especially in the Central

269
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,189
Valley having really long summers that

270
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:00,789
you could carry all the way into

271
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:04,539
November so you were able to flower you

272
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:07,870
know indoor strains that would be 19 or

273
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:10,078
20 weekers with a little assistance and

274
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:14,379
help you could push them to full term

275
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:17,620
and you know a lot of especially with my

276
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:20,920
dad he really liked the the the speedy

277
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,899
weed the ampie weed if you will and the

278
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,429
only thing that he didn't really care

279
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:28,839
for what's the really long growing

280
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:31,120
season and that's when a lot of the the

281
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:36,389
Hindukush was starting to make its way

282
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:40,299
over over here and then you had the

283
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:42,009
Afghanistan and Russian conflict and my

284
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:46,948
dad had friends in the Peace Corps that

285
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:50,919
were bringing seeds back from from from

286
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:55,058
different areas and that's when a lot of

287
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:58,389
the real true land race hybrids were

288
00:15:55,058 --> 00:16:02,818
being started you had pure sativa lines

289
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:07,720
for the first time being pollinated by

290
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:10,419
super short you know stocky wide indica

291
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,050
plants that a lot of people had never

292
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:16,360
even seen before and they were they were

293
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:20,289
using them in and what we have coined

294
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,089
breeding projects now and thus you know

295
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:26,948
that's where a lot of it got started was

296
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:30,999
was us-backed in but with herbal there

297
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:34,149
was no name you know so that's that's

298
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:36,670
the biggest reason that there's the the

299
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:41,438
big question mark as to the lineage

300
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:46,899
because when it was created there just

301
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:48,490
wasn't a lot of names I think one one of

302
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,470
the lines had and

303
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,430
down the road becoming one of the

304
00:16:50,470 --> 00:17:00,250
Northern Lights by type Ross's I want to

305
00:16:54,429 --> 00:17:03,729
say that it was the male side that was

306
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:09,338
the indica the indica side of things on

307
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:11,709
the article and it just it wasn't you

308
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:13,958
know it just wasn't a conversation it

309
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,549
would always be about the plant for the

310
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:20,320
plant with the plant and it was it was a

311
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:21,879
trait expressions that's what you were

312
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,159
looking for that was the biggest thing

313
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,040
it wasn't so much in the name and that's

314
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,610
why when people asked me hey why don't

315
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:34,569
your crosses carry names certain ones do

316
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:36,399
and they carry their names after the

317
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:39,519
fact that they've been grown because

318
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,710
it's a name that you can actually see in

319
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,660
the plant you know this one was called

320
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,309
this because this is what she smelled

321
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,850
like that's what she looked like tasted

322
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:50,470
like that was the name and then I tell

323
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:54,939
people not to get caught up in the name

324
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:57,579
because it's meaningless and so it was

325
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,710
uh it was about the traits about the

326
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:02,769
expressions of the plant you know it's

327
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:06,789
just the idea that you know this one was

328
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:08,920
done by the end of September and and

329
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:10,839
this one over here we were carrying into

330
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,550
the middle of November and probably

331
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,829
could have given her an extra two weeks

332
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:18,000
and the idea of putting them together

333
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:21,159
just made a whole lot of sense and

334
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,160
that's how it got started and then the

335
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:29,860
hybrid craze really got started and then

336
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:35,400
you had old school skunk lines that you

337
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:39,099
know were powerful and and it's

338
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:42,580
supercharged satima lines and now you

339
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:44,709
had indica lines that were released when

340
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,899
they had the same turf profiles the same

341
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,539
expressions the same smells but they

342
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,080
they looked completely different and you

343
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:55,839
would always try and find things that

344
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,309
that in your head you could just put

345
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,449
them together you could actually see

346
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:03,808
them being well matched together and

347
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,409
with Arkell there was a lot of Northern

348
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,269
Lights

349
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:09,539
well what ended up being cleaned is

350
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:14,368
Northern Lights and ty going around a

351
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:17,099
lot of Ty and those two ended up having

352
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:21,118
a party and then they became a single

353
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:23,878
line and that's also when you started

354
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:27,259
seeing a lot of color a lot of the

355
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:32,398
Afghans that were that were coming over

356
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:35,759
were worth turning black about the final

357
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:40,229
month of flower temperatures had a lot

358
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:42,419
to do with it but you just didn't see a

359
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,989
whole whole lot of it at the time and

360
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:48,929
once we started to see well we have more

361
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:51,179
of my dad and and crew but once they

362
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:55,200
started to see those expressions it was

363
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:57,778
just a whole different realm of weed

364
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,190
that you know they were now getting to

365
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:03,989
experience and it was a no-brainer

366
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,019
working with it for them and then that's

367
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:10,829
when you started seeing the purple lines

368
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:13,460
really started to pop up the sativa

369
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:19,069
dominant purple lines from the hybrids

370
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:23,788
the the indica dominant purple lines and

371
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:26,308
purple Urkel was a product of that she

372
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:31,108
just was something that was really

373
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:33,058
really special yeah so just kind of

374
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:35,189
going back to a point you made a few

375
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:39,148
minutes ago about um some hybrids in

376
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,919
relation to Oracle you know this kind of

377
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:42,959
has a bit of a bigger underlying

378
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,149
question but you know how do you think

379
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,608
ocol has managed to stay within kind of

380
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:50,599
the mainstream of weed culture or at

381
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:54,689
least kind of always peripherally

382
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:56,189
present and by that I mean like to me

383
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,960
granddaddy purple is one of those

384
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,970
strains where it's good you know like I

385
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,350
don't mind it but I always like I have

386
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,839
to remind people like you know the

387
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:06,538
speculated genetics are local Cross Big

388
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,839
Bud so you know if you look at big but

389
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:11,788
we know what its job is

390
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:14,000
so the extrapolation would be that oh

391
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:17,669
cool it's going to be like the con

392
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,099
granddaddy purple so is that true and

393
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:21,990
why do you think our core has managed to

394
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,639
stay kind of present in mainstream

395
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,440
culture because it is one of those ones

396
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,750
that it's always popping up but it's

397
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,798
never the flavor of the month so to

398
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:35,220
speak yeah well with Oracle I think

399
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:38,099
there's there's three reasons you have

400
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:43,860
the mysterious factor everybody wants to

401
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:48,949
know what exactly it is - it is an

402
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:51,479
amazingly gorgeous plant - to grow just

403
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,179
everybody complains that grows her that

404
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,890
she's a slow Vedder and she can be a

405
00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:02,340
slow veg er I grow a lot of pot that's

406
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:08,570
extremely painful painfully slow in veg

407
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:13,970
and the third I think would be her

408
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:17,298
intoxicating smell and for me her taste

409
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:23,899
because the true herbal cut the actual

410
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:30,619
herbal cut is a hazy smoky if you will

411
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:34,349
great flavor that is very unique and

412
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:38,009
it's it's one of those things that

413
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:40,109
really goes well with food I think a lot

414
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:42,808
of people make the relation to cannabis

415
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:45,798
and food and I think you put those three

416
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:48,859
factors together and I just think that

417
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:54,658
she's just carried carried on that way

418
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:58,319
everybody everybody everywhere I go with

419
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,480
with friends you know I I don't go

420
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,278
around advertising Who I am I'm a very

421
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,579
recluse individual probably one of the

422
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:07,460
most recluse individuals which you know

423
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:10,079
but the circle of friends that I have

424
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,880
even the same guys will ask me you know

425
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,839
what what do you think it is what do you

426
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,880
think it we just had this conversation

427
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,269
three weeks ago what do you mean what do

428
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:23,070
I think it is and I think it's the the

429
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:27,089
mysterious factor and just that that

430
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:27,569
it's just a gorgeous gorgeous plant when

431
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:31,289
she fly

432
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:35,639
hours I just think that's what it is

433
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:37,769
it's a for me obviously I've already

434
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,759
stated that it was the medicinal factor

435
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:45,089
that that she serves for me but she's

436
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:50,400
just one of the most beautiful plant to

437
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:51,029
flower out and and I won't be without

438
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,320
her

439
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:57,359
I'll have her it'll be something that

440
00:23:54,319 --> 00:24:02,659
you know when it's my time to go I'll

441
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:06,209
turn over to my to my child and you know

442
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:09,960
explain which she already knows that

443
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:12,660
it's what you know I've always been

444
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,490
honest with her and she knows what

445
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,330
certain things mean to me and how

446
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,620
special they are obviously plus my wife

447
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:24,210
and they know there are certain things

448
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:25,829
that like your name you want to carry

449
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,840
out you'll want to do everything you

450
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:32,519
possibly can to continue on and that'll

451
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,009
be something that I turn over to them

452
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,680
and then and I'll make it clear that you

453
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:39,509
know keep her around as long as you can

454
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:44,660
and when you're tired of her pass her to

455
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:48,089
somebody that will do the same thing and

456
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,070
but that's just what it is for me of

457
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:53,759
course I can't speak for everybody else

458
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:56,730
but even if she didn't have the the

459
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,640
medicinal effect for me that she does it

460
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:04,769
would still be one of those plants that

461
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:08,390
I keep around just because she's that

462
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:11,519
unique she she works well with others

463
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:14,880
and it's all about her expressions

464
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:17,069
she's just let's put this way she's

465
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,880
intoxicating to the eyes she's

466
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:24,529
intoxicating to the nose and she's

467
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:29,100
intoxicating on your taste buds and when

468
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:31,920
your body is into something that much

469
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:35,309
with that many of your senses it's a no

470
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:38,190
brainer and that that's why she stays

471
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:41,460
with us and I think maybe that's why it

472
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:44,220
is something that is so highly sought

473
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,798
after by others is those three factors

474
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:51,390
is the the fact that it is a mysterious

475
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:55,558
strain but besides that it's just she's

476
00:25:51,390 --> 00:26:00,330
gorgeous and she's it it's explosive

477
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,798
with flavor yeah so just to move on to

478
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:03,509
some of your strains because actually

479
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,329
wanted to highlight some of your strains

480
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:10,140
for people listening so the first one

481
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:14,298
what I think is maybe kind of your

482
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:17,460
hallmark strand away the Triple E wicked

483
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:19,230
you know this one is obviously made from

484
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,419
the lavender which we mentioned earlier

485
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,940
as well as it's earth what you said is

486
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,950
the the male side of the purple opal so

487
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,269
I think you mentioned that was the what

488
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,080
eventually became in the Northern Lights

489
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:32,970
yes Erin or the lights both I yes so so

490
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:35,699
how would you describe this strain to

491
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,440
someone and why you know like from from

492
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,860
what I can see it looks like the one

493
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,590
you've kind of worked the most with why

494
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,459
did you sit decide to work with it so

495
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:45,750
extensively and you know and yeah and

496
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,740
how what would be your kind of sales

497
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:52,230
pitch to someone you know well what's

498
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:56,159
the tripoli wicked first let me say that

499
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,890
I refer to her a lot as t-dub a lot of

500
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,480
people especially here on the west coast

501
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,730
when they hear the turn term teed up

502
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:08,220
they have automatically assumed train

503
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:10,110
rights and it's not when I'm referring

504
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,480
to I don't like T that I don't like

505
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:15,959
train wreck it's not it's not my cup of

506
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:21,599
tea she's a [ __ ] to work with very

507
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:25,769
unstable the buzz isn't that unique she

508
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:27,689
just grows erratic she stretches so she

509
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:33,240
just wasn't my cup of tea like I'm not a

510
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:35,159
real big og fan either but that's when

511
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,620
you hear me refer to see them it will

512
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:42,210
never be trainwreck it will always be

513
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:44,609
triple e wicked that and I get asked

514
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,048
that question a lot so I wanted to to

515
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:52,199
clarify that

516
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:55,259
Jenny worms t-dub is uh she's she's a

517
00:27:52,200 --> 00:28:00,779
very special very special

518
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:03,269
strain the mail that we got was actually

519
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:07,910
when my dad had passed away

520
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:10,440
a family friend which the friendship

521
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:13,259
unfortunately has kind of degraded

522
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:17,070
because of the popularity that was

523
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:20,129
gained by the three strains that we used

524
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:23,609
to create with the mill that we were

525
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:27,180
blessed with was it was in honor of my

526
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:30,689
dad because my dad had a love for purple

527
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:34,799
pots and originally it was gonna be the

528
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:37,440
lavender and the Urkel and the Mel was

529
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,200
noted as Triple E when we're working

530
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,259
Lestrange usually they'll be documented

531
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:47,069
as a letter and a number depending where

532
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:51,180
they are in the garden it's just easier

533
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:53,369
to track them with with letters and

534
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:57,210
numbers because of the rows and the

535
00:28:53,369 --> 00:29:03,169
placement and so we went ahead and

536
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:08,100
labeled said Mel as Triple E it was a

537
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:14,070
kind of an heirloom line and it was from

538
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:18,449
the the male side of the responsible

539
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:21,599
party for creating the Urkel and it is a

540
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:25,670
very heavy Northern Lights leaning

541
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:30,449
Northern Lights by Ty hybrid line that

542
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:33,900
really expressive it carried a heavy

543
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:38,279
heavy heavy which we didn't know at the

544
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:40,200
time had no clue a citrus herb profile

545
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,899
and when I say citrus I guess I should

546
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,769
just say tangerines because it literally

547
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,509
smelled most of the the plants even the

548
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:52,200
Mel's on the stem rub you could smell it

549
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:54,990
would just the three or four weeks in

550
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,860
the flower would start to smell as if

551
00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:02,819
you were peeling a really really sweet

552
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:06,899
tangerine and we didn't expect that at

553
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:09,119
all and so we got the mail which was

554
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,759
Triple E it was an honor of

555
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,788
of my of my dad we wanted to do

556
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:18,659
something that was gonna be unique

557
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:23,759
something that had had to my knowledge

558
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:27,419
had not been done and with we were

559
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:30,298
blessed with the mail and so we went

560
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:35,220
ahead with it and we used him to

561
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:39,628
pollinate our our lavender which became

562
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:42,509
Tripoli wicked in honor of my father our

563
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:45,118
purple Arkell which became purple Jackie

564
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,980
again in honor of my father and then

565
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:50,339
those were the two we were we were going

566
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:54,240
to use in the beginning and then it was

567
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:57,319
a last-minute decision that we threw in

568
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,628
our esidisi that one really wasn't

569
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:03,359
specific for my dad she's probably been

570
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:05,878
with us out of all our elite mothers

571
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:08,898
she's been with us the least amount of

572
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:12,569
time I think we've had her for around

573
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:17,758
eleven eleven maybe close to 12 years

574
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:22,249
now um and we we put her in late and she

575
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:26,940
became the triple deep Crippler and we

576
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:30,058
and ended up becoming just the things

577
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,909
that end up happening that you can't

578
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:36,240
control and how a person is gonna react

579
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:39,480
you you know you can't control and it

580
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:44,159
became such an issue that we ended up

581
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,889
just killing the one male that I to this

582
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,249
day wish I would have just wrote out the

583
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:52,378
turmoil and and kept kept the mail

584
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:56,879
itself because he was the most

585
00:31:52,378 --> 00:32:01,648
expressive mill speaking on on turps

586
00:31:56,878 --> 00:32:04,709
term profiles the most expressive male

587
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:07,648
that I've ever worked with and we ended

588
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:11,028
up killing him just to you know kind of

589
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:14,668
try and keep a relationship a friendship

590
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:19,888
what she ended up failing anyway and so

591
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:22,620
we did away with him and we decided to

592
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:24,629
carry on with the three we

593
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:27,750
kept our end of the bargain we didn't do

594
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:32,120
anything more and we had the three lines

595
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:38,130
the t-dub the the PJ and the TVC and

596
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:42,689
just the the triple II was so dominant

597
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:47,190
so amazing and now that I look back and

598
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:50,250
I've grown literally probably a thousand

599
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:55,679
of of these the the three that we

600
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:58,769
created I have seen how predictable of a

601
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,650
male doesn't matter the female how

602
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:04,379
predictable he's gonna be and anytime

603
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:07,009
you can find a male that is predictable

604
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:10,880
in what he's gonna do it makes your job

605
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:15,720
easy because you know what to expect and

606
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,850
Tripoli was that male and the reason

607
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,670
that you hear the most right now about

608
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:26,449
the Tina is because when we work aligned

609
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:29,429
we don't just create the line and then

610
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:32,549
you know put it out there and then move

611
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:36,660
on to the next we create the line we

612
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:40,740
work from within the line because I just

613
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:42,420
feel that you now know that line you now

614
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,410
know what she's capable of what she's

615
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:50,250
capable of doing the predictability

616
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:53,220
factor there's just so much about her

617
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,960
that you now know why do you want to

618
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,370
just jump into something else that's an

619
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:03,929
unknown so we continued on for a while

620
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:06,629
a few years with the t-dub and that's

621
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:13,530
why you continue to hear about the Teva

622
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:16,200
but we're now moving in to the PJ aspect

623
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,409
the purple Jackie and it is the same

624
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:24,408
it's the triple email but instead of the

625
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:28,500
lavender mom it's the Urkel mom and it's

626
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:30,960
it's probably more expressive with the

627
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,739
Urkel's then he was with the lavender

628
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,099
and that one well it's gonna raise some

629
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:41,189
eyebrows I think

630
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:45,450
because again it's hi citrus expressions

631
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:49,800
in the Terps the the buds are a little

632
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:52,168
more chunky if you will the the calyxes

633
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,769
are a little more small and a little

634
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:58,019
larger the hairs are a little brighter

635
00:34:55,769 --> 00:35:03,509
orange they just stand out a little bit

636
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:06,960
more the the potency factor is right

637
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:09,869
there with the t-dub that was the reason

638
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,079
why too with the tea that we stayed with

639
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:16,950
it for so long because it had amazing

640
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:20,940
medicinal effects but she just was a

641
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:23,460
little bit light in in the power aspect

642
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,789
and and I just felt I could I could

643
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,829
bring that out a little bit better so we

644
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:33,239
we just played with the line for a long

645
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:38,309
time enjoyed it thoroughly and created

646
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:40,259
many hybrid lines with with Athena but

647
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:44,130
in the meantime we were working with the

648
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:50,609
TDC and the PHA just not you know openly

649
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:52,140
and dumping a month on whoever we like I

650
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:56,279
said we like to stick with a single

651
00:35:52,139 --> 00:36:00,598
project as far as our focal points but

652
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:02,880
we always have at least one most of the

653
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:07,048
time to other projects that were we're

654
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,730
kind of doing in the background and tea

655
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:14,039
that was just the first one from the

656
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:17,940
what we did for my dad was the first one

657
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:22,318
that that we brought mainstream and that

658
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:28,019
we we allowed to you know to come out to

659
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:31,099
the masses so um you much like one of my

660
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:36,088
favorite breed is dynasty up here to

661
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:38,369
work in kind of a methodical way in that

662
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:40,588
uh what you do is you've got kind of

663
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:42,809
your pool of base strains and in your

664
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:46,739
case it's kind of the Clementine and the

665
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:49,500
t-dub cool and spaced queen and a few

666
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:50,579
others and you kind of mix and match

667
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,650
your flavors from the

668
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,929
and I like this approach because I mean

669
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:57,269
for one that Clementine I mentioned

670
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:59,009
isn't the DNA Clementine it's a

671
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:00,480
different one it's one you made so a lot

672
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,150
of those are actually your own strains

673
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,269
yes

674
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,130
so it seems to me like you've made a lot

675
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:12,389
of the possible combinations there are

676
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:14,940
so my my immediate thought was what's

677
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:18,150
mad farmers next move are you gonna

678
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,269
bring some new genetics in and then make

679
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,190
some new combinations with that or maybe

680
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:25,019
refine some of the old genetics by yeah

681
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,280
I know that you took the t-dub to the f2

682
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:28,440
you know maybe do that with some other

683
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,280
strains and then begin reworking from

684
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:35,280
there or what's your plan well like I

685
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,310
said you know here with us it's about

686
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,420
what first and foremost what my

687
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:45,799
preferences as smoking material so I'll

688
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:51,480
always go with that first and foremost

689
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:54,539
I've never been one to breed with the

690
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,820
cut of the month strains like a lot of

691
00:37:54,539 --> 00:38:01,130
people will get what's popular you have

692
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,090
the cookies and the the gg4 and now

693
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,789
archivists come out with a dough see

694
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:08,510
though and those are all amazing in

695
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:11,309
their own right and I would never ever

696
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,770
try to dick somebody and say hey you

697
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:16,349
know you're working with [ __ ] or you

698
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:19,050
know you created [ __ ] never because

699
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:21,210
that's somebody's passion and I'd never

700
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:24,450
do that whatsoever

701
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:28,760
my point is simple I'm not a cut of the

702
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:33,599
month breeder I am really methodical

703
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:36,210
it's kind of OCD and so when I'm on

704
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,829
something I stay on something until I'm

705
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:44,940
completely satisfied with it and then

706
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:51,210
I'll move on but what's coming next is

707
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:55,650
the is the PJ and you'll see if PJ

708
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:57,539
hybrids the the male that we have that

709
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:01,530
we're working with was chosen

710
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:05,000
oh my over three seasons I think it was

711
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:09,050
three seasons that we we took the find

712
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,110
um a lot of times yes yes sir a lot a

713
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:16,280
lot of testing I mean when you have a

714
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:18,110
field of just males it's you know it's

715
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,940
it's just like growing females you're

716
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:23,300
looking for specifics you're smelling

717
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:27,860
for specifics you're documenting flower

718
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:29,600
times people ask if you really smoked

719
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:35,000
them yes I do

720
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,860
I I don't enjoy it but some of the

721
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,769
male's you can actually get you can get

722
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,960
a bit of a buzz on I I've had like with

723
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:45,199
our PJ I have Mel's little produced

724
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,840
resins good amounts of resin to the

725
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,149
point to where you can turn them into a

726
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,329
concentrate I mean you you can actually

727
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:55,760
extract I mean your your percentages

728
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:58,119
aren't gonna be anything close to what

729
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,880
you're gonna get with the female flower

730
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:05,179
but it is it's there it's a possibility

731
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,820
and you can't just say well this line

732
00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:10,639
produced this smell so this smell looks

733
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,730
like he's got everything I'm looking for

734
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,920
for me that's not good enough my brain

735
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:19,130
doesn't work like that

736
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:21,800
for me I I I have to see him I have to

737
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,220
touch him I have to smell him I have to

738
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:30,650
smoke him I have to know what he's gonna

739
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:33,319
give me and with our PJ it's it's

740
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:37,880
everything that I wanted from my PJ male

741
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:41,900
he has the the blood-red PT old he has

742
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,380
that citrus font on the stem rub he has

743
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:48,800
the quicker flowering time he has the

744
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:51,940
little bit further node spacing he has

745
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,340
that gorgeous double serrated leaf edge

746
00:40:51,940 --> 00:41:01,849
just everything about him his pollen

747
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:03,890
sacks are vivid violet and let's put it

748
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:06,769
this way you put him in the field of 25

749
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:09,349
other males and he's gonna be the one

750
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:14,050
that stands out he's gonna be the one

751
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:17,029
that screams Here I am choose me and

752
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,769
typically we don't if or you know post

753
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,170
pictures of our males or so

754
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:23,840
Mel's but he has impressed us so much

755
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:26,900
that I've actually posted a couple of

756
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:32,269
pictures of him just because he's caught

757
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:35,599
my fancy like I don't know if I've had a

758
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:39,860
mail that has as excited me as much as

759
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,139
as this pj mail and that's where we're

760
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:45,200
gonna go we're gonna work the pj line

761
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:48,199
we're gonna ff2 in the line first and

762
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:52,519
foremost bring out the the f twos and

763
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:56,359
then we'll take him to you know to what

764
00:41:52,519 --> 00:42:00,320
we consider our elite mothers our you

765
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:03,590
know our brood and then we'll start to

766
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,010
introduce him to you know like our

767
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:11,210
heirloom Clementine

768
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:13,700
we don't ever bring in outside cuts for

769
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:18,050
one yeah it's it's kind of a bad

770
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:21,250
practice because it's sanitary issue

771
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:24,710
even the most clean gardens can carry

772
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:26,480
hitchhikers that are unknown you know

773
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,760
you can go down to your damn bro shop

774
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,789
and bring home hitchhikers because

775
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,980
there's so many farmers in and out of

776
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:36,289
the shop that they you know the spider

777
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,329
mite will follow him you know be honest

778
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:40,719
shoes or pants and then they're jumping

779
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:43,940
onto a product that you bring home so

780
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:45,500
and yeah you can quarantine and you know

781
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,170
there's plenty of methods to eradicate

782
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:52,159
anything possible that you can bring in

783
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:57,200
but again we're really Rekluse our

784
00:42:52,159 --> 00:43:00,469
social circle is small and we just we

785
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,509
don't bring in a lot of outside cuts and

786
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:06,939
if you look back just in the last three

787
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:11,330
years at at what popular cannabis

788
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:14,329
strains you've had a lot of them come

789
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:16,549
and go you know here in california you

790
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:20,840
go back just a few years and you had

791
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:23,269
lines like a snow cap and train wreck

792
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,760
and you know a lot of the lines they

793
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:28,070
come and go cookies this seem to have

794
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,760
stuck around for a while but healing

795
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:32,450
cookies now is kind of starting to

796
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,980
expand out and

797
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:37,129
hybrids you know everybody now has

798
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,719
cookie hybrids where before it was just

799
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,960
straight cookies everybody wanted

800
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:46,189
cookies GG for now you're seeing a lot

801
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:50,150
of hybrids and I'm just I'm old school I

802
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:52,849
guess um it's not that I don't dig those

803
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:55,820
strains it's just that when it comes to

804
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:58,940
my work so what I'm doing to what my

805
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:02,210
vision is I don't know enough about

806
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:04,608
those lines to feel confident when I

807
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:06,710
bring them in that I'm gonna create

808
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:10,670
something that the growers are gonna get

809
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:14,659
and say damn you know that's all I want

810
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:17,480
I I want to know what I'm working with

811
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:19,309
and I want to know the ins and outs I

812
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,809
don't just want to know its name and

813
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:23,779
what it smells like and what it looks

814
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:25,429
like and tastes like I want to know what

815
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,380
it's doing on week six on an indoor

816
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:29,358
flower run I want to know what it's

817
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:33,829
doing in September on an outdoor flower

818
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:36,108
run I want to know you know how big is

819
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:37,910
she gonna get in an outdoor patch how is

820
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:40,608
she gonna do on organics house you're

821
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:42,980
gonna do on synthetics I I want to know

822
00:44:40,608 --> 00:44:46,549
these things and there's only one way to

823
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:50,750
do it and it just takes time and a lot

824
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:54,500
of people bite me for you know only

825
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:57,650
having what seems to be a small set of

826
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:00,858
lines that we work it's not because I

827
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:03,920
don't have access or I can't acquire I'm

828
00:45:00,858 --> 00:45:06,309
you can get whatever I want it's just

829
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:11,269
the fact that this is how my brain works

830
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:13,549
this is this is my commitment I'm a lot

831
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:17,420
like my dad in that sense I know what I

832
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:19,550
like and that's for my personal

833
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,230
consumption and then when I'm working

834
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:24,050
with something it needs to be more than

835
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:26,539
what I like I need to know like I said

836
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,760
what she's gonna do in September on an

837
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:30,440
outdoor run on synthetic nutrients I

838
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:34,160
need to know what she's gonna do

839
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:38,420
in September out or on organic nutrients

840
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:41,118
and that's that's just how we are so it

841
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:45,409
seems like we're we're really simplified

842
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,380
in in what we're doing but in reality

843
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,230
it's an

844
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,780
simplifying it off there's a lot going

845
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,619
on that most people will never know you

846
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,340
know

847
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:58,980
yeah I mean the a quick little caveat I

848
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,930
would chuck in there is that I'm from my

849
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,179
experience from talking to people and

850
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:05,399
just personally breeders like yourself

851
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:07,500
and other people who do have that kind

852
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,090
of limited base and mix-and-match they

853
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,769
tend to be able to give by far the most

854
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:13,230
accurate descriptions of their strains

855
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:15,929
so you know I think that kind of speaks

856
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,710
for itself in a lot of ways but anyway

857
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:20,190
moving on

858
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,840
so are you organic or synthetic and and

859
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,639
you just mentioned before that you might

860
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:28,470
consider taking the purple Jackies to

861
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:31,019
the f2 yes would you would you ever

862
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:33,929
consider doing a cubing process or do

863
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:36,570
you think now doing bat crossings not so

864
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:39,989
much what I'm looking to do what yeah

865
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:41,519
what what makes f2 is an ideal thing for

866
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:44,399
you you know do you aim to refine

867
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:46,530
characteristics in that process or you

868
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,490
know like why choose the f2 over say a B

869
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:57,060
X no with a PJ we are we're going to

870
00:46:50,489 --> 00:47:00,269
cube I want to get as close to the Urkel

871
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:04,679
in seed form as I can I want the growers

872
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:07,289
to get a 10 pack of seeds and have seven

873
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:10,440
of them come out damn they're spitting

874
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:14,699
images of purple purple and that's our

875
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:17,550
goal in the PJ is I just fill and this

876
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:20,309
is no slight on lavender I probably

877
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:21,960
should have done it with her but there's

878
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:23,849
just so many other things moving with

879
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,610
her that we just didn't get around to

880
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:29,869
that but one of our biggest goals with

881
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:33,269
the PJ is to cube her I want to see

882
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:36,779
Arkel dominance I want people to be able

883
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:42,690
to experience you know that true purple

884
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:45,690
in its its form not not some s1 not some

885
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:47,369
oh this is in quotation marks purple

886
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:49,950
Oracle that we got from the club that's

887
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:52,409
[ __ ] it's some purple strain that

888
00:47:49,949 --> 00:47:54,509
you can clearly wanna I don't know how

889
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:56,519
many times I'll be thumbing through

890
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:58,100
pictures and this guy will state yeah

891
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:00,269
and this is my er Kolkata I'm like

892
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:04,079
that's not even close

893
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:07,559
verbal verbal you know and it's just I

894
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:12,179
feel bad I I do I feel really bad and it

895
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:16,079
just drives me to to produce some seed

896
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:18,899
that is gonna show people what the

897
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,239
purple or chol is is truly all about and

898
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,269
and the PJ is that's that's where we're

899
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:28,709
gonna go so we're gonna do F two lines

900
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:30,719
we're gonna do some hybrids but for me

901
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:34,230
which is the most important factor is

902
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:39,209
I'm going to bring it full circle I'm

903
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:44,250
going to draw the Arkell out and it'll

904
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:48,119
be cubed it will be 75% or higher

905
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:51,030
Arkel dominant in every female or I

906
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:55,259
won't be satisfied and that is

907
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:57,210
definitely our goal with with that there

908
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:00,600
be other projects that we do with it but

909
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:05,250
the goal with the PJ is is to allow

910
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:09,650
people to experience true in every way

911
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:12,869
for political and it's exciting for me

912
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:15,240
because like I said I see people who you

913
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:17,460
know they really do they they they

914
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:21,119
invest a lot of their time and money and

915
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,949
and they've they've they've been Sham

916
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,799
dan and you'll see their pictures and

917
00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:27,299
they're so excited and and you know I'm

918
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,820
I'm not gonna be the one that breaks

919
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,620
their heart and just it pulls the dick

920
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,170
move and tells them dude you're not

921
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:36,329
you're not growing purple purple bud

922
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:39,059
your growth you guys want to watch your

923
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:42,239
Crooklyn but it's not article you know

924
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:44,610
I'm not gonna do that but it does it

925
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,039
pisses me off to see that because it

926
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:49,320
just tells me how many people are out

927
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:53,039
there that are just doing it to turn a

928
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:54,780
dime and it's just you know it bothers

929
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,139
me and this isn't what it's about

930
00:49:54,780 --> 00:50:00,300
it's everything especially in this

931
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:03,019
industry if you look around everything

932
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,980
is about the almighty dollar again and

933
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:08,280
the money's great

934
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:11,159
money's great I wish I had more of it

935
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,950
but that's that's not what it's about

936
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:17,730
for me it's it's about producing the bed

937
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:20,399
cannabis that I can possibly produce and

938
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:23,369
putting smile on smiles on growers faces

939
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,200
I want them to repeat our name I want

940
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:27,480
them to tell their friends have you

941
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:29,519
grown any of this guy stuff

942
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,710
no well then look I'm gonna get you a

943
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,530
pack because that's how you know that's

944
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:37,440
how strongly I feel about about his

945
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:39,269
lines is there they are what they say

946
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:44,220
they are when he gives you information

947
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:45,929
on you know the packaging or whatever

948
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:49,879
when he tells you this is what you can

949
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:53,429
expect that's what you can expect that

950
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,588
you know it's a like I said it just

951
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:58,230
pisses me off to see so many people that

952
00:50:55,588 --> 00:51:01,440
think they're growing the actual herbal

953
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:05,670
cut and it's it's not and we're gonna

954
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,889
cube the PJ we're gonna bring out the

955
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:10,380
Arkell and that's all God that's the

956
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:13,170
best thing about her is from the Gekko

957
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,720
just the the initial females that we

958
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:19,318
were running from the initial cross of

959
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:22,259
the herbal and the purple Jackie I mean

960
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:25,289
you're already seeing extremely fertile

961
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,150
dumphy knows regularly without even

962
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:29,608
trying

963
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:32,130
just the expressions and it's exciting

964
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:34,170
it's really exciting to see you know

965
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:38,519
something coming to fruition and I can't

966
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:41,579
once I get to that that fourth cross I

967
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:44,159
can't imagine what what we're gonna see

968
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:47,369
I I don't even expect it to have to be

969
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:51,539
cubed I don't think I'll have to go that

970
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:57,079
far I truly think you know we'll we'll

971
00:51:51,539 --> 00:52:00,179
walk search our initial F one's for the

972
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:02,630
brother and sister that represents it

973
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:06,210
well enough and and then our back cross

974
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:08,579
with our goal the selection process I

975
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:11,519
believe by the third time through a

976
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:15,240
you're gonna see full herbal dominance

977
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:17,460
in the seed and and you know not that we

978
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:20,549
won't take it to the to the fourth I

979
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:24,059
can't say that at this point but I'm

980
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:27,539
absolutely 100% positive what you're

981
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:30,599
gonna see from from the PJ

982
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:33,869
hybrid the PJ Oracle hybrids is gonna be

983
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:37,650
very very very herbal very Oracle

984
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:41,429
dominant and that's the goal I mean you

985
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:45,260
know that's the goal as far as the dua

986
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:47,460
growth synthetic do I grow organic yes

987
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:51,390
we have to

988
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:53,490
we do use synthetics my my personal head

989
00:52:51,389 --> 00:52:59,219
stash is organic

990
00:52:53,489 --> 00:53:04,049
I do believe in a very clean pot i I

991
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:05,309
want nothing but why - I I don't want

992
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,769
any you know

993
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:11,639
pesticides I don't want any [ __ ] in

994
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:14,429
my pot for one I do have lupus and I

995
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:20,909
have to be very specific in what I

996
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:23,730
intake ingest breathe so my head stash

997
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:26,429
is organic but to be fair to the growers

998
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:29,429
I have to grow and sit with synthetics

999
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:32,219
as well because you're still over half

1000
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:34,889
of your growers you know are using

1001
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:36,779
synthetic nutrients and you'd be amazed

1002
00:53:34,889 --> 00:53:39,839
at how many people I still come across

1003
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:42,990
so that will come up and send me an

1004
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:46,410
email or a message and they'll say hey

1005
00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:48,629
you know my plants doing this and and I

1006
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:51,299
don't know why I'm only four weeks in

1007
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:53,910
the flower and the first question I ask

1008
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,760
is okay well tell me a little bit about

1009
00:53:53,909 --> 00:54:00,629
what you're using and their first thing

1010
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:03,330
they'll say is well you know my miracle

1011
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:06,599
grow it's just that I'm beating it as

1012
00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:10,619
the bottle label and then it rhythms are

1013
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:13,049
you can [ __ ] with me it's like you're

1014
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:15,449
Syrian and I can't be asked about it

1015
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,580
because these you know these rowers

1016
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:19,559
they're they're they're really they're

1017
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:22,559
trying they're committed and they don't

1018
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:26,190
know any better and this day and age I'm

1019
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:28,110
suppressing with what the way everybody

1020
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:30,360
knows Monsanto as much as they do

1021
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:34,890
they're people that are still growing

1022
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:38,160
with the [ __ ] and you know so I do I

1023
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:41,519
have to use synthetics and I have to I

1024
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:46,049
guess I shouldn't say I

1025
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:50,099
- but in my brain the way my brain works

1026
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:52,590
to be fair to everybody and and to give

1027
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:56,460
them a product that I'm I'm confident in

1028
00:54:52,590 --> 00:55:00,059
I do I I have to grow synthetically and

1029
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,710
I have to be able to say you know how

1030
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:05,070
they're gonna perform with synthetics

1031
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:09,119
with organics outdoors indoors light

1032
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:13,289
that greenhouse um you know it's it's

1033
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:17,880
just if if your goal is to produce the

1034
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:21,409
best and and you know be confident in it

1035
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:24,329
that's that that's all part of the game

1036
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:27,719
yeah yeah completely makes sense

1037
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:30,929
so um in terms of your strains you use a

1038
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:33,149
really good descriptive and categorical

1039
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:34,618
way of describing them to customers you

1040
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:37,200
know you lose things such as the number

1041
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:39,329
of phenotypes and what to expect from

1042
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,759
each phenotype as well as you know your

1043
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:43,880
standard flowering times and rough

1044
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,080
stretch values and things like that

1045
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,480
there are a few other breeders who use

1046
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,039
this same general layer and it's really

1047
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,340
good do you think this type of

1048
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:55,559
information is it's not only like just a

1049
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,869
service to the customer by giving them

1050
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,139
more information but it's also almost

1051
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:02,760
mandatory these days because in a way

1052
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:05,730
you're showing people that you've grown

1053
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,500
out the seeds you've you've taken note

1054
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,969
of all these traits because something

1055
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,789
which seems to come up more and more is

1056
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:13,108
like this idea of like you know I don't

1057
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:15,809
know if I should call them breeders but

1058
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:17,279
you know quote breeders who make seeds

1059
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:18,960
and like they don't even test them and

1060
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,019
they're just like straight to market so

1061
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,670
like in a way you're indicating that

1062
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:25,440
like no that's not me you know like I've

1063
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:27,900
done the testing I've done what I need

1064
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,730
to do or in your opinion is it not so

1065
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,700
much that it's it's more just like for

1066
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:36,530
the customers benefit oh it's totally

1067
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:39,118
for the customers benefit I want to know

1068
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:42,570
you know because a lot of people they

1069
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:45,420
don't have you know five thousand square

1070
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:47,820
feet of space to work with most growers

1071
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,519
have 1/10 most growers have a corner in

1072
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:52,800
a bedroom or crawlspace in an attic

1073
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,239
you've got growers that have five foot

1074
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,880
ceilings

1075
00:56:54,239 --> 00:57:00,209
and so you need to be able to tell them

1076
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,309
this is not the strain for you and the

1077
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:05,849
only way that you can do that is by

1078
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:09,150
having grown the lines yourself and it

1079
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:11,760
pisses me off to no end to see these

1080
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:14,700
guys and I'm again I don't do the whole

1081
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,650
and I'm gonna call this guy out it's

1082
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:23,189
it's usually it's the bigger outfit that

1083
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:26,190
they run the pollination they process

1084
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:28,380
their seeds they cure them they're in

1085
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:30,929
the package and they're out to market

1086
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,900
there's no testing you know where's

1087
00:57:30,929 --> 00:57:37,199
where's your viability rates um you know

1088
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:39,630
what what percent of the parent lines

1089
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:42,029
are gonna show what's your male to

1090
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:44,280
female ratio they can't tell you I mean

1091
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:46,320
they'll they'll make some [ __ ] up yeah

1092
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,780
of course and they'll put some warning

1093
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,250
on a package because it looks good but

1094
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:53,280
the fact of the matter is they're not

1095
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:54,420
testing their own products out and I

1096
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,140
think it's [ __ ]

1097
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:00,869
III it hurts me tremendously because

1098
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:02,848
again it comes back to the almighty

1099
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:04,710
dollar and the quicker you can get

1100
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:08,010
product to market the quicker you're

1101
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:11,309
getting a paycheck and I'll go broken

1102
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:13,230
poor doing what I love making sure that

1103
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:16,469
the customer knows exactly what they're

1104
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:18,449
growing before I ever do that I've been

1105
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:21,868
doing this for a very long time I

1106
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:25,230
haven't changed my ways I've not gotten

1107
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:29,130
close to being rich financially I've

1108
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:31,139
gotten rich in other ways that most

1109
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,789
people will never get to experience in

1110
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:35,368
their life I've got to share it with my

1111
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:43,130
with my daughter and my wonderful wife

1112
00:58:35,369 --> 00:58:46,019
of 16 years and that well to me is more

1113
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:49,019
important than any wealth I can put into

1114
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:53,159
my wallet or my bank account and I want

1115
00:58:49,019 --> 00:58:55,559
the growers to feel confident in the

1116
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:56,489
strains that they're giving um you know

1117
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,469
and of course there's gonna be

1118
00:58:56,489 --> 00:59:01,919
exceptions it's a plant you're gonna

1119
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:06,509
have recessive traits that show up from

1120
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,950
lineage way way way gone by and it's

1121
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,560
it's always going to happen

1122
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:12,358
always have the growers that are like

1123
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,119
hey you know this plant was supposed to

1124
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:18,059
stay short and squat but it grew a

1125
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,220
single Cola even when I topped it and it

1126
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:22,828
was wanting to grow 8 9 feet in my

1127
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:24,569
little space it's it's gonna happen it

1128
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:29,070
will happen there's no way around it but

1129
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:32,088
I want that to happen as little as

1130
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:36,539
possible and the only way I can assure

1131
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:38,940
myself of that happening is growing out

1132
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:42,480
my own product and that's why it's a

1133
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:48,630
slow tedious task but anything we create

1134
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:50,699
is tested is tested thoroughly we I want

1135
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:53,338
to know what it's gonna do in a small

1136
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:56,368
space I want to be able to tell the

1137
00:59:53,338 --> 01:00:00,449
grower you know if you're growing with

1138
00:59:56,369 --> 01:00:03,809
this style maybe some LST it works great

1139
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:05,909
in the sea of green or in a screen and

1140
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:10,199
the only way to do that is by you to

1141
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:13,799
actually doing it yourself and I it's

1142
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:16,129
it's a constant testing process and

1143
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:20,150
there's a lot of times that I'm growing

1144
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:23,130
strains that you know that aren't

1145
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:25,950
specifically for what I was looking for

1146
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:29,130
for my personal use because I'm growing

1147
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:31,108
am i I feel it's probably gonna kind of

1148
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:33,630
kind of sound lame but I'm growing it

1149
01:00:31,108 --> 01:00:36,389
for other people and not in a sense that

1150
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:38,579
I'm providing to the dispensary I'm

1151
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:41,670
growing so I can tell other people what

1152
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:44,609
they can expect from this line or from

1153
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:46,680
this line and I want to be able to make

1154
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:50,159
recommendations when when somebody

1155
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:52,828
approaches me and asks me ok this is my

1156
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:55,679
circumstance this is what I'm using this

1157
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:58,740
is this is everything and this is what

1158
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:01,799
I'm looking for in my pot I want to be

1159
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:03,449
able to tell them this one this one or

1160
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,660
this one will be right up your alley

1161
01:01:03,449 --> 01:01:08,969
this is this is gonna be what you want

1162
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:12,929
for your space for the way you are

1163
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:16,348
growing you you you don't want to have

1164
01:01:12,929 --> 01:01:20,730
an you know a less experienced grower

1165
01:01:16,349 --> 01:01:21,840
have to change the their comfortability

1166
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:26,250
and grow

1167
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:28,650
to suit a plant that it's gonna be such

1168
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:30,630
a pain in the ass that it's gonna turn

1169
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:32,369
them off or growing for a while you

1170
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:35,430
don't want them to experience headaches

1171
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:40,019
and hassles you want them to be able to

1172
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:43,199
to grow in in their realm and in their

1173
01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:45,030
their comfortability factor you wanna

1174
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:48,809
you want to keep it in there you know

1175
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:51,420
and that that's the goal is is you can

1176
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:54,420
you can produce strains that you know

1177
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:57,539
that are potent that that are very tasty

1178
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:59,639
that yield or or the specifics that

1179
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:02,820
individual growers are looking for you

1180
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:07,469
can produce strains that fill the needs

1181
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:10,769
of growers and and it you know and them

1182
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:12,449
not have to adapt to a single plant each

1183
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,730
time they want to change and grow

1184
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:16,919
something else and a lot of people don't

1185
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,900
have confidence in seeds because it's a

1186
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:22,200
crapshoot you know a lot of people

1187
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:24,750
prefer to grow cuts because again

1188
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:26,969
growing from seed can be a crapshoot so

1189
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,460
they like to stay with cuts which like I

1190
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:34,099
said you bring in cuts from a dispensary

1191
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:35,490
and it has its own different set of

1192
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:38,940
headaches

1193
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:41,459
you got the powdery mildew issues you

1194
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,559
know any kind of fungus or diseases they

1195
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,480
don't really you know not oh I don't

1196
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:47,759
want to lump everybody into a big circle

1197
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:50,639
but a lot of dispensaries you know they

1198
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,410
don't they don't take the time to do

1199
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,389
what needs to be done the cuts they get

1200
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:56,009
them in as fast as they can think in the

1201
01:02:54,389 --> 01:02:57,299
routine as fast as they can in it

1202
01:02:56,010 --> 01:03:00,630
getting them out the door as best they

1203
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:02,550
can they're there as a business they're

1204
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:05,369
not there to suit the needs even though

1205
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:07,440
that's what they want you to believe you

1206
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:09,599
know of the person who is sick that is

1207
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,510
growing there their medication I mean

1208
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:15,630
you know and and trust me I know a lot

1209
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:17,970
of people that I do help that they grow

1210
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:20,460
pot because they are sick they're not

1211
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:22,709
growing pot to be stoned I mean I'm open

1212
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,599
for everything I mean if you want to

1213
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:26,789
smoke weed because you want to you know

1214
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:28,980
that's your form of relaxation and then

1215
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:31,949
it's like you know crack in the cold one

1216
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:35,880
yeah I'm totally fine with that I that

1217
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:39,328
was me before I got sick and I still can

1218
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,970
to myself a STONER for other reasons but

1219
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:45,539
most of it now is for proper medic

1220
01:03:41,969 --> 01:03:46,980
medicating and if you just don't want

1221
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:49,049
they're already dealing with the hassle

1222
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,059
of life with the circumstances that

1223
01:03:49,048 --> 01:03:53,548
they're under you don't want them to

1224
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:56,278
have to deal with issues from plants and

1225
01:03:53,548 --> 01:03:58,318
growing from clones and you know it has

1226
01:03:56,278 --> 01:04:01,318
its own hassle these people will get

1227
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:03,599
spider mites that are resistant to -

1228
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:06,960
organic pesticides so then what are they

1229
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:09,088
left to do I mean its nuclear its its

1230
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,130
nuclear war time because if you want to

1231
01:04:09,088 --> 01:04:13,500
keep the cut or now get your grow room

1232
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:16,349
back because you brought in some sheisty

1233
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:19,400
cuts from such and such this both it's

1234
01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:23,640
the only way to do it you know and and I

1235
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:26,160
it just bothers me because I know this

1236
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:28,379
industry could be so much better there

1237
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,899
could be so much more compassion in it

1238
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:34,349
and it all revolves around the damn

1239
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:36,450
dollar and it I don't know it just it's

1240
01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:38,519
bothersome to me that's why we do it

1241
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:40,078
different that's why we always have done

1242
01:04:38,518 --> 01:04:43,709
it different we always will do it

1243
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,960
different and that's I just I I just

1244
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:47,579
want a person to know when they're

1245
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,440
getting our label they're getting those

1246
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:51,990
ten seeds their germination rates are

1247
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,088
gonna be high and it's gonna do what

1248
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:55,889
they expect it to do it's just plain and

1249
01:04:54,088 --> 01:04:59,099
simple it's that easy and the only way

1250
01:04:55,889 --> 01:05:02,009
it's gonna happen is if you your self

1251
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:04,920
are growing them out and I'm not saying

1252
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:07,528
oh yeah we we tested we tested five of

1253
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,630
those strings you tested five so you

1254
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:11,039
yourself than you test the whole pack is

1255
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:14,068
something you created that you're not

1256
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,650
selling to the masses no we tested a

1257
01:05:14,068 --> 01:05:19,619
hundred and five you know I mean we went

1258
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:22,710
through fifteen packs of ten to make

1259
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:24,869
sure the consistency was there you know

1260
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:27,778
how many times did we see a recessive

1261
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:30,240
female how many times did we see the

1262
01:05:27,778 --> 01:05:33,358
targeted female how many times did we

1263
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:36,088
see you know the exact one that

1264
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:39,119
everybody is after I mean you document

1265
01:05:36,088 --> 01:05:40,858
you documents you test you grow and and

1266
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,170
that's that's called knowledge that's

1267
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:45,538
that's called knowing your product and

1268
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:49,710
that's one thing I am very proud of my

1269
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:52,320
wife and I I I feel that

1270
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:55,650
we set ourselves apart from everybody

1271
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:58,140
else because though we're not you know

1272
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:01,289
trying to work with a hundred different

1273
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:03,629
strains we're working with a base and

1274
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:06,029
I'm working with that base because I

1275
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:08,010
know that base better than anybody knows

1276
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:10,410
their base because I've been working

1277
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:13,170
with these for years not for months

1278
01:06:10,409 --> 01:06:15,029
didn't just bring in the cookies and now

1279
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,750
I'm working with it now I'm releasing it

1280
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:18,180
to you guys

1281
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:21,300
I've been working with my lines for

1282
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:23,219
years I'm creating hybrids from my lines

1283
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:26,760
and I've been working with them for

1284
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:30,449
years I'm selecting specific traits to

1285
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:33,000
work into hybrid form because I know

1286
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:36,419
what those said traits are gonna do in

1287
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,389
hybrid form one grown out and I think

1288
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:42,300
that's a direct reflection on who we are

1289
01:06:39,389 --> 01:06:45,690
and what we want for the growing

1290
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:46,280
community and you know it's just how it

1291
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:50,909
is

1292
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:54,210
okay so moving to a bit more of like a

1293
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:57,210
macro topic for a breeder what's it like

1294
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:58,829
the years kind of you know like I hope

1295
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:02,220
not to offend you with this but as kind

1296
01:06:58,829 --> 01:07:03,900
of a more smaller breeder what's it like

1297
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,969
to interact with the seed banks you know

1298
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:08,940
like your gear is out there but it's not

1299
01:07:05,969 --> 01:07:12,000
like on attitude or seedsman like you

1300
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:15,300
know like those all Cultra big name seed

1301
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,010
banks do you not want to be on there or

1302
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:19,320
do you think I it's a bit hard to get

1303
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:22,050
noticed by them at times or do you think

1304
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:24,088
like no I've got you know kind of like a

1305
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:25,230
niche I'm looking to fill and I feel

1306
01:07:24,088 --> 01:07:27,210
like I'm kind of doing that at the

1307
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:27,780
moment and I don't need to be a part of

1308
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:33,780
any of that

1309
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:39,660
oh god that's such a large question well

1310
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:42,750
first I loved being known as a true

1311
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:47,190
mom-and-pop if you will because that's

1312
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:50,730
how I see us again for us it's it's not

1313
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:55,470
about the the bulk the mass of it it's

1314
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:59,990
about the refined search product

1315
01:07:55,469 --> 01:08:03,419
knowledge and and and keeping it real so

1316
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:07,078
to coin the term mom and pop it

1317
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:10,970
suits us fine no we don't mind being as

1318
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:14,309
smaller well we'll say smaller known

1319
01:08:10,969 --> 01:08:16,588
size-wise I don't know I wouldn't say

1320
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:20,759
we're small when it comes to the space

1321
01:08:16,588 --> 01:08:23,719
but size-wise and and how we're known

1322
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:27,630
yes yes sir we are we are a definite

1323
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:34,170
mom-and-pop now as far as the notoriety

1324
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:35,909
factor and being on the attitude we've

1325
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:38,730
attempted to go that route we've been

1326
01:08:35,909 --> 01:08:44,189
approached time and time again by the

1327
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:47,039
the big seed outfits and both times that

1328
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:49,678
we we thought we were going in those

1329
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:54,960
directions we did everything we could to

1330
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:58,319
stay on the down low to get the seeds

1331
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,359
into the hands of the bigger will say UK

1332
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:03,650
guys that are going to do the the

1333
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:10,609
distribution or the Spain the Spanish

1334
01:09:03,649 --> 01:09:16,379
seed outfits and both times I've lost

1335
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:19,588
I've lost quite a bit to him and it has

1336
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:23,489
taught me a lesson for instance with one

1337
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:27,689
of them that's now defunct I lost 90

1338
01:09:23,488 --> 01:09:30,568
packs of one of our of our lines and

1339
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:32,309
it's because I put trust in the people

1340
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:35,219
because I'm I'm a trusting person

1341
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:38,850
because I know when I tell somebody

1342
01:09:35,219 --> 01:09:42,569
something they can trust it 100 and I

1343
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:44,460
oftentimes believe that the same with

1344
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:48,298
the person that I'm dealing with in

1345
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:52,640
often times it's not and I've had to

1346
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:56,579
learn that lesson the hard way and so

1347
01:09:52,640 --> 01:10:01,429
we've done it and like I said I've been

1348
01:09:56,579 --> 01:10:05,309
taken and it's it's it's it's not about

1349
01:10:01,429 --> 01:10:07,829
the finances it's it's it's the it's

1350
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:14,429
about just the idea that you were just

1351
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:17,309
used and so right now we we've kind of

1352
01:10:14,429 --> 01:10:22,800
moved far enough away that it's not

1353
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:26,310
fresh in my mind so we are open to to

1354
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:29,610
you know to giving another try but there

1355
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:32,460
there will have to be stipulations

1356
01:10:29,609 --> 01:10:34,500
there's there's there's only one way

1357
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:38,010
that we're gonna do it now because we've

1358
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:41,189
had to learn the lessons and like I said

1359
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:45,690
you put trust in two people and it's all

1360
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:48,710
lies and you end up finding out later on

1361
01:10:45,689 --> 01:10:53,179
that it was a big pyramid scheme and

1362
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:56,250
somebody is making a [ __ ] ton of money

1363
01:10:53,180 --> 01:11:00,690
off the backs of people that are doing

1364
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:04,680
the real work and it's you know that's

1365
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:08,219
not kosher with me and it would be very

1366
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:10,130
nice to get to get on with with the

1367
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:13,650
right crew somebody that's gonna

1368
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:16,350
appreciate us the way we'll appreciate

1369
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:18,719
them you provide me a service and I'm

1370
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:21,300
going to go even further out of my way

1371
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:23,390
to make sure you're happy because that's

1372
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:26,010
how we work that's how we've always been

1373
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:27,390
we'll provide our own freebies that you

1374
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:30,210
can give out and there's a lot of things

1375
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:34,369
that we we go above and beyond with ya

1376
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:37,140
it's just that fear factor of you know

1377
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:40,470
dealing with an [ __ ] who's just out

1378
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:42,390
to screw you in the end you know that's

1379
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:45,300
that's the reason behind that it's not

1380
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:47,280
that we don't want you that's not that

1381
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:50,100
it's that's not the ultimate goal

1382
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:52,649
because absolutely that is I mean for

1383
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:57,630
the last 10 years it wasn't my wife

1384
01:11:52,649 --> 01:11:59,969
wasn't real keen on the idea for one we

1385
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:02,579
didn't want to jump into that pool and

1386
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:06,480
and worry about you know is somebody

1387
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:08,489
coming for us all the time yeah and once

1388
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:11,549
we moved out of that and the fear had

1389
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:13,949
subsided and and then it was now we've

1390
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:16,199
gotten screwed by an [ __ ] that was in

1391
01:12:13,949 --> 01:12:18,869
this for the wrong reasons and now we're

1392
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:22,800
kind of getting over that and the ideas

1393
01:12:18,869 --> 01:12:25,649
is appealing we're we're ready to expand

1394
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,310
the horizon for ourselves we're ready to

1395
01:12:25,649 --> 01:12:30,839
make the label more known and that's the

1396
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:34,980
goal

1397
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,599
is I myself I'm ready to put myself out

1398
01:12:34,979 --> 01:12:39,419
there a little bit more because my

1399
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:41,670
daughter is getting older she needs to

1400
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:43,079
go to college in two years she say honor

1401
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:45,210
student straight A's

1402
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:48,029
never gotten anything less than three

1403
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:53,158
days thank you and something else I take

1404
01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:58,309
great pride in um she's in all AP

1405
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:58,309
classes which in the states are college

1406
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:07,739
college basically pre-college courses

1407
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:10,710
yeah exactly and you know my wife and I

1408
01:13:07,738 --> 01:13:12,149
that's our pride and joy and she wants

1409
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:17,908
to go to Humboldt State and it's gonna

1410
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:21,238
cost mom and dad about 75 K a year and I

1411
01:13:17,908 --> 01:13:24,868
want to fulfill I want to fulfill that

1412
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:29,939
for my daughter um you know III want her

1413
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:32,039
to get her degree and my plan is for her

1414
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:34,888
to come back and run run the company one

1415
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:38,099
day but she's really not interested in

1416
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:40,289
that at this point in time but hey you

1417
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:42,569
know there's always that chance and I

1418
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:46,979
think if she's wanting to go to Humboldt

1419
01:13:42,569 --> 01:13:49,590
State that's a great start so the next

1420
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:53,549
question would be what would be your

1421
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:55,500
advice to someone who's trying to become

1422
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:57,000
a Brady and maybe they've been doing

1423
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,679
their own thing is a bit of an amateur

1424
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,840
for a while but they're ready to try to

1425
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:02,429
you know step it up what's your advice

1426
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,869
you know one thing I've heard is you

1427
01:14:02,429 --> 01:14:05,760
know you really need to get a social

1428
01:14:03,868 --> 01:14:09,329
media presence what do you think of some

1429
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:11,940
things people need to do well um it

1430
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:15,000
depends on what what aspect you're

1431
01:14:11,939 --> 01:14:17,729
looking at them my biggest advice is is

1432
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,359
somebody who is wanting to to truly get

1433
01:14:17,729 --> 01:14:23,098
into it is is and know what you're doing

1434
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,589
obviously but know your lines you're

1435
01:14:23,099 --> 01:14:28,260
working with know your product the ends

1436
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:31,409
and outs of it be confident in what

1437
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:35,310
you're doing and then once you you feel

1438
01:14:31,408 --> 01:14:37,769
confident in in your product then yeah

1439
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:39,690
then and if you're willing and that's

1440
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:44,639
what you want to do put yourself out

1441
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:49,168
there go to like here in Cali we have

1442
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:51,958
the emerald-cut do meet-and-greets like

1443
01:14:49,168 --> 01:14:56,429

know be a good person and and and the

1450
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:21,239
rest will follow

1451
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:24,809
you know just it's it's it's not so much

1452
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:27,058
about the notoriety as it is about your

1453
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:29,340
personality and who you are and how you

1454
01:15:27,059 --> 01:15:32,519
treat people because if you do it right

1455
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:34,649
people are gonna like it and and and

1456
01:15:32,519 --> 01:15:38,969
they're gonna do the advertising for you

1457
01:15:34,649 --> 01:15:42,809
and you you know that just just be good

1458
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:45,208
to the people that that are obviously

1459
01:15:42,809 --> 01:15:48,630
being good and supporting you and and

1460
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:54,779
just be who you are and don't be a

1461
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:57,599
tight-ass you know give give give you

1462
01:15:54,779 --> 01:16:01,529
know like us we probably still give away

1463
01:15:57,599 --> 01:16:03,149
maybe not so much now but there was a

1464
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:06,359
point in time when we were giving away

1465
01:16:03,149 --> 01:16:09,689
two or three times more seeds then then

1466
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:12,418
we were selling seeds and that's great

1467
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:15,989
there's nothing wrong with that but if

1468
01:16:12,418 --> 01:16:17,908
you're dependent upon the income that

1469
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,018
can't be a bit of a struggle and you

1470
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:21,768
know if you're paying for all the

1471
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:24,059
postage of everything going out and

1472
01:16:21,769 --> 01:16:27,090
everything and and you're you're

1473
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:31,288
covering all the expensive in it hey you

1474
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:34,189
know like it can be a it can cost you a

1475
01:16:31,288 --> 01:16:36,868
bit but yeah I just go to events

1476
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:41,249
socialize make it clear what you're

1477
01:16:36,868 --> 01:16:43,549
doing be able to have full-on

1478
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:46,158
conversations where you can be asked any

1479
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:49,229
question and and you know the answer

1480
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:53,819
know the ins and outs of what your

1481
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:55,860
product is and and be be passionate

1482
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:57,688
about it don't don't get in it for the

1483
01:16:55,859 --> 01:16:58,500
wrong reason don't do it because you

1484
01:16:57,689 --> 01:17:00,900
think

1485
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:04,020
gonna get rich and famous that's wrong

1486
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:08,489
to think you know you you do it for the

1487
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:10,590
love yes oh you you know you do it

1488
01:17:08,489 --> 01:17:11,369
because that's that's what you love

1489
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:15,119
doing

1490
01:17:11,369 --> 01:17:19,949
yeah so on that same kind of idea I've

1491
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:22,769
often heard people you know kind of tote

1492
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:25,349
this idea of like oh man it would be so

1493
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:28,230
good to be a breeder and I've literally

1494
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:30,240
heard this quote like I would just smoke

1495
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:32,549
weed and look after plants all day you

1496
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,859
know so yeah is that like this

1497
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:36,900
idealistic description like from what

1498
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:40,409
I've seen breeders seem to work like the

1499
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:41,879
longest hours of any like yeah yeah give

1500
01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:43,409
us a true picture of what it's like to

1501
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:48,630
be a breeder you know a day in the life

1502
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:52,139
of it is so not like that do i smoke a

1503
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:55,050
lot of weed yeah do I get to smoke as

1504
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:58,920
much as I want no I'm too busy doing

1505
01:17:55,050 --> 01:18:02,550
other said they get to constantly stop

1506
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:05,970
and medicate well let's say you don't

1507
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:08,279
have scheduled days off things are gonna

1508
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:11,400
come up that you wouldn't ever expect in

1509
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:14,479
a million years your workloads always

1510
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:17,129
gonna be greater than expected or

1511
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:18,989
anytime you make plans you might as well

1512
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:23,819
cancel them in advance because it's not

1513
01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:27,119
going to take place you know your your

1514
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:28,199
days they start when they start and they

1515
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,149
end when they end

1516
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:33,149
there's no I'm working 9:00 to 5:00

1517
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:37,139
today I go in at 9:00 I'm you know might

1518
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:40,859
be home by 5:30 no you're done your task

1519
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:42,600
is done and get used to late nights and

1520
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:45,779
I'm not talking 10:00 or 11:00 I'm

1521
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,700
talking 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning we

1522
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:51,869
didn't get to sleep last night because

1523
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:54,000
obviously when at work because we've got

1524
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:56,220
plants on different different cycles

1525
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:00,119
somewhere in the dark in the day some

1526
01:18:56,220 --> 01:19:04,829
are in the dark at night so it's it's a

1527
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:07,890
constant remembering who's where and you

1528
01:19:04,829 --> 01:19:10,199
know I get used to working on two or

1529
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:11,460
three hours of sleep or we're doubling

1530
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:14,219
up and

1531
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:16,980
and and and not having sleep and then

1532
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:18,510
this time of the year because it's a

1533
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:22,799
harvest season

1534
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:25,590
I get really used to being on basically

1535
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,920
on-call because it's it's just what it

1536
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:31,469
is it's not it's not the lifestyle that

1537
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:35,090
people think it is

1538
01:19:31,469 --> 01:19:39,060
we actually don't get to go to as many

1539
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:41,130
harvest festivals or competitions that

1540
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:44,310
we would like to or get to do things

1541
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:47,029
with the growers out there that we would

1542
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:51,030
love to get to do because we're working

1543
01:19:47,029 --> 01:19:52,800
I mean you know just to get the to do

1544
01:19:51,029 --> 01:19:54,869
the meet and greet that we did last

1545
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,500
weekend it's I guess a month of

1546
01:19:54,869 --> 01:20:00,029
coordinating and planning and and and

1547
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,630
and you know I've got a really good

1548
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:04,259
friend

1549
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:07,050
thank God was able to get all of us our

1550
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:09,690
spot arranged and and help me get the

1551
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:12,869
directions and and the times and

1552
01:20:09,689 --> 01:20:15,238
everything out there because it's you

1553
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:18,390
know there's there's no eight-hour days

1554
01:20:15,238 --> 01:20:21,539
it would be nice to have a five day a

1555
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:23,789
week if I can do what I do and have it

1556
01:20:21,539 --> 01:20:27,289
be a five day a week 40 hours a week

1557
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:31,679
type of thing oh my it would be heavenly

1558
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:34,109
it's it's not the the the glamour and

1559
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,929
the glory that that people tend to think

1560
01:20:34,109 --> 01:20:39,988
that it is especially if you're if

1561
01:20:36,929 --> 01:20:43,619
you're committed to it it's transplants

1562
01:20:39,988 --> 01:20:45,178
its watering it's feeding it's you know

1563
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:47,069
and then if like I said running

1564
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:49,289
synthetic nutrients you you're

1565
01:20:47,069 --> 01:20:53,609
constantly adjusting and checking ph's

1566
01:20:49,289 --> 01:20:55,789
and how much it's sterilization of

1567
01:20:53,609 --> 01:21:00,539
containers and drip trays and and

1568
01:20:55,789 --> 01:21:05,100
cleaning of hoods and it's I I could

1569
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:07,729
write a book on the workload of the list

1570
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:12,600
of things that don't have to be done and

1571
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:15,689
socialite there is none not not for true

1572
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,719
breeders you know and and we're not like

1573
01:21:15,689 --> 01:21:21,238
some of the bigger outfits that have a

1574
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:24,539
crew that that they are able to pay to

1575
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:25,319
do to do the the grant work I mean it's

1576
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:28,590
my wife and

1577
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:30,449
we do the grant work you know and I

1578
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:35,250
wouldn't have it any other way this

1579
01:21:30,449 --> 01:21:37,829
isn't a complaint it it does wear on my

1580
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:42,390
body because like I said I do I do have

1581
01:21:37,829 --> 01:21:46,140
lupus and sometimes it's really bad my

1582
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:50,900
13 surgeries due to my disease and and

1583
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:53,640
sometimes it it can be overpowering and

1584
01:21:50,899 --> 01:21:56,460
and like I said my wife is the most

1585
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:59,190
amazing person I've ever met she's

1586
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:04,579
probably the hardest worker I've ever

1587
01:21:59,189 --> 01:22:08,460
known and she's able to do things that

1588
01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:11,329
I'd still to this day I still get blown

1589
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:13,859
away by what she's able to accomplish

1590
01:22:11,329 --> 01:22:18,300
she's one of the best growers that I

1591
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:21,449
know and I'm just very thankful to have

1592
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:23,579
a partner in life and the partner in the

1593
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:27,720
business that I have or else this

1594
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:30,269
wouldn't be and I'll never complain yo

1595
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:32,880
you'll never not see me smiling or

1596
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:35,550
joking and even when I have a hospital

1597
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:38,010
visit due to my disease I'm cracking up

1598
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:40,739
with the doctor and the nurses just

1599
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:44,430
because that's that's just kind of to

1600
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:47,429
use a more modern term that's how I roll

1601
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:49,920
that's how I roll yeah so basically

1602
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:52,050
you're saying you just want to smoke

1603
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,199
weed all day and not do a bunch of hard

1604
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:58,690
work should probably be a rapper

1605
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:58,689
[Laughter]

1606
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:07,050
yeah so in the recent kind of six months

1607
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,340
or so we've seen a lot of I mean it's

1608
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:09,720
probably been a bit longer than that but

1609
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:12,510
a particularly on line we've seen like

1610
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:14,190
this rise in crowd mentality around

1611
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:18,119
strains you know the big one you know

1612
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:20,189
the Big Blue Dream hay wagon yeah you

1613
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:22,409
know you know as a little side note I

1614
01:23:20,189 --> 01:23:25,079
always have to remind people like like

1615
01:23:22,409 --> 01:23:27,029
Blue Dream like it did so much for so

1616
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:28,890
many people like like it's just all

1617
01:23:27,029 --> 01:23:32,309
disregarded in this whole argument but

1618
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:33,600
anyway so with that being said though

1619
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:35,039
how do you feel about the crowd

1620
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,780
mentality you know and you kind of

1621
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:38,510
alluded to it earlier you know like as

1622
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:40,639
much as blue drink it's a negative

1623
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:42,829
Rapp cookies gets a positive rap and

1624
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:45,889
Juji fool gets a positive rap and you

1625
01:23:42,828 --> 01:23:48,500
know does it does that sit okay with you

1626
01:23:45,889 --> 01:23:50,989
and if regardless you know do you not

1627
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:53,630
feel like maybe in a few years time

1628
01:23:50,988 --> 01:23:56,178
we'll see this big you know the same

1629
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:57,440
hate that's getting on Blue Dream you

1630
01:23:56,179 --> 01:23:59,059
know that's gonna be on Girl Scout

1631
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:00,618
cookies and there'll be some new thing

1632
01:23:59,059 --> 01:24:02,029
which everyone's all over at the time

1633
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:07,308
you know what I mean like it's just a

1634
01:24:02,029 --> 01:24:09,469
family changing thing yeah well the one

1635
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:12,199
aspect will just take cookies for

1636
01:24:09,469 --> 01:24:16,578
instance the one aspect about cookies

1637
01:24:12,198 --> 01:24:18,799
that blue dream didn't have well is the

1638
01:24:16,578 --> 01:24:22,759
fact that you've got the rapping

1639
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:24,260
community that you've got burner it's

1640
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:28,039
it's kind of lifestyle

1641
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:31,250
I mean you now have the cookie spam who

1642
01:24:28,038 --> 01:24:34,788
they've got an entire clothing line I

1643
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:40,279
mean it's a complete lifestyle so that

1644
01:24:34,788 --> 01:24:43,189
one I see carrying carrying itself

1645
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:45,529
longer-term if you will then say the

1646
01:24:43,189 --> 01:24:47,689
Blue Dream I mean the hype with the Blue

1647
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:50,359
Dream was because it was an amazing

1648
01:24:47,689 --> 01:24:54,229
strain of cannabis that they might talk

1649
01:24:50,359 --> 01:24:57,500
[ __ ] about now but you know two years

1650
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:59,569
ago that's all anybody was smoking

1651
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:03,288
that's all anybody wanted that's all

1652
01:24:59,569 --> 01:25:06,979
anybody was growing but it didn't have

1653
01:25:03,288 --> 01:25:10,250
that whole lifestyle um cookies has done

1654
01:25:06,979 --> 01:25:13,399
something I never would have imagined in

1655
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:15,380
in the cannabis community with the all

1656
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:19,069
the choices that people have and and

1657
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:21,500
everything and you it's kind of like I

1658
01:25:19,069 --> 01:25:30,408
said it's a lifestyle it's influenced

1659
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:34,460
its own industry it's just all of one

1660
01:25:30,408 --> 01:25:37,009
started out as one pot stream and that

1661
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:40,849
I'd never have seen anything like that

1662
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:43,400
so as far as that one how will that one

1663
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:46,460
carry a year two years from now I'm not

1664
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:50,750
really sure on that I see

1665
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:52,368
the gg4 I see that one fading as you

1666
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:54,710
know maybe the blue dream

1667
01:25:52,368 --> 01:25:58,729
I don't even know if that one will will

1668
01:25:54,710 --> 01:26:01,368
carry as long as as the blue dream did

1669
01:25:58,729 --> 01:26:03,589
for one gg4 in the outdoor scene here

1670
01:26:01,368 --> 01:26:05,929
she's not the yielder that the blue

1671
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:09,199
dream was if you look at the blue dream

1672
01:26:05,929 --> 01:26:12,219
from the grow aspect you could get you

1673
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:16,158
know done right you could get primo pot

1674
01:26:12,219 --> 01:26:19,189
and yields that set records even six

1675
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:23,629
seven pounds off of outdoor outdoor

1676
01:26:19,189 --> 01:26:27,049
plants of you know lower a grade for

1677
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:29,500
outdoor weed it's it's we consider this

1678
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:33,170
scale on just outdoor it's an A grade

1679
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:35,029
but even the dispensaries in the Midwest

1680
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:37,310
that are bringing an outdoor Cali weed

1681
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:42,079
and trying to pass it as as indoor it

1682
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:43,849
would be a high be a low a so that was

1683
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:47,029
one of the reasons that Blue Dream had

1684
01:26:43,849 --> 01:26:49,190
the the the weight that she had because

1685
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:52,399
she was an all-around strain she was a

1686
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:54,829
growers dream she was a toker stream so

1687
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:58,039
you know she was a dispensaries dream

1688
01:26:54,829 --> 01:27:01,420
because everybody had it but it's it's

1689
01:26:58,039 --> 01:27:05,000
it's like with a particular type of food

1690
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:08,210
at once everybody has had it and then

1691
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:12,289
that's so popular that's all you can

1692
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:14,569
find it becomes a burden and then nobody

1693
01:27:12,289 --> 01:27:17,689
wants it so then it tanks and that's

1694
01:27:14,569 --> 01:27:20,420
kind of where you know the blue dream

1695
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:23,569
went and I kind of see that with a GG

1696
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:26,810
for show she'll burn herself out That's

1697
01:27:23,569 --> 01:27:29,719
not me knocking these dreams that's just

1698
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:33,199
me saying that's how society works when

1699
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:36,829
it comes to these dreams and people want

1700
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:39,339
variety you know people want in the

1701
01:27:36,829 --> 01:27:43,250
morning they feel like maybe having

1702
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:46,940
something that's a bit of a earthy in

1703
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:48,829
sake coffee like you know with with

1704
01:27:46,939 --> 01:27:50,868
their breakfast or with their with their

1705
01:27:48,829 --> 01:27:53,090
their coffee and in the evening they

1706
01:27:50,868 --> 01:27:56,719
want something fruity you know so

1707
01:27:53,090 --> 01:28:00,050
there's there's gonna be variety and you

1708
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:05,118
know there's ice I see it being any more

1709
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:06,229
like that but again I'm not I don't know

1710
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:09,469
I I'm just

1711
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:11,840
big on the whole the this the strain

1712
01:28:09,469 --> 01:28:15,618
name game in the cut of the month I mean

1713
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:18,229
you look at sherbert cherry pie and

1714
01:28:15,618 --> 01:28:22,130
they're all great they're they're all

1715
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:24,889
really great but just to gain the

1716
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:28,458
notoriety that they do and and to have

1717
01:28:24,889 --> 01:28:31,639
people do the things they do to try and

1718
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:36,019
acquire it it's it's kind of crazy you

1719
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:38,900
know but III see it you'll have

1720
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:41,958
something else that comes out that takes

1721
01:28:38,899 --> 01:28:44,538
its place it's how it's work and it's it

1722
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:46,488
you know it's a cycle and then they

1723
01:28:44,538 --> 01:28:49,099
always like go in and they will always

1724
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:52,428
cycle out I think but like I said the

1725
01:28:49,099 --> 01:28:55,550
one I I I don't know what to expect of

1726
01:28:52,429 --> 01:28:59,208
is is the cookies and it's because it's

1727
01:28:55,550 --> 01:29:02,269
got its own it's a it's gonna sound

1728
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:05,288
following and and its own lifestyle and

1729
01:29:02,269 --> 01:29:07,489
it's almost like I guess I've been

1730
01:29:05,288 --> 01:29:09,408
ii-i've been checked by the whole

1731
01:29:07,488 --> 01:29:11,448
cookies thing why aren't you working

1732
01:29:09,408 --> 01:29:13,368
with cookies why aren't you you know

1733
01:29:11,448 --> 01:29:18,819
making any cookie hybrids it's a

1734
01:29:13,368 --> 01:29:22,639
personal choice for one I've never grown

1735
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:26,328
cookies I've never grown the forum I've

1736
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:28,400
never grown any of the cookies so now my

1737
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:30,768
brother my brother's grown probably

1738
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:33,708
every cookie that you can imagine my

1739
01:29:30,769 --> 01:29:39,079
brother likes to play the strain game he

1740
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:42,130
loves that because that's what was his

1741
01:29:39,078 --> 01:29:46,578
clientele that's what they demand of him

1742
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:50,269
and you know he's that's kind of his

1743
01:29:46,578 --> 01:29:52,939
business is taking care of what they

1744
01:29:50,269 --> 01:29:56,719
want with what everybody wants and he's

1745
01:29:52,939 --> 01:29:59,208
really good he doesn't like no other and

1746
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:02,748
that's what he does and I'm polar

1747
01:29:59,208 --> 01:30:05,840
opposite of that it sounds like you have

1748
01:30:02,748 --> 01:30:07,340
that more kind of organic artistic

1749
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:10,340
approach where you know where it's like

1750
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:12,529
it flows from me and it's not I don't

1751
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:16,610
want it to be influenced or like

1752
01:30:12,529 --> 01:30:18,828
commissioned or yeah anyway so kind of a

1753
01:30:16,609 --> 01:30:19,880
a little left-field of what we were just

1754
01:30:18,828 --> 01:30:25,130
talking about

1755
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:28,219
who is a breeder who you would want to

1756
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:29,000
do a collaboration with and if there

1757
01:30:28,219 --> 01:30:31,939
isn't any

1758
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:35,270
or maybe just as a follow-up who's

1759
01:30:31,939 --> 01:30:36,979
someone who maybe look up to is not the

1760
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:39,260
right word but you know who's someone

1761
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:40,848
whereas a breeder who's currently around

1762
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:42,260
you look at their work and you're like

1763
01:30:40,849 --> 01:30:44,060
yeah man like you're doing the right

1764
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:47,329
thing like everything you're doing I

1765
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:50,690
completely agree with that for me

1766
01:30:47,328 --> 01:30:53,988
there's only one name that truly stands

1767
01:30:50,689 --> 01:30:58,658
out that I'm and I hate to say but I

1768
01:30:53,988 --> 01:31:03,589
think because he's become so in demand

1769
01:30:58,658 --> 01:31:07,250
that and then he's done so well at it I

1770
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:09,710
think it's even kind of changing his his

1771
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:11,810
attitude towards things I don't know if

1772
01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:14,328
the attitude is the proper term but it's

1773
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:17,420
it's kind of changing the way he views

1774
01:31:14,328 --> 01:31:18,889
things a little bit it's it's it's kind

1775
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:22,429
of changing that that's the type of

1776
01:31:18,889 --> 01:31:24,469
person that he is and I'm I'm I don't

1777
01:31:22,429 --> 01:31:27,199
want that to sound like I'm I'm dick in

1778
01:31:24,469 --> 01:31:29,599
him that I'm I'm not whatsoever because

1779
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:33,169
he's he's what he's just one of the the

1780
01:31:29,599 --> 01:31:35,449
best people that you will ever meet it's

1781
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:41,658
just a really down-to-earth sensible

1782
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:44,269
understanding committed guy Bodhi yeah

1783
01:31:41,658 --> 01:31:44,899
Bodhi is a hell of a guy I knew you were

1784
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:48,070
gonna say that

1785
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:53,000
[Laughter]

1786
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:57,380
he's he's in it for the right reasons

1787
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,979
he's committed to his work and he's an

1788
01:31:57,380 --> 01:32:03,920
artist

1789
01:31:57,979 --> 01:32:08,718
he he's passionate and he has a keen

1790
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:12,670
understanding as well as an eye for what

1791
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:19,039
he's looking for and what he's doing and

1792
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:24,560
the guy is a master and he is you know

1793
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:28,158
he's well known and that doesn't doesn't

1794
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:30,590
really affect him I think he's so well

1795
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:33,049
known now that maybe it's it's starting

1796
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:33,350
to kind of alter it a little bit you

1797
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:35,840
know

1798
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:40,220
I was saying and I think again this

1799
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:42,550
isn't a negative response at all because

1800
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:47,780
I love the guy

1801
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:50,480
and I hope to god if I were to become as

1802
01:32:47,779 --> 01:32:53,960
successful as he is that it it wouldn't

1803
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:55,819
change me you know is something I think

1804
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:58,460
that's out of our hands I don't think we

1805
01:32:55,819 --> 01:33:01,429
can necessarily control it I think it's

1806
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:03,829
a product of the environment that that

1807
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:07,190
you are now in because your life will

1808
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:09,680
probably change you know everybody's

1809
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:11,629
wanting your time and and you know I

1810
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:15,500
mean I just think that you can't help

1811
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:18,590
but but that changing you and I kind of

1812
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:22,520
think that's what is is kind of taking

1813
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:25,310
place a little bit with Bodhi but as far

1814
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:27,530
as who he is and what he stands for

1815
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:30,289
he's the best guy in the industry you

1816
01:33:27,529 --> 01:33:32,029
couldn't ask for a better person um he's

1817
01:33:30,289 --> 01:33:35,390
a kind soul

1818
01:33:32,029 --> 01:33:40,699
he gives he's another one that gives as

1819
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:44,119
many as he sees does he sells and you

1820
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:48,800
know not just that but even in the the

1821
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:52,369
flower he gives there he's uh he's he's

1822
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:56,270
committed and I've never heard him say a

1823
01:33:52,369 --> 01:33:57,880
bad thing about anybody and he's never

1824
01:33:56,270 --> 01:34:03,950
gonna be one that talked [ __ ] about

1825
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:07,670
anybody and to what you you have to to

1826
01:34:03,949 --> 01:34:10,069
really really like about Bodhi is

1827
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:15,020
there's so many people that are now

1828
01:34:10,069 --> 01:34:18,019
making a name off of his work all the

1829
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:21,160
work that he's put in that he himself is

1830
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:25,280
busted his ass and spent so many years

1831
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:30,229
dedicated to you now have people that

1832
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:32,630
are using that and and not having done

1833
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:35,089
any of the damn legwork themselves and

1834
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:37,970
they're now using that and they're

1835
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:41,659
they're becoming really successful with

1836
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:45,539
it because Bodhi himself and and his

1837
01:34:41,659 --> 01:34:49,019
creations are so popular that the

1838
01:34:45,539 --> 01:34:51,329
and that's only gonna change on that end

1839
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:53,580
of the market the buyers they're gonna

1840
01:34:51,329 --> 01:34:55,019
have to be supportive of their of their

1841
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:57,029
favorite breeder and they're gonna have

1842
01:34:55,020 --> 01:35:00,470
to say wait a minute I'm gonna boycott

1843
01:34:57,029 --> 01:35:04,079
this guy because you're making the name

1844
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:07,020
from somebody else's work and somebody

1845
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,880
else's name and I'm not cool with that I

1846
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:11,670
mean if they don't have a problem and in

1847
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:14,069
most cases a Bodie he himself has no

1848
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:16,890
problem with it so I don't have a

1849
01:35:14,069 --> 01:35:19,799
problem with it per se but in many

1850
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:23,789
instances I do because you got some you

1851
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:26,550
know dumbass that's never done anything

1852
01:35:23,789 --> 01:35:29,238
and he just happened in two years to get

1853
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:32,760
extremely lucky and and put together a

1854
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:35,069
couple of binos that he found out of

1855
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:37,640
somebody else's hard work and he's kind

1856
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:41,039
of now made himself into something and

1857
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:43,500
and it bothers me because I'm one of

1858
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:48,810
those guys that have put in years not

1859
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:53,189
not one or two I put in years of my life

1860
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:55,830
into this and I you know I've should I

1861
01:35:53,189 --> 01:35:57,689
probably grown more plants and in five

1862
01:35:55,829 --> 01:36:00,149
years than most people will grow in a

1863
01:35:57,689 --> 01:36:02,939
lifetime and and you figure I've been

1864
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:05,969
doing this but it feels like forever to

1865
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:08,419
me so I put in a lot of work and and

1866
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:11,130
it's not that I don't care if people use

1867
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:12,869
anything that they you they think that

1868
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:15,900
they get of mine to do whatever they

1869
01:36:12,869 --> 01:36:18,390
want I'm absolutely fine with it but

1870
01:36:15,899 --> 01:36:21,659
when it comes time to now you're gonna

1871
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:24,210
start using it to you know create your

1872
01:36:21,659 --> 01:36:26,840
own label and your own name and now

1873
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:30,300
you're profiting off of the work that

1874
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:33,569
you know people like Bodie have put into

1875
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:37,050
it then it pisses me off because it's a

1876
01:36:33,569 --> 01:36:39,599
commitment by wood you know again we'll

1877
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:42,829
use Bodie it's a commitment by Bodie

1878
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:45,770
that you're able to do this and I mean

1879
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:48,238
yeah we live in a capitalistic

1880
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:50,430
capitalistic society and that's the name

1881
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:53,759
of the game but that doesn't make it

1882
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:55,619
morally right and and and yeah you know

1883
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,140
that's that's where I'm bothered by it

1884
01:36:55,619 --> 01:37:03,760
but that's the guy that that

1885
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:07,300
I do I look up to him and you know III

1886
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:10,619
just bode and I are similar in a lot of

1887
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:13,900
ways he's passionate about his work and

1888
01:37:10,619 --> 01:37:15,640
that's that's that's how I am and Bodi

1889
01:37:13,899 --> 01:37:17,710
would never say anything bad no one

1890
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:20,829
would bode ever come out and tell people

1891
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:24,189
hey don't use my work to do that it's

1892
01:37:20,829 --> 01:37:26,140
gonna take the growers out here that are

1893
01:37:24,189 --> 01:37:29,619
committed to this and that are

1894
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:34,350
passionate to not support those that are

1895
01:37:29,619 --> 01:37:36,609
only making money me no profits off of

1896
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:39,190
somebody else's hard work it's gonna

1897
01:37:36,609 --> 01:37:41,469
take them but the problem is is these

1898
01:37:39,189 --> 01:37:44,259
guys are willing to do it and they're

1899
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:47,409
willing to lowball you know and and and

1900
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:50,050
just so they can turn a profit and and

1901
01:37:47,409 --> 01:37:52,210
that's what ends up happening and and

1902
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:55,600
you know Bodie already tries to be

1903
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:58,239
compassionate and you know and and put

1904
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:03,190
his overhead you know into everything

1905
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:05,500
and then his bottom line and I don't

1906
01:38:03,189 --> 01:38:07,479
know he's just he's one of those guys

1907
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:10,569
that's never gonna say anything and and

1908
01:38:07,479 --> 01:38:12,909
he's put in years of hard work and and

1909
01:38:10,569 --> 01:38:16,000
though it is a love and a passion for

1910
01:38:12,909 --> 01:38:19,689
him I just don't like to see things like

1911
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,689
that happen for for those that that I

1912
01:38:19,689 --> 01:38:25,000
admire and I think so highly of and and

1913
01:38:22,689 --> 01:38:27,759
a lot of people are doing that with with

1914
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,920
his work right now yeah I totally agree

1915
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,900
and it's sad to say that you know I like

1916
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,789
I think it's like one out of every three

1917
01:38:31,899 --> 01:38:36,099
breeders or something you know and you

1918
01:38:33,789 --> 01:38:39,550
see their genetics it's like you know

1919
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:42,370
one parents the bow tie strain the the

1920
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:44,199
others like a top dog or TJ strain you

1921
01:38:42,369 --> 01:38:46,149
know that's their whole menu it's just

1922
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:49,689
all that and it's just like what is this

1923
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:52,239
you know exactly exactly and energy said

1924
01:38:49,689 --> 01:38:54,369
you know but I such a nice guy bode

1925
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:56,260
sorry um he'd never say anything you

1926
01:38:54,369 --> 01:38:58,059
know and just forever listening we have

1927
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:00,010
actually been talking to him and we do

1928
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:02,500
have an episode coming up in the

1929
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:04,480
not-too-distant future and yeah I agree

1930
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:05,170
totally one of the nicest dudes you'll

1931
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:06,489
ever meet

1932
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:09,909
I don't think you could get him to say a

1933
01:39:06,489 --> 01:39:11,710
bad word about anyone as you said and so

1934
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:12,368
this maybe kind of brings us to our last

1935
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:15,670
quite

1936
01:39:12,368 --> 01:39:17,170
but maybe the most interesting one in my

1937
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:20,770
opinion for someone like you who's got

1938
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:24,158
such a you know a depth of history to me

1939
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:26,619
it's cannabis I often compare it to

1940
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:28,448
cooking in that you know like you'll get

1941
01:39:26,618 --> 01:39:29,948
these smells or these flavors and

1942
01:39:28,448 --> 01:39:31,658
they'll animal take you back you know

1943
01:39:29,948 --> 01:39:34,750
like they're they're attached to the

1944
01:39:31,658 --> 01:39:36,729
memories and and so for someone like you

1945
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:38,560
who's got such a depth of memory you

1946
01:39:36,729 --> 01:39:40,509
know you must have all these different

1947
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,489
flavors that can take you back to these

1948
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:45,449
different points in time and stuff like

1949
01:39:42,488 --> 01:39:48,309
that and so what I love to always ask is

1950
01:39:45,448 --> 01:39:51,158
what's the most standout to you you know

1951
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:53,170
like was there a flavor profile or a

1952
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:55,598
terpene profile that maybe isn't really

1953
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:57,670
around anymore or something which was

1954
01:39:55,599 --> 01:39:59,469
just really you know so for example when

1955
01:39:57,670 --> 01:40:01,329
I read about the Clementine you know how

1956
01:39:59,469 --> 01:40:06,880
you know it's essentially an Afghan

1957
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:08,738
email with that tangerine smell and and

1958
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,750
that's really unique you know like that

1959
01:40:08,738 --> 01:40:13,868
that would have blown my mind back in

1960
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:19,029
the day you know what was the standout

1961
01:40:13,868 --> 01:40:22,269
for you for me it's always been the

1962
01:40:19,029 --> 01:40:28,000
citrus expressions and it's more common

1963
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:31,570
now but when we were creating and mind

1964
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:34,448
you selection is key and and then

1965
01:40:31,569 --> 01:40:37,988
selecting you can find that Fino that

1966
01:40:34,448 --> 01:40:40,719
you now have and it's it's amazing but

1967
01:40:37,988 --> 01:40:44,799
it doesn't mean that it's it's going to

1968
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:47,349
pass on into the progeny you that you

1969
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:50,889
you know you hope for it but there's no

1970
01:40:47,349 --> 01:40:55,179
way maybe in the future we'll have tests

1971
01:40:50,889 --> 01:40:57,340
that that can determine how DNA is going

1972
01:40:55,179 --> 01:41:01,599
to pass and and who's going to be the

1973
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:06,150
dominant parent but it's um it's it's

1974
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:10,900
not that yeah I think I can pick up

1975
01:41:06,149 --> 01:41:13,899
citrus in it it is the sweet sweet

1976
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:16,809
presence of tangerine when you close

1977
01:41:13,899 --> 01:41:19,448
your eyes and you break the but open or

1978
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:22,389
you walk into one of our rooms or one of

1979
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:25,578
the the outdoor patches and you close

1980
01:41:22,389 --> 01:41:28,279
your eyes and you take in a

1981
01:41:25,578 --> 01:41:31,518
deep breath you can almost envision

1982
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:36,918
yourself standing in an orange orchard

1983
01:41:31,519 --> 01:41:39,588
and just being amazed that when you open

1984
01:41:36,918 --> 01:41:41,628
your eyes it's cannabis that that and

1985
01:41:39,588 --> 01:41:44,689
then the well actually there is another

1986
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:47,029
one too and and though you can you can

1987
01:41:44,689 --> 01:41:49,338
still pick it up like sometimes heavily

1988
01:41:47,029 --> 01:41:51,708
in our in our in our clementines

1989
01:41:49,338 --> 01:41:54,588
especially our our lavender Clementine

1990
01:41:51,708 --> 01:41:56,538
crosses you can pick it up but one of

1991
01:41:54,588 --> 01:42:01,010
the things my dad was known for was his

1992
01:41:56,538 --> 01:42:03,828
gums and the most pungent

1993
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:07,820
I just got sprayed in the face by his

1994
01:42:03,828 --> 01:42:12,648
gun turret profile that you can imagine

1995
01:42:07,819 --> 01:42:14,719
and wasn't like I think it was my

1996
01:42:12,649 --> 01:42:20,149
brother and I that were just talking

1997
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:24,260
about it dad skunks were so rich so full

1998
01:42:20,149 --> 01:42:26,359
so complex it was it was like being

1999
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:29,719
sprayed in the face with the skunk and I

2000
01:42:26,359 --> 01:42:33,679
think we might have been the only only

2001
01:42:29,719 --> 01:42:35,838
kids at the time if we were you know

2002
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:38,418
riding around and we'd come across a

2003
01:42:35,838 --> 01:42:40,639
fresh roadkill of a skunk

2004
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:43,038
where everybody else is covering their

2005
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:47,599
face gone oh my god my brother and I

2006
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:51,978
like well I love that smell it's so

2007
01:42:47,599 --> 01:42:53,529
great everybody's looking at it's like

2008
01:42:51,979 --> 01:42:56,239
that's disgusting

2009
01:42:53,529 --> 01:42:58,988
I've got to congratulate you you've

2010
01:42:56,238 --> 01:43:01,248
unlocked the bonus question so the

2011
01:42:58,988 --> 01:43:03,108
reason why I asked that was because I

2012
01:43:01,248 --> 01:43:06,260
was digging around on some forums on the

2013
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:08,389
specifically the breed Bay and I found a

2014
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:10,338
comment years and years ago and someone

2015
01:43:08,389 --> 01:43:11,689
essentially asked you what I just asked

2016
01:43:10,338 --> 01:43:14,988
you know like what's what's your

2017
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:17,449
favorite and and your answer was I'm

2018
01:43:14,988 --> 01:43:20,118
still loyal to the skunk family give me

2019
01:43:17,448 --> 01:43:21,799
those nose burning eye-watering funk of

2020
01:43:20,118 --> 01:43:24,438
it the skunk and I'll fill my lungs

2021
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:26,599
further than capacity I thought I was

2022
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:28,429
that's right comment and so the bonus

2023
01:43:26,599 --> 01:43:32,689
question is where's all the skunk

2024
01:43:28,429 --> 01:43:37,719
crosses well skunk it's it's almost just

2025
01:43:32,689 --> 01:43:39,409
been so diluted it's that heavy that

2026
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:41,359
threw it

2027
01:43:39,408 --> 01:43:45,768
as to your eyes what onions will do is

2028
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:47,958
really hard to find and a lot of the

2029
01:43:45,769 --> 01:43:52,159
stuff that that dad was growing back

2030
01:43:47,958 --> 01:43:53,988
then you know we still have have seeds

2031
01:43:52,158 --> 01:43:56,448
of but the germination I mean you're

2032
01:43:53,988 --> 01:43:58,879
talking seeds from the late seventies

2033
01:43:56,448 --> 01:44:03,109
early eighties the viability of them is

2034
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:08,389
you know 10 20 percent and then finding

2035
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:12,589
them in this election it's it's it's so

2036
01:44:08,389 --> 01:44:15,349
heavy in work that it's it's them

2037
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:18,380
they're impossible to spend the time and

2038
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:21,889
it's one of my goals um it probably

2039
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:25,219
should have been my first goal you know

2040
01:44:21,889 --> 01:44:28,159
as a tribute to my father but I just I

2041
01:44:25,219 --> 01:44:31,729
just I didn't because I just felt that

2042
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:35,089
the the work involved and the purpose of

2043
01:44:31,729 --> 01:44:38,059
what I was doing were at that time or

2044
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:43,010
were just they were too far apart to

2045
01:44:38,059 --> 01:44:46,969
make it a viable option that it's it's

2046
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:50,630
there it can be found but the gene pool

2047
01:44:46,969 --> 01:44:52,639
has become so muddled one of the

2048
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:57,889
expressions that's the hardest to find

2049
01:44:52,639 --> 01:45:00,949
is the true roadkill skunk it is now

2050
01:44:57,889 --> 01:45:05,349
one of the most highly sought after and

2051
01:45:00,948 --> 01:45:09,129
it is one of the most difficult

2052
01:45:05,349 --> 01:45:12,708
expressions to be able to define in

2053
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:17,479
plants and one of my goals is to someday

2054
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:20,090
to find the classic roadkill skunk and

2055
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:23,479
like I said by my father was responsible

2056
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:26,869
for for some patches that you could if

2057
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:29,269
you were in a certain part of the of the

2058
01:45:26,868 --> 01:45:32,118
valley and if the wind was just right

2059
01:45:29,269 --> 01:45:35,570
you could literally be a mile or two

2060
01:45:32,118 --> 01:45:38,598
miles away and you can smell fresh skunk

2061
01:45:35,569 --> 01:45:42,708
and that was always the biggest

2062
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:45,529
influence for me I grew up loving that's

2063
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:47,059
not I I don't I hope people don't judge

2064
01:45:45,529 --> 01:45:49,248
me for what I'm about to say and they

2065
01:45:47,059 --> 01:45:51,679
thought about it and I'm gonna go ahead

2066
01:45:49,248 --> 01:45:52,819
and say it but the first experience that

2067
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:56,300
I had and

2068
01:45:52,819 --> 01:46:03,199
puffing on a joint was actually a non

2069
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:08,000
let that my dad was my dad was so happy

2070
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:10,849
about that he looked at me turned away

2071
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,359
and was explaining it to me the profile

2072
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:17,300
and and the natural oil of a and why it
