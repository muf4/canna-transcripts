on here

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,159
not a problem my friend so first

59
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,238
question we ask people these days what

60
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,318
are you currently smoking on

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,959
uh right now we're smoking on some pk

62
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,439
sherb that we made so it's the malibu pk

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,159
with the reverse sunset sherbert

64
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,878
and before that some tricks by my buddy

65
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,959
grolo key uh gg4 mendo breath that he

66
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,199
hunted

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,759
wow interesting there's uh there's a lot

68
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,159
going on there so i mean first of all

69
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,840
tell us about the sunset sure how would

70
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,680
you describe the crosses you made with

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,239
that one

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,319
um i'd say the sunset sherb crosses have

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,400
all been pretty beneficial in terms of

74
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,878
what it added to the structure

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,800
it's a really interesting plant

76
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,000
probably the plant that i've been most

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,319
excited about since cookies and

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,318
i actually passed on it for a couple of

79
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,199
years because i wasn't interested in

80
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,399
hearing anything about it mostly because

81
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,158
i didn't really think that it would be

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,439
better than the cookies in any way shape

83
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,280
or form it just seemed kind of like

84
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,759
derivative

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,400
so i passed on it for a while until i

86
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,318
actually got to try a sample and

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,239
i was impressed by it it's got the

88
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:35,119
creamy kind of deep musky flavor and

89
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,140
it's a little bit less cookie doughy

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,439
dominant and

91
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,679
[Music]

92
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,318
i like the yield on it the structure on

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,000
it the growth habit super super proper

94
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,399
plant in terms of

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,598
how it grows and stretches and the

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,640
yields from it um

97
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,639
i'd say

98
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,039
you know it's probably

99
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,598
added a lot to the crosses and with the

100
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,438
pk being lower yielding

101
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,079
a little bit more finicky of a plant you

102
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:06,158
find that what the crosses of it produce

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,760
are hardier more vigorous plants

104
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,759
yeah that sounds really good and i've

105
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,840
i've got to admit i've actually never

106
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,518
tried pure sherbet that's why i'm always

107
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,280
interested to hear people's take on it

108
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,120
but to cross over the other side of

109
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
things you mentioned across to the the

110
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,199
pure kush i'm always interested because

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,240
there's so many different pure cushes is

112
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,280
the malibu your personal favorite one

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,800
so i i honestly think that a lot of them

114
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,799
are very very similar if not identical

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
i think sometimes when people see them

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
what all they're really seeing is just

117
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,758
different growers examples of a similar

118
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,279
plant at this point with ogs in general

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,560
which i'm sure you've seen a good amount

120
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,799
when you've been when you've been out

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
west it's very very similar i think

122
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,840
there's really only a couple of

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
different profiles that stand out

124
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,758
there's the more like gassy lemony one

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,600
like the sfv

126
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
there's the more earthy one like the

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,080
malibu and then there's kind of what you

128
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,918
find in um a good example recently was

129
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,198
like the black triangle from bodhi that

130
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,758
triangle uh 88 g13 hash plant

131
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,478
very very dank like what i call like a

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,919
traditional kush type profile

133
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,120
and the malibu and the topanga honestly

134
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,198
a lot of them when i've seen them

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,478
they're very very similar so i can't

136
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,000
really say

137
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,159
that there would be much of a difference

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,240
between them somebody who would probably

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
be better suited to speak on that might

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,879
be the doctor from archive

141
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
he might have seen more i mean i've seen

142
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,439
the malibu

143
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
um

144
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,519
when i was in san diego in like the

145
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,279
early 2000s and when i've seen the

146
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,519
tapanga brought up

147
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,478
very very similar in my opinion and i

148
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,399
know there's i mean because the

149
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,159
hollywood pk2 is what they're calling it

150
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,758
as well

151
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
yeah there's a there's a stack of

152
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,160
different ones i guess the thing i'm

153
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:52,000
most interested in is do you think that

154
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,639
the more lemon based ogs came maybe from

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,240
an s1 of say the the more earthy the

156
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
more pure kush type ones or do you think

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,120
maybe it was the other way around or do

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,600
you think they just evolved

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,600
independently

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,199
that's a good question i mean i i would

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,439
think that they came from the more

162
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,400
earthy ones just because i kind of feel

163
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,399
like that's the base of that genetic

164
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,120
so it would make sense to me that an

165
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,439
outlier might be the more lemony one and

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,360
the lemony ones um

167
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,879
are very very popular for a specific

168
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,038
reason because they have that they have

169
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,360
that gassy profile but they also have

170
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,599
that stick to your palate flavor

171
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,199
that pretty much cuts through anything

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,199
and so i feel like

173
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,120
it was probably an outlier of the

174
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,000
earthier cushes that people were

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,560
probably getting back in the day

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,079
yeah that certainly seems to make sense

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
and then so i guess to kind of bring

178
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,240
this little bit full circle a lot of

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,240
people often talk about feeling like

180
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,400
there's a cush component within girl

181
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
scouts and by extension

182
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,719
within the sherbs

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,479
do you see that yourself and if so what

184
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,960
type of kush influence do you think is

185
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,360
within the sherb

186
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,279
so at least with the girl scout cookies

187
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,439
i would say when you look at it and the

188
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,839
way that it grows it grows very very

189
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,560
similar to the sfvs

190
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,478
in terms of just the way the flower sets

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,120
the size of the flowers on them the

192
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,120
internal spacing on it and the long

193
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,840
petioles that you see on them if you've

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,439
ever seen like the og's grown or whatnot

195
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,399
they don't require a lot of plucking

196
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,918
because they don't they don't pull that

197
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,159
they don't put out a lot of leaves they

198
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,318
stretch a whole lot and that's similar

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
to what we first saw in the forum with

200
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,720
the sherb i could see it as well it's

201
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,879
just selected away from that to a plant

202
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
that stacks a little bit more is a

203
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,800
little bit tighter puts out fatter

204
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,280
flowers that the colas are you know

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,720
three or four flowers set together not

206
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,638
not kind of like what you see with the

207
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
sfvs or the ogs

208
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,918
and it's firmer the the branches aren't

209
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
as floppy

210
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,079
with the ogs you know they require a lot

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,520
of work because you know they they want

212
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,959
they want to get all kind of over the

213
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,079
place they require

214
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,878
a lot of maintenance on them

215
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,560
yeah okay and so overall are you put off

216
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,160
by these types of structures because

217
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
that's a common complaint we hear from

218
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,319
some people

219
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,079
um yes and no it i think it really just

220
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,280
depends on what it is you're trying to

221
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,680
achieve i mean a properly grown og is

222
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,399
one of the best flowers you'll ever see

223
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,038
so to me it's worth it and there's a

224
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,799
reason why it stuck around so long i

225
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,279
think part of why we stopped seeing the

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,199
ogs in the kind of volume that we used

227
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,878
to see them in is just because the price

228
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
dropped on the market

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
and so

230
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,519
you know it wasn't worth growing anymore

231
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
it was worth growing something that was

232
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,598
a heavier yielder that required less

233
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
work that was less finicky

234
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,919
so for me

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,000
personally i love a phenomenal og and

236
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,838
i've never seen a plant with better

237
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,919
structure let's say that actually

238
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
delivered the same type of flower

239
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,519
so if you could find it in something

240
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,920
that had better structure and growth

241
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,000
habits i would absolutely take it

242
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,559
but having never really seen anything

243
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,159
like that myself i'm you know i'm i'm

244
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,239
saying it it had it stuck around for a

245
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,958
long time for a reason and i know

246
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,519
inspector has done um some s1 work with

247
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,679
the triangle and the chem 91

248
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,959
and still the plants still look even

249
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,319
though he's got some that stack a little

250
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,399
bit better it looks like there's they

251
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
still have the same viny structure it

252
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,759
just requires a lot of maintenance to

253
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,600
them

254
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,799
yeah certainly so you just got to grow

255
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
it properly

256
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,519
so you raised a really interesting point

257
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,039
which is kind of on a very different

258
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,039
topic but i'd love to quickly go there

259
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,278
where you mentioned that although these

260
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,559
ogs were elite and they're amazing

261
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,159
flower people stopped growing them

262
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,919
because they kind of fell out of favor

263
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,519
and i witnessed this firsthand when i

264
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,360
was in the states whereby i had a bag of

265
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
what was meant to be some sort of like

266
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,399
exotic type of cookie type of thing you

267
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,040
know and it was grown it looked nice but

268
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,120
it had no turps had no flavor was really

269
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:53,039
quite bland but it looked pretty good

270
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,240
and then next to it was um a bag of the

271
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,319
the clone only headband that's the same

272
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,560
one that mr bob has so i know that it's

273
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,480
like a really good one and the smell was

274
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,559
just super piney

275
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,639
lemony gassy like everything you'd want

276
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,239
the flavor was on point and i'm having

277
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,919
this talk with people and they're like

278
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,399
yeah these bags would go for about the

279
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,639
same price and i was like what but like

280
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,839
the headbands clearly way better and

281
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,519
they were like yeah but people have

282
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,200
smelt that one before like they're used

283
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,278
to that smell you know

284
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,278
do you feel like that's a problem within

285
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,720
the consumer market that we can get to

286
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,360
this point where

287
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,000
shittily grown exotics are fetching the

288
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,639
same or more than like a really killer

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
tried and tested clone only but just

290
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,159
because of like a name and a hype thing

291
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
they're willing to go with the the

292
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,199
exotic one

293
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,439
yeah i mean i think i think we're

294
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,040
already there you know at this point

295
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,880
there's a lot of

296
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,480
what what people are terming exotics a

297
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,278
term that they're using pretty loosely

298
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,519
now

299
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,240
but there's a lot of those going around

300
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,679
and literally just just putting it i

301
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,680
mean honestly at this point just putting

302
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,120
it in the right in the right bag makes

303
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,879
all the difference

304
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,560
and there is there is a segment of the

305
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,159
market that will pay for that and the

306
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,599
the general populace doesn't really know

307
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,519
the difference at all

308
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
so the staples like i mean i don't know

309
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,560
if you remember the j1 i used to love

310
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,200
the j1

311
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,078
and it was a phenomenal flower really

312
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,800
really good high nice taste people do

313
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,479
not like jack they've seen so much jack

314
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,359
especially in cali that they they don't

315
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,600
want to see it anymore they're over it

316
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
so i think like the higher end market

317
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,879
they want i mean if you've noticed

318
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,440
there's you know

319
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,439
dosi docido crossed with gelato and you

320
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
know dosi doe cross with sherb and

321
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
that's really what people want i mean i

322
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,600
made something pretty weird

323
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,759
a couple years ago

324
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,320
and it has no traction

325
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,159
it's a vietnam black tie grand doggy

326
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
perp crossed with a grand doggie per

327
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,039
banana limon

328
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,040
that's amazing

329
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,719
yeah and that was a cross that took a

330
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,799
long time to make

331
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,120
i made you know i selected the limon

332
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,879
from i selected the limon mill

333
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
i hit it to the banana cut we had i

334
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,000
found a male in that and hit it to a

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,680
grand doggie perp female

336
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,519
then i found a male from that and then

337
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,319
separate from that i had selected a

338
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,560
vietnam black tie from ace and hit that

339
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,160
with a grand doggie perp male and then

340
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,078
selected a female from that and then

341
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,519
work together that female and the and

342
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,719
the other male

343
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,120
and uh

344
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
it's a whole lot of work in there and

345
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,039
really nobody really has any interest in

346
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,039
it i mean it's you know a couple of

347
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,958
people that i know that that that do

348
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,639
care about quality flour

349
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,919
they've told me they've grown it and

350
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,839
they've told me it's some of the most

351
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,319
unique terps they've ever seen

352
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
and they love it but

353
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,920
generally speaking if you put something

354
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,200
like that on the market number one most

355
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,958
people you try to explain all those

356
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,720
genetics to them

357
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,000
they they would just go right over their

358
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
head they would get a blank look on

359
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,039
their face

360
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,160
but if you just tell them oh it's girl

361
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:50,319
scout cookie cross with og kush okay

362
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,559
they probably know those things and

363
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,560
they're just gonna go for what they know

364
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,199
versus you know what something

365
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,799
completely unique and different and

366
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,879
that's not you know it's it's kind of

367
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:04,000
where we're at now where people will

368
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,559
take a poorly grown example of some kind

369
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
of exotic that looks good or photographs

370
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,679
well i mean honestly people are buying

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,919
things because they can take a picture

372
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,638
and post it on their instagram

373
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,278
so if if the headband smells phenomenal

374
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,079
to you in person has a great effect

375
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,679
but the purple punch whatever cross

376
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,958
looks good and they can photograph it

377
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,159
and put it on their instagram and get a

378
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,679
bunch of likes that's what they're going

379
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,278
to do

380
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,199
most people i mean that's what they're

381
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,799
going to do all things being equal

382
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
so

383
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,278
yeah no i i totally get that do you feel

384
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,199
like this is going to ultimately

385
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,439
negatively affect everyone in the

386
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,839
growers start growing out these strains

387
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,320
and we maybe lose some of these better

388
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,079
ones like objectively better but just

389
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
not demanded

390
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,958
i do

391
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,880
there's been a huge shift in terms of um

392
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,319
people cultivating varieties that are

393
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,240
photogenic

394
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
because they want them to look good on

395
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,959
instagram some plants don't photograph

396
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,639
well

397
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,319
no matter how you grow them like the

398
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
chem d is kind of is one of those plants

399
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,680
it doesn't photograph well it doesn't

400
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
really i mean it looks okay in a bag it

401
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,159
can be done right as it were

402
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,399
but it's never going to look like a

403
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,838
gelato sherb cross would look it's never

404
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,039
going to have that bag appeal it's not

405
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,720
going to have the purple tones to

406
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,159
photograph well

407
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,240
so there's a lot of genetics that are

408
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,679
getting lost off and i mean even even

409
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,480
when i've tried to share genetics with

410
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,759
people to help back up some of the work

411
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,600
they don't care because if it's not

412
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,120
something that they can immediately put

413
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,120
into production most people don't want

414
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
to do it and so there's there's really

415
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,519
it costs a lot of money it takes a lot

416
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,560
of time to back up all these genetics

417
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,480
and i know that's something that

418
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,239
inspector could relate to

419
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,560
it's a conversation that we've had here

420
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,480
and there about that just it's a big

421
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,479
commitment to do all that work and keep

422
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,120
all that together most people don't want

423
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,199
it i mean a similar example is a plant

424
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,198
we have called the lucy it's a chem 91

425
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:59,039
butterscotch hawaiian

426
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:01,120
very very unique terpene profile

427
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,759
not the highest yielder a little bit

428
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,278
finicky whatnot but it's you know it's

429
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,278
not something that i don't think anyone

430
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,198
in my circle has kept it around i think

431
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,958
one person that operates a wreck

432
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,278
facility has it

433
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,679
and other than that it's not a plant

434
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,799
that anyone really wants but

435
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,719
when i hit it with the tricks

436
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,240
and a friend of mine has grown them out

437
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,320
now

438
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,759
the owner of the facility came by and

439
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,440
when he was checking out all the

440
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,919
different stuff that they were growing

441
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,959
what he remarked about amongst you know

442
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,479
maybe

443
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,159
six or seven different breeders work

444
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,759
that they had going there was that the

445
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,360
patch of work that would that they that

446
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
had that had come from my work all the

447
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,480
strange plants that my friend had

448
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,879
selected independently

449
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,720
were the most unique profiled plants he

450
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,000
had seen and one one was that lucy he

451
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
said he never smelt anything like it

452
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,559
before and for me that's that's a big

453
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
part of why i keep those plants around

454
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,278
because although they're of zero value

455
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,799
to most people mostly because they don't

456
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,159
really know what they're worth they

457
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,519
don't really see the value in it they

458
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,759
don't understand that if you cross it

459
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,000
into something else you're opening up a

460
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,839
whole new gene pool like but if you just

461
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,120
hit gelato to docido

462
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,440
yeah you're gonna get a bunch of plants

463
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,440
that smell similar that give kind of

464
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,120
somebody in iowa let's say the ability

465
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,800
to grow that type of a plant and smell

466
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,159
that type of a profile

467
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,719
but at the end of the day you're not

468
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,480
really doing anything special you're not

469
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,000
really opening up the possibility of

470
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,680
anything unique i like to take things

471
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
from the far end of the spectrum and

472
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,958
combine them together

473
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,120
and that's i think where you're going to

474
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,599
find really really different plants but

475
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,639
somebody has to keep those plants around

476
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,000
and

477
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,000
you literally

478
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
nobody wants them you can't find people

479
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,600
that you could you'd have to pay people

480
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,079
to keep them around for you

481
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,320
if you can't keep them

482
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,879
god so many things you just said i just

483
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,480
so deeply relate to like

484
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,320
yeah i know what you mean and what i

485
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,360
wanted to first ask you because i got so

486
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,079
many things i need to ask you in

487
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,399
relation to that first thing the chem 91

488
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,838
butterscotch cross is that from bodhi or

489
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,639
rado

490
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,920
no so that's not rados butterscotch i

491
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,558
don't even i don't know the lineage of

492
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:08,159
his butterscotch this was made

493
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:10,720
by someone named poor white farmer

494
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,759
he was off ic mag years ago

495
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,000
and

496
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,599
i believe it might have been from reef

497
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,919
i believe the butterscotch hawaiian came

498
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,558
from reef and he found a male and there

499
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,280
hit the chem 91 and then somebody named

500
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,879
izurasta selected the clone

501
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,720
he passed it to a couple of our friends

502
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,600
on icmeg and that's how i ended up

503
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,480
getting it and i don't know that either

504
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,038
of them

505
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
are i mean they may still be alive but i

506
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,038
don't neither of them i've i haven't

507
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,679
seen either of them active in years

508
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,359
so i'm not sure um where where that work

509
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,200
lies but yeah no that's not from rado

510
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,359
i'm not even sure what the lineage on

511
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,519
his butterscotch is to be honest i don't

512
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,439
know if you might know what it is

513
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,839
yeah no i would probably have to look

514
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,279
into it before i say something incorrect

515
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,678
as i'm trying to

516
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,678
trying to vet some of the more random

517
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,679
things i say recently so i'll hold off

518
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,919
on that one i remember seeing a post

519
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,160
with that chem 91 butterscotch cross in

520
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,000
it and then i remembered seeing in that

521
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,519
same post and you also just mentioned it

522
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,119
that there was like a i think it was

523
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,679
cross to tricks

524
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:15,439
and yeah i crossed it to the tricks yeah

525
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,960
and so i wanted to ask you a little bit

526
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,160
about tricks i noticed that sometimes

527
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,759
you refer to it as gb six tricks what

528
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,679
does that mean

529
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:28,000
so originally i believe that when loki

530
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
selected the plant he got it as as

531
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,720
gorilla breath

532
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,159
that he did a project with gromer and

533
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,319
there was a bunch of work that came out

534
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,640
of that and that's one of those plants

535
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,079
and when he selected it

536
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
i think it was just the gorilla breath

537
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,359
six and he named it trix because of the

538
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,798
flavor profile on it um the way like the

539
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,240
wood like the kind of the smell that it

540
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,879
gives off

541
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,798
and so the shortened version is just gb

542
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,400
six tricks rather than gorilla breath

543
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,879
six tricks

544
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,559
ah that makes sense as a quick little

545
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,280
side note what do you think of our

546
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,359
friend groma you know i i've had a few

547
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,759
people come on the show saying well he's

548
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,119
very blatantly ripped off gage green but

549
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,119
then on the other hand people seem to

550
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,798
turn a bit of a blind eye to that and

551
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,719
you know friendly with him what's your

552
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,759
take on that situation

553
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,279
i mean yeah he obviously did so that's i

554
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,879
don't think that's up for discussion at

555
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,960
this point because though the work was

556
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,280
all based on the mendo breath and i

557
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
think he has a line recently that's just

558
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,879
another gauge green kind of rip i think

559
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,319
he took um

560
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
africa with a grateful breath or

561
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,879
something and started a whole nother

562
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,440
line with that

563
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,760
so but yeah i mean he you know it's

564
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,679
it's it's one of those things where it

565
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,919
would have been previously frowned upon

566
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,759
clearly not frowned upon now i'm sure he

567
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,919
made a whole bunch of money for himself

568
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,919
and he sells them at a low price point

569
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,320
because there's really no work involved

570
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,559
in them i mean you know i could take a

571
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,240
pack from you know archive right now and

572
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,918
do the same thing and people i mean

573
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,839
there's people who have done that

574
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,840
with with work that was put out with my

575
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,038
work so

576
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,199
it's kind of one of those things where

577
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,879
you know it's it gave people access to

578
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
something he did it in numbers he did it

579
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,480
in volume he cut the price real low

580
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
so

581
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,319
personally

582
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,678
you know for me no but

583
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,839
for people who are just trying to make

584
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,919
some money i totally get it it makes

585
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,158
sense it was there to be had and people

586
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,600
clearly support him and

587
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,280
i mean the work that's come from it

588
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,038
hasn't been bad

589
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,359
because you know it means a lot of it is

590
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,359
dosi dome mendo breath you know docido

591
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,240
from archive and mendo breath from gage

592
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,000
both

593
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,839
both you know made in collaboration with

594
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,919
norcal and that ogkb clone so

595
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,759
not really i mean not

596
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,679
not something that i would do to be

597
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,279
honest but

598
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,720
not mad at him either because i'm sure

599
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,240
he made a pile of money off it and is

600
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,440
still making a pile of money off of it

601
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,679
there's a lot of people out there doing

602
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,600
work with integrity that are broke

603
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,440
so

604
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,119
you know you can kind of look at it and

605
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,519
see really at the end of the day like

606
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,038
who's really winning there

607
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,879
it's interesting that

608
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,038
exactly what you said holds true in my

609
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,240
opinion the best clone that exists in

610
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:06,798
australia is a jelly breath clone from

611
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,798
in-house genetics and that's just um

612
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,119
docido cross mendo breath you know it's

613
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,279
just his version his feminized version

614
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,839
of essentially the peanut butter breath

615
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,599
from groma but yeah you can't deny it

616
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,439
some really nice weed but i just wanted

617
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,879
to loop back for a moment the reason why

618
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,200
all of this stimulated my interest

619
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,840
initially especially in regards to that

620
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,120
gorilla breath was that i had heard

621
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,720
rumors of other well-known strains been

622
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,839
given the same genetics and i probably

623
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,480
need to explain this a little bit

624
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:37,119
specifically i'd heard that smell boat's

625
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,000
rainbow ssog

626
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,678
was in fact just gorilla glue for mendo

627
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,279
breath and i'd asked him about it and he

628
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,360
was like what no way like neither of

629
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,798
those plants are you can't even see any

630
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,798
traits from those plants in this thing

631
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,798
but what it made me realize was when i

632
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,038
was hearing these rumors it was just

633
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,879
kind of like two really popular strains

634
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,480
thrown together it was almost as if like

635
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
people didn't know what a certain cross

636
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,159
was so they were like oh it's probably

637
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,679
like gg4 cross mendo breath like as in

638
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,200
like it was just two popular things you

639
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,360
could throw together and imply that

640
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,360
someone's just kind of chucking these

641
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,000
two popular things together have you

642
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,918
ever heard of any other strains

643
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,599
being called like oh it's probably gg4

644
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,880
mendo breath even though like it doesn't

645
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,319
really appear to be or anything like

646
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,840
that or is that just my own little weird

647
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,079
experience

648
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,678
no yeah i mean i'm kind of familiar with

649
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,158
small boat but i had never heard that

650
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,080
about that particular cross

651
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,400
i'm sure that somebody else has done a

652
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,158
gg4 mendo breath i would be surprised if

653
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,640
they hadn't um

654
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,280
i'm sure there's a gg4 docido out there

655
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,520
i could bet on that one for sure

656
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,279
the mendo breath you know it wasn't it

657
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,918
was they both kind of came at the same

658
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,519
time and then one ended up obviously

659
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,840
exceeding the popularity of the other

660
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,639
significantly in my opinion that being

661
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,639
the docido

662
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,400
i mean we actually

663
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,840
we actually were the ones that that sold

664
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,600
that clone originally that norcal cut

665
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,279
when that cut actually came out it was

666
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,759
through a delivery service that i had in

667
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,240
sf at the time and we released the

668
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:07,440
docido norcal cut the number six and the

669
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,319
mendo breath cut which was the platinum

670
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,320
and those you know one one really took

671
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,079
off which was that docido and the other

672
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,519
one didn't really trend as much was the

673
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,879
mendo breath so

674
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,000
really i think the person that's worked

675
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,000
with the mental breath the most

676
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,079
obviously besides gage has has been

677
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,279
grommer because he worked with it for a

678
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,798
long time it has to be years now

679
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,918
yeah i don't really know that anyone

680
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,319
else has really worked with it that

681
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,720
significantly

682
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,399
yeah well i mean i guess just to kind of

683
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,600
wrap up this little sag we've been

684
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,840
talking about what are your thoughts on

685
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,558
gage

686
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,278
uh i mean they're weird there's no

687
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:45,599
denying that i don't think there's uh

688
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,240
they're a little bit strange um

689
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:51,439
muscle i'm friends with norcal and

690
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,200
norcal and my buddy frost boss and my

691
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,519
buddy unknown prophet and myself we all

692
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,038
go back a long way in the bay area

693
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,839
the four of us

694
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:02,798
and norcal was how i came to know about

695
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,399
gage um but he's he's a really good guy

696
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,440
he he's open to working with a lot of

697
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,919
people

698
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,440
and he worked with gage in some way

699
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,000
shape or form

700
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,720
my understanding of their relationship

701
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,400
was that it was not very beneficial to

702
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,240
him and so in that regard to me not

703
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,559
really people that i'm a huge fan of

704
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,159
simply because if my friend says that it

705
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,319
didn't go right i know the kind of guy

706
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,400
he is so i imagine it's on their side

707
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,798
plus i've seen them caught up in all

708
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,000
kinds of all kinds of online debating

709
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,440
and whatnot um and people who debate

710
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,038
online are not people that i want to

711
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,240
associate with

712
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,919
so

713
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,880
the work is interesting they seem weird

714
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,720
and i personally have never run any of

715
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,200
their work besides the mendo breath

716
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,640
cuttings that norcal gave me

717
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
but i know a lot of people like their

718
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
work

719
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,719
so

720
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,480
you know i think i think one of them is

721
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
a flat earther that's a little bit

722
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,640
strange to me and then just the way that

723
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,880
they present themselves online is kind

724
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,880
of off-putting to me and the reality is

725
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,400
besides the mendo breath

726
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,919
i don't really know any of their other

727
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,919
work that i'm intrigued by

728
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,759
yeah that's an interesting point i mean

729
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,759
i'll i'll be honest there's a few of

730
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,278
their crosses i've seen that do catch my

731
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,879
eye particularly that high school

732
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:20,480
sweetheart one but

733
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,320
um i agree with you they're an

734
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,558
interesting crew and our friend michael

735
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,319
fong the flat earther he's another

736
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,158
interesting chap and

737
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,439
i wouldn't be surprised if one day we

738
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,120
get him on the show i think it'd be a

739
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
cool chat but anyway

740
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,119
let's let's take it back now we've been

741
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,199
having a good little detour here let's

742
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,798
go back to our original first question

743
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,400
which we normally start the show with

744
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,158
what was your first experience with

745
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
cannabis

746
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,039
wow

747
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,879
yeah

748
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,319
my first experience with cannabis was

749
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,240
with some friends of mine when i was

750
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,439
younger one of their parents was a

751
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,919
deadhead

752
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,759
and i was spending the night over there

753
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
and they stole they stole a little bit

754
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,359
of flour from them

755
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,200
and we sat up after everyone went to bed

756
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,000
and smoked it

757
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,519
laid down and had that typical first

758
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,240
experience where you're wondering like

759
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,679
am i feeling anything or what is this

760
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,440
um

761
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,038
everything went fine

762
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,038
didn't think anything of it went to bed

763
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,038
the next day woke up felt a little bit

764
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,640
different just thinking okay well

765
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,558
clearly it's not it's not what the dare

766
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,600
program and everybody else said it was i

767
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,278
think i was about like 13 at the time

768
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,839
and then i really didn't didn't smoke

769
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,759
much after that it took um a couple

770
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,558
years before i really got into smoking

771
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,839
because it didn't really grab me

772
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,440
and then

773
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,959
i remember

774
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,880
meeting with some friends

775
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,798
where i was living in miami at the time

776
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,080
and grabbing some flour from one of

777
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,599
their older brothers he actually had

778
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,240
some blueberry

779
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:49,278
and remember smoking that and being like

780
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,440
oh yeah okay like i get it now

781
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,880
and pretty much obsessed with that i

782
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,798
mean i think we ended up going to see a

783
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
movie at the mall and i

784
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,079
we were waiting for the movie we went up

785
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,000
in the parking garage to smoke

786
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,119
right before the movie i walked back in

787
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,038
there were some benches in front of the

788
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,399
movie theater i remember laying down and

789
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,079
telling them

790
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,960
when it was time to go in i said no i'm

791
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,960
good you guys can go i'm good

792
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,079
um and they told me like you can't lay

793
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,079
out here man you have to you have to

794
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,439
come into the movie theater so i went in

795
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,918
with them

796
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,159
um but i loved it i completely fell in

797
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,000
love with it it i mean it's a it's a

798
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,080
plant that you know it changed my life

799
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
i've been dedicated to this plant for

800
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,599
you know over 20 years now

801
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,360
and in spite of everything else any

802
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,199
little detours i've taken in life i've

803
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,519
always circled back

804
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,278
to the plant constantly it's it's i mean

805
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,398
it changed my life clearly just like a

806
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,759
lot of the people that you probably

807
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,918
speak to

808
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,079
clearly we've dedicated a lot like a lot

809
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,440
of time and energy into this

810
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,199
so yeah i've been i was kind of spoiled

811
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,278
though because i'd never seen

812
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,759
i'd never seen regs before and in

813
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,079
florida there was really only like regs

814
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,079
or like like like nugget you know it was

815
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,918
like oh you either had you either had

816
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,960
crippy or you had

817
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,000
rags

818
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,720
and

819
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,319
i i was spoiled because i'd only smoked

820
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,519
like i'd only smoke crippy i only smoked

821
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,278
like kind butter whatever you want to

822
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,119
call it only smoked like

823
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,278
nicer indoor flour

824
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:12,639
and then i remember the first time i saw

825
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,679
some rags we all we all faded in on i'm

826
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,600
supposed to be like i think like a

827
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,880
quarter pound and when my friends asked

828
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,558
me to fade in on it i was kind of

829
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,919
surprised by like the small amount of

830
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,200
money that it was

831
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
and when they showed up with it and

832
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,399
started breaking it up i didn't even

833
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,480
know what the seeds were i was

834
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,959
completely confused about the stems the

835
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,880
seeds all of that i tried to take one

836
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,960
hit of a blunt they were old and i said

837
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,240
no i'm good um i'm just going to hit my

838
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,240
pipe in my little jar weed that i

839
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,480
brought with me

840
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,399
well there you go and was that when you

841
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,839
say rags was that kind of like brickweed

842
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,158
or just like not as good as kind

843
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,918
brickweed brickweed pressed miami

844
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,480
brickweed

845
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,640
yeah well and so i know that back in

846
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,880
those days names weren't a big thing but

847
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,880
do you remember the first name strain

848
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
you ever smoked

849
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,240
so

850
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,840
my friend's brother would get blueberry

851
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,599
that was the first thing that i actually

852
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,158
smoked um

853
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,839
and then in florida there was a juicy

854
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,080
fruit which was like another one that

855
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,959
was popular i want to say the other one

856
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,720
was called orange crush

857
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,038
and there was like one more that i can't

858
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,960
remember off top but really there was

859
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,000
only i don't know how it is in australia

860
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,440
but um when in florida there you only

861
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,159
could really get from people that you

862
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,600
knew and if it wasn't like brickweed

863
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,600
basically out of like some suspect spot

864
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,599
um it was through the same kind of

865
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,798
contact and they just had the same type

866
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,558
of stuff

867
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:37,440
and so you really didn't have much of an

868
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,200
option

869
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
and so we would get a lot of that juicy

870
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,399
fruit that orange crush

871
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,278
i forget what some of the other ones

872
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:44,398
were

873
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,038
um

874
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,639
and then a friend of mine actually grew

875
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,158
some of the first stuff from seed i ever

876
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,919
saw which was they had brought back some

877
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,320
shishka berry seeds

878
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,799
and so that was that was like the first

879
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,960
actual something from seed that i where

880
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:02,240
i knew the people that actually grew it

881
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,720
that's cool okay so did you have like an

882
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,558
inclination towards spice of life at

883
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,159
that point given shisha berry kind of

884
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:09,759
opened your eyes or was that like an

885
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,600
afterthought

886
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,558
to be honest i didn't even know who they

887
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:16,319
were

888
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:18,720
um i was so paranoid about any kind of

889
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,839
online searching for anything at that

890
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,839
time

891
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:25,038
that i didn't want anything to do with

892
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,398
it and in florida if you knew someone

893
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,319
like you just you just didn't say

894
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,959
anything because the people that were

895
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,200
growing were so quiet about it

896
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,038
that you you just you couldn't say

897
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,399
anything about anything to anybody so it

898
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:37,919
wasn't even really it wasn't really even

899
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,239
a conversation that you could have with

900
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,159
someone to even ask questions about it

901
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,839
was more like here i've got this take it

902
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,520
you don't want it okay you can't have it

903
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,199
now because you took too long you asked

904
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,960
questions they didn't like it

905
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,159
so you just you know you had it was like

906
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,159
if you didn't grow up with certain

907
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,919
people you were just you were excluded

908
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,960
from certain circles you just weren't

909
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,038
welcome

910
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
so i didn't even know about steve or

911
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,319
spice of life or any of that but i have

912
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,559
i have enjoyed some of his work i like

913
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,759
the blue satellite from him

914
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:05,440
um

915
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,640
i would like to grow some shishka berry

916
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,000
at some point

917
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,240
it's kind of a shame because a lot of

918
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,839
that flour nowadays with the way the

919
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,960
wreck markets are moving here in the

920
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,639
states

921
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,880
they're not really desirable because a

922
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,320
lot of those higher terpene interesting

923
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,039
different varieties they don't they

924
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,480
don't test over 20 percent and consumers

925
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,240
in the stores that's that's what they're

926
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,919
really obsessed with is like varieties

927
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,159
over 20 percent

928
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,080
and you know if if something has a

929
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,000
really really unique terpene profile but

930
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,000
it tests 13 or 14 it's going to be

931
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
eliminated that's another thing that's

932
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,599
going to affect the gene pool going

933
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,558
forward is like this focus on commercial

934
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,798
breeding

935
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,798
is really is really going to change

936
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,639
what people are doing

937
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,440
i think it's interesting because

938
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,038
i think it's this the same situation in

939
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,798
the states but it's certainly the case

940
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,960
down under that there's this whole kind

941
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:56,879
of renaissance and explosion of craft

942
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,480
beers and there's this idea of like

943
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,080
people are moving away from just your

944
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,000
stock standard commercial stuff and

945
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,000
looking for that more boutique type of

946
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
thing do you think that'll ever happen

947
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,919
with cannabis or the current trend you

948
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,599
just described where people

949
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,038
are kind of a bit ignorant of what

950
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,319
they're actually looking for as a

951
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,720
consumer do you think that will continue

952
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,798
i think i think it might happen um i

953
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,159
think it'll take time and by then i

954
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:21,359
think we'll have lost a lot of the

955
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,799
genetics

956
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,240
there'll there'll be people here and

957
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:25,440
there that have preserved some things

958
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,880
there'll be some seeds that we'll be

959
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
able to pull from

960
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,840
but i do feel like there's a lot of

961
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,000
diversity that's getting lost and work

962
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,000
that's not being done

963
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,759
one day consumers might might be

964
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,278
educated enough

965
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,359
might be interested enough in asking for

966
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,759
that but currently with the way the

967
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,558
regulatory landscape is set up it's very

968
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,240
difficult to operate and i think that in

969
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,000
the future when we're able to actually

970
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,480
have interstate commerce so if you know

971
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,038
if a facility was located let's say in

972
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,960
you know arizona but it could ship all

973
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,480
over the country kind of like you know a

974
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,480
small vineyard might

975
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,079
i think you'll have more access to that

976
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,319
boutique market

977
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,398
the same way that the breweries do but

978
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,079
right now with the way it's set up and

979
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,599
you know just kind of having to operate

980
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,038
within a state and comply with the local

981
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,240
regulations and if you want to expand

982
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:11,839
into another state you have to set up

983
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,519
another facility

984
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,278
it's just not it's it's geared towards

985
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,960
rich people it's geared towards the

986
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,720
wealthiest people and right now what

987
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,360
they're doing is they're grabbing

988
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,640
the hugest piece of the markets possible

989
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,719
they're setting up all across the

990
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,759
country so they're you know they'll be

991
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,319
everywhere before they give the craft

992
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,879
people kind of a chance to expand and

993
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:35,038
oregon has a small craft market but it's

994
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,399
been brutal and oklahoma's about to go

995
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:37,679
through the same thing a lot of people

996
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,839
are popping up over there because it's

997
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,960
so inexpensive but what's going to

998
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,398
happen is is the same thing that

999
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,840
happened in oregon

1000
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,038
markets are going to get decimated and a

1001
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:46,558
lot of people are going to lose are

1002
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,240
going to are going to lose what they've

1003
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,678
invested not everyone is going to

1004
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,839
survive that

1005
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,080
but i do think that oregon is a place

1006
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,839
where you might see that craft market

1007
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,599
and you know i could point to brands

1008
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,398
like resin ranchers

1009
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,398
smaller companies that feed you know

1010
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,319
they understand the market and they're

1011
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,798
not they're not over producing they

1012
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,480
could expand they choose not to

1013
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,199
they found a happy medium and a way to

1014
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,599
survive within that but they also had

1015
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,480
deep deep roots in the medical scene

1016
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,960
before the recreational market hit so

1017
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,358
they had those relationships in place

1018
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,199
they had local connections they were

1019
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,559
able to make the transition and i'm sure

1020
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,638
at some point you know if we spoke to

1021
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,559
them they would tell you it wasn't easy

1022
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,878
but they managed to make it work and

1023
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,519
people know you know and our archive is

1024
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,759
a good curator of local

1025
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:38,159
kind of craft products in oregon if

1026
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,760
people want to if you can get your

1027
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,079
product on their shelf it says something

1028
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,560
about your company

1029
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,919
yeah right i remember when i visited the

1030
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,078
oregon store a few years ago they

1031
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,679
definitely had some nice flour there

1032
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,760
something i forgot to mention earlier

1033
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,240
when you're talking about j1 how good is

1034
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,960
j1 i love j1 i can't believe it i love

1035
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,399
j1 people people don't even it's maybe

1036
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,079
it's me and you then

1037
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,160
but people don't people don't seem to

1038
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,160
care for it i think it's a phenomenal

1039
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,358
flower i think it's resinous it's

1040
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:10,078
flavorful it grows impeccably it yields

1041
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,000
well i love the high from it i feel like

1042
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,640
a lot of people they want the narcotic

1043
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,239
high nowadays they have for years but

1044
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,118
they especially seem to want it now i

1045
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,199
don't know if it's just the current

1046
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,920
state of affairs or whatnot

1047
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,239
but

1048
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,960
i think the j1 is a phenomenal flower i

1049
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,279
mean i'm i was i grew that plant for a

1050
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,400
long time and i was i was bummed when i

1051
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,560
lost it

1052
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,160
um i know it still exists i know some

1053
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,400
people still grow it

1054
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,319
and really i mean it's a jack profile

1055
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,880
with better structure better flower

1056
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,200
better finishing time better bag appeal

1057
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,800
i think it's amazing i love it

1058
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:45,039
yeah the thing i noticed about it is no

1059
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,920
one breathes with it ever

1060
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,519
that's true that's true um i would like

1061
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
to at some point i definitely need to

1062
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,719
make an effort to get that cut back in

1063
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,800
the rotation but yeah if you look around

1064
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,799
you don't see any crosses with it part

1065
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,560
of that might be because i think people

1066
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,400
wonder that if you put jack into

1067
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,639
something is anyone gonna want it

1068
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,720
and it's weird a lot of breeding is done

1069
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,639
with that kind of intention like what is

1070
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,199
the market gonna want

1071
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,679
and for years you know i mean even even

1072
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,799
before i started you know offering seeds

1073
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,039
publicly

1074
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,960
i just bred whatever i wanted i didn't

1075
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,279
really think about what people wanted i

1076
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,639
thought about what what i wanted to see

1077
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,480
and

1078
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,960
i mean that's that's why i've read the

1079
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,358
stuff that i've made like

1080
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,280
has nothing to had literally zero

1081
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:33,519
consideration for the market at all

1082
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,359
you know but i learned i mean i it's

1083
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,280
easy to see like what people want and

1084
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,440
what they don't want but i think i think

1085
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,880
a plan like the j1 just if you tell

1086
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,480
people there's jack in something

1087
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
especially in the bay area the face

1088
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,719
they're gonna make is not is not one of

1089
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,319
approval

1090
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,039
well that's almost like a bit of a good

1091
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,880
little segue so if we loop back to

1092
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,679
you were talking about how you'd started

1093
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,160
smoking what was the progression like in

1094
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,919
the transition from say smoker to grower

1095
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,118
for you

1096
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,880
yeah so i started smoking um floyd i

1097
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,280
grew up in florida it's a pretty

1098
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,800
difficult state to operate and i think

1099
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,160
you know you find a lot of people in

1100
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,320
this especially on the west coast that

1101
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,000
were from florida because you had to

1102
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,440
have a real passion for it and that's

1103
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,039
something that that doesn't get tamped

1104
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,159
out i mean at the time

1105
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:22,559
um i was going to school in gainesville

1106
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,480
and i was growing

1107
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,000
i i had a friend of mine had started

1108
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,838
growing when he came back from amsterdam

1109
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,960
and when i saw it i'd seen a setup

1110
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,199
before

1111
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,960
i didn't even know what it was when i

1112
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,358
saw a friend of mine took me to a

1113
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,400
friend's basement in chicago and i went

1114
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:37,838
downstairs

1115
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,720
you know he said hey it's my guy he's

1116
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,719
cool

1117
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,159
whatever whatever he takes me downstairs

1118
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,799
and i see

1119
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,078
um a makeshift space i think it honestly

1120
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,000
i think it had to be like two by fours

1121
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,519
and some kind of plastic it wasn't not

1122
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,760
anything fancy and he opens it up

1123
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,920
and i see a bulb in there and some light

1124
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,040
and some plants and in retrospect now

1125
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,039
looking back i'm like yeah they were

1126
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,159
they were pretty rough looking

1127
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,639
but i didn't know the difference between

1128
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,598
a metal halide and an hps whatever it

1129
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,759
might be

1130
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,440
and i asked him kind of some questions

1131
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,359
and he was actually making seeds in

1132
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,519
there he had a male in there and he was

1133
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,838
actually making seeds which

1134
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,280
totally random um that kind of surprised

1135
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,119
me but it kind of stuck with me and it

1136
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,640
made me think like wow you could just

1137
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,640
you can just do this not having ever

1138
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,319
seen anyone do it before it just i said

1139
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,239
yeah this is something that you could do

1140
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,680
if you just had a little bit of space

1141
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,598
so when i got back to florida um i sold

1142
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,679
a guitar and an amp that i had and i

1143
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,838
went and bought a 400 watt light

1144
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,440
and i set up a space at a house that i

1145
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:38,320
was renting

1146
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,679
and i remember padlocking the door um

1147
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,519
you know if we would have some people

1148
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:42,559
over here and there um then somebody

1149
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,920
would say something about the smell i

1150
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,519
would tell them oh you know we smoke we

1151
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,200
smoke a lot of weed and they would

1152
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,800
inevitably say that's not what weed

1153
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,919
smoke smells like

1154
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,839
um

1155
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,000
but i remember setting up just a small

1156
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,759
closet space with a 400 and i got some

1157
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
cuttings from a friend of mine

1158
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,359
i started growing them in there

1159
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,519
grew them and it actually was some

1160
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:04,000
reclining buddha by soma

1161
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,280
at the time and i remember growing it

1162
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,599
and

1163
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,280
somebody that i used uh somebody i used

1164
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,640
to provide

1165
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,320
mentioned something about the cherry

1166
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,759
flavor in the flower not knowing that i

1167
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,519
had grown it not knowing anything about

1168
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,160
it supposedly having a cherry type

1169
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,599
flavor and i that really stuck with me

1170
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,960
and it made me it made me think about

1171
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,119
all the different possibilities that

1172
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,358
were that were out there and i was in

1173
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,920
school i didn't like it

1174
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,519
i did not enjoy the whole school system

1175
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,440
to be honest i thought it was kind of a

1176
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,280
waste of time and money and a money grab

1177
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,800
for the most part i think you know for

1178
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,400
certain professions it makes sense but

1179
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,200
in general for all kids to go to school

1180
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,440
just

1181
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,799
doesn't really make a lot of sense and

1182
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,800
so

1183
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,680
i was growing for about a year and a

1184
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,440
half out there and i remember um just it

1185
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,358
was mandatory minimums at the time for

1186
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,240
any kind of cultivation there

1187
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:51,598
so

1188
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,879
like a single plant was you know

1189
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,320
mandatory minimum i think it was three

1190
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,599
to five years

1191
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,119
and um

1192
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,800
at that point i had i had a friend would

1193
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,320
move to san diego

1194
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,119
and so

1195
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,880
in talking with him um and you know my

1196
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,079
family they basically said like hey if

1197
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,680
you're gonna keep doing this maybe you

1198
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,119
should just move out west so you don't

1199
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,118
go to jail and uh i packed up i sold

1200
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,280
everything and i moved out west and gave

1201
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,960
it a shot out there in san diego that's

1202
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,119
actually where i got my first taste of

1203
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,559
like real southern california like high

1204
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,480
grade because i used to fly out there

1205
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,679
all the time but like living out there

1206
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,760
and being out there was totally

1207
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,440
different you really got to see what was

1208
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,359
happening and at the time there was a

1209
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,480
medical scene this was after 2 15 had

1210
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:31,170
passed

1211
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,639
and

1212
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,119
[Music]

1213
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,039
it was very very different what was

1214
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,039
happening out there they had clubs but

1215
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,039
they were getting shut down and harassed

1216
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,719
san diego is a beautiful place but it's

1217
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,960
very conservative and

1218
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,039
not very very cannabis friendly although

1219
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,559
there is a large scene there but that

1220
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,239
was where i first started seeing things

1221
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:54,318
like the bull rider

1222
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:56,639
the p91 the cat piss all that stuff and

1223
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:59,119
um they grew some they had some afghani

1224
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,358
whatnot and i just remember seeing just

1225
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,000
the sheer volume of flour that was

1226
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,598
coming out of out of the area in general

1227
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,039
and it really you know it stuck with me

1228
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,640
and so i had the chance to move out

1229
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,880
there i gave it a go

1230
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:13,358
um it didn't work out a friend of mine

1231
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,358
got addicted to oxies so that that kind

1232
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:16,719
of went sideways i don't know how much

1233
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:18,880
people have spoken about that kind of

1234
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,719
stuff but this business is not easy um

1235
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,119
the lifestyle is not easy

1236
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,799
it's a lot you know you might see people

1237
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,000
that people think are successful but i

1238
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,079
don't think people know everything they

1239
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,599
had to go through and how many times

1240
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,880
they had to try and how many times they

1241
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,318
didn't quit

1242
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,880
before they were able to see some

1243
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:38,880
success i mean it's a tough business and

1244
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,559
you know definitely that type of

1245
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,160
lifestyle at the time it was not a

1246
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,679
traditional lifestyle so you know

1247
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,358
definitely pills and whatnot and

1248
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,118
everything we're around

1249
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,480
and that's kind of when oxy i think

1250
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,280
we're starting to get a hold on people

1251
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,119
out there so that didn't really work out

1252
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,079
um i ended up

1253
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,240
leaving everything moving back east

1254
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,519
working again saving some more money and

1255
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,439
then

1256
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,880
i was kind of over it because i hadn't i

1257
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,119
hadn't been to norcal i was kind of over

1258
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,960
it san diego just reminded me of l.a

1259
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,079
and miami crossed together and i said to

1260
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,559
do that i'll just go back and live in

1261
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,599
miami i like miami

1262
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,759
and then

1263
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,280
um some friends of mine were out in lake

1264
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,520
tahoe and they invited me out for the

1265
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,519
summer to go visit out there they lived

1266
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,119

00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,880
and uh i went out there to lake tahoe

1271
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,800
and it was stunning it was beautiful i'd

1272
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,760
never seen anything like it never seen

1273
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,839
anything like it i don't know if you've

1274
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,000
had the chance to get to lake tahoe but

1275
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,279
it's beautiful stunning you know

1276
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,519
impactful

1277
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,359
and had a chance to go down to oakland

1278
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,039
with my friends and i remember being at

1279
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,199
somebody's house

1280
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,400
at a friend of my friend's house

1281
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,159
and they had told him you know this is

1282
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,760
this is my guy been friends for a long

1283
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,679
time so everything was fine with me and

1284
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,839
him but somebody came by

1285
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,159
um with a duffel bag and a bunch of

1286
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,599
perps a bunch of perp packs and which

1287
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,399
was you know huge in the bay area at

1288
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,359
that time that was like around 2005

1289
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,119
2006 and uh

1290
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,960
i remember them

1291
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,400
um you know doing whatever they were

1292
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,199
doing with the per packs and then him

1293
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,960
pulling out like a pound of purple keef

1294
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,919
and saying like i don't know what to do

1295
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,599
with this

1296
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,680
and at that point that's when i chimed

1297
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,280
in and said you know well you know i'll

1298
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,039
take that and he didn't know who i was

1299
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,119
he was completely thrown off by me the

1300
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,358
guy sitting on the couch smoking not

1301
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,079
saying anything saying i'll take that

1302
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,358
and um but it just it was obvious to me

1303
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,359
at that point that like i was in the

1304
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,838
wrong place because

1305
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,199
i'm in a city right now where people

1306
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,119
have a pound of purple keith and don't

1307
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:40,719
know what to do with it i'd never seen a

1308
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,160
pound of purple keef anywhere like so it

1309
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,318
blew my mind and i was like yeah i'm

1310
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,960
coming back to oakland and so you know i

1311
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,800
went home i worked saved more money sold

1312
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,639
everything i owned and rented a

1313
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,519
warehouse off craigslist

1314
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,679
not not having ever seen it and

1315
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,519
just moved out with two duffel bags and

1316
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,039
you know bought some lights and got to

1317
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,880
work out there and

1318
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,719
kind of built up from there

1319
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,200
i mean it definitely you know it wasn't

1320
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,799
it was not easy uh to give it a run i

1321
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,559
don't know if you if you spent any time

1322
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,800
in oakland oakland is getting gentrified

1323
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,239
now it's a lot more cleaned up as it

1324
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,440
were but

1325
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:17,118
still a rough city um and still you know

1326
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,519
but a place a place that lives eats and

1327
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,559
sleeps high grade cannabis in my opinion

1328
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,719
i know my friends in socal might differ

1329
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,920
but i think i think the bay area is the

1330
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:31,039
epicenter of global cannabis not even

1331
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,920
not even you know just in california but

1332
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,519
globally and no knock on you know

1333
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,039
humboldt or whatever the emerald

1334
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,960
triangle all that stuff they do their

1335
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,559
thing up there but if you really really

1336
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,159
look at who's been making the waves over

1337
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,078
the last decade

1338
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,159
it's the bay area and if anyone has any

1339
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,519
claim before that it's socal you know

1340
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,879
with the og's

1341
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,039
but since then

1342
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,039
it's been all the bay area i mean all of

1343
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,199
it you know the cookies

1344
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,960
the gelatos the sherbs everything all

1345
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,598
this stuff it's just been bay area bay

1346
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,400
area bay area for you know probably the

1347
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,760
last seven or eight years maybe 10 years

1348
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,440
yeah 100

1349
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,880
i mean there's there's so many things we

1350
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,960
can touch on there the first thing i

1351
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,280
wanted to do before we move past it you

1352
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,440
mentioned the bull rider the p91 and the

1353
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,519
cat pierced down in san diego sounds

1354
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,760
like you were down there when matt was

1355
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,920
kind of doing his thing matt riot were

1356
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,160
you familiar with him at all or not

1357
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,480
really i i was not i avoided any kind of

1358
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,480
social interaction possible with people

1359
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,719
that were outside of my circle

1360
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,559
um i think it's a big reason why i've

1361
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,639
managed to kind of stay out of trouble

1362
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,318
a lot of these guys have had run-ins or

1363
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,639
had you know people snitch on them or

1364
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:41,358
whatever it might be or get robbed

1365
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,118
and i pretty much avoided everyone

1366
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:44,480
i was connected with one circle of

1367
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,800
people out there

1368
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,719
that had access to all of those flowers

1369
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,560
they were born and raised in san diego

1370
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,480
so all those guys you know had gone to

1371
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,358
school there and so they you know they

1372
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,960
all

1373
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,358
they all had the local connections for

1374
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,119
those flowers um and a lot of those

1375
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,598
flowers i mean you don't see them

1376
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,358
anymore like anywhere and even the bull

1377
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,640
rider it fell off years and years later

1378
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:05,838
i know people are out there now saying

1379
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,358
that they still have it and grow it i'd

1380
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,838
like to see it

1381
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:10,960
to see if it is what it is i almost

1382
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:12,318
think at this point you could just tell

1383
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,519
people it's bull rider and them having

1384
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:14,800
never seen it they wouldn't know the

1385
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,358
difference

1386
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,599
because it's just some afghani right

1387
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,598
yes supposedly you know not having been

1388
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,119
there for for it um that's my

1389
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,559
understanding of it and you know it

1390
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,480
didn't have the big the best bag appeal

1391
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,799
or anything it was big flowers you could

1392
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,159
tell it yielded um and there was also

1393
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,599
there was a super silver haze that was

1394
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,039
being grown out there in long beach at

1395
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,359
the time too

1396
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,759
um that was phenomenal i mean ridiculous

1397
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,679
and there was a cali mist and i mean i i

1398
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,680
kind of i kind of miss those days there

1399
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,279
was some flower that you couldn't buy

1400
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,358
like there was such a limited amount it

1401
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,200
was already spoken for people would

1402
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,480
prepay for the flower which is something

1403
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,239
that i don't know that if young people

1404
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,760
even like would understand what that is

1405
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,318
like they would pre-pay before the

1406
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,400
harvest so that they could have their

1407
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,159
their share of that harvest

1408
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,760
and there was a super silver haze that

1409
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,000
was like that and the guy that i knew

1410
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,240
who would get it he wouldn't sell any of

1411
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,559
it he would only trade me so i'd have to

1412
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:07,838
trade him like that this super silver

1413
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:09,920
haze let's say that i would get for the

1414
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,679
cali mist that he was getting and it was

1415
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,039
just like a one-to-one trade that was it

1416
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:14,399
like as much as i was willing to give up

1417
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:16,400
that's as much as he was willing to give

1418
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,680
up and

1419
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,119
it was um you know it was different

1420
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:20,480
there was just there was more limited

1421
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,838
limited flower out there at the time but

1422
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,920
you know i didn't i didn't know matt

1423
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:27,920
um yeah seems like he he seems like he

1424
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,039
was more social i mean definitely i

1425
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,639
think he was into like the punk rock

1426
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,639
scene and whatnot so

1427
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,039
he was definitely out there um i was

1428
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,400
hanging out with jamaicans and a totally

1429
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,639
different type of scene in like mission

1430
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,200
beach and pb out there

1431
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:44,480
yeah cool okay and so then what was your

1432
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:47,919
transition from going as just a grower

1433
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,199
to then starting to make your own seeds

1434
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,400
yeah so

1435
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:54,639
so we were on icmag a bunch of us and

1436
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,639
you know i had tried to buy seeds years

1437
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:57,759
ago off like heaven's stairway or

1438
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,358
something

1439
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,720
they didn't make it i freaked out i was

1440
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,558
in florida the time i said i'm not

1441
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,000
buying anything else through the mail

1442
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,839
i'm over it

1443
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,400
and then i knew people that were buying

1444
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,159
off off ic mag off uh seed bay and seed

1445
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,838
boutique and so i said you know what i

1446
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:13,519
said i'm gonna start getting some seeds

1447
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:14,799
and i started just collecting some seeds

1448
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,719
and sending some money orders here and

1449
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,960
there and grabbing some stuff

1450
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,118
and i actually the first thing i ever

1451
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,280
tried to do was i took a male from a

1452
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,440
pack of soma's reclining buddha and

1453
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,200
tried to hit a bunch of things but i

1454
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,920
learned a valuable lesson from that in

1455
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:32,719
that like at all everything that i grew

1456
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,480
from that was terrible it was all trash

1457
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,239
and i did it to my bubble jack the east

1458
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,639
coast sour and a couple other things and

1459
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,719
they were just trash it was nothing good

1460
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,558
came from that mail

1461
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:45,598
and so i chucked all those seeds

1462
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,200
whatever whatever with that and then

1463
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,000
some friends of mine

1464
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,279
were doing a lot of outdoor work and you

1465
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,760
know we were talking about like how the

1466
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,960
blue dream would go deep into november

1467
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,559
it was a great plan for outdoor

1468
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,318
cultivation but they wanted something

1469
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,519
that would finish faster

1470
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,880
and i had some williams wonder

1471
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,559
from reef

1472
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,960
and so um we popped those found a male

1473
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,319
and hit the blue dream with that because

1474
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,159
we figured all right this is going to be

1475
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:13,599
a plant that is going to this is really

1476
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,199
going to be a phenomenal plant for

1477
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,400
outdoor cultivation it should finish

1478
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,318
faster

1479
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,160
from the afghani influence it should

1480
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,079
still be resonance it should still you

1481
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,078
know be real chunky hopefully pick up

1482
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,680
some resistance to pm and botrytis and

1483
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,000
whatever it might be

1484
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,519
so we started that project and that's

1485
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,639
something we worked on over a couple of

1486
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:35,119
years just kind of in our own world

1487
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,440
nothing to do with any kind of

1488
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,200
thoughts towards vending seeds or a seed

1489
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,639
company or anything

1490
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,039
it was just something that we worked on

1491
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:45,440
collaboratively as a group

1492
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,199
and so we worked that for a couple of

1493
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,679
generations and that's where that wet

1494
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,598
dream plant came from and that was my

1495
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,000
first like realization like okay like

1496
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,760
yeah you can use a male but

1497
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,039
they're definitely not all the same and

1498
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,440
it doesn't matter what kind of female

1499
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:00,880
you cross it to if the male is trash

1500
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,880
like the work that comes from that is

1501
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,400
going to be trash so we got lucky you

1502
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,039
know we got lucky and the mail that we

1503
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,800
used was really solid and from there you

1504
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,480
know we did one further selection and

1505
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,640
then i've done a couple of open open

1506
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,760
populations since then just to kind of

1507
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:17,759
spread it out and uh see see what kind

1508
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,319
of variants we might find in there and

1509
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,480
not not bottleneck the gene pool

1510
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,119
so that's you know that was probably the

1511
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,800
first actual breeding projects that we

1512
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,480
did as a group was just a couple of

1513
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,318
friends with just an intention to breed

1514
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,079
something that would do better and

1515
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,000
finish faster and at the time we weren't

1516
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,400
even really doing the depths it was all

1517
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,760
just the larger full season plants so we

1518
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,119
just wanted something that would still

1519
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,640
you know throw down big plants but

1520
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,318
finish quicker

1521
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,000
and what was your impressions of the

1522
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:46,000
williams wonder strain that's something

1523
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,199
we frequently reminisce about on the

1524
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,719
show

1525
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:50,558
yeah so i

1526
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,318
we loved it um

1527
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,160
some of the when when i was living in

1528
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:55,440
chicago for a while i was staying out

1529
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,318
there

1530
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,318
for a little bit and um the packs that

1531
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:02,239
we would get were the willys is what we

1532
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:04,480
used to call them and they were coming

1533
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,399
out of oregon at the time which my

1534
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,400
understanding is like that's where that

1535
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,280
variety was developed

1536
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,400
and i loved it i mean beautiful

1537
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,720
like electric green resinous flowers

1538
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,880
large

1539
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,000
like nowadays you know it would be hard

1540
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,400
it would be hard to really find

1541
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,838
something comparable to it but because

1542
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,920
you know a lot of what's popular now is

1543
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:27,920
like the candy stuff and the fruit sweet

1544
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,400
stuff or whatever it might be

1545
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,358
it was like a real hashy plant

1546
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,160
um

1547
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:35,920
but potent you know potent like the high

1548
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,879
from it was what we really really

1549
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,800
enjoyed it's beautiful beautiful flower

1550
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,720
and that's something that i mean you

1551
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,960
just you don't see it around anymore

1552
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,879
there's like i i mean i imagine it might

1553
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,240
still exist somewhere i like i think

1554
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,599
inspect and i've talked about it there's

1555
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,598
usually someone in the hill somewhere

1556
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,800
holding something but they don't talk to

1557
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,880
anyone and so you probably never see it

1558
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,559
but that's that's a really old plant

1559
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,599
that i just don't think that you see

1560
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,400
anything like that anywhere else anymore

1561
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,240
yeah certainly it seems like people are

1562
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,318
kind of madly looking for any remnants

1563
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:10,959
of it so

1564
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:13,599
for the next little bit of chat i wanted

1565
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,960
to touch on something which i think

1566
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,480
everyone will be really interested to

1567
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,400
hear the story about which probably a

1568
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,800
lot of people aren't actually aware that

1569
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,318
you were the person who found the forum

1570
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,480
cut

1571
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,239
that's true would you be able to give us

1572
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,838
the backstory on that one

1573
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,679
yeah absolutely yeah people have asked

1574
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:30,960
for years i've just never like i said

1575
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,519
you know i never really wanted any

1576
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,400
attention for anything so

1577
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,480
i mean i think people have uh people

1578
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,280
have said that profit was the one that

1579
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,639
gave it out and or my other buddy uh

1580
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,839
frost boss

1581
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:46,960
both of them have probably been

1582
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:49,039
um both of them have probably been

1583
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,039
involved in like the actual story more

1584
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,358
than myself publicly

1585
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,599
um so what happened there was we used to

1586
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,119
have a get-together party and i see mag

1587
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,559
party in vegas there was just kind of

1588
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,440
just for a bunch of us together like

1589
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,680
invite only we would like rent a house

1590
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,358
and get out there and whatnot i i had

1591
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:08,000
tried to avoid as much as humanly

1592
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,519
possible um going to any of these events

1593
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,559
just because why do i want to be in a

1594
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:14,639
building with a bunch of growers

1595
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,240
so i tried to avoid it for a while but

1596
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,519
one of our friends had got into some

1597
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:19,598
legal trouble

1598
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,239
and i had helped him out when he got

1599
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,838
popped and they took all his plants i

1600
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:26,318
always have

1601
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,920
um extra like just i always have an

1602
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:29,119
excessive amount of edge plants because

1603
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,720
you just never know when you're going to

1604
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,480
need them and if you need them i'd

1605
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,679
rather have them you can always chop

1606
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,679
them down you can always do whatever

1607
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,679
with them but you at least have them on

1608
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,279
deck so when when our friend had got in

1609
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:40,879
trouble and they'd cut down his garden

1610
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,000
taking all his plants and whatnot i knew

1611
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,519
when he got out he was going to need

1612
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,039
some help

1613
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,800
and so i hit him up and just asked if he

1614
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,400
wanted anything i could help him out and

1615
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,720
so i got him some plants got him

1616
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,480
replugged and he said to me you know we

1617
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,078
have this party in vegas you should

1618
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,079
really come out

1619
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,240
i hadn't really wanted to go out but he

1620
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:02,160
talked me into it so i ended up going

1621
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:03,759
out and i met uh frost boss and um i

1622
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:04,558
don't think profit profit was there that

1623
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,800
year

1624
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,559
for the first one but i met frost boss

1625
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,079
and i remember hanging out with him

1626
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,920
and uh you know we were both from the

1627
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,359
bay and he had told me about something

1628
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,800
called cookies he said yeah man there's

1629
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:15,679
something called cookies have you heard

1630
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,359
of it

1631
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,519
and i said nah i never heard of it and

1632
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,719
he said oh man it's it's it's special

1633
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:22,559
man you should check it out and i was

1634
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,480
like yeah yeah whatever whatever because

1635
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,839
i was growing nothing but sour and oh

1636
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,838
geez at that time i didn't really have

1637
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:29,679
any interest i mean sour noji had

1638
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,199
reigned supreme for so long that why

1639
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:32,639
would i be interested in anything else

1640
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,719
to be honest like i'd seen a lot of

1641
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,558
people come with other flour none of it

1642
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,480
you know exceeded the towers or the ogs

1643
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,160
so what what was the point

1644
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,280
um

1645
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:43,519
but he had told me about something

1646
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,440
called cookies and whatnot and so when

1647
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,679
we got back

1648
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,318
he came by my house one day and in his

1649
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:52,719
pocket he had a little smashed up nugget

1650
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:55,279
inside a ziploc bag like a tiny tiny

1651
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,358
little 0.3.4 nugget

1652
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,640
and it was abused it didn't really look

1653
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,078
that great

1654
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,719
it had some purple color to it and

1655
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,318
whatnot i didn't think much of it

1656
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,318
i broke it up though i ground it up and

1657
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:08,318
i put it in my volcano and so i i've

1658
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,159
been vaporizing for a long time i do it

1659
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:11,759
mostly because of the health benefit but

1660
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,679
also because it's honestly the most

1661
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,599
flavorful way

1662
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:17,118
to experience flour in my opinion if

1663
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,000
you're just about the terpene profile if

1664
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,480
you really just want to know what it

1665
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,358
tastes like you know that's gonna be the

1666
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,440
best way to get that full experience so

1667
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,679
i ground it up i stuck it in the volcano

1668
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,599
i vaped it and instantly i kinda i got

1669
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:30,639
what he was talking about

1670
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,039
and

1671
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:34,960
i started asking around um he knew the

1672
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,719
people he's familiar and you know he

1673
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,480
knows all all he knows that whole circle

1674
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:40,399
he's from sf

1675
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,159
but he didn't have access to the cut and

1676
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,160
so cause i asked and he said yeah if we

1677
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,759
can get it we should get it

1678
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,838
and so i asked a couple of friends of

1679
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,040
mine who were actually one of them was

1680
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:50,798
the same person that i worked with on

1681
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,480
the wet dream and

1682
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:54,960
they didn't even know what i was talking

1683
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,000
about they had no clue so i said

1684
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,358
specifically i said it's something

1685
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,880
called cookies

1686
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:01,358
this that and the other ask around and

1687
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,358
see see if you can find it

1688
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,519
he asked a friend of ours he didn't know

1689
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,358
what it was that friend actually asked

1690
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,920
another person that they knew

1691
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,960
who ran a hydro store in the emeryville

1692
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,200
area

1693
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:18,000
and he was married to an asian girl

1694
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,519
whose family ran a grow spot somewhere

1695
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,480
in that area

1696
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:22,719
um

1697
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,838
it turned out that although he didn't

1698
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:25,039
have it

1699
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,759
they did

1700
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,759
and we asked about it and they said oh

1701
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,599
you know we need we need like six grand

1702
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,480
or five grand or whatever it was at that

1703
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,599
time

1704
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,199
um

1705
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,318
and you know we kind of i think we all

1706
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,318
just kind of looked at each other like

1707
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:39,679
ah you know is it really is it worth it

1708
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:41,119
i mean that's that you know it's a lot

1709
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,318
of money for a cut

1710
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,000
especially at that time and um we

1711
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,519
decided that it was and he basically

1712
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,280
said he could get a lower price if you

1713
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:52,719
know if we gave him a cut so they they

1714
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,240
gave us one plant um he took a cutting

1715
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,239
off of it my other friend who put it

1716
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:57,919
together took a cutting off it and my

1717
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,519
friend who had

1718
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,440
who had kind of put the whole thing

1719
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:02,880
together through these other people he

1720
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,280
didn't have a place to keep it so he

1721
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,960
gave it to me and said hey hold on to it

1722
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,880
because he knows if you give it to me

1723
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,920
i'm gonna hold on to it

1724
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,000
and so i remember getting it and ramping

1725
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,000
it up and posting about it actually on

1726
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,079
icmag at the time it's probably the

1727
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,358
first post about cookies like ever

1728
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,359
publicly

1729
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:22,798
and i remember posting about it and just

1730
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,838
saying hey i got this girl scout cookies

1731
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:28,000
blah blah blah whatever

1732
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:30,798
um grew it you know started growing it

1733
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,798
out what not and it you know showed uh

1734
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:35,440
my buddy frost boss and profit the

1735
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,880
samples of it and it was cookies

1736
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,200
um

1737
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,760
and so we had it at that time and what

1738
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:45,199
happened was i had a small get-together

1739
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,480
at my house and i gave a cutting to four

1740
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:48,960
different people

1741
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,798
my buddy frost boss cut a cutting

1742
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,480
profit out of cutting

1743
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:53,519
and two other people that were there got

1744
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,960
cuttings

1745
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,039
and

1746
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,440
at that point i didn't pass it with any

1747
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,199
restrictions i didn't say you can't sell

1748
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,880
it i gave it to them for free i didn't

1749
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,199
think they were gonna sell it

1750
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,640
i didn't really see what you know what

1751
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,719
they would i didn't think that it would

1752
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:10,639
end up going the way that it did

1753
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,480
and what ended up happening was yeah

1754
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,318
people started hitting them up to buy

1755
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,920
the cuts people came up from la people

1756
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:17,199
came from all over the place

1757
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,159
cuttings went to a couple different

1758
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:22,239
people from there and then

1759
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,639
cuttings made it all the way to the uk i

1760
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:26,159
know um i see mag people out there got

1761
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,358
it got it through people that we know

1762
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,039
out here

1763
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:30,639
and it just kind of it just kind of went

1764
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,079
off i mean it got to the point where

1765
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,798
when people were typing girl scout

1766
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,960
cookies in the search engine the ic mag

1767
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:38,639
thread was coming up which is why they

1768
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,159
made us rename it so we weren't allowed

1769
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:41,759
to type girl scout cookies anymore we

1770
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:44,318
had to type gsc

1771
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,559
and at that point um is when people

1772
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:48,960
started calling it the forum cut and it

1773
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,480
started because people outside the board

1774
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,519
and people amongst the board started

1775
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,920
getting it

1776
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,639
and it really just spread like wildfire

1777
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,880
i mean then i think animal came animal

1778
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,480
wasn't a thing at that time and you know

1779
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,400
our buddy straight flame he would have

1780
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,679
some insight into this but

1781
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,160
in my circle with with these guys animal

1782
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,838
didn't exist there was just cookies um

1783
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,318
and as far as we knew

1784
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:14,159
that was it i didn't there was the word

1785
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:16,400
thin mint the word platinum none of that

1786
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,239
had ever been uttered there was no

1787
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,358
there was no differentiation it was just

1788
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:20,479
cookies

1789
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,519
um

1790
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,400
and i think at that time is when like it

1791
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,159
started to kind of gain popularity

1792
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,200
and part of it i think part of the

1793
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:31,838
reason why i think it did gain the

1794
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:34,000
popularity is because it got out so much

1795
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:35,838
i think if it hadn't got out

1796
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,798
nobody would ever really seen it it you

1797
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:38,318
know it would have been it would have

1798
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:40,639
been some of the nicest herb nobody ever

1799
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,639
got to try and to be honest like the

1800
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:45,039
packs that they were growing were not

1801
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:48,318
very good like the asian packs and the

1802
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:50,159
packs from the guys in the city were not

1803
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,358
really the greatest examples of cookies

1804
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:52,879
i think it really took it getting into

1805
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,440
the hands of some people who actually

1806
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,680
cared about cultivating better flower

1807
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,358
and once once people really put a lot of

1808
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:00,719
intent into it they saw like wow you

1809
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:02,798
know this is some really there's some

1810
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:03,679
really high grade flower it's beautiful

1811
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:05,199
you know

1812
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:06,879
stunning totally different than anything

1813
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,199
we were growing at the time

1814
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,039
and some of the first cookie packs to

1815
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,358
get to the green door came out of my

1816
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,798
garden and i remember going in there one

1817
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:16,719
day after i've been bending cookie packs

1818
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:18,239
to them for a while and seeing like they

1819
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:19,439
had like platinum cookies and i said

1820
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,798
what's was platinum cookies and they

1821
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,480
said oh that's that's your cookies we

1822
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:23,838
just we just renamed it because there's

1823
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,838
other cookie packs now coming that

1824
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:27,039
aren't as good so they started putting

1825
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:29,440
like regular cookies there and then

1826
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:31,358
platinum cookies and then from there

1827
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,960
came like thin mint and this and that

1828
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:35,039
and i think the cookie guys even came

1829
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,280
out and said that it wasn't real cookies

1830
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:40,318
but if you ask around now like globally

1831
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,640
speaking if people know cookies it's

1832
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,480
it's that cut um

1833
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,440
whatever whatever you know people people

1834
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,639
i think it's kind of one of those things

1835
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,079
where people might have forum and they

1836
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,000
might say oh it's thin mentor it might

1837
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,920
be this or it might be that i know that

1838
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,358
there was a different group in la that

1839
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,358
i've spoken with

1840
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,960
some friends of my friends down there

1841
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:58,400
that had a cookie cut around the same

1842
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,519
time

1843
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,760
and so around that like 09010

1844
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:06,239
kind of area or yeah basically right

1845
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,839
around there is when people started

1846
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:09,519
popping up with some of these other ones

1847
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:12,639
but there really wasn't any

1848
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:15,759
differentiation at all an animal became

1849
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,358
a thing i mean i saw the animal from my

1850
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,520
buddy frost boss that's who i got the

1851
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,440
cut from and we ran them side by side

1852
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,679
they were a little bit different but i

1853
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,280
honestly think that i think there was

1854
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:30,078
just a bunch of s-ones of whatever

1855
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,440
like whatever or or a bunch of femme

1856
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,519
seeds

1857
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,440
that that forum probably came from and

1858
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,280
that all the cookies probably came from

1859
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,760
because if you've noticed there's never

1860
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,160
been a cookie mail ever

1861
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,599
ever like and if you would think if you

1862
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,519
had the most pop one of the most popular

1863
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,240
strains in the last 20 years

1864
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,639
you would be capitalizing on that by by

1865
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:52,879
breeding with the male

1866
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,719
but it doesn't exist that i've ever seen

1867
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,880
and it's been a long time since since

1868
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:58,719
that plant's been out so that's you know

1869
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,480
i think that's probably

1870
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,399
the majority of the story besides the

1871
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,000
fact you know that there was all kinds

1872
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,480
of all kinds of crazy things going on

1873
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,159
with that cut i mean there was it got to

1874
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,240
the point where it was it was just

1875
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,159
everywhere and that honestly like i've

1876
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:13,519
never really said anything about it but

1877
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,759
that's something that kind of sat with

1878
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:17,358
me a little bit poorly was that people

1879
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,839
started using the term like whoring it

1880
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,440
out and i didn't like that because i

1881
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:22,960
felt like it was disrespectful i mean

1882
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,039
it's something that we put out for free

1883
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,679
i put it out for free you know we paid

1884
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,359
for it and we put it out for free and so

1885
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,279
for people to kind of like treat it like

1886
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:33,519
that kind of left a salty taste in my

1887
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,280
mouth i think it's why i really haven't

1888
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:37,199
been a proponent of passing out a lot of

1889
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,440
cuts i'm very very selective now about

1890
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,279
where and who i pass cuts to

1891
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,200
um and i i learned a lot from that

1892
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,440
because i think also you started seeing

1893
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,199
a lot of poor examples of the flower and

1894
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,119
that that goes down to one of my one of

1895
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:50,480
my uh one of my favorite hashtags that i

1896
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,160
don't use that much but it it's

1897
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,679
basically stop stop giving shitty

1898
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:55,279
growers good cuts

1899
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:56,879
because they make it look bad somebody

1900
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,160
sees an example of it and then says oh

1901
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,440
well you know i've had cookies and it's

1902
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:00,159
not that good

1903
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,318
no

1904
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:03,838
you just had a shitty example of it it's

1905
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:05,920
it's proper herb

1906
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,358
like grown right it's beautiful flower

1907
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,798
and it's look at the staying power i

1908
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,199
mean it's been

1909
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,318
it's the most significant variety since

1910
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:13,759
og

1911
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:16,159
and i challenge anyone to point out

1912
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,000
another variety it's not perps either i

1913
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:20,480
mean i love the perps and it was big in

1914
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,159
the bay area but it never went national

1915
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,000
it never went global

1916
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:26,639
like it's a bay area thing you know

1917
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,599
nobody in new york was asking for perps

1918
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:31,279
like people did want cookies

1919
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,880
no that's that's a really good recount

1920
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,280
so i think the first thing i'd want to

1921
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,599
follow up with is i'd always assume that

1922
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,240
the forum cut was just like an s1 of

1923
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,000
thin mint do you feel that that's maybe

1924
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:44,558
not the case or what do you think was

1925
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,719
the original girl scout cut that the

1926
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,680
cookie fam had

1927
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:51,838
yeah so i don't i don't think so i think

1928
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:54,879
that if anything

1929
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:57,038
probably in those like they had they had

1930
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,160
and so frost boss um i've spoken to him

1931
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,359
a little bit about it there there were

1932
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:04,399
some seated packs back back then

1933
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:06,400
um and he even he worked like deseeding

1934
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,639
some of these packs and we think that

1935
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,480
that's where the girl scout cookies like

1936
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,318
seeds came from

1937
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,880
um because i think what happened was

1938
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:16,880
that there was i i've always said i

1939
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,559
could be wrong and this is one of those

1940
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,798
things where i'd love to see

1941
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,760
i'd love to see it if i'm wrong or if

1942
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:25,838
i'm not but at the time you know the the

1943
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,240
ogs and the cherry pie were like what

1944
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:29,599
was really really popular in the bay and

1945
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,118
a lot of people had those in their

1946
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,519
gardens and everybody knows that the

1947
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:36,079
cherry pie is unstable and whenever i've

1948
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:38,798
looked at the cookies that's what i see

1949
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,160
i see cherry pie and og like i see i see

1950
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,719
it in the structure i see it in the

1951
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:45,598
color i see it in the flavor i see it in

1952
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:47,838
the profile like all of the above like

1953
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,318
that's that's what i've seen

1954
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:51,838
um to me i think that

1955
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:53,038
there was you know an accidental

1956
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:55,199
pollination

1957
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,799
and they grew some of the seeds out and

1958
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:57,838
that's probably where their cookie cut

1959
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:01,038
came from

1960
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:03,038
i imagine that the forum cut came out of

1961
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,559
that same pack of seeds let's say as it

1962
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,000
were out of those same packs and that

1963
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,519
they just grew it themselves

1964
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,159
independently

1965
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:12,159
and that's where we got that cut from i

1966
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,558
could be wrong but like i said there

1967
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:17,118
would the word thin mint had never got

1968
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,240
uttered like that word did not exist

1969
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,280
like that

1970
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:23,838
that like that description of a specific

1971
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,240
cutting was not a thing like my buddy

1972
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,920
frost boss never said oh there's this

1973
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:31,279
thin mint or there's this platinum it

1974
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,000
was just cookies and after cookies came

1975
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,920
like animal and that was it like it was

1976
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,960
cookies and then animal and then i

1977
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,960
started hearing people talking about

1978
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,039
thin mint and all this other stuff i

1979
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,199
think that may have been a reaction on

1980
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,039
their part to try and say

1981
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:47,358
hey we have something that's not what

1982
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,520
everyone else has it's not the cut

1983
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,119
that's going around we have thin mint

1984
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:53,599
cookies and that's the cookie fam

1985
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,798
version of it but i could be wrong you

1986
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,880
know i would love to hear their

1987
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:57,920
perspective on it if that's the case

1988
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,358
like you know one of the things that

1989
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,079
that does crack me up is when they talk

1990
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:03,598
about breeding because if you bread it

1991
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,280
where's the mail

1992
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,440
like

1993
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,798
and even if not what did you reverse to

1994
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,200
make it happen they keep talking about

1995
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,280
oh it's this and f1 derb and blah blah

1996
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:14,480
blah it's like i was in the bay there

1997
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,680
people can say whatever they want to say

1998
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,639
and i'd love to have my buddy straight

1999
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:19,598
flame clarify some points and he might

2000
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:21,038
um

2001
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,599
i've never seen it

2002
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,880
you know and we've seen a lot of flower

2003
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,359
and just

2004
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,039
that's the bay area is very very tight

2005
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:30,880
like in terms of like what's happening

2006
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,440
and who's growing what like

2007
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,838
people know what's going around like we

2008
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,440
eat sleep and breathe it and so if there

2009
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:39,920
was such a thing we would have heard

2010
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,440
about it it's not a thing like and if

2011
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,280
you like i said if there was this f1

2012
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,679
derp and you used it to make this you

2013
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:48,319
know generational flower

2014
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:49,279
why not use it again

2015
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:51,599
yeah like

2016
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,440
where's it at

2017
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,400
so with all that being said about the

2018
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:58,639
girl scout cookies do you tend to try to

2019
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,200
avoid working with the forum cut now

2020
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,159
because it is so widespread and used or

2021
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:03,838
is it just something you're not

2022
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:05,440
particularly interested in working with

2023
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,838
or do you have plans for in the future

2024
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,599
how do you see the whole situation

2025
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:11,199
yeah so i've actually

2026
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,680
have my bread with it yeah you know i

2027
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,919
actually hit it once and i only made a

2028
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:17,440
few seeds with it i did a forum with the

2029
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,119
sh with the sherb

2030
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,039
um but i've never actually grown i

2031
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,119
haven't grown them out yet

2032
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,280
uh i mean i think initially when we

2033
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,200
first got it like i just i had such

2034
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,960
respect for people breeding that i just

2035
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:30,480
didn't really feel like that was like

2036
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,760
the thing to do

2037
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,358
was just to like

2038
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,880
run on it and just cash in on it and

2039
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:37,598
whatnot so

2040
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,280
just avoided it and now

2041
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,640
i think generally

2042
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,839
um

2043
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:44,159
i think i'm just more interested in

2044
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:46,159
other types of work there's so much work

2045
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:48,399
that's similar to it now whether it's

2046
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:50,719
the docido and whatnot

2047
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,960
that i just don't really see

2048
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:56,480
what i would do with it um

2049
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,480
if anything for me you know as a plant

2050
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,000
and of itself i appreciate it for

2051
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,679
breeding purposes

2052
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,358
it's not really the direction that i'm

2053
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:05,038
looking to go in one of the things that

2054
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:07,119
really surprised me about it was you

2055
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,119
know we we'd all been told and kind of

2056
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,760
the common thought was that oh it's a

2057
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,640
crazy poly hybrid and whatnot so you

2058
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,079
know you're not it's not going to be

2059
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:16,238
stable you're not going to find anything

2060
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:18,560
good in it it's actually incredibly

2061
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:21,759
dominant in a lot of the crosses like it

2062
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,279
really really comes out in the crosses

2063
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,719
similar to kind of how the docido does

2064
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,960
the cookie the cookies tend to really

2065
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,319
really shine through in a lot of these

2066
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,239
crosses

2067
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,679
so for me

2068
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,198
it's not that i'm avoiding it i've

2069
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,560
actually thought about doing a femme

2070
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,079
project with the forum i thought it

2071
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,520
might be fun

2072
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:39,039
there's just a lot of other stuff on the

2073
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,600
plate that's kind of like looking

2074
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,880
forward that i think are more valuable

2075
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,719
you know in terms of in terms of what

2076
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,480
i'm trying to do with my time

2077
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:49,198
so i as much as i love it i think i

2078
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:51,759
would include it in some projects but

2079
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:54,879
not necessarily right now is like the

2080
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:56,399
focus of what i'm trying to do um i

2081
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,039
could see it being a part of something

2082
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:00,960
but not being like the main piece in

2083
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:02,238
everything

2084
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,560
yeah okay

2085
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,798
and so how do you feel about cookies in

2086
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:09,199
general not just the various cuttings

2087
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:12,399
but like the brand and where they're

2088
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:15,039
trying to take the whole image of it all

2089
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:18,238
i mean it's cool you know i see them i

2090
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:20,960
mean there was clearly a split between i

2091
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:23,119
think like the like like sherbinsky and

2092
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,960
all those guys even amongst themselves

2093
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:26,479
and then burner with the cookies brand

2094
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,158
because i think that's just burner that

2095
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,238
cookies brand

2096
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:31,119
and um it's interesting what they've

2097
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,198
done you know they've definitely

2098
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:35,039
capitalized on it i have nothing but

2099
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:36,318
respect for being able to go out there

2100
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:37,838
and get a piece of something for

2101
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,239
themselves

2102
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:41,278
in terms of like what it actually is

2103
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:44,079
like

2104
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,679
i don't have a lot of interest in it in

2105
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,439
and of itself me

2106
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,359
um definitely can't knock the hustle

2107
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,879
though i see them out there you know

2108
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,798
between burner with the stores or

2109
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,159
scherbinski doing his thing

2110
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,399
some of the other guys they don't seem

2111
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,158
as active um

2112
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:59,679
i think pie guy and jacob maybe is a

2113
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,198
little bit more active

2114
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,359
but

2115
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,519
i have no knock on it um

2116
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:08,158
i've some of the work that i've seen

2117
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,679
hasn't been great so i just kind of like

2118
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:11,119
not really excited about it i mean i'm

2119
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,640
sure you saw some of the work at emerald

2120
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,000
cup like there was definitely a lot of

2121
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,640
people there that had work that was more

2122
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,319
impressive to me but as a brand

2123
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,400
i mean there's no denying it they've

2124
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:22,479
they've crushed it you know it's a huge

2125
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:23,359
brand it's globally recognized at this

2126
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:25,279
point

2127
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:27,039
and you know whichever one of them you

2128
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,399
know whatever piece you're looking at

2129
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,158
they've definitely done something with

2130
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:31,279
it that i think a lot of people whether

2131
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:32,799
they want to admit it or not a lot of

2132
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:33,920
people would have liked to be able to do

2133
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,920
they just weren't able to tie all the

2134
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,840
pieces together

2135
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,760
yeah so they had something yeah and they

2136
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,840
capitalized on it

2137
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,840
they've certainly done some things well

2138
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,840
for sure but let's talk about what they

2139
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,920
could have done better what do you think

2140
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,319
are some of the things they've fallen

2141
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,800
short on

2142
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:54,799
i honestly think that if they had all

2143
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,239
stayed working together

2144
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,000
and not maybe and you know i wasn't

2145
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:00,718
there so i don't know but usually in

2146
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,319
this business there's a lot of ego

2147
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,239
people are used to being what i call

2148
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:05,599
king of their own castles you know

2149
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:07,119
they've all had their own warehouses

2150
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,039
they've all had their own spots they're

2151
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:10,479
all used to being their own bosses a lot

2152
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:12,640
of them have never worked for anybody

2153
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,279
else or even really worked with anybody

2154
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,880
else in any kind of significant capacity

2155
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:18,800
it's why so many of these relationships

2156
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,480
fall apart in this business people don't

2157
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,640
know how to communicate and set clear

2158
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:24,879
expectations they're not professional

2159
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,560
i honestly think that there's companies

2160
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,119
on their way to billion dollar

2161
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,280
valuations right now and if they had all

2162
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:34,000
figured out a way to work together they

2163
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,519
would be on their way to doing that and

2164
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,600
you know i can't knock anyone i would

2165
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,360
have loved i would love to see anybody

2166
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,840
from the underground make it to a

2167
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:43,119
billion dollar valuation one day and if

2168
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,719
anybody could have done it it would have

2169
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:46,800
been them i think that's probably the

2170
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,880
biggest thing because it kind of seems

2171
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,800
like burner just ran with it and he was

2172
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,440
really like the least influential person

2173
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,119
i mean he was working at the hemp center

2174
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:57,759
as like a security guard if i remember

2175
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:59,198
correctly and um

2176
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,280
kind of just like

2177
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:03,039
made the rap thing work and promoted it

2178
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,519
and you know hustle hustle hustle then

2179
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:07,439
definitely did a lot i'm sure no knock

2180
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,360
to be clear no knock on his hustle i'm

2181
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:10,559
sure he busted his ass to get where he

2182
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:11,599
is right now

2183
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,800
because a lot of people were in the day

2184
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,560
at that time a lot of people had the

2185
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,840
opportunity but like i said i think the

2186
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,640
biggest thing

2187
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,600
is

2188
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:21,600
i mean there's been you know fallouts

2189
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,120
between those people and so i think

2190
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,199
that's probably the biggest thing that

2191
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,880
kind of set them set them back and kept

2192
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:28,079
them from fulfilling their potential i

2193
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,199
think if they'd all been able to just

2194
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:31,519
work together they would have really

2195
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,839
achieved something special

2196
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,600
yeah definitely so something i have been

2197
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,679
interested in myself and i can't really

2198
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,239
find a good answer is

2199
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:42,319
was shibinsky a part of the original

2200
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:43,839
crew it always felt to me like he came

2201
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:46,079
in after

2202
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,319
they found the girl scouts and then had

2203
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,760
his little moment in there what's your

2204
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:51,359
take on all that where does he fit in

2205
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,640
the picture for you

2206
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:53,920
yeah i think i mean i'm pretty sure they

2207
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,239
were all friends because i think it's

2208
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,800
pie guy [ __ ] and sherb and i think i

2209
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:02,238
think they were all friends you know in

2210
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:05,119
sf especially it's like it's kind of a

2211
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,399
like loose knit but very very affiliated

2212
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:07,840
city like

2213
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:09,599
people there's a lot of people that have

2214
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,199
grown up out there they know each other

2215
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,960
you know they're friends with friends or

2216
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:15,599
you know they dated each other's cousins

2217
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,920
or whatever it might be like people

2218
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:21,360
people have deep deep roots in that city

2219
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,039
and it's a very very small area and so

2220
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,479
you know whether he whether i don't i

2221
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:26,158
don't i doubt there was even really an

2222
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,439
official you know there was an official

2223
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:28,559
anything i think they all just knew each

2224
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:29,919
other

2225
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,199
and happened to be involved in some of

2226
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,279
this stuff and

2227
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,198
they probably all played their part in

2228
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:37,119
it um from my understanding you know it

2229
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,119
was the three of them it was pi guy

2230
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:41,599
schrabinski and [ __ ] that like were

2231
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:43,840
responsible for that

2232
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,520
and from there you know the affiliation

2233
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,880
with berner who was like rapping at the

2234
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,719
time

2235
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,560
and you know did a lot of the promoting

2236
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,239
and it's weird because people will shout

2237
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,679
out burner as like oh yeah thanks thanks

2238
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:54,209
to burner for the cookies or whatever

2239
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,679
and it's like

2240
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:57,760
[Music]

2241
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:59,440
not really if you want to thank anyone's

2242
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,719
probably one of those three guys and if

2243
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:02,319
really if you want to thank someone you

2244
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:04,480
could thank us because they didn't want

2245
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,238
that cut getting out

2246
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:07,599
they didn't want people growing it so if

2247
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:09,678
people are growing it you could probably

2248
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:12,239
really thank us

2249
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,480
yeah no i i definitely agree on that

2250
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,479
point and that raises an interesting

2251
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:18,959
point in itself what do you think about

2252
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:21,359
snowman the the last remaining cookie

2253
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,960
cut that they feel hasn't gotten out yet

2254
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:24,719
that they're still keeping under lock

2255
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,760
and key

2256
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:30,480
yeah so i've actually never seen it and

2257
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,000
i would love to see it um i think it's

2258
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:33,919
probably something that i'd have to ask

2259
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,439
my my buddy straight flame about i think

2260
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,880
he he would definitely know more about

2261
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,319
it and my buddy frost boss would know

2262
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,319
more about it

2263
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,639
i've never seen it you know i've heard

2264
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:43,679
things about it um

2265
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,280
but

2266
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,119
to be honest

2267
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:48,880
i'd be curious to know like is it better

2268
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:50,800
than the sherb is it better than any of

2269
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,719
the gelatos like is it better than the

2270
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,159
cookies cause

2271
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,239
a lot of that stuff is kind of treading

2272
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:57,359
in the same gene pool so you know i just

2273
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:00,158
kind of feel like they're just on

2274
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,839
opposite ends of the cookie spectrum

2275
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:03,439
i would love to i mean if it's like a

2276
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,360
gassier version of the cookies that

2277
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:06,719
might be interesting

2278
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:08,238
yeah so

2279
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,679
sorry i was just going to say i spoke to

2280
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:12,000
shah of

2281
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:14,480
seed bank and he's got an s1 of it

2282
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,800
because he managed to buy a bag off

2283
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:19,759
one of the guys founds a seed in it and

2284
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:22,719
uh pretty good s1 and he said it's just

2285
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,199
like a much more og dominant version of

2286
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,800
cookies basically that's what i figured

2287
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,719
that's the only other thing that it

2288
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,159
could be and i remember yeah that i was

2289
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:32,079
going to say that i thought there was an

2290
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,119
s1 somewhere

2291
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:34,960
but

2292
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:36,640
no i had never seen it so yeah but i

2293
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,640
mean that doesn't surprise me i think if

2294
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,719
you wanted to do that though you know

2295
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,840
you could just reverse an og to the

2296
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,079
cookies

2297
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,719
and you would have that i don't think

2298
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:47,840
that it's anything you know i don't know

2299
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,600
i just i don't know if it's game

2300
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,279
changing i mean does he sound very very

2301
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,880
excited about that s1 or is it just

2302
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:54,000
something that he's like it's good but

2303
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,840
it's

2304
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,399
neither here nor there

2305
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,239
he likes it for sure but i think that

2306
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:02,960
kind of touches on the point you raised

2307
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:05,919
earlier in the you know at that point is

2308
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:07,520
it really that different from docie doe

2309
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:10,000
exactly

2310
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,159
yeah yeah that's i mean that's that's

2311
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,760
exactly my point like is it really

2312
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:16,399
anything so like

2313
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,600
if you had a male if you actually bred

2314
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:19,439
the cookies

2315
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,199
hit it to something like a vietnam hit

2316
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:23,119
it to something like a burma hit it to

2317
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:24,799
something like a guatemalan hit it to

2318
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,519
something weird

2319
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,679
now now we've got something

2320
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,199
you know like if you hit it to three

2321
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,840
different types of you know totally

2322
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:34,960
different genetics and run through those

2323
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,880
i think that's how you're going to find

2324
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,239
something different i mean if cookies is

2325
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,000
kind of what i think it is which is just

2326
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:41,359
oh geez and cherry pie

2327
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,439
um

2328
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,319
what are you really doing that's that

2329
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:45,359
different

2330
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:47,039
like

2331
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,479
yeah you know what i mean what do you

2332
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:50,960
what do you really have if you're if

2333
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:52,319
you're just hitting it back to an og

2334
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,198
right

2335
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:55,439
so

2336
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,198
my next question on the cookies would be

2337
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:59,519
i think you might have a little bit of

2338
01:16:57,198 --> 01:17:01,279
an idea but if you don't that's fine do

2339
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,760
you know much about the story behind the

2340
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:06,238
og kbb because what you find online is

2341
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,960
just that supposedly the guy

2342
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:10,959
og kushbreath just is like oh i just got

2343
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,319
given it as gsc

2344
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,719
but like i feel like there's probably a

2345
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,880
bit more to it than that

2346
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:19,119
yeah so he's as far as i know i don't

2347
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,199
think uh o.g cush breath has ever really

2348
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:22,960
spoken publicly about it

2349
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:25,439
um so i definitely wouldn't want to put

2350
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,719
words in his mouth i know norcal who is

2351
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:29,198
friends with him

2352
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,640
and you know i know as much as norcal

2353
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:33,279
has told me

2354
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:36,159
and the story of where it came from i

2355
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:39,599
can't speak to it i do know how how it

2356
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:42,399
got out i do know how it was given out

2357
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,960
but where he got it from i can't say and

2358
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:47,599
i i think that he got it as a cutting i

2359
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,840
don't think he popped it from seed

2360
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,920
so i believe that he got that as as a

2361
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,400
cutting and it may have been from from

2362
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,039
that initial batch that i think most of

2363
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:58,719
these seeds came from

2364
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,399
yeah because they're very similar you

2365
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,960
know what what people call the thin mint

2366
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:04,158
and the animal and even the og kb even

2367
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,920
though the structure is completely

2368
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:08,079
mutated and totally you know in that way

2369
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,319
it's different the

2370
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:13,198
bag of peel the frost

2371
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:15,198
like the the flavor profile is very very

2372
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:17,359
similar the style of the flower

2373
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:20,719
very very similar um

2374
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:23,519
i mean all i know about that is that it

2375
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,600
was given to norcal as a favor

2376
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,280
as a thank you for a favor that he did

2377
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,880
for og kush breath and you know if he

2378
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,719
wants to speak publicly about about what

2379
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,960
that was at some point he can

2380
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:35,279
but um i'll say that he did a favor for

2381
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:38,640
him and as a thank you

2382
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:41,119
um he gave him that plant he no norkell

2383
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,520
gave that plan to several of us um

2384
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:46,158
probably a half dozen of us

2385
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,320
nobody kept it i kept it

2386
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:50,639
nobody else kept it because

2387
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:52,319
when we put it in the bedrooms it got

2388
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,400
lapped by everything else when we sent

2389
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:56,880
it into flour it literally got drowned

2390
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:58,879
out i remember having to like lift it up

2391
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,400
to get it to like above the canopy where

2392
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,600
the sours were and everything else i

2393
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:03,198
mean it couldn't keep up with form it

2394
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,719
can it couldn't keep up with anything it

2395
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:06,479
veg super slow

2396
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:09,600
it didn't like to be over watered it was

2397
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:11,439
slow to root nobody liked it

2398
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,960
everyone let it go and it wasn't until

2399
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:14,399
probably about nine months or a year

2400
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,319
later when it started kind of getting

2401
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:18,479
some traction that people started

2402
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,880
hitting us up asking for it back and

2403
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:23,198
norcal's general response was well i've

2404
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,520
already gave it to you once no no i'm

2405
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:28,238
not giving it to you again

2406
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:30,000
so a lot of people didn't get it back

2407
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,839
and i think you know a couple people got

2408
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,920
it and it is out you know some people

2409
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,440
have it but if you notice it's not one

2410
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,520
that people produce large amounts of

2411
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:40,158
flour of it's not one that you know that

2412
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,000
you see commonly on a shelf and i have

2413
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:43,599
seen certain producers in other states

2414
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,760
claim to have it and when i've seen the

2415
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,920
flower in the store it's it's not the og

2416
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,320
kbb um

2417
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,800
it's just not so i've never actually

2418
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:54,479
seen it like commercially on a shelf

2419
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,039
probably because of how difficult it is

2420
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:58,879
to grow and how long it takes

2421
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,640
but you know what's interesting is when

2422
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:04,000
you see it crossed with the with with

2423
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:05,679
the face off um in the dough

2424
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,039
it doesn't show that i mean it shows

2425
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:08,399
some of the mutant tendencies and you

2426
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:10,560
see that in like a peanut butter breaths

2427
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:12,479
and whatnot because it comes out a lot

2428
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,719
in there but there's generally good

2429
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,959
plants to be found in there so it's a

2430
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:20,719
weird plant it's hard to pollinate i

2431
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:23,760
actually made an og kb sfvnl at one

2432
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:25,600
point that i've never run those seeds

2433
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,039
it didn't make a lot of them it doesn't

2434
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,639
have a lot of pistols and this is

2435
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,238
friendly piece of advice if anybody does

2436
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,039
have it and it's interesting pollinating

2437
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:32,399
it

2438
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:35,039
you're going to want to pollinate it way

2439
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,960
early and it just does not have a lot of

2440
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:39,198
pistols so it will not make a lot of

2441
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,239
seeds it just it can't

2442
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:41,359
and you're going to want to you're going

2443
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:42,479
to want to adjust your feed you're going

2444
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:43,920
to want to adjust your lighting and

2445
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:45,439
whatnot to make it stretch a little bit

2446
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,840
more and make it a little bit less dense

2447
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:49,599
so the seeds have more time to fill in

2448
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,199
and um

2449
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,120
yeah it's a it's a really interesting

2450
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,039
plant um

2451
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:57,198
hard pressed to find an ounce of it

2452
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:59,119
honestly like

2453
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:00,960
only really the only person i know still

2454
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,679
growing it is norcal

2455
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,279
and mostly for personal projects and

2456
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,920
whatnot things that he's working on for

2457
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:09,759
himself but not really for commercial

2458
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,960
production at all like i've been like i

2459
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,239
said i've never seen it i've seen it

2460
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,158
once on the shelf and it wasn't what

2461
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,399
they said it was

2462
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:19,359
yeah yeah i've certainly never been able

2463
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:21,839
to try it unfortunately um i would love

2464
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:24,319
to take a stab because i think i read

2465
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,400
somewhere i think norcal wrote somewhere

2466
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:28,639
the reason how he got that plant and

2467
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:30,238
maybe you can yay nay that for me or if

2468
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,840
you prefer not to that's fine but what i

2469
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:33,839
had heard was that

2470
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,400
uh og kush breath had like a grow

2471
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,960
somewhere and he was like about to be

2472
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:41,359
busted by the cops or something and like

2473
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,600
norcal went to the grow and like took it

2474
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:45,119
all down for him and was like as he's

2475
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,880
doing it like the cops could bust in at

2476
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,279
any moment type thing so very much in

2477
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,960
danger himself but he managed to do it

2478
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,319
and get it all packed up and so it was

2479
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,359
given to him as like a thank you for

2480
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:56,319
that because that's obviously like a

2481
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:57,519
pretty hectic situation is that roughly

2482
01:21:56,319 --> 01:21:59,279
what happened

2483
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,320
that is yeah that is exactly what

2484
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:02,800
happened

2485
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:04,000
um yeah it was a favor for breaking down

2486
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,520
a spot

2487
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,719
and

2488
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,880
like you said you know anything could

2489
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:11,279
have happened at that time um he was at

2490
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:13,440
risk of getting busted there and so as a

2491
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:15,439
favor as a thank you for doing that for

2492
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:16,719
him he gave him that cut

2493
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:18,079
and that's you know i know they've

2494
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,600
always had they've always had a good

2495
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:22,319
relationship over the years the two of

2496
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,520
them so you know solid i mean norcal is

2497
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:24,880
one of the most i'll put it on record

2498
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,639
lorcal is one of the most solid guys

2499
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,400
you'll ever meet in this business we've

2500
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,319
been friends for a long time

2501
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:33,599
a long time and

2502
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:35,840
very very stand-up guy good good person

2503
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,840
yeah good to know good to know okay so

2504
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,760
my final question directly relating to

2505
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,199
cookies for the moment is

2506
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,840
do you think that there will be any

2507
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:45,678
repercussions on the cookie fam for the

2508
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,679
whole candy rain debacle or do you think

2509
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:49,920
they're just gonna slip by and nothing

2510
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:52,000
will ever really happen about it

2511
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,920
i think they're gonna slip by and

2512
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,600
they're going to pop back up again and

2513
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,719
they're going to do something again and

2514
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,719
people are going to forget that this

2515
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,039
ever happened i mean you got to remember

2516
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,719
there's other people not at their scale

2517
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:04,479
and not at that price point that have

2518
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,239
kind of had these issues and i'm not

2519
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,839
going to i don't want to say anybody's

2520
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:09,439
name or whatever if if you know if

2521
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,679
you've been in this you've seen there's

2522
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:13,519
a couple of individuals specifically

2523
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:16,000
that have popped up dropped the whole

2524
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,760
line had it be a disaster gone

2525
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,359
underground and popped up a couple years

2526
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:24,079
later and tried again um but the candy

2527
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:25,839
rain debacle i mean honestly people are

2528
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:26,880
such fan boys that i don't even think

2529
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,039
they're mad

2530
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,800
if anything they they kind of set the

2531
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:33,439
standard for hey you know if you find

2532
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:35,199
one that's good enough

2533
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:36,879
and i mean those packs you know they

2534
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:38,559
were significant amount of money people

2535
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,520
lost a lot of time and energy into those

2536
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,600
and

2537
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,679
clearly you know there was massive

2538
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,199
issues with them and so i think i think

2539
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,480
people were just doubly upset the fact

2540
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:48,479
that i don't really think they ever

2541
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:50,000
responded to it publicly

2542
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:52,079
i think they kind of just ignored it as

2543
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,760
far as i know i think a big part of the

2544
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:54,800
candy rain debacle was yeah people spent

2545
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,480
a lot of money and they couldn't even

2546
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,360
get them to germ

2547
01:23:56,479 --> 01:23:59,678
um

2548
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:02,319
but they don't want to say anything

2549
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:04,800
yeah definitely and i mean a little bit

2550
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:08,238
of an insider scoop which may or may not

2551
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:11,039
be publicly known but um jbz has 100

2552
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:12,879
signed on to be cookie fam's

2553
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:14,560
in-house breeder from now on so we will

2554
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,960
certainly see some more stuff from them

2555
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,159
in the near future yeah no i had heard

2556
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,880
about that

2557
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:23,519
um yeah no congratulations to him i hope

2558
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,279
they caught him a huge check honestly

2559
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,199
so i'm like i said i'm not mad at anyone

2560
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:29,039
getting out there getting it you know

2561
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:31,198
like good for them if you can get them

2562
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:32,479
to cut you a huge check i think it's

2563
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:34,158
easy for a lot of people to say oh i

2564
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:35,678
would never do that until it's sitting

2565
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:36,719
in front of you and then would you do

2566
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,319
that

2567
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,679
um

2568
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:41,679
i was gonna just say there's a lot of

2569
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,440
people making making the transition into

2570
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:44,480
the recreational cannabis market doing

2571
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:45,919
just that

2572
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,678
because they don't have the capital they

2573
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,760
don't have the access to the property

2574
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,119
they don't have the connections so then

2575
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,199
they're going to sign on with someone

2576
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:55,679
who can who can take what they've built

2577
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:58,158
and magnify it

2578
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:00,480
yeah definitely definitely and if and

2579
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:01,920
you know based on jbz's work like you

2580
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:03,919
know for the most part he does pretty

2581
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,440
good stuff you know hopefully that trend

2582
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,960
continues in terms of what he does for

2583
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:08,238
cookie fam

2584
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,840
yeah i don't see any reason why it

2585
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:12,319
wouldn't i think i think honestly i

2586
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,679
think it i think it's gonna be good work

2587
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:15,840
hopefully

2588
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:17,679
okay well to get off something a little

2589
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,840
less doom and gloom i did want to

2590
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,760
quickly run this by you how do you feel

2591
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,920
when you see like kind of i don't want

2592
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,239
to say distant offspring but just kind

2593
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,920
of offspring of the forum go on to reach

2594
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:29,919
stardom like the one that comes to mind

2595
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,158
is if you trace it back the gmo has got

2596
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,399
the forum in it when you see that type

2597
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:36,079
of thing and all the traction it gets do

2598
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:38,158
you get a certain sense of kind of

2599
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:40,559
accomplishment from that or do you just

2600
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:42,479
don't really think about it

2601
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,679
to be honest i i don't really think

2602
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:48,559
about it much but but i always felt like

2603
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:50,079
cannabis had done so much for me

2604
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,159
that there was really nothing that i

2605
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:54,079
could ever do to repay it and i'm gonna

2606
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:56,000
be blunt and say something that people

2607
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:57,840
don't really seem to say like i don't

2608
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,719
believe in the cannabis community i grew

2609
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,880
up

2610
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,760
where you know people sold drugs i grew

2611
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,920
up where people hustled like that's why

2612
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,840
i've always like responded well to like

2613
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,199
oakland and the type of mentality that

2614
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,039
people have there it's a hustling

2615
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:12,559
mentality it doesn't matter what they're

2616
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:14,399
doing they're trying they're trying to

2617
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,520
hustle survive and improve their

2618
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:16,719
position

2619
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,800
um

2620
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,719
and so cannabis had always done so so

2621
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,800
much for me i didn't ever really think

2622
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,760
there was anything i could ever do to

2623
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,880
like

2624
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:28,000
to repay it in general like the i don't

2625
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,840
want to say the community because i

2626
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,359
don't really believe in that but more

2627
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,239
more just so like

2628
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:34,719
just

2629
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:36,399
the world that it cultivates around it

2630
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:38,319
the people that are in the space the

2631
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:40,399
people that are in like tied into this

2632
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:41,279
plant and all the different offshoots of

2633
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:44,399
it

2634
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:47,439
um and so to see the forum cut get used

2635
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,719
in so many projects and just real and

2636
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:49,839
like yeah and like you said to see the

2637
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:51,520
gmo

2638
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,159
blow up and a bunch of these other cuts

2639
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,320
that have blown up because of it as well

2640
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:57,920
if anything like

2641
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:59,920
i'd say it makes me a little bit happy

2642
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,158
because i feel like i have the chance to

2643
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,000
contribute to like changing the course

2644
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:05,359
of cannabis which how many people can

2645
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,560
really say that how many people can

2646
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:09,039
really say

2647
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,000
that without this thing that they had

2648
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:10,800
done

2649
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,279
that

2650
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,119
that they played a part you know in

2651
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:17,198
literally shifting the course of

2652
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,198
cannabis on a global scale

2653
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,399
and you know with like you said without

2654
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:22,000
that cut

2655
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:25,439
making it to europe

2656
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,279
um and mamiko making those seeds and

2657
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:29,279
then you know skunk master flex

2658
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:31,039
selecting that cut and you know it

2659
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:32,399
blowing up in michigan before it ever

2660
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:33,600
blew up out here

2661
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:34,960
that was one of the first cuts that

2662
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,560
actually you know in a long time that

2663
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,880
actually started in the in the midwest

2664
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,560
and came west a couple years later

2665
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,880
it wasn't you know it was big there

2666
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,239
before it was really big out west so in

2667
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,800
a way i would say you know that it

2668
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:49,599
stokes me because

2669
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,920
to know that that would not exist if we

2670
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:54,159
had not done what we did even as far as

2671
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,079
getting the cut to europe

2672
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:57,519
like if we hadn't done that mamiko would

2673
01:27:56,079 --> 01:28:00,079
have never made the gmo and if he hadn't

2674
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:02,080
made the gmo then skunk master flex you

2675
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,519
know they wouldn't have the han solo

2676
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:05,198
burger

2677
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,719
and all that other stuff that they've

2678
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:08,158
done with that

2679
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,840
so when you really look at it i mean a

2680
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:11,519
lot of stuff when you trace it back is

2681
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,199
from the forum i mean even sin city

2682
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,639
seeds you know

2683
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:16,879
i want to say

2684
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,440
if i'm not mistaken i want to say it was

2685
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:22,960
like blue power and forum

2686
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:25,359
and they used that uh i think jbz used

2687
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,679
that when they made the wedding cake

2688
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:29,679
and yes definitely

2689
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,199
yeah so that also would not exist

2690
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,199
without that

2691
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:34,719
i mean there's a lot of if when you

2692
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:36,079
really really trace it back it's kind of

2693
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:37,359
it's kind of like a horse or something

2694
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:38,960
where you say

2695
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:41,439
look at all these look at all the

2696
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,800
offspring and all the all the

2697
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:44,559
all the different plants that are

2698
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,639
related to it that can be traced back to

2699
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,920
it that wouldn't exist without it

2700
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,520
i mean

2701
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,719
to me it kind of stokes me because

2702
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,560
really like how many people have

2703
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:55,279
actually had a chance to contribute to

2704
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,880
the cannabis scene at that level i mean

2705
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:58,800
you can talk about chem dog you can talk

2706
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,199
about a couple of these people

2707
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,360
you know that i mean they were pivotal

2708
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:04,638
factors in in these plants you know

2709
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:05,920
getting to where they were going you

2710
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:09,520
know bubba

2711
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:11,920
um i mean the chems the bubbas

2712
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,000
even the sours you know all of that

2713
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:16,480
stuff and i mean with the ogs you know

2714
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,600
you can talk about ghost um you know the

2715
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:20,000
ghost cut

2716
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,520
and uh some of that stuff at la i mean

2717
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,359
if that stuff hadn't really gone where

2718
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,679
it got you know like a lot of the stuff

2719
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:28,158
from you know and from uh archive

2720
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,840
wouldn't exist i mean face-off and all

2721
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:31,279
that stuff from you know from those guys

2722
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,440
down in socal and then you know the

2723
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:35,840
doctor working with that and

2724
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:37,678
just it's in it's i'd say more than

2725
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,719
anything i'm grateful to have had the

2726
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:42,960
chance to play a part in in this thing

2727
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:45,760
and i think the biggest takeaway is like

2728
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:48,079
you are just a piece of this whole thing

2729
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,600
it's not nobody in this business and in

2730
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:50,719
this scene or whatever you want to call

2731
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:54,000
it

2732
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:56,399
exists independently of everybody else

2733
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,719
we're all connected to each other in

2734
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:01,519
some way shape or form and some of us

2735
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:03,920
you know have bigger you know roles that

2736
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,719
we've played more more has gone through

2737
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,800
us

2738
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,158
than other people more connections more

2739
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,520
networks whatever it might be have

2740
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:10,559
spiraled out from these things that

2741
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,400
we've done

2742
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,760
but without you know all these people it

2743
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:15,679
wouldn't exist i mean if i had just

2744
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,960
given the cut to my if i just given the

2745
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,800
cut to my two or three friends and they

2746
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,480
hadn't passed it out

2747
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,159
i wasn't going to pass it out not

2748
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:24,000
because i had no interest in passing it

2749
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:25,599
just because i or because i was against

2750
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,359
passing it just because i just generally

2751
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,280
avoided talking to people like in this

2752
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:30,559
business no good comes from talking to

2753
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:33,039
people

2754
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,800
so just the more that you avoid people

2755
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:36,158
the longer you'll survive

2756
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,920
and

2757
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:39,439
that was kind of my feeling on that so

2758
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,359
if anything i would say that i'm honored

2759
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:42,879
you know it's funny that the gmo is

2760
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:45,839
actually one of the only cuts i ever

2761
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,679
asked for and they told me they said yes

2762
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,199
but they never got it to me

2763
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,920
and they kind of just like left me on

2764
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:53,198
okay whatever um so

2765
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,039
i thought that was kind of funny because

2766
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:56,719
yeah that cut wouldn't exist without

2767
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:59,439
without the work that i had done i mean

2768
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:01,600
i know true um in the uk and in spain

2769
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:03,279
has worked a lot with the forum as well

2770
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,360
he got that you know directly from our

2771
01:31:03,279 --> 01:31:07,679
circle i mean a lot of people can trace

2772
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:09,599
where that cut came from back to people

2773
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,199
that were affiliated with us so yeah i

2774
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,120
would say if anything you know i'm

2775
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:15,119
grateful and i'm honored you know to

2776
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:17,198
have been able to shift

2777
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:19,599
cannabis in some way shape or form to

2778
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:22,079
have even been a part of it

2779
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,320
yeah what a really awesome sentiment to

2780
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:26,639
express and that's so kind of

2781
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:28,559
coincidental you you reference true i'm

2782

01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:38,000
yeah he knows me from the forums from

2786
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,079
back in the day um he was affiliated

2787
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,319
with some of our friends and that's how

2788
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,719
he got that forum cut which i'm sure you

2789
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:47,359
can ask him about cool you just gave me

2790
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:50,000

so i love the chem d um the first chem i

2799
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:12,000
ever grew was the four

2800
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:14,079
and it was you know bigger yielding you

2801
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,880
know real solid threw down really really

2802
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:16,880
well

2803
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,880
but people kind of had got tired of it

2804
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,719
that's actually one that i'm like bummed

2805
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,159
that i gave up i know some friends of

2806
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,520
ours in our circle still have it so i

2807
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:25,359
could i could get that one back at some

2808
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,679
point but for whatever reason it's been

2809
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:30,238
like like the least favorited one out of

2810
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:32,239
all of them um the d

2811
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:34,959
is phenomenal and you know you talked

2812
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:37,119
about the gmo and that's really part of

2813
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,960
what makes it special i mean

2814
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:42,158
the proper d

2815
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:43,920
well done is you know what what my my

2816
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:45,839
boy calls blunt weed or gangster weed

2817
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:49,039
it's like it's

2818
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,560
super potent incredibly tasty does not

2819
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:52,319
does not have the best bag appeal in the

2820
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,600
entire world does not photograph super

2821
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:57,840
well um but it's just amazing phenomenal

2822
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,600
herb just raunchy

2823
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,520
beautiful herb i mean it's what makes

2824
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,600
the gmo like

2825
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:05,840
you know the gmo just got dressed up in

2826
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,960
a better in a better bag necessarily or

2827
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,960
a better shell from the forum but really

2828
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:13,920
what really makes it is the chem d and

2829
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,880
then the 91 is a beautiful plant the 91

2830
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,960
and the d

2831
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,079
are gorgeous plants in and of themselves

2832
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:22,000
the 91 being more og

2833
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:24,079
which i just i just love it i mean i

2834
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,359
think it's an amazing amazing plant as

2835
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:27,519
well and you know but they're they're a

2836
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:29,119
little bit fickle the the d the d will

2837
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:31,199
do better the 91 is a little bit more

2838
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:33,039
fickle um

2839
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,359
but i love them both i think that

2840
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:37,679
they're you know they're they're staples

2841
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,960
in in the cannabis scene in my opinion

2842
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,239
and i don't think that enough people

2843
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,439
have actually seen like you said all the

2844
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:42,959
various d's and yeah there's the

2845
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:44,158
non-variegated and this one and the

2846
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,480
other one

2847
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:49,839
we were lucky enough to get

2848
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:51,279
the d cut from jj separately you know we

2849
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,360
had had it as well

2850
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:55,279
um but you know when we when we got the

2851
01:33:53,359 --> 01:33:57,839
one from jj we said okay well you know

2852
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:59,599
this one is definitely the one if there

2853
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,800
was any question there's not a question

2854
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,079
anymore

2855
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,800
and uh

2856
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,960
it's a phenomenal plant beautiful love

2857
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,760
it i mean if you've i mean you've tried

2858
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:11,840
the gmo i'm sure you've tried the d

2859
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:14,079
the the way that the profile sticks to

2860
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,400
your palette you know it's really kind

2861
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:18,800
of like cuts through anything else

2862
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:20,479
yeah very very special plant and that's

2863
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,159
kind of like a nice little segue on to

2864
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:24,718
the next question which is let's talk

2865
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:26,960
about a strain that i think will become

2866
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,960
known as like the equivalent of the cam

2867
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:32,800
dogs but for kind of the

2868
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:34,239
2010 to 2020 period the mac you know

2869
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:37,440
it's been so

2870
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:38,959
used abused you know all the rest of it

2871
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:40,238
what's your thoughts on it and do you

2872
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,158
plan to work with it because it's

2873
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:44,799
something i noticed is surprisingly

2874
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:47,039
missing from your feed

2875
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,360
yeah so i got the mac

2876
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:51,279
um initially like when when when people

2877
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:52,960
started kind of getting it i was pretty

2878
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:54,399
excited about it i was like okay this

2879
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,000
thing i've heard good things it looks

2880
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:57,359
good um

2881
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,238
i grew it

2882
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:01,839
and i just wasn't impressed with it and

2883
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:03,519
i passed it to a couple of friends of

2884
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,119
mine you know people who've been you

2885
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,560
know people who i have been in my circle

2886
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:07,599
and i've shared cuts with for a long

2887
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,679
time and

2888
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,600
we mostly all agreed except for one of

2889
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:14,560
us we've mostly all agreed that it's not

2890
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,800
that great um it looks good

2891
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,600
it has nice bag appeal

2892
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:22,239
does not really have much else going for

2893
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,440
it in my opinion i don't really care for

2894
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:25,519
the flavor

2895
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:27,839
i don't care for the high i don't care

2896
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,480
for the growth habit

2897
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:32,400
i don't like it i mean i think cap did a

2898
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:34,000
great job marketing and promoting and

2899
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:35,599
branding it i think he did i think he

2900
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,198
did a phenomenal job by saying don't

2901
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,360
give this to people who haven't earned

2902
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:40,559
it and in that way he kind of made it

2903
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:43,439
special

2904
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,920
um i have seen a lot of the crosses from

2905
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:47,439
it and so to answer your question um i

2906
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,039
have seen a lot of the crosses from it

2907
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:50,719
and they come out very very like what i

2908
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:52,319
would describe as that jack lemony

2909
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:53,279
profile i think it's from the colombian

2910
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:54,238
in it

2911
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:56,000
and

2912
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:58,959
that's not really something that i

2913
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,880
necessarily need to look for

2914
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,719
or would want to look for and it seems

2915
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,920
very very dominant in a lot of the

2916
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:05,520
crosses

2917
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,760
so for me

2918
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,199
not really something that i intend to

2919
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,679
work with

2920
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:13,919
i did make i think i made some mac sherb

2921
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:15,679
seeds but i have not popped them

2922
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,520
and i don't really think i have any

2923
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:18,880
intention to pop them at some point i

2924
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,520
guess if one of my friends wanted them

2925
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,039
i'd probably let them run it but

2926
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:25,199
from what i've seen it's not really a

2927
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:26,719
direction that i want to go down so

2928
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:28,638
actually have a pack of the mac that i

2929
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:30,158
bought you know in all honesty from the

2930
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,539
first drop

2931
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:31,599
um

2932
01:36:30,539 --> 01:36:33,840
[Music]

2933
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,360
but it's one that you know i don't think

2934
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:37,279
it's gonna stand up

2935
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:39,359
i think it's you know gonna disappear

2936
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:40,800
pretty quickly i mean if you've noticed

2937
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:42,399
like there's not really a lot of hype

2938
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,800
left around it right now although it's

2939
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:46,638
crazy at the events when when cap is

2940
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,639
there the line is like 100 people deep

2941
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,400
or 200 people deep for it

2942
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,639
so all the crosses and this that and the

2943
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:54,399
other so i'll be interested to see you

2944
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:56,719
know one of my friends does love it i

2945
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:59,039
mean he he told me that i'm wrong flat

2946
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:01,359
out he said he said he likes it

2947
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:03,679
um but for me

2948
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:05,439
no i've got no interest in it and it's

2949
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:07,199
mostly just everything that i described

2950
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:08,799
about how it breeds and the effect and

2951
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:11,118
the high and the taste

2952
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:14,000
all of the above beautiful plant though

2953
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:17,519
photographs extremely well like a great

2954
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:19,359
instagram plant if you asked me

2955
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,040
yeah i would agree with that and the

2956
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:22,479
thing about the mac which i mean it has

2957
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:25,279
been said before but i'll bring it up

2958
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:28,799
again is it frustrates me how no one's

2959
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:31,599
talking about the fact that no other

2960
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,520
serious legitimate contender keeper cuts

2961
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,400
have ever been found from the seeds it's

2962
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,320
like it's almost like the mac one is

2963
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:40,079
pulled out of the aether and then the

2964
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:41,759
seeds that are produced are almost

2965
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:45,118
different because there's yet no one has

2966
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,840
ever found a keeper especially a male

2967
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:47,839
no

2968
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,159
nothing that i have seen come out of

2969
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,920
those out of the crosses that have been

2970
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:54,079
like you know the the authorized kind of

2971
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,319
crosses that he's done as well as some

2972
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:59,039
of the work that other people have done

2973
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:01,359
nothing has ever made any waves in

2974
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:02,880
anybody's garden and so i think that

2975
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:04,000
there's a lot of there was a lot of hype

2976
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,520
around it

2977
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,439
but

2978
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,280
just kind of looking at what's come from

2979
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:10,960
it it makes me think that it's not

2980
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:13,039
really it's not really a direction i

2981
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,560
would ever want to go in like i wouldn't

2982
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:16,880
i wouldn't want to work it i wouldn't

2983
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,119
want to sell it to people i'd i just i

2984
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,639
have no interest in going down that road

2985
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:22,719
i'll be interested to see if he keeps

2986
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:25,359
working with it you know i don't know if

2987
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:26,239
he's on to something else perhaps he is

2988
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:28,238
um

2989
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:30,799
but yeah not like you said nothing has

2990
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:32,319
really come from those seeds and you

2991
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,480
would think like i mean you know that

2992
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:35,759
can't the same cannot be said for jbz's

2993
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:38,079
work like

2994
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,360
there's been a ton of work that that

2995
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:41,039
people have found there's been a ton of

2996
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,799
crosses the ice cream cake whatever all

2997
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:44,560
this stuff that has come out

2998
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,440
since you know since the wedding cake

2999
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,320
stuff

3000
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:48,079
that

3001
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:49,679
people are you know people are like yeah

3002
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:51,279
man this is really nice work i mean we

3003
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,440
have a wedding cake sherb that i made

3004
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:55,679
that's phenomenal i mean it's beautiful

3005
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:57,279
it's gorgeous like

3006
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,800
it was hard to pick a keeper out of

3007
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:00,880
those out of those wedding cake sherb

3008
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,239
seeds that we made and ran like there

3009
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,159
was a bunch of them that were just

3010
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:05,759
beautiful and i think that if i did the

3011
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:07,599
same thing with the mac i think i

3012
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,199
probably would have killed them all

3013
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,039
so

3014
01:39:09,198 --> 01:39:12,960
let's let's jump back to those sunset

3015
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:15,519
sherb crosses for a minute

3016
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,039
when you test those crosses do you find

3017
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,960
that this shirt tends to be quite

3018
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:21,760
dominating or it more lets the other

3019
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:24,079
parent shine through

3020
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,679
so that so one of the things that i've

3021
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:27,679
done which some of my friends have

3022
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:30,000
disagreed with is i tend to make a lot

3023
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:31,520
of crosses sometimes and even if i don't

3024
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,479
release them or post them or whatever it

3025
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,440
might be

3026
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:37,919
i i like to do it and the reason is

3027
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:39,599
because i've noticed that um

3028
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:42,000
when something so somebody might say oh

3029
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,039
the sherb is dominant and that may be

3030
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,719
the case

3031
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:45,760
but there are pairings where it where it

3032
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:47,359
is not

3033
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,960
and i don't think that things are

3034
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:50,238
universally dominant so i don't think

3035
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,158
that if you reverse a sherb let's say

3036
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:53,439
and hit you know 20 different clones

3037
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:54,879
that there that the sherpa's always

3038
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:56,479
going to be dominant there's ones where

3039
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,719
it shines out and there's ones where

3040
01:39:56,479 --> 01:40:01,359
where it kind of fades back and i've

3041
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:02,960
noticed that in some different crosses

3042
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:05,920
we did a

3043
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:09,039
daigo walker to the u-dub and then we

3044
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:12,399
did the sherb to the u-dub and the dagel

3045
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:14,000
walker to the u-dub uh the [ __ ] was

3046
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:18,079
dominant and we did the sherb to the

3047
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,079
u-dub and the u-dub was dominant

3048
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:22,000
and so you know they both had the same

3049
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,760
u-dub cut they had different donor

3050
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,039
parents as it were

3051
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:28,320
and

3052
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:30,560
both of them responded differently to it

3053
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:32,158
so you know with the sherb crosses i

3054
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,320
mean what we see in like the wedding

3055
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:35,599
cake sherbs is that there are some that

3056
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:37,359
are wedding cake there are some that are

3057
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,119
sherb and there are some that are 50 50

3058
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:42,000
and i'd probably put them at about you

3059
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:44,238
know 40 one way 40 the other and 20 down

3060
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,039
the middle and the 50 50 ones are the

3061
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:48,479
ones that i'm always most interested in

3062
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:50,319
the ones that are more wedding kicker

3063
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:52,399
more sure why would i select that way if

3064
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:54,079
i already have those cuttings

3065
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:56,559
so it just makes sense to me to try and

3066
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:59,198
find something where it pairs well

3067
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:01,440
in the case of the udub [ __ ]

3068
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:03,359
we did select towards the [ __ ] only

3069
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:05,759
because that grapefruit profile is

3070
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:08,079
something i really like and it just was

3071
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,840
kind of a finicky leslie like lower

3072
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:11,359
yielding plant whereas the u-dub just

3073
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,199
throws down these you know big fat

3074
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:15,118
resinous colas on it

3075
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:17,759
um and it's just you know it's hearty

3076
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:19,599
and chunky and you know veggies well and

3077
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,600
so selecting one like that with that

3078
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:24,000
grapefruit profile you know was a real

3079
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,719
real improvement for us

3080
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,800
yeah okay well i mean heck speaking of

3081
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:31,118
sherbet and grapefruit this seems like a

3082
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:33,840
really good time to ask in the past we

3083
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:36,079
had heard stories that it was possible

3084
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,159
that the skittles cut was just a sherbet

3085
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:39,519
s1 now given your experience with

3086
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,559
sherbet do you think there's any

3087
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:44,960
possibility that could be true

3088
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:47,039
um

3089
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:49,439
i mean

3090
01:41:47,039 --> 01:41:51,920
no i don't think so and and the reason

3091
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:53,359
is because we have you know run a lot of

3092
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,480
sherb and we've run a lot of sherb

3093
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:58,319
crosses

3094
01:41:54,479 --> 01:42:00,879
and i don't think that the skittles came

3095
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:02,960
from that

3096
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,719
i haven't really god i can't say that i

3097
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,679
really thought much ever about about

3098
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:10,239
where the skittles actually came from

3099
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,039
i mean it was such a weird wonky plant

3100
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:12,799
that

3101
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:14,479
i never really had a lot of interest in

3102
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,159
it and i know it made a lot of waves as

3103
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:17,759
well and people were really interested

3104
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:20,479
in it but it kind of reminds me of the

3105
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:22,880
lemon tree in a way where it's like this

3106
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:24,799
is not something that like

3107
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:27,279
is like game changing this is something

3108
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,039
that's interesting but a flavor that i

3109
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:31,519
would be soon bored of if that's all i

3110
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:33,359
was if that's all i was consuming um

3111
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,480
whereas with like a sour or a camera and

3112
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:36,238
og

3113
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:37,839
you know that's something that you know

3114
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:40,079
i could take those all day and be

3115
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:41,520
completely satisfied um beautiful

3116
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:42,960
beautiful herb

3117
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,800
i kind of put the skittles where i put

3118
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,760
the lemon tree which it's an interesting

3119
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,079
flavor

3120
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,159
but i only want to see it as like 20 of

3121
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:52,079
a cross as it were i don't really want

3122
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:54,638
to see it as like the whole thing but

3123
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:55,519
yeah to answer i don't think i would not

3124
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:58,800
say

3125
01:42:55,520 --> 01:43:00,560
that the skittles was a sure best one

3126
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:03,679
yeah it's i mean if you've seen the

3127
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:05,760
flower it's just it's ugly it's like and

3128
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:09,279
it's not just that they grow it poorly

3129
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:11,920
it's that it's not really super high

3130
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:14,238
grade herb in that way it's very very

3131
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:17,118
tasty though and amazing for extracts

3132
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:19,198
much like the lemon tree

3133
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:20,000
yeah and what i found interesting that

3134
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:21,198
you

3135
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,118
kind of brought that point about the

3136
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:25,198
lemon tree is i always find it very

3137
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:27,279
peculiar how similar

3138
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:28,479
the terpene profile is between sherbet

3139
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:30,800
and lemon tree even though one's

3140
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:32,799
obviously more orangey ones more

3141
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:34,480
kind of more lemony but i feel like

3142
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,840
there's this underlying similarity

3143
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:37,919
between the two

3144
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,079
between the lemon tree and the sherb uh

3145
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:43,440
sorry lemon tree and skittles

3146
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:44,238
yes um yeah if you asked me if you said

3147
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:46,799
hey

3148
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:49,359
the sk the lemon tree was an s one of

3149
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,119
the skittles or or the skittles was an

3150
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:52,479
s1 of the lemon tree which you know we

3151
01:43:51,118 --> 01:43:55,039
all think is just some

3152
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:56,718
lemon uh you know lemon from basically

3153
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:58,880
the santa cruz area that had been there

3154
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,158
supposedly for years anyway

3155
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,400
um and that's not you know that's not an

3156
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,079
area i spent a lot of time in up in that

3157
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:05,439
up in those mountains but

3158
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:07,198
my understanding is that that's all the

3159
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:09,359
lemon tree is it's just a rebranded

3160
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:11,759
lemon cut that was you know popular in

3161
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:14,319
that area for a long time anyway

3162
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:16,079
and if you told me the skittles was an

3163
01:44:14,319 --> 01:44:17,519
s1 of the lemon tree

3164
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:18,960
that i would believe

3165
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,760
that would actually make a lot of sense

3166
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,920
to me that's another one where like

3167
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,679
there's never been a male

3168
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,480
there's no male skittles

3169
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:28,239
like

3170
01:44:26,479 --> 01:44:30,479
that i've ever seen you could correct me

3171
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:32,079
if i'm wrong but i don't think there's

3172
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:33,359
ever been like an actual male they've

3173
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:35,840
crossed it with things and then they did

3174
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:37,439
like the zoz and some other stuff

3175
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,279
um

3176
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:41,519
but i don't think there was ever an

3177
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:44,880
actual mail of skittles

3178
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:46,960
yeah i think you're correct on that one

3179
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,760
interesting yeah i noticed that another

3180
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,760
kind of older strain from around those

3181
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:54,400
older days that i noticed on your feed

3182
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:56,239
was the las vegas purple kush i'd love

3183
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:57,759
to know how did you get it because you

3184
01:44:56,238 --> 01:44:59,439
don't you don't see a lot about it and

3185
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,600
people don't often speak about it but

3186
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:03,359
there are some people who hang on to it

3187
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:05,440
so i figure it must have some value

3188
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:08,238
what's your take on it

3189
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:10,319
so that cut as we can trace that cut

3190
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:12,399
back pretty far within within our

3191
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:16,238
personal circle

3192
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:18,079
and um the cut originally so so we

3193
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:20,399
attribute that to cut that cut to

3194
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:22,000
somebody named hydroson who uh passed

3195
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:23,920
away um

3196
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,760
he was the one that brought that cut

3197
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:28,480
into our circle he was definitely a

3198
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:31,199
character as most of us tend to be

3199
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:34,000
and he had sourced that cut from some

3200
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:34,960
people that he knew up in washington i

3201
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,319
believe

3202
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:41,279
and originally um another friend of mine

3203
01:45:38,319 --> 01:45:44,319
who is super underground he was the one

3204
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:46,719
that actually got that cut for our

3205
01:45:44,319 --> 01:45:49,920
friend hydro sun and hydro sun brought

3206
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:52,158
that cut down to uh to vegas and spread

3207
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:54,000
it to our circle out there and from

3208
01:45:52,158 --> 01:45:56,879
there it spread it spread to some of our

3209
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,359
guys in the bay area i always avoided it

3210
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:01,199
because it grew like a bubba and i never

3211
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:03,198
liked bubba at all

3212
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:06,158
i had no interest in bubba i didn't want

3213
01:46:03,198 --> 01:46:07,919
to grow it i didn't like the profile

3214
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:09,679
and the samples that i had seen of bubba

3215
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,440
were kind of weak it was kind of after

3216
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,239
the bubba had been grown kind of well

3217
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:15,039
and it was kind of getting

3218
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:16,638
commercialized and whatnot and so

3219
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:18,960
just the bad samples i'd never really

3220
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:20,960
been impressed by it

3221
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,719
but that's a cut that i kept for a long

3222
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,920
long time it's a beautiful plant it's

3223
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:26,639
hearty

3224
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:29,359
vigorous very very resistant

3225
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:31,279
um i think i think inspector or i think

3226
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:32,559
the doctor has come out um and back and

3227
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:34,000
forth here and there and said that oh

3228
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,840
it's a bubba ass one or something or

3229
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,960
it's a weak version of bubba

3230
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,600
um

3231
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:41,439
and yeah for me i always thought it was

3232
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,199
a great plant i know in our circle it's

3233
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:45,759
always been very very popular it

3234
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:47,919
definitely spread from there

3235
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:50,079
whether other people were able to get it

3236
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,359
through other avenues and maybe that's

3237
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:52,800
where they acquired it i know there's

3238
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:54,559
some people in the midwest we've spoken

3239
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,079
to that have held it and grown it for a

3240
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:58,320
while as well

3241
01:46:56,079 --> 01:47:00,000
i know that our circle and hydroson in

3242
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:02,479
particular were responsible for

3243
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,840
spreading that cut it's like i said it's

3244
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:05,759
not a cut that anyone's going to have

3245
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:08,400
any interest in today

3246
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,920
it you know it doesn't trim up well

3247
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:12,559
does not have a ton of bag appeal it

3248
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:13,679
grows very very interesting um potent

3249
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:16,320
flour

3250
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:19,118
but you know who's to say um kind of

3251
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:20,639
anything beyond that i just i believe

3252
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:22,960
that it came out of a garden in

3253
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:25,359
washington originally when we got it and

3254
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,439
then we spread it down to vegas and i

3255
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:29,839
think that's where it took that name

3256
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:32,079
um and then from there it kind of spread

3257
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:34,159
out but it is it's a cut that's kind of

3258
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:36,479
that's known but it seems

3259
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:38,479
unknown in a way as well i don't really

3260
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:39,839
know that that many people outside are

3261
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:42,638
like familiar with it so it's

3262
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:44,239
interesting that you bring it up

3263
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:46,639
yeah because it's kind of one of those

3264
01:47:44,238 --> 01:47:49,039
ones which does persist on but doesn't

3265
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:51,199
get a lot of mention does it

3266
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:53,198
no well we've we've definitely kept it

3267
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:55,118
around i mean it has a place in our

3268
01:47:53,198 --> 01:47:56,319
circle and i think

3269
01:47:55,118 --> 01:47:58,158
people

3270
01:47:56,319 --> 01:48:00,158
certain individuals have an affinity for

3271
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:02,158
it um one or two people in particular

3272
01:48:00,158 --> 01:48:03,920
that i'm thinking about that i think

3273
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:06,000
there are just certain cups certain cuts

3274
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:08,719
that they're going to keep probably

3275
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,719
forever and that's one of those cuts

3276
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:12,560
they just love it i mean

3277
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:14,000
grown grown right you know they've had

3278
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:16,719
good results with it i think one of my

3279
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,800
friends grew in deep water culture

3280
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:21,520
which spread uh sped up the veg and

3281
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,199
increased um the yield on it so you know

3282
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,639
he has a special place for it in his

3283
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:26,879
garden always

3284
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:28,719
and um yeah it's kind of cool to see it

3285
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,000
continue to survive and persist i've

3286
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:32,639
definitely done some work with it i've

3287
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,719
done an lvpk sherb and a couple other

3288
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:35,520
little projects with it that i think you

3289
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:37,439
know

3290
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:39,840
a lot of that stuff um a lot of the

3291
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:41,198
seeds they just go to friends of mine so

3292
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,960
and a lot of them they're not on

3293
01:48:41,198 --> 01:48:44,238
instagram they don't care about anything

3294
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,679
they're just they're just doing what

3295
01:48:44,238 --> 01:48:46,718
they do and they just they just want to

3296
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:48,239
grow

3297
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:49,679
you know we all we've all just been

3298
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:51,039
sharing seeds for a long time i mean a

3299
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:52,399
lot of those sherb seeds i never made

3300
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:54,639
them available people didn't really have

3301
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:57,198
a chance to buy them they mostly just

3302
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:59,840
went to friends of mine

3303
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:02,000
yeah okay well i mean heck speaking of

3304
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:04,319
seeds i've noticed that you tend to make

3305
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,800
a good mix of both femme and regular

3306
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:08,880
seeds do you have one you prefer most

3307
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,760
and do you feel like feminized seeds

3308
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:15,440
will eventually overtake regularity

3309
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:16,239
overtake regular seeds in popularity

3310
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:17,759
so

3311
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:19,198
yes so

3312
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,880
for years and years you know there was

3313
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:22,559
the common thought that like oh you know

3314
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,319
fems are unstable this that and the

3315
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,159
other whatever it might be

3316
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:27,679
um

3317
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:30,158
you know that that kind of stuck in my

3318
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:32,239
mind for a while until we actually until

3319
01:49:30,158 --> 01:49:33,839
i started seeing people doing work with

3320
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:35,118
them and then kind of seeing what was

3321
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,800
coming from it and i started to

3322
01:49:35,118 --> 01:49:38,960
understand a little bit more that like

3323
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,440
not necessarily you know if if the work

3324
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:43,198
if it was done you know unintentionally

3325
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:44,158
or whatever it might be then yes you

3326
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:45,759
know

3327
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,559
especially some like the sours and

3328
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:50,400
whatnot but if you do it intentionally

3329
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,920
i do feel like

3330
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:53,839
so i've seen a lot of regular male

3331
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:57,599
female work and if you do a poor

3332
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:59,440
selection on the male you are kind of

3333
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:01,199
dooming that whole line everything that

3334
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:03,359
comes after that is probably not going

3335
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:06,238
to be good and really the only way to

3336
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:08,238
know is to use the mail grow out the

3337
01:50:06,238 --> 01:50:10,399
seeds see see what comes of it and then

3338
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:12,399
determine okay this is a solid male and

3339
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:14,399
then probably go back and do another

3340
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:16,319
line with them what i really appreciate

3341
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:18,079
about the fems especially you know like

3342
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,359
the clone onlys or whatever it might be

3343
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:21,439
well i guess that the term is kind of

3344
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:24,559
loose these days but basically like

3345
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:26,319
selected cuts versus you know

3346
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,520
just a general male or whatnot if you

3347
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:31,840
take if i take a sherb which people know

3348
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,280
and i cross it to let's say a skittles

3349
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,039
which people know

3350
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:36,559
you're kind of taking the breeder out of

3351
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:38,479
the equation at that point what you're

3352
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,639
really depending on is does this person

3353
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:44,479
actually have these cuts

3354
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:46,400
and so for me going forward

3355
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:48,959
some of the work you know is going to be

3356
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:50,799
more more focused on the fems because i

3357
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:52,639
think that people really that's really

3358
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:54,239
what people want i mean a lot of people

3359
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,840
they don't really want to breed so if

3360
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:57,198
you don't want to breed you don't want

3361
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:59,039
to do the sex testing you don't want to

3362
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:00,559
have to identify anything you have a

3363
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:02,079
limited amount of space some people

3364
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,239
stick to plant counts or whatnot and

3365
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:06,000
wherever they are they would rather just

3366
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:08,879
pop them they would rather say okay cool

3367
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,359
this is you know gelato 25 crossed with

3368
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:13,760
docido perfect like this will work you

3369
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:15,519
know and you know gelato and sherb or

3370
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,679
you know wedding cake and shirt your

3371
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,880
take you're taking the breeder out of

3372
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:21,920
the equation you're taking their

3373
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:23,840
personal kind of

3374
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:26,480
they're not able to influence as much

3375
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:27,920
the process so you're just saying hey

3376
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:29,598
basically thanks for having the

3377
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,760
legitimate cut thank you for providing

3378
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,560
these seeds and i hope they germinate

3379
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:34,480
and

3380
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,280
then you know basically your service is

3381
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:36,879
done

3382
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:38,319
um and that that brings up a point you

3383
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:40,079
know for me as well which i don't know

3384
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:40,799
if it's something you were going to ask

3385
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:42,719
but

3386
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,159
a lot of what's going on out there right

3387
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:45,679
now it's people not working with

3388
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,679
legitimate cuttings and i think that's

3389
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:49,039
one of the reasons that i've been able

3390
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:51,840
to do what i do

3391
01:51:49,039 --> 01:51:53,760
is because people know that if i say i

3392
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:55,840
have something that

3393
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,520
it's that it is that

3394
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:59,920
and that's something that i've earned

3395
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:01,520
over a long long time in this business i

3396
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,679
think when people pop up now and they've

3397
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:06,080
got no reputation they've got no name

3398
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:08,319
they're not i'm honestly i hold inspect

3399
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:09,920
in high regard um i was gonna say you

3400
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:11,359
know like they're not inspected they're

3401
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,319
not these other people not to put myself

3402
01:52:11,359 --> 01:52:13,439
with him

3403
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:16,880
um

3404
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:18,238
but if inspector says he has a cut i 100

3405
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,279
believe it so when he did those triangle

3406
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:20,879
cushions once and people were

3407
01:52:19,279 --> 01:52:23,279
complaining about the price i might i

3408
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:25,760
was dying laughing because the

3409
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:27,599
opportunity to get a triangle kush s1

3410
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:31,599
which took him multiple attempts to

3411
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:34,000
achieve from inspector is invaluable

3412
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,840
and if you can't see that then you know

3413
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,679
it's not for you

3414
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,679
because you know that's that's a guy who

3415
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:42,719
if he says he has something it is

3416
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,079
exactly what he says it is and that's

3417
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:45,760
that's something that's like sorely

3418
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:47,519
lacking i see people popping up right

3419
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,599
now and they're saying oh you know i got

3420
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,119
the rumps or i got this or i got that or

3421
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,119
you know something comes out and they

3422
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:55,279
already have a whole line with it

3423
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:57,118
and a whole reverse femme line to all

3424
01:52:55,279 --> 01:52:59,198
these other ones and it's like

3425
01:52:57,118 --> 01:53:01,439
who number one who are you

3426
01:52:59,198 --> 01:53:03,118
totally fine go ahead and get your money

3427
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:05,759
but number two like

3428
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:08,399
just like is it really

3429
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,920
is it really what you say it is

3430
01:53:08,399 --> 01:53:11,519
and you know i think i think there's

3431
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,239
there's a lot of that going on but for

3432
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:16,639
me yeah i mean i intend to keep doing

3433
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:18,879
some male female work

3434
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:20,239
but that work takes longer and just like

3435
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,319
that as a zo

3436
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:23,919
people aren't really interested in you

3437
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:26,079
know people people don't people don't

3438
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,599
see the value of working something two

3439
01:53:26,079 --> 01:53:29,359
or three or four generations you're

3440
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:31,920
really kind of limiting yourself

3441
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:34,799
and from that kind of perspective people

3442
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:36,158
more want exactly what they know so if

3443
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,480
you say i've got a wedding cake and a

3444
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:40,960
sherb they're very into that but if you

3445
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:42,959
say oh i've got a vietnam black tie with

3446
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:44,560
a grand doggie perp crossed with a grand

3447
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,920
doggie per banana limon then you have to

3448
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,920
explain all that to them you have to say

3449
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,679
oh the limoni in cross was from swan

3450
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,800
song seeds and it's a double sour diesel

3451
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:52,000
[ __ ] trowel

3452
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,760
and you know it's crossed with the

3453
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
banana but it's not the banana og it's a

3454
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:58,079
sonoma cut that we had it's like banana

3455
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,520
runs almost and then you know we made

3456
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:01,840
that and then the grand doggie purpose

3457
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:03,920
of chem d gdp from connoisseur back in

3458
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,279
the day and you know but you got to

3459
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,880
explain all this stuff to them and the

3460
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:08,079
vietnam black tie is from ace most

3461
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:10,880
people are going to be like who's ace

3462
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:13,198
and what is that and what is all of that

3463
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:14,639
like where's the cookies at

3464
01:54:13,198 --> 01:54:16,000
that's what that's

3465
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:18,079
honestly that's what they're gonna say

3466
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,039
so literally if i just do cookies to

3467
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:20,399
cookies

3468
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:22,399
people will buy that you know

3469
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:23,839
fortunately for me like honestly i'm i'm

3470
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:25,759
a little bit more difficult about

3471
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,360
selling my seeds i don't really care if

3472
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,360
people buy them or don't buy them and

3473
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:31,679
that's not to be disrespectful of anyone

3474
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:34,639
that's just to say like i do what i do

3475
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:36,480
because i want to do it and

3476
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:38,000
because i think it's going to be good

3477
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:40,319
but when it comes down to actually

3478
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,399
selling seeds why would you spend three

3479
01:54:40,319 --> 01:54:44,799
or four years on a project when people

3480
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:47,359
are pumping out six projects a year

3481
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:48,639
of just fems to fems you know

3482
01:54:47,359 --> 01:54:50,719
i mean people are literally going to

3483
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:52,239
dispensary and buying a gelato 33 clone

3484
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:54,239
and reversing it to everything else or

3485
01:54:52,238 --> 01:54:55,519
they're popping one pack of seeds from

3486
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:57,439
somebody else and just hitting a bunch

3487
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,040
of stuff and just renaming it

3488
01:54:57,439 --> 01:55:00,960
um saying they have this saying they

3489
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:02,399
have that and i think a lot of that is

3490
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,480
kind of what's going on out there right

3491
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:06,719
now but yeah for me i'm i'm going to

3492
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:08,718
still do some fem work the fem work is

3493
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:11,118
tricky too you know an inspector i've

3494
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:13,760
been grateful to take some time from him

3495
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:16,158
um you know it's not they don't always

3496
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:18,639
work i tried to do a high life reversal

3497
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:20,479
barely worked barely put out any seeds

3498
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:23,039
very very very

3499
01:55:20,479 --> 01:55:24,238
um frustrating that when that happens

3500
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:25,599
and all you can really do is just go

3501
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:27,839
back to the drawing board and just try

3502
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:30,319
again you know and i know i know matt

3503
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:32,000
matt sells some solutions and uh one of

3504
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:33,759
my buddies uh chef ro from people under

3505
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,039
the stairs he has another solution that

3506
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,159
he makes and

3507
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:37,599
you know we're toying with some

3508
01:55:36,158 --> 01:55:39,839
different things and some gibberellic

3509
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:41,119
acid and whatnot in the mix with the sts

3510
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,039
to see if you know we'll get the

3511
01:55:41,118 --> 01:55:45,920
intended results that we need

3512
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:47,920
but you know generally it's not always

3513
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:50,480
the fems aren't always guaranteed either

3514
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:52,158
and so i understand you know like

3515
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:53,839
like that's why i feel like they can

3516
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:55,198
kind of command a higher premium because

3517
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:57,279
and i think people don't understand that

3518
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:59,598
like what it takes to back up so many

3519
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:01,840
plants like the commitment that it takes

3520
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:02,960
to keep such a diverse library it's

3521
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,400
there's a lot of people that are just

3522
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:05,840
going to the dispensary buying eight

3523
01:56:04,399 --> 01:56:08,319
clones and you know they start a seed

3524
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,520
company and that's great and that's fine

3525
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:10,880
and dandy they don't even keep any of

3526
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:12,800
the cuts they just go back and buy them

3527
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,239
again they hope it's the same cut you

3528
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,119
know maybe they hope maybe they don't

3529
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:16,559
care

3530
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:18,559
um

3531
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:20,639
but to back up the sheer number of

3532
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,840
plants you know that i have backed up

3533
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:23,520
over the years and the people i can

3534
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,599
expect to back up

3535
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:27,679
that's why i feel like they deserve a

3536
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:30,719
premium that's why i feel like you know

3537
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:32,800
it's worth paying them what they ask

3538
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:34,399
because of what it takes to go into that

3539
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,840
you mean you're not just paying for you

3540
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:38,000
know somebody to make some seeds in the

3541
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,840
tent or something it's like this person

3542
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,560
has dedicated years to sourcing

3543
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:45,119
collecting preserving transporting

3544
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,480
moving you know cloning backing up

3545
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:48,319
whatever it might be

3546
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:49,118
and then tried to do these things for

3547
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:50,639
you

3548
01:56:49,118 --> 01:56:52,479
but yeah no i'm always going to do some

3549
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:54,639
regular male female work

3550
01:56:52,479 --> 01:56:56,559
and and some fem work i enjoy the fem

3551
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:57,679
work honestly a lot of people want that

3552
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:59,360
they don't

3553
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:01,760
they don't care about breeding they have

3554
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:03,679
no interest in males like they just want

3555
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:06,400
to pop some seeds grow some flowers pick

3556
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:09,199
a female and go from there

3557
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:10,960
yeah i agree with just almost everything

3558
01:57:09,198 --> 01:57:13,678
you said you know like that that

3559
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:16,399
trusting a breeder and not doing

3560
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:18,639
the the kind of the the shady acts that

3561
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:22,238
we see certain breeders like copycat

3562
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:25,118
genetics [ __ ] you big dan i hate you um

3563
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:26,959
yeah that guy's trash in every sense um

3564
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:28,559
but yeah you know and someone like

3565
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,880
inspector on the other hand you know the

3566
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:32,400
epitome of kind of what you can trust as

3567
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,639
the gold standard so yeah i totally

3568
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:36,719
agree and we're going to talk about some

3569
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:38,400
azazel stuff soon because i'm super

3570
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:40,480
interested in that like above all things

3571
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:42,079
but i want to quickly ask you do you

3572
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:44,559
feel like when you're converting a

3573
01:57:42,079 --> 01:57:46,800
female to be like the pollen donor for a

3574
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:49,440
cross do you feel like

3575
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:50,560
that causes any sort of stress like do

3576
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:52,079
you feel like

3577
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:54,159
the result of you doing that is

3578
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:55,279
different from if the plant had hermed

3579
01:57:54,158 --> 01:57:57,839
out or do you feel like they're

3580
01:57:55,279 --> 01:58:00,479
essentially the same result

3581
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:03,679
i feel i feel that they're different

3582
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:05,439
um in my experience the plants that her

3583
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:08,079
mouth as it were

3584
01:58:05,439 --> 01:58:10,799
tend to produce more unstable seeds

3585
01:58:08,079 --> 01:58:14,079
and when you intentionally do it it

3586
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:15,760
seems to actually produce more stable

3587
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:17,198
seeds but

3588
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,800
i mean that could just be a matter of

3589
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:21,198
the plant that herm that was initially

3590
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:23,920
more prone to that anyway

3591
01:58:21,198 --> 01:58:25,519
so maybe maybe if maybe it wouldn't have

3592
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,800
had anything to do anyway maybe if you

3593
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:28,080
had sprayed the plant that was gonna

3594
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:30,880
hermit it would do it anyway whereas the

3595
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:32,880
other one is just less prone to doing so

3596
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:35,840
um i've never tried both ways to be

3597
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,679
honest um but in my experience i think

3598
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:39,840
that if you do it intentionally versus

3599
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:40,800
if it happens accidentally

3600
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,800
it's

3601
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,360
i feel i find it to be more more

3602
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,679
reliable in my experience

3603
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:49,920
yeah definitely i can i can back that

3604
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:52,239
myself with my limited experience making

3605
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,840
fems and so the follow-up question is

3606
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:55,919
have you ever done any kind of more

3607
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:58,800
weird breeding stuff with your regular

3608
01:58:55,920 --> 01:59:02,639
things and by that i mean like we often

3609
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:05,520
refer to how dj short had many moons ago

3610
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:07,440
referenced like that hermaphrodite males

3611
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:09,360
were good males to breed with you ever

3612
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:11,598
do any kind of left of field stuff like

3613
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:13,198
that at all or you try to keep it pretty

3614
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:15,440
straightforward

3615
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:19,198
no i try and keep it pretty basic it's

3616
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:21,198
it's it's a very very complicated um

3617
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:22,158
game to play anyway

3618
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:24,399
and

3619
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:26,319
to try and complicate it even further i

3620
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:28,319
would leave that to someone like dj or

3621
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:29,118
some of these other people out there i

3622
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:31,279
mean

3623
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:32,799
the kind of work that that dj has done

3624
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:35,519
is not really the kind of work that i

3625
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,679
would want to do like i don't i don't

3626
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:39,840
the kind of breeding that he's done is

3627
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,679
different than what i'm interested in

3628
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,199
for me i'm most interested in taking

3629
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:44,399
like things that are

3630
01:59:43,198 --> 01:59:46,719
popular now

3631
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:48,479
and combining them with things that are

3632
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:50,158
you know kind of out of left field that

3633
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:52,959
people wouldn't expect like like i did a

3634
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:55,118
burma with the gb6 tricks and that's not

3635
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:58,079
something that anybody's doing and in

3636
01:59:55,118 --> 01:59:59,920
fact when i made it uh loki um was he

3637
01:59:58,079 --> 02:00:02,238
even asked he's like nobody's gonna want

3638
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,000
that nobody's gonna care about burma or

3639
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:06,000
lucy or any of this weird stuff that

3640
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,359
you're doing and i said it's fine people

3641
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,198
will grab whatever they want they'll

3642
02:00:07,359 --> 02:00:10,399
grab docido face on fire they'll grab

3643
02:00:09,198 --> 02:00:11,439
this they'll grab that they'll grab the

3644
02:00:10,399 --> 02:00:13,118
peanut butter breath whatever it is

3645
02:00:11,439 --> 02:00:15,359
they're interested in it's totally fine

3646
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:18,399
i do that because i like to do that and

3647
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:20,238
that's you know i enjoy doing that's

3648
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:22,960
probably about as weird as i get is kind

3649
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:24,879
of combining some of these left field uh

3650
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:28,639
cultivars with something that people

3651
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:30,159
would not expect it to be combined with

3652
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:33,039
of course

3653
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:35,439
so when you are looking to select a male

3654
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:37,760
what are the some of the traits you find

3655
02:00:35,439 --> 02:00:39,198
ideal in a male like would you have any

3656
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:41,039
tips for the audience they love this

3657
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:43,279
type of things like is there any sort of

3658
02:00:41,039 --> 02:00:44,479
visual cues or anything that you like to

3659
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:47,118
go with

3660
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:48,479
yeah so the first thing that i look for

3661
02:00:47,118 --> 02:00:51,118
is structure

3662
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:53,678
um i like a plant that has what i

3663
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:56,559
consider ideal structure i don't want

3664
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:58,079
something that's too stocky i don't want

3665
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:00,719
something that has weird internal

3666
02:00:58,079 --> 02:01:02,319
spacing i don't want something i mean i

3667
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:05,359
have a specific type of plant that i

3668
02:01:02,319 --> 02:01:07,759
that i look to make and it's more geared

3669
02:01:05,359 --> 02:01:09,359
towards indoor cultivation i wanted to

3670
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:11,440
have a certain amount of internal

3671
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:14,079
spacing i wanted to have like proper

3672
02:01:11,439 --> 02:01:15,839
size flowers i don't want i mean

3673
02:01:14,079 --> 02:01:18,158
sometimes it happens but i don't want

3674
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:20,000
like just giant spear colas like this

3675
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:21,759
you know it's not 1985 i'm not trying to

3676
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,560
grow something to put my forearm next to

3677
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:23,440
it

3678
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,840
um

3679
02:01:23,439 --> 02:01:28,638
i wanna i like to grow what i consider

3680
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:31,279
like proper you know two three gram

3681
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:32,960
flowers like on you know on a nice sized

3682
02:01:31,279 --> 02:01:35,198
plant so the biggest thing i would say

3683
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:37,118
would be structure vigor

3684
02:01:35,198 --> 02:01:39,519
um

3685
02:01:37,118 --> 02:01:41,039
definitely like the leaf like how leafy

3686
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:44,320
it is so when when something is

3687
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:45,920
extremely leafy i think about like

3688
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:47,920
what it's going to be to maintain that

3689
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:49,920
plant and grow that plant and

3690
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:52,158
at scale something requires if it

3691
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:53,279
requires a lot more work it's just not

3692
02:01:52,158 --> 02:01:54,559
worth it

3693
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:56,800
um

3694
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:59,199
so i think a lot about that and then

3695
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,039
also when it comes time to flower them

3696
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:02,879
um let's say i've got you know 20 males

3697
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:05,920
i'm trying to flower i'll eliminate the

3698
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,719
first ones to show i don't want them and

3699
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,000
you know i don't know if that's

3700
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:10,239
something that other people have touched

3701
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,760
on before but to me that's a sign that

3702
02:02:10,238 --> 02:02:13,039
something is like a little bit more

3703
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:15,679
susceptible

3704
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:17,679
to having intersex expressions a little

3705
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:20,000
bit less stable

3706
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:22,319
i want something that's going to show a

3707
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,679
little bit later and i want something

3708
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:25,439
that's going to be a little bit more

3709
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:26,880
resistant so you know you can be a

3710
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:28,079
little bit rough on them you should be a

3711
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:30,480
little bit rough on them you should see

3712
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:31,760
how they respond and it's it's tough for

3713
02:02:30,479 --> 02:02:33,359
me because i definitely don't like to

3714
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:35,520
abuse them

3715
02:02:33,359 --> 02:02:38,000
but i think it's important to see how

3716
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:39,520
they respond and to see which ones

3717
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,238
really which ones kind of have the

3718
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:45,119
widest bandwidth so that's something

3719
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:47,359
that i think about a lot with plants is

3720
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:49,118
how tolerant they are

3721
02:02:47,359 --> 02:02:51,920
and i feel like that's something that we

3722
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:54,319
don't talk about as much like not all

3723
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,079
plants have the same bandwidth and

3724
02:02:54,319 --> 02:02:58,079
that's just what i call it

3725
02:02:56,079 --> 02:02:59,519
they don't all have the same range

3726
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:01,439
they're not all able to take the

3727
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,360
temperature swings or the ph swings or

3728
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:06,079
the nutrient imbalances

3729
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:09,198
or you know whatever it might be they

3730
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:11,279
don't all respond the same way and so i

3731
02:03:09,198 --> 02:03:14,319
definitely look for plants that have a

3732
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:16,960
wider bandwidth if if the ph swings

3733
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:19,439
during the feed you know and these three

3734
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:21,439
don't respond well i'll eliminate them

3735
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:22,799
because to me that says this is a plant

3736
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:24,559
that has that needs a really really

3737
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,760
specific set of conditions in order for

3738
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:28,239
it to thrive

3739
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:30,480
that's a plant that i don't want because

3740
02:03:28,238 --> 02:03:32,158
that's not what i'm looking for

3741
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:34,158
and i feel like it'll pass those it

3742
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:35,598
could pass those traits on so why would

3743
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:37,598
i keep that plant

3744
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:38,880
so mostly i would say that's probably

3745
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:41,119
the biggest thing is just to see how

3746
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:43,679
they respond to look at the structure i

3747
02:03:41,118 --> 02:03:45,759
eliminate the early flowering ones and

3748
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:47,359
then you know i go from there one thing

3749
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:50,159
i've never done that i'm actually very

3750
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:52,639
interested in doing is to reverse a male

3751
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:54,879
to see how it produces what the resin

3752
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:56,319
profile is like

3753
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:57,679
just a lot of those different factors

3754
02:03:56,319 --> 02:03:59,279
and i'm sure you've heard people talk

3755
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:01,359
about doing that before it's been a

3756
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:03,439
topic of conversation for years

3757
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:04,880
i know that some people have done it

3758
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:07,439
and i think that's a really interesting

3759
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,880
way to kind of see which mail would be

3760
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:12,238
worth going with and it's something i'd

3761
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:14,000
probably like to do on my next project

3762
02:04:12,238 --> 02:04:15,598
yeah i think that'll get you some really

3763
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,920
interesting results we've heard a few

3764
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:20,239
people talk about it but it is still

3765
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:22,239
very much like a bit of a

3766
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:25,839
uncertain thing that hasn't been delved

3767
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:27,359
into too much i did however want to ask

3768
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,960
you in general

3769
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:31,279
what are you currently working on what

3770
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:33,840
are you excited for

3771
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:36,238
yeah so right now i'm trying to figure

3772
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:38,319
out what i want to do next we're seeing

3773
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:40,319
a lot of the results from the gp6 tricks

3774
02:04:38,319 --> 02:04:43,439
project i had tried to do that high life

3775
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:44,880
project which did not work out for me

3776
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:47,118
um

3777
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:49,679
not quite sure what i want to do i think

3778
02:04:47,118 --> 02:04:52,000
we may take one of the selections from

3779
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:54,319
the gb6 tricks project to start a new

3780
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,960
line from so one of the things we did

3781
02:04:54,319 --> 02:04:59,118
was that we kept a couple of lines for

3782
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:02,078
ourselves and we didn't release them

3783
02:04:59,118 --> 02:05:03,839
one was the gelato 41 gb six tricks and

3784
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:06,158
the other one was the biscotti gb6

3785
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,199
tricks and so both of those haven't been

3786
02:05:06,158 --> 02:05:09,359
released

3787
02:05:07,198 --> 02:05:11,919
and i right now we're in the process of

3788
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:13,198
hunting some of those um loki is hunting

3789
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:14,880
some of them right now and i've got a

3790
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:16,158
couple going as well

3791
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,560
and i think if

3792
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:20,319
what we're seeing we really like and i

3793
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,679
think it would be an improvement to that

3794
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:24,158
line and i think it might be a good

3795
02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:26,560
foundation for a future femme project i

3796
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:29,198
mean things are moving so quickly that

3797
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:31,280
it's kind of hard to say me personally i

3798
02:05:29,198 --> 02:05:32,319
would like to do something totally off

3799
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:34,000
off

3800
02:05:32,319 --> 02:05:34,960
something totally off the reservation as

3801
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,439
it were

3802
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:38,560
um like some honduran or some guatemalan

3803
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:40,879
or you know i've got a friend from

3804
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:42,159
colombia you know they got me some seeds

3805
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:44,319
i'd be interested in working some of

3806
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:45,920
that stuff but you know i've you know in

3807
02:05:44,319 --> 02:05:47,359
conversations with my friends one of the

3808
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:48,960
discussions we've had is basically was

3809
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:51,359
just like yeah no one no one is going to

3810
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:53,118
be interested in that and so there's the

3811
02:05:51,359 --> 02:05:54,479
part of me that doesn't really care and

3812
02:05:53,118 --> 02:05:55,439
then there's the part of me that thinks

3813
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:57,279
well

3814
02:05:55,439 --> 02:05:59,439
like i do it for me but i also do it so

3815
02:05:57,279 --> 02:06:00,880
that other people will grow it and so i

3816
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:03,359
have to consider

3817
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:05,920
you know what people want i mean if i

3818
02:06:03,359 --> 02:06:08,479
just make something that is of only

3819
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:10,000
interest a handful of us is it really

3820
02:06:08,479 --> 02:06:11,519
going to be impactful is it really going

3821
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,599
to make a difference are people really

3822
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:15,679
even going to grow it and if they're not

3823
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:16,480
if the answer is no then

3824
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:18,880
why

3825
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:20,959
why make it or why make it at scale just

3826
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:22,880
make it for myself then if i want

3827
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:23,840
and grow it out if i feel like growing

3828
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:25,199
it out

3829
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:27,440
but yeah i would say right now we're

3830
02:06:25,198 --> 02:06:29,519
probably looking towards working on one

3831
02:06:27,439 --> 02:06:31,118
of those or probably a reversal i have a

3832
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:32,000
wedding cake sherb that i really like as

3833
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:33,198
well

3834
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,439
but

3835
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:36,879
sometimes i kind of feel like maybe some

3836
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:39,198
of those things they've kind of had

3837
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:41,679
their time and a thing that i forget is

3838
02:06:39,198 --> 02:06:44,719
kind of how far ahead of the curve my

3839
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:47,118
friends and i have always been and

3840
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:49,439
something that to us is kind of like

3841
02:06:47,118 --> 02:06:51,839
kind of like washed kind of like over it

3842
02:06:49,439 --> 02:06:53,678
as it were kind of blown out

3843
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:55,199
still has a lot of traction i mean

3844
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:56,719
people still buy a lot of wedding cake

3845
02:06:55,198 --> 02:07:00,000
crosses they still buy a lot of gmo

3846
02:06:56,719 --> 02:07:00,880
crosses they still want to grow that and

3847
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,719
you know

3848
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:05,840
back east especially like a lot of the

3849
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:07,679
market isn't even really there yet

3850
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,279
like they're they're still excited about

3851
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:10,719
wedding cake

3852
02:07:09,279 --> 02:07:12,399
and you know wedding cake is something

3853
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:15,118
that you know hasn't been popular out

3854
02:07:12,399 --> 02:07:17,198
west in in a straight form

3855
02:07:15,118 --> 02:07:18,719
for at least three or four years

3856
02:07:17,198 --> 02:07:20,000
i mean it's something that you see but

3857
02:07:18,719 --> 02:07:21,198
it's kind of like become like a it's

3858
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,719
kind of become like a staple it's kind

3859
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:24,078
of become like a thing that's around but

3860
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:26,880
not something that people are really

3861
02:07:24,078 --> 02:07:28,158
really excited about so i think you know

3862
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,920
there's there's some work that could be

3863
02:07:28,158 --> 02:07:31,279
done with the gelato 41 tricks that i

3864
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:32,560
think would be good or the biscotti

3865
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:34,399
tricks

3866
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:36,880
i would like to work the burma tricks

3867
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:38,238
potentially and the lucy tricks

3868
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:40,078
um

3869
02:07:38,238 --> 02:07:42,559
and then maybe go back to do some of the

3870
02:07:40,078 --> 02:07:43,519
sherb crosses as well going forward

3871
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:45,599
though

3872
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:47,760
um i don't know we talked about a little

3873
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:49,840
bit uh that azazel is something that i

3874
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,199
think has a lot of potential in it and

3875
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:52,880
everybody that's grown it has been

3876
02:07:51,198 --> 02:07:54,799
really really impressed by it but it's

3877
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:56,319
one of those things where you know if

3878
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,800
you called it apple runts people would

3879
02:07:56,319 --> 02:08:00,000
buy it but if you call it as is though

3880
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:02,000
i don't know that people are interested

3881
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,359
in it honestly and it's like do how much

3882
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,359
how much further do i go down that

3883
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:08,479
direction

3884
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:10,639
yeah okay well i mean let's talk about

3885
02:08:08,479 --> 02:08:12,959
that for a quick second do you like to

3886
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:14,560
kind of hunt and go down that route of

3887
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:16,078
things that aren't exactly popular

3888
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:19,039
because like as what we see with the

3889
02:08:16,078 --> 02:08:21,759
azazo most people aren't specifically

3890
02:08:19,039 --> 02:08:23,920
requesting vietnamese or thai

3891
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:26,480
dominant weed these days do you feel

3892
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:28,719
like as a breeder you've got to accept a

3893
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:31,198
certain amount of kind of

3894
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:34,480
commercial loss or just you know kind of

3895
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:36,799
sales loss from the casual enthusiast

3896
02:08:34,479 --> 02:08:39,039
but that then in turn allows you to

3897
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:42,159
pursue some of these more niche and

3898
02:08:39,039 --> 02:08:44,639
truly exotic lines

3899
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:47,198
i i do feel that and

3900
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:49,440
what i find is that the people who are

3901
02:08:47,198 --> 02:08:50,638
interested in my work are extremely

3902
02:08:49,439 --> 02:08:53,198
passionate

3903
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:54,960
um so i think that i have cultivated the

3904
02:08:53,198 --> 02:08:56,960
right type of people

3905
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:59,439
for what i want to do

3906
02:08:56,960 --> 02:09:01,760
but commercially it's not going to be

3907
02:08:59,439 --> 02:09:03,919
something that you know like an azazel

3908
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:06,320
or vietnamese or a thai is not going to

3909
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:08,399
be something that necessarily

3910
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:10,719
is you know is gonna is gonna make a ton

3911
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:12,559
of waves however that being said i mean

3912
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:14,639
when you look at the mac

3913
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:16,480
it's the colombian in it that that

3914
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:18,400
really surprises people

3915
02:09:16,479 --> 02:09:20,319
um and it's what gives it that profile

3916
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:22,078
that lemony profile or whatever whatever

3917
02:09:20,319 --> 02:09:24,078
you want to call that weird um kind of

3918
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:25,679
my friend describe it like a like a

3919
02:09:24,078 --> 02:09:27,439
raspberry yogurt or something but the

3920
02:09:25,679 --> 02:09:29,840
lemon is what comes out all the rest of

3921
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:31,118
it all the crosses so i think that you

3922
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:32,800
know

3923
02:09:31,118 --> 02:09:34,078
i'm going to continue to do what i love

3924
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:36,320
to do

3925
02:09:34,078 --> 02:09:37,920
i think that there is a group of people

3926
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:38,960
out there that appreciate the work that

3927
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:40,319
i do

3928
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:42,639
and

3929
02:09:40,319 --> 02:09:44,319
i do it mostly because i love it i've

3930
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:46,880
always done this because i love it and

3931
02:09:44,319 --> 02:09:48,158
i've been grateful to be able to do that

3932
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:49,679
and i've always been the guy that

3933
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:51,598
instead of just running one strain i've

3934
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:53,599
run you know a dozen and it doesn't make

3935
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:55,360
any sense to people and you leave a

3936
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:57,760
bunch of money on the table and it's not

3937
02:09:55,359 --> 02:09:58,960
efficient it requires a lot more work

3938
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:01,920
but

3939
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:04,719
i've always done this because i love to

3940
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:06,480
do it and so i accept whatever comes

3941
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:08,078
with that which is yeah maybe you're not

3942
02:10:06,479 --> 02:10:11,598
gonna you are gonna leave some sales on

3943
02:10:08,078 --> 02:10:13,359
the table i mean we did some gmos ones

3944
02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:16,400
and they flew

3945
02:10:13,359 --> 02:10:18,559
this tiny tiny drop super small you know

3946
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:19,839
but they flew and you know the vendor

3947
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:21,679
that picked them up said that if i had

3948
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:22,960
done you know a bunch more of them they

3949
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:24,319
would all still go

3950
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,639
but a lot of the other stuff people

3951
02:10:24,319 --> 02:10:29,359
aren't interested in you know if you do

3952
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:32,078
i mean we did uh death star cherry pie

3953
02:10:29,359 --> 02:10:33,839
with the mendo breath uv wet dream

3954
02:10:32,078 --> 02:10:35,759
and you know people that have grown and

3955
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:37,920
love it i mean somebody grew chem 91

3956
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:39,360
mando breath uv wet dream that i made

3957
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:42,719
and you know told me the herb was

3958
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:45,359
phenomenal i mean they loved it but

3959
02:10:42,719 --> 02:10:47,439
it doesn't have what people want like

3960
02:10:45,359 --> 02:10:50,238
nowhere in there does it say gelato or

3961
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:52,399
sherb or cake or whatever or breath it

3962
02:10:50,238 --> 02:10:54,238
doesn't have any of that in there

3963
02:10:52,399 --> 02:10:56,078
it's something i mean i guess it does

3964
02:10:54,238 --> 02:10:57,839
because it has the mendo breath but like

3965
02:10:56,078 --> 02:10:59,359
very very sparingly not in a way that

3966
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:01,119
people would want it

3967
02:10:59,359 --> 02:11:03,359
so when you do

3968
02:11:01,118 --> 02:11:05,118
decide to go down this route of

3969
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:07,039
exploring one of these lines which is

3970
02:11:05,118 --> 02:11:09,839
kind of more for your own interest than

3971
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:11,359
for a commercial success so to speak not

3972
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:13,199
that they're mutually exclusive but you

3973
02:11:11,359 --> 02:11:14,639
know hopefully you get what i mean is it

3974
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:16,638
because

3975
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:18,400
you have fond memories of some of the

3976
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:20,319
components of these lines you're kind of

3977
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:22,799
chasing that feeling of the old

3978
02:11:20,319 --> 02:11:24,399
vietnamese type strains or is it more so

3979
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:26,239
that it's just a really interesting

3980
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:27,598
combination of things you don't see

3981
02:11:26,238 --> 02:11:29,359
often

3982
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:30,239
to me it's literally because life is

3983
02:11:29,359 --> 02:11:33,279
short

3984
02:11:30,238 --> 02:11:34,638
and i have zero interest in trying to

3985
02:11:33,279 --> 02:11:36,960
just make a bunch of money and do

3986
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:40,639
whatever people expect you to do

3987
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:42,639
um i'm gonna do what i want to do and so

3988
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:44,880
if i have an opportunity to work

3989
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:46,480
something unique and something different

3990
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:48,319
that's what i'm gonna do

3991
02:11:46,479 --> 02:11:50,000
and you know that like i said the people

3992
02:11:48,319 --> 02:11:51,920
that that that doing that kind of work

3993
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,520
attracts are the kind of people that i

3994
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:55,039
want to be around i mean i've been

3995
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:56,880
really really fortunate to connect with

3996
02:11:55,039 --> 02:11:59,359
a lot of really good people

3997
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:00,800
um a group at new mexico that you know

3998
02:11:59,359 --> 02:12:02,559
super passionate about the work that i'm

3999
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,320
doing and one of them is growing the

4000
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:06,480
azazel and he told me i mean his

4001
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:08,880
description of it was yeah super unique

4002
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:10,799
um really really interesting uh you know

4003
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:13,118
shorter quicker flowering but it has

4004
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:14,560
that vietnamese high profile and that's

4005
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:16,559
something that when when you show it to

4006
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:17,840
people they haven't seen that they don't

4007
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:19,360
even know what that is there's a whole

4008
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:20,560
generation of people that i mean

4009
02:12:19,359 --> 02:12:23,118
honestly most of them haven't even seen

4010
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:26,079
flower all they do is dab

4011
02:12:23,118 --> 02:12:28,559
so when you show them a proper flower

4012
02:12:26,078 --> 02:12:30,559
of something like that it shows i think

4013
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:32,320
i think it could change somebody's life

4014
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:34,480
to see something like that it could show

4015
02:12:32,319 --> 02:12:36,399
them that there's more to this than just

4016
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:38,158
cookie cookie cookie cookie you know

4017
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:38,960
there's like there's other stuff out

4018
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:40,479
there

4019
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:42,078
and

4020
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:43,598
i think that you know that that to me is

4021
02:12:42,078 --> 02:12:45,279
valuable and the high is different the

4022
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:46,480
effect is different the terpene profile

4023
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:47,599
is different

4024
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:49,279
and

4025
02:12:47,599 --> 02:12:50,719
i mean it's something that people

4026
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:52,238
nowadays don't see like i was saying

4027
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:54,239
earlier you know a lot of the herb today

4028
02:12:52,238 --> 02:12:55,519
is very very narcotic people are looking

4029
02:12:54,238 --> 02:12:57,439
for something to basically be a

4030
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:59,199
substitute for a pill

4031
02:12:57,439 --> 02:13:01,839
and um

4032
02:12:59,198 --> 02:13:03,279
yeah they can find it out there but i

4033
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:05,360
don't to me

4034
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:07,198
it's not always about that

4035
02:13:05,359 --> 02:13:08,639
um i mean i've been i've been blessed to

4036
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:09,598
smoke some really really interesting

4037
02:13:08,639 --> 02:13:10,560
flour

4038
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:12,078
and

4039
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:14,320
you know the effects from them can be

4040
02:13:12,078 --> 02:13:16,000
way way different and i don't know that

4041
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:17,118
a lot of people have ever had flour like

4042
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,719
that

4043
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:21,118
yeah i would i would agree it's

4044
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:23,439
certainly one of the rarer ones right

4045
02:13:21,118 --> 02:13:25,039
just not uh probably not last question

4046
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:27,359
but the one before

4047
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:29,118
you mentioned wet dream this is one i

4048
02:13:27,359 --> 02:13:31,519
wanted to ask you about because i

4049
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:33,439
noticed the cult classics used it in

4050
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:35,599
some of their lines would you be able to

4051
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:38,078
fill us in on where you fit in with the

4052
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:41,039
wet dream and where they fit in

4053
02:13:38,078 --> 02:13:43,279
yeah so the wet dream was a project that

4054
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:44,800
some friends and i had done we started

4055
02:13:43,279 --> 02:13:46,639
it and i mentioned it earlier it was you

4056
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,000
know from reef and then we hit the blue

4057
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:49,440
dream and we grew it outside for a

4058
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,158
couple of seasons

4059
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:53,919
and then i had had some that i had um

4060
02:13:52,158 --> 02:13:55,439
flowered out i was gonna try and do

4061
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:58,880
another i did

4062
02:13:55,439 --> 02:14:00,638
i was on the f3 generation of it and i

4063
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:02,719
gathered some pollen

4064
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:05,279
um from it to kind of further the line a

4065
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:07,039
little bit more and i actually gave it

4066
02:14:05,279 --> 02:14:08,238
went down and saw my friend norcal and

4067
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:10,000
gave it to him

4068
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:10,959
at the time he was growing the dog's

4069
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,880
waltz

4070
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:14,800
and i liked it that was a great plant

4071
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:16,078
very very interesting and so i said hey

4072
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:17,599
i said do you mind hitting the dog's

4073
02:14:16,078 --> 02:14:19,519
walt and making some seeds for me with

4074
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:21,279
it and he said yeah no problem

4075
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:22,800
he has a lot of stuff going on in his

4076
02:14:21,279 --> 02:14:25,279
life so

4077
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:28,159
he had that pollen

4078
02:14:25,279 --> 02:14:30,238
and at some point he connected with cult

4079
02:14:28,158 --> 02:14:32,479
classics because they they know each

4080
02:14:30,238 --> 02:14:34,718
other and he gave him he gave him the

4081
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:36,959
pollen or he sorry he gave him he hit

4082
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:40,719
the og kb and he hit the mendo breath

4083
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:43,039
and he gave cult classics the og kb

4084
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:44,078
seeds from from that project

4085
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:46,319
um

4086
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:48,559
the next time that i heard about that

4087
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:50,479
because we're all pretty busy um

4088
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:52,639
somebody contacted me and said hey are

4089
02:14:50,479 --> 02:14:54,879
you working with cult classics and i

4090
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:57,920
said who's called classics

4091
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:58,880
and uh he said yeah he's got a og kb wet

4092
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:00,880
dream

4093
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:02,078
line that he's releasing you don't know

4094
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:04,159
anything about this i said not on

4095
02:15:02,078 --> 02:15:05,840
anything about it so i um

4096
02:15:04,158 --> 02:15:07,198
called norcal and talked to him for a

4097
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:10,078
bit and he's like oh man i completely

4098
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:11,519
forgot uh that you gave me that pollen

4099
02:15:10,078 --> 02:15:13,198
he's like yeah i'm working with him on

4100
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:15,199
on the seed project and you know we're

4101
02:15:13,198 --> 02:15:17,279
doing the ogkb stuff and blah blah blah

4102
02:15:15,198 --> 02:15:19,519
this that and the other

4103
02:15:17,279 --> 02:15:22,639
i had never heard of him i had never met

4104
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:25,199
him i would not have given him my pollen

4105
02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:27,840
this is a conversation that i have had

4106
02:15:25,198 --> 02:15:28,719
uh publicly i think with him at one

4107
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:31,520
point

4108
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:33,920
and um but because norcal is my friend

4109
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:35,599
and i figured he would you know get

4110
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:37,118
compensated from it

4111
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:38,800
rather than cause a problem like what's

4112
02:15:37,118 --> 02:15:40,238
done is done i just let it go i had a

4113
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:41,360
lot of other stuff going on a lot of

4114
02:15:40,238 --> 02:15:44,078
other things that i was working on

4115
02:15:41,359 --> 02:15:45,359
anyway so it didn't really bother me

4116
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:46,799
um

4117
02:15:45,359 --> 02:15:48,960
then just kind of like and i don't want

4118
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:50,400
to go too much into his personal issues

4119
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,279
but i'll just suffice it to say that

4120
02:15:50,399 --> 02:15:53,439
like

4121
02:15:51,279 --> 02:15:54,639
they didn't necessarily it didn't really

4122
02:15:53,439 --> 02:15:56,158
work out the way that he wanted it to

4123
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:59,039
work out um

4124
02:15:56,158 --> 02:16:00,559
not to in all full transparency not an

4125
02:15:59,039 --> 02:16:03,198
individual that i've ever wanted to be

4126
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:06,000
associated with a person that i've met

4127
02:16:03,198 --> 02:16:08,479
one time and i've never had any interest

4128
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,078
in further associating with him um i

4129
02:16:08,479 --> 02:16:12,000
never got compensated on any of that

4130
02:16:10,078 --> 02:16:13,519
stuff never had really any interest as

4131
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:16,560
long as norcal was getting you know

4132
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:18,719
compensated in some way shape or form

4133
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:20,320
beyond that um you know i've seen a lot

4134
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:22,319
of people run the work i've seen a lot

4135
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:25,039
of people be excited about it it is kind

4136
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:26,479
of cool to see that because you know

4137
02:16:25,039 --> 02:16:28,960
what they're most excited about is

4138
02:16:26,479 --> 02:16:30,959
usually the fact that there's no no

4139
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:33,760
intersex issues that have been found in

4140
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:35,439
those seeds the size the vigor the resin

4141
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:37,359
production

4142
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:38,719
the profiles

4143
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:40,479
you know if anything i think it's a

4144
02:16:38,718 --> 02:16:42,239
testament to the work that my friends

4145
02:16:40,478 --> 02:16:45,840
and i did over the years with that

4146
02:16:42,239 --> 02:16:47,679
pollen that being said it was not ever

4147
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:49,359
intended for a release nor did i ever

4148
02:16:47,679 --> 02:16:51,120
have any nor would i have ever worked

4149
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:54,559
with somebody like him

4150
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:56,960
it's just what happened and uh

4151
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:58,959
from there i would say um at some point

4152
02:16:56,959 --> 02:17:02,000
he did give me a couple of the other og

4153
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:03,678
kb uh wet dream seeds that existed and

4154
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,239
he also gave me uh some of the mendo

4155
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:08,239
breath uv wet dream seeds that existed

4156
02:17:06,239 --> 02:17:10,000
and so i was able to

4157
02:17:08,239 --> 02:17:11,840
you know keep those and i've used the

4158
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,599
meadow breath uv wet dreams

4159
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:14,960
in a line that i did and

4160
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:16,639
you know other than that i would say

4161
02:17:14,959 --> 02:17:17,919
yeah it's kind of cool to see it get out

4162
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:19,518
there he did a hell of a job with the

4163
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,040
branding and the promotion but just as a

4164
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:22,478
general human being he's not somebody

4165
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:25,439
that i would associate with or would

4166
02:17:22,478 --> 02:17:28,318
ever want to be associated with

4167
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:31,200
unfortunately it's a common sentiment we

4168
02:17:28,318 --> 02:17:32,959
hear in general when people

4169
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:35,679
have this type of thing happen to them

4170
02:17:32,959 --> 02:17:37,358
but i guess on the more above board side

4171
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:38,719
of things we see and you mentioned

4172
02:17:37,359 --> 02:17:41,599
earlier that you've been collaborating

4173
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:43,598
with grow low-key in a few projects

4174
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:46,079
do you plan to do more collabs with them

4175
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:48,239
going forward and do you see collabs

4176
02:17:46,079 --> 02:17:50,478
becoming like a more popular option in

4177
02:17:48,239 --> 02:17:53,039
the industry going forward

4178
02:17:50,478 --> 02:17:55,039
i do i i could see people working

4179
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:57,120
together more collaboratively

4180
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:58,880
we do intend to do another project

4181
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:00,880
together so right now i think we're just

4182
02:17:58,879 --> 02:18:02,718
kind of in the planning phase like i

4183
02:18:00,879 --> 02:18:04,478
said if he finds something in this

4184
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:06,478
recent hunter i find something that may

4185
02:18:04,478 --> 02:18:08,398
be the direction we go down

4186
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:10,478
we've shared cuts back and forth so

4187
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:12,079
there are some potential lines in there

4188
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:13,599
and then i also have a huge you know

4189
02:18:12,079 --> 02:18:15,840
collection of my own that i could pull

4190
02:18:13,599 --> 02:18:17,760
from if i was interested so yeah we we

4191
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,200
definitely plan on working together um

4192
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:21,120
he's another one of those guys he's just

4193
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,719
a stand-up person somebody that i'm

4194
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,519
happy to work with and be associated

4195
02:18:22,718 --> 02:18:25,199
with

4196
02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:26,559
and you know he shared that tricks with

4197
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:28,719
me that's a plant that he hasn't given

4198
02:18:26,558 --> 02:18:30,638
to anybody else so it took you know took

4199
02:18:28,718 --> 02:18:32,079
a lot of trust in him to give me that

4200
02:18:30,638 --> 02:18:33,759
and to share it with me and to trust

4201
02:18:32,079 --> 02:18:35,280
that i wouldn't put it out there you

4202
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:36,960
know without without without his

4203
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:38,319
approval basically

4204
02:18:36,959 --> 02:18:39,518
so i'm definitely looking forward and i

4205
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:41,039
do think that there is going to be a lot

4206
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:43,120
of more collaborative projects going

4207
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:44,479
forward um mostly because people are

4208
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:46,079
just becoming more comfortable with

4209
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:46,959
meeting people and kind of being out

4210
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:48,959
there

4211
02:18:46,959 --> 02:18:50,638
and so we're meeting people outside of

4212
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:52,478
our immediate circle than we would

4213
02:18:50,638 --> 02:18:54,239
otherwise associate with

4214
02:18:52,478 --> 02:18:56,718
and you know loki was somebody that i

4215
02:18:54,239 --> 02:18:59,280
met when i threw a farmer's market event

4216
02:18:56,718 --> 02:19:01,438
um we actually threw the first uh

4217
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:03,280
cannabis farmers market in sf

4218
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:04,398
and through a through a delivery service

4219
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:06,559
that i had

4220
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:08,478
and um he actually came out there he was

4221
02:19:06,558 --> 02:19:10,159
super humble he uh came and asked about

4222
02:19:08,478 --> 02:19:11,840
some balian flower that i had been

4223
02:19:10,159 --> 02:19:13,679
posting and growing

4224
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:14,719
and i told him we were sold out because

4225
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:17,200
we were

4226
02:19:14,718 --> 02:19:19,518
um and he didn't say anything he just

4227
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:21,200
walked away and then he came back with

4228
02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:22,800
my buddy straight flame

4229
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:24,319
and uh straight flame was like hey man

4230
02:19:22,799 --> 02:19:26,478
this is grow low key blah blah i'm like

4231
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:28,239
oh man he was much smaller still at that

4232
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:29,599
time but i said i said hey i said why

4233
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:31,119
didn't you say that you know why did you

4234
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:32,318
say you knew straight flame or whatever

4235
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:33,920
who you were

4236
02:19:32,318 --> 02:19:36,079
he just didn't want to say anything but

4237
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:37,840
i you know i had a stash of balian

4238
02:19:36,079 --> 02:19:39,120
flowers for all my friends and so i

4239
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:40,239
pulled out of there and gave him a bunch

4240
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:41,519
of stuff

4241
02:19:40,239 --> 02:19:43,760
um

4242
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:45,280
but yeah a good guy and just you know

4243
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:46,880
like like i said people are starting to

4244
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:48,000
come out meet more people i had a couple

4245
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:49,039
friends that didn't want to come to that

4246
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,719
event because they were pretty sure we

4247
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,760
were going to get raided

4248
02:19:50,719 --> 02:19:53,279
um

4249
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:54,559
so

4250
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:56,319
some people are definitely getting more

4251
02:19:54,559 --> 02:19:57,760
comfortable because since then a lot of

4252
02:19:56,318 --> 02:19:58,879
those events the farmers markets and the

4253
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:00,398
sessions and all that stuff have

4254
02:19:58,879 --> 02:20:02,799
definitely popped up

4255
02:20:00,398 --> 02:20:04,719
and so when you do a collab what's the

4256
02:20:02,799 --> 02:20:07,438
ideal collab set up for you like do you

4257
02:20:04,719 --> 02:20:09,438
like it when say each person brings one

4258
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:11,040
parent to the table or do you think it

4259
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:13,439
doesn't necessarily have to work like

4260
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:16,399
that is there a set kind of format you

4261
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:18,239
like or just whatever flows happens i

4262
02:20:16,398 --> 02:20:21,119
think i think kind of whatever whatever

4263
02:20:18,239 --> 02:20:23,760
happens i mean for me he had a really

4264
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:25,760
nice plant to contribute and i had kind

4265
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:27,280
of the stable that we could pollinate he

4266
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:29,600
also gave me a couple that we could

4267
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:30,960
pollinate from his collection so i feel

4268
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:33,920
like that was a really mutually

4269
02:20:30,959 --> 02:20:35,599
beneficial situation for both of us

4270
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:37,040
i got to pollinate some cuts that were

4271
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:38,159
in demand like the dubs garden peanut

4272
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,960
butter breath

4273
02:20:38,159 --> 02:20:41,039
and

4274
02:20:38,959 --> 02:20:43,759
obviously his tricks and whatnot

4275
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:45,359
and then you know he got access to a lot

4276
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:47,439
of my genetics which you know i had

4277
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:49,439
brought the gelato 41 and the biscotti

4278
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:50,880
um and what not to the table so that's

4279
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:52,398
you know one of the dev one of

4280
02:20:50,879 --> 02:20:54,159
definitely one of the positive sides of

4281
02:20:52,398 --> 02:20:56,079
just being who we are and where we're

4282
02:20:54,159 --> 02:20:57,680
from is just having access to all the

4283
02:20:56,079 --> 02:20:59,439
genetics whether it's the runts or the

4284
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:01,359
gelatos or this or that or the other

4285
02:20:59,439 --> 02:21:02,880
like we've always been some of the first

4286
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:05,680
people to have those

4287
02:21:02,879 --> 02:21:08,159
um so just being kind of first in space

4288
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:09,680
and then you know getting access to that

4289
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:10,799
and me being able to contribute some

4290
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:12,398
things and him being able to contribute

4291
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:14,318
from his side of the circle really

4292
02:21:12,398 --> 02:21:17,039
worked beneficially for both of us i

4293
02:21:14,318 --> 02:21:18,318
mean i have a project going with a

4294
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:19,840
friend of mine right now that i'm not

4295
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:21,920
going to get into too much but basically

4296
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:23,520
i sent him some pollen and you know he's

4297
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:25,200
going to pollinate something that's uh

4298
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:26,479
you know super in demand right now and

4299
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:28,560
so we'll see you know people are

4300
02:21:26,478 --> 02:21:29,760
interested or not interested regardless

4301
02:21:28,559 --> 02:21:31,920
you know we're always gonna we're always

4302
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:33,760
gonna keep doing what we like

4303
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:35,120
cool cool that that's interesting to

4304
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:37,120
hear so

4305
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:38,800
just to jump back to some things we were

4306
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:41,439
talking about before

4307
02:21:38,799 --> 02:21:42,799
you mentioned that you know like a seeds

4308
02:21:41,439 --> 02:21:44,000
that you've used some of their work

4309
02:21:42,799 --> 02:21:45,279
along with connoisseur let's talk about

4310
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,879
some of these older breeders who often

4311
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:49,359
don't get a good mention like

4312
02:21:46,879 --> 02:21:51,119
connoisseur is a good one because

4313
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:52,880
as far as i can see he's always done

4314
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:55,200
pretty good work but doesn't frequently

4315
02:21:52,879 --> 02:21:57,279
get a mention what was it that drew you

4316
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:58,720
to the grand doggie perps and what's

4317
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:00,319
your general opinion on connoisseur

4318
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:03,920
genetics

4319
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:05,680
so i love the chem d and the gdp

4320
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:08,318
um you can't you can't have lived in

4321
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:09,920
oakland and not appreciate purple and

4322
02:22:08,318 --> 02:22:12,159
then the chem you know i really

4323
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:15,280
appreciated the pairing i mean i i had

4324
02:22:12,159 --> 02:22:18,159
watched connoisseur ojd and them um

4325
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:20,880
working for a while with really just

4326
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:23,680
a nice collection of uk varieties um

4327
02:22:20,879 --> 02:22:25,839
like the church and what not out there

4328
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:26,720
and um also some of the stuff from the

4329
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:28,960
states

4330
02:22:26,719 --> 02:22:30,639
and it always just seemed like they were

4331
02:22:28,959 --> 02:22:32,000
doing in they had he had interesting

4332
02:22:30,639 --> 02:22:33,920
pairings that they were working and i

4333
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,680
know that him and true work together and

4334
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:37,600
they had a falling out which i'm sure

4335
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:39,280
you know true may or may not speak on

4336
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:40,079
when you speak to him

4337
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:41,200
um

4338
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:43,359
but i always thought that they did

4339
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:45,200
interesting work and you know especially

4340
02:22:43,359 --> 02:22:47,680
the perps and the chems and i think they

4341
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:48,960
were one of the first ones to do a forum

4342
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:50,079
cross it may have been true actually

4343
02:22:48,959 --> 02:22:51,679
that was one of the first ones to do

4344
02:22:50,079 --> 02:22:53,120
like a forum cross and actually publicly

4345
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:54,159
release it

4346
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:55,760
but

4347
02:22:54,159 --> 02:22:57,280
i liked a lot of that older work you

4348
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:59,680
know karma was somebody who did a lot of

4349
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:01,200
older work he's he's still managed to

4350
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:02,479
stay relevant and uh he's moving

4351
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:03,359
definitely and doing some things out

4352
02:23:02,478 --> 02:23:05,199
here

4353
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:07,200
and um

4354
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:09,120
got some of the older breeders that kind

4355
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:12,319
of you know are still out there ace and

4356
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:13,680
them um doing interesting work

4357
02:23:12,318 --> 02:23:15,920
and um

4358
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:19,520
most guys someone you know that he did

4359
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:21,280
some c99 work um years ago that was all

4360
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:23,600
really really solid old-time moonshine

4361
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:25,600
work um stuff like that

4362
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:27,680
that you know didn't really gain a lot

4363
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:29,120
of buzz but it was you know good flower

4364
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:31,920
i grew a bunch of that stuff and i

4365
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:34,240
enjoyed it um i feel like there was just

4366
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:36,239
there was more space back then to it's

4367
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:38,079
weird there's like more breeders now but

4368
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:40,159
they do there's less variety in my

4369
02:23:38,079 --> 02:23:43,439
opinion it's more people doing the same

4370
02:23:40,159 --> 02:23:45,119
[ __ ] and less people doing

4371
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:46,639
more unique work

4372
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:48,720
i feel like back then there were less

4373
02:23:46,639 --> 02:23:51,358
people but they were doing they were

4374
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:52,559
doing very very different work

4375
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:54,079
i mean there was always like the dutch

4376
02:23:52,559 --> 02:23:55,439
seed banks that kind of seemed like you

4377
02:23:54,079 --> 02:23:56,559
could just pick one and swap them for

4378
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:58,639
the other

4379
02:23:56,559 --> 02:24:00,159
um you know there was sag and martha

4380
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:02,398
they were doing different stuff back

4381
02:24:00,159 --> 02:24:03,359
then there was some peak 19 and a couple

4382
02:24:02,398 --> 02:24:04,719
other things from them that were

4383
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:06,079
interesting

4384
02:24:04,719 --> 02:24:08,000
but generally you know whether it was

4385
02:24:06,079 --> 02:24:09,920
scentsy or nirvana whoever it might be

4386
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,040
they were all kind on the same thing at

4387
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:13,280
that point

4388
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,560
um even greenhouse or whatever you know

4389
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:16,399
greenhouse had some interesting work

4390
02:24:14,559 --> 02:24:18,239
back then that people seemed to like i

4391
02:24:16,398 --> 02:24:20,079
didn't really grow much of it

4392
02:24:18,239 --> 02:24:22,559
um but yeah there was there was a lot of

4393
02:24:20,079 --> 02:24:24,478
just smaller kind of more underground

4394
02:24:22,559 --> 02:24:26,318
people that were doing it i mean even og

4395
02:24:24,478 --> 02:24:29,039
rascal was doing work back then people

4396
02:24:26,318 --> 02:24:30,079
forget that og rascal did work like that

4397
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:32,319
back then

4398
02:24:30,079 --> 02:24:33,760
he does he doesn't put seeds out now but

4399
02:24:32,318 --> 02:24:35,760
you know i've definitely i've run some

4400
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:37,439
of his work he did bubba blue moonshine

4401
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:39,439
and a couple other things

4402
02:24:37,439 --> 02:24:41,040
um that people just didn't see you know

4403
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:43,600
head and head was another one you know

4404
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:45,520
he had some mass super skunk sour d work

4405
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:48,159
um rez who i'm sure people have talked

4406
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:49,439
about before is another one um

4407
02:24:48,159 --> 02:24:51,200
you know whatever whatever with the

4408
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:53,359
situation and the whole story with him

4409
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:54,720
but you know though the work he was one

4410
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:56,159
of the first ones

4411
02:24:54,719 --> 02:24:57,760
you have to give credit you know he's

4412
02:24:56,159 --> 02:25:00,000
one of the first ones to put

4413
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:02,079
a sour type plant out in seed form for

4414
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,600
people and you could grow the seeds and

4415
02:25:02,079 --> 02:25:04,559
find something that was similar or

4416
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:06,640
better

4417
02:25:04,559 --> 02:25:10,000
you know i grew uh res

4418
02:25:06,639 --> 02:25:11,279
4d the chem 4 with the sour or 4sd come

4419
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,680
forward the sour

4420
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:15,040
that was phenomenal beautiful herb you

4421
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:16,960
know to this day that's something that

4422
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:18,000
actually uh profit wants to work on i

4423
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:21,519
gave him

4424
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:23,359
a pack of the chem sours that i still

4425
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:25,040
have that was another phenomenal

4426
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:28,079
combination that he made chem d with the

4427
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:29,359
sour inbred line that he was working

4428
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:32,398
so there's yeah there's definitely some

4429
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:33,760
older breeders uh swan song was one um

4430
02:25:32,398 --> 02:25:34,799
he was from the boards there was a lot

4431
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:36,398
of there's a lot of people that people

4432
02:25:34,799 --> 02:25:38,959
are never going to remember

4433
02:25:36,398 --> 02:25:40,398
and he did this limon um and a couple

4434
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:42,959
other ones and the limona is something

4435
02:25:40,398 --> 02:25:45,279
that i used in that as a zl it's a

4436
02:25:42,959 --> 02:25:47,039
double sour diesel [ __ ] trowel

4437
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,920
and it's you know it's work like that

4438
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:49,439
that

4439
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:50,960
if you weren't around if you didn't know

4440
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:52,479
about it if you didn't really want it

4441
02:25:50,959 --> 02:25:53,839
you were never going to see it it's not

4442
02:25:52,478 --> 02:25:55,358
something you could just go and just

4443
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:56,719
pick up anywhere you really had you

4444
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:58,720
really had to want it you really had to

4445
02:25:56,719 --> 02:25:59,599
look for it

4446
02:25:58,719 --> 02:26:01,438
yeah

4447
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:03,359
and i think some of the best gems are

4448
02:26:01,439 --> 02:26:05,359
like that and that brings us to the next

4449
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:07,920
question perfectly where you reference

4450
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:09,920
that you know you've used some of aces

4451
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:11,040
work in your own work

4452
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:13,600
would you

4453
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:15,280
in general kind of subscribe to the idea

4454
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:17,680
that with ace you know they're breeding

4455
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:20,319
with this really kind of untamed more

4456
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:21,920
kind of raw stock so it's inevitable

4457
02:26:20,318 --> 02:26:23,439
that you're probably gonna get some more

4458
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:25,760
kind of wild stuff you're gonna have to

4459
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:27,200
put in a bit more of a hunt would you

4460
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:28,880
agree with that sentiment or do you

4461
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:30,000
think it's it's just like most other

4462
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:31,839
packs you know you probably find a

4463
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,600
keeper in a pack of ten type of thing or

4464
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:35,359
is it a bit more involved

4465
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:37,120
i think it's a bit more involved it

4466
02:26:35,359 --> 02:26:39,280
depends which of their lines you work

4467
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:41,760
with they have some that are very very

4468
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:43,359
open very kind of wild and they have

4469
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:45,280
some that have been selected a little

4470
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:47,680
bit more with the mind of cultivating

4471
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:49,760
them indoors or at least you know in a

4472
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:52,000
semi greenhouse environment

4473
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:54,079
um i think the vietnam black tie was an

4474
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,639
example of that i had plants that went

4475
02:26:54,079 --> 02:26:58,079
you know 11 weeks 13 weeks 15 weeks

4476
02:26:56,639 --> 02:27:01,439
there was plants that just didn't want

4477
02:26:58,079 --> 02:27:04,159
to stop in there they were massive

4478
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:05,760
and but i managed to work it and select

4479
02:27:04,159 --> 02:27:08,398
an earlier flowering one and kind of

4480
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:10,000
tame it down but it takes some work and

4481
02:27:08,398 --> 02:27:11,760
that's not something that people want to

4482
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,600
hear nowadays they would rather have a

4483
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:16,398
candy rain situation

4484
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:19,760
than than to actually put the work in in

4485
02:27:16,398 --> 02:27:21,920
my opinion um they want it done for them

4486
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:23,920
most people most people do not have any

4487
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:26,159
interest in that but honestly that's

4488
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:28,079
where some of the most amazing

4489
02:27:26,159 --> 02:27:29,680
the most unique varieties are going to

4490
02:27:28,079 --> 02:27:31,520
be found i mean if you wanna really make

4491
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:33,280
something game-changing you're gonna

4492
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:34,399
have to come out of left field you're

4493
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,439
gonna have to come with something

4494
02:27:34,398 --> 02:27:36,959
different

4495
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:38,559
and

4496
02:27:36,959 --> 02:27:40,959
i just don't know you know that you're

4497
02:27:38,559 --> 02:27:43,439
gonna find that in you know crossing

4498
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:45,839
gelato with docido like i just i just

4499
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:47,520
don't see that happening i don't see

4500
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:48,478
how that would happen

4501
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:49,840
um

4502
02:27:48,478 --> 02:27:51,679
especially like i feel like a lot of the

4503
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:53,200
older genetics are fading out so if you

4504
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:55,200
really really want something different

4505
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:57,920
you do kind of have to pull for

4506
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:59,439
something from ace or and yeah i know

4507
02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:01,600
there's a lot of the people that have

4508
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:03,120
popped up over the last year or two um

4509
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:04,800
god i'm gonna probably butcher it but i

4510
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:06,880
think it's like the iranian like seed

4511
02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:09,679
exchange or something like that

4512
02:28:06,879 --> 02:28:11,719
um those guys are out there gathering

4513
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:15,120
wild seeds you know semi

4514
02:28:11,719 --> 02:28:17,279
semi-domesticated some wild you know

4515
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:19,120
but that's you know those are gems right

4516
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:20,800
there that's you know access to that

4517
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:22,880
work is really special and i know that

4518
02:28:20,799 --> 02:28:24,239
my my buddy from people under the stairs

4519
02:28:22,879 --> 02:28:25,279
chef rowe has worked with some of that

4520
02:28:24,239 --> 02:28:26,559
stuff

4521
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:28,319
and there's definitely other people out

4522
02:28:26,559 --> 02:28:30,478
there collecting it and growing it

4523
02:28:28,318 --> 02:28:32,000
because they they see the value you know

4524
02:28:30,478 --> 02:28:33,519
i think they'll always be those people

4525
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,359
that want they want to grow something

4526
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,760
different something unique but they're

4527
02:28:35,359 --> 02:28:39,840
not solely focused on cash cropping this

4528
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:41,680
is like this is a hobby for them

4529
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:43,359
it's not something that they're thinking

4530
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:44,880
oh you know i need to get to a light or

4531
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:47,120
three a light it needs to be purple i

4532
02:28:44,879 --> 02:28:49,358
need to be able to put inside a runs bag

4533
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:51,840
um they're not thinking like that

4534
02:28:49,359 --> 02:28:54,000
they're thinking you know about a unique

4535
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:55,600
experience and that's what you'll find

4536
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,280
in the ace gear you'll find something

4537
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:58,318
different you might not find anything

4538
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:00,560
good at all

4539
02:28:58,318 --> 02:29:01,680
but if you find something nice

4540
02:29:00,559 --> 02:29:03,439
you're going to find something really

4541
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:05,200
nice i mean i'm stoked to have grown a

4542
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:06,479
bunch of those i don't think that

4543
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:07,920
there's a lot of people that could ever

4544
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:08,719
say that they have grown a plant like

4545
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:10,318
that

4546
02:29:08,719 --> 02:29:11,599
and i got to grow it and share it with

4547
02:29:10,318 --> 02:29:13,439
my friends and show them something

4548
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,120
really really unique you know and i'm

4549
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:17,439
grateful to have had the opportunity to

4550
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:18,560
do that to not be under this pressure i

4551
02:29:17,439 --> 02:29:20,239
mean i think about these commercial

4552
02:29:18,559 --> 02:29:23,760
facilities nowadays

4553
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:25,359
the main ask is you know 20 thc x number

4554
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:27,359
of grams per square foot you know this

4555
02:29:25,359 --> 02:29:28,800
number of days of flowering plants get

4556
02:29:27,359 --> 02:29:31,520
harvested when they're expected to be

4557
02:29:28,799 --> 02:29:34,318
harvested on a schedule not not when

4558
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:36,079
they're ready not not when they're ripe

4559
02:29:34,318 --> 02:29:37,119
you know then they got to be tested then

4560
02:29:36,079 --> 02:29:39,760
they got you know they got to get

4561
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:41,439
packaged i mean they get touched so many

4562
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:43,920
times along the way that by the time you

4563
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:45,840
get it it's basically been abused

4564
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:47,280
um you know the the times of actually

4565
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:49,680
being able to go somewhere and you know

4566
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:51,520
chop a branch off of a line and put it

4567
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:53,760
into a jar for yourself

4568
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:55,200
you know it's those days are mostly gone

4569
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,478
for people like most people will never

4570
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:58,240
know what that's like most people have

4571
02:29:56,478 --> 02:29:59,519
never seen flower like that so how could

4572
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:01,039
they appreciate

4573
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:03,680
you know what really makes a special

4574
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:06,000
flower special

4575
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:07,520
yeah of course

4576
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,520
just to kind of

4577
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:11,920
talk about a different older kind of

4578
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:13,760
variety i noticed that you had worked

4579
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:15,600
with the super silver haze and that

4580
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:18,239
you'd done some crosses with it are

4581
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:20,399
there any other kind of older strains

4582
02:30:18,239 --> 02:30:23,039
from these years gone by that you would

4583
02:30:20,398 --> 02:30:24,639
like to work with and also what was the

4584
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:26,319
cutting of super silver haze that you

4585
02:30:24,639 --> 02:30:29,039
ended up using was it one of the more

4586
02:30:26,318 --> 02:30:31,760
known ones or just one you'd found

4587
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:34,240
no it's it's the known cut it's it's

4588
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:36,880
like the multiple cup winning cut that's

4589
02:30:34,239 --> 02:30:39,920
a cut that we've had for a long time

4590
02:30:36,879 --> 02:30:41,839
um i love it it's it's a way to one that

4591
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:43,280
uh kind of has a

4592
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:44,478
i don't know a lot of people in our

4593
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:45,840
circle they don't really care for it

4594
02:30:44,478 --> 02:30:49,599
they don't really appreciate it but i

4595
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:51,359
love it and our buddy wades who uh you

4596
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:53,439
know grew it for a long time as well and

4597
02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:56,000
won a couple cups with it he

4598
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:57,520
he loves it we love it um people down in

4599
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,520
la that get it through our friends

4600
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:00,479
delivery service they love it

4601
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:02,319
um

4602
02:31:00,478 --> 02:31:03,679
it's a beautiful beautiful cut you know

4603
02:31:02,318 --> 02:31:05,920
i've tried i tried to hunt some super

4604
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:08,079
silver haze from like more recent stock

4605
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:09,680
and i didn't find anything worth

4606
02:31:08,079 --> 02:31:11,680
anything in there

4607
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:13,200
so i always revert back to that to that

4608
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:15,520
specific plant

4609
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:18,240
as far as like um

4610
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:20,159
newer or older varieties as well that

4611
02:31:18,239 --> 02:31:22,398
i'd be interested in working in

4612
02:31:20,159 --> 02:31:24,559
i'd say i've mostly what i have access

4613
02:31:22,398 --> 02:31:27,680
to i've worked with if i could get

4614
02:31:24,559 --> 02:31:30,159
anything back that reminds me of you

4615
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:32,000
know something different it would be

4616
02:31:30,159 --> 02:31:34,318
there was a plant called lavender and

4617
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,559
it's not the soma lavender it's it was a

4618
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:39,680
bay area cut it might have come out of

4619
02:31:36,559 --> 02:31:42,879
norcal i think it probably did

4620
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:46,880
and um mad farmer actually works with it

4621
02:31:42,879 --> 02:31:49,119
a lot and the and the urkel and um i to

4622
02:31:46,879 --> 02:31:52,559
be honest like i've wanted to buy some

4623
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:54,720
of those crosses but me being me i just

4624
02:31:52,559 --> 02:31:57,039
want i actually just want the cut

4625
02:31:54,719 --> 02:31:58,719
or s1s of the cut so that i could work

4626
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:01,840
with it in the way that i want and not

4627
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:01,840
have it as diluted

4628
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:04,719
that's a plant that i would actually

4629
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:06,159
probably like to work with that's one of

4630
02:32:04,719 --> 02:32:08,478
the first ones that i actually started

4631
02:32:06,159 --> 02:32:10,719
with in the bay area when i when i got

4632
02:32:08,478 --> 02:32:13,920
that cut

4633
02:32:10,719 --> 02:32:14,719
beautiful plant great profile perfumey

4634
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:15,920
like

4635
02:32:14,719 --> 02:32:18,799
resinous

4636
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:20,719
great full relaxing high to it

4637
02:32:18,799 --> 02:32:22,719
just a really really beautiful plant and

4638
02:32:20,719 --> 02:32:24,959
that's probably one that i would like as

4639
02:32:22,719 --> 02:32:27,438
far as any of the older cuts i would say

4640
02:32:24,959 --> 02:32:29,599
the romulan if it existed would be

4641
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:31,840
something that i would be interested in

4642
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:33,439
um the train wreck is one that i've

4643
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:34,799
always liked that i know that a lot of

4644
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:38,800
my friends are gonna listen to that and

4645
02:32:34,799 --> 02:32:41,920
just shake their heads but i like it and

4646
02:32:38,799 --> 02:32:43,599
you know i got to the bay after the

4647
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:46,000
train wreck had already kind of blown

4648
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:47,680
through and so i never really got tired

4649
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,079
of it because i never really had it to

4650
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:51,600
that level the j1 would probably be one

4651
02:32:50,079 --> 02:32:52,959
of those as well

4652
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:54,559
i would say the super silver haze is

4653
02:32:52,959 --> 02:32:56,398
probably the oldest cut though out of

4654
02:32:54,559 --> 02:32:57,680
all those cuts

4655
02:32:56,398 --> 02:32:59,680
before that

4656
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:01,200
not there's not really much else that i

4657
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:03,200
can think of that i would actually be

4658
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:05,120
interested in i mean i know we've worked

4659
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:07,359
with some interesting stuff

4660
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:08,960
the haze like the piff

4661
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:10,079
is one that some friends of mine have

4662
02:33:08,959 --> 02:33:11,519
worked with

4663
02:33:10,079 --> 02:33:13,280
that's one that i would probably be

4664
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:15,120
interested in as well

4665
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:17,120
just because i would honestly like to

4666
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,040
see s-ones of it to run through to see

4667
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:21,680
what we find i think it would be a freak

4668
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:24,000
of a hunt um

4669
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:25,600
and then beyond that i mean i know some

4670
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,879
friends of mine have talked about the hp

4671
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:28,640
13

4672
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:31,279
and that's one i actually just saw some

4673
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:33,039
flowers of that was very interesting

4674
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:35,840
very unique

4675
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:37,439
different you know there was a sage cut

4676
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:39,040
by escobar

4677
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:40,960
that my friends have grown for a while

4678
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:42,800
that's a pretty interesting one it's not

4679
02:33:40,959 --> 02:33:44,398
the sage from th seeds it's something

4680
02:33:42,799 --> 02:33:45,679
else

4681
02:33:44,398 --> 02:33:47,599
so that's a pretty that's a pretty

4682
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:50,318
unique one i mean those are really the

4683
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:52,479
ones that i seek out for my personal

4684
02:33:50,318 --> 02:33:53,680
kind of garden for the stuff that i want

4685
02:33:52,478 --> 02:33:55,358
to do

4686
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:56,720
because really like you know like you

4687
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:58,720
said or like i was saying it's like how

4688
02:33:56,719 --> 02:34:01,119
many gelatos and dosi dos and sherbs can

4689
02:33:58,719 --> 02:34:02,559
we mix together at some point at some

4690
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:03,439
point it's just like

4691
02:34:02,559 --> 02:34:04,719
really like if that's what you're

4692
02:34:03,439 --> 02:34:07,120
looking for here we have this and it's

4693
02:34:04,719 --> 02:34:10,318
basically the same thing

4694
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:12,640
yeah yeah i agree completely

4695
02:34:10,318 --> 02:34:15,840
so when you think about starting a new

4696
02:34:12,639 --> 02:34:17,920
project is it all kind of based on feel

4697
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:19,600
or do you really kind of think about it

4698
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:21,040
and if you do kind of put a bit more

4699
02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:23,200
thought and maybe

4700
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:24,920
um kind of writing down your ideas and

4701
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:27,359
whatnot what are what are sort of the

4702
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:29,040
considerations that come into play when

4703
02:34:27,359 --> 02:34:31,520
you are thinking about starting a new

4704
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:33,840
project

4705
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:36,159
so mostly i think about

4706
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:38,799
what what the intention is what the goal

4707
02:34:36,159 --> 02:34:41,280
is and if if like i'll give an example

4708
02:34:38,799 --> 02:34:43,358
is that like we have an orange sherb cut

4709
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:45,920
that loki found it's phenomenal

4710
02:34:43,359 --> 02:34:49,040
beautiful flower but i don't want to do

4711
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:52,079
a whole line based on an orange profile

4712
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:53,680
so i won't pick that plant as the basis

4713
02:34:52,079 --> 02:34:55,840
for the project

4714
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:58,239
i think about really like

4715
02:34:55,840 --> 02:35:00,559
what what kind of gaps can we fill in

4716
02:34:58,239 --> 02:35:01,760
that haven't been filled in before

4717
02:35:00,559 --> 02:35:03,600
and

4718
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:05,439
it makes me think about that's why i

4719
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:07,359
think a lot about those exotic pairings

4720
02:35:05,439 --> 02:35:09,359
because

4721
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:12,720
to just take like you know let's say we

4722
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:14,720
take this this gelato 41 trix and i hit

4723
02:35:12,719 --> 02:35:16,239
it to the gelato 33 and i hit it to the

4724
02:35:14,719 --> 02:35:18,398
run so i hit it to the apple fritter or

4725
02:35:16,239 --> 02:35:20,799
whatever it might be

4726
02:35:18,398 --> 02:35:22,478
what am i really actually doing

4727
02:35:20,799 --> 02:35:24,239
but for me

4728
02:35:22,478 --> 02:35:25,840
that's how i feel and i know i've had

4729
02:35:24,239 --> 02:35:27,439
conversations with some of my friends

4730
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:28,639
and they say well you know that's what

4731
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:31,359
people want

4732
02:35:28,639 --> 02:35:33,119
they want to see you know the mac or the

4733
02:35:31,359 --> 02:35:35,040
wedding cake or the sherb or whatever

4734
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:37,040
they want they want to know both sides

4735
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,920
when they see it

4736
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:39,359
me

4737
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:40,879
i don't think about that as much

4738
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:42,720
although if i'm doing a collab with

4739
02:35:40,879 --> 02:35:45,119
someone i do need to consider that

4740
02:35:42,719 --> 02:35:47,679
because that may be how they feel

4741
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:49,439
and so i'll be inclined to do a couple

4742
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:50,639
for them the way that they would want

4743
02:35:49,439 --> 02:35:52,800
them to do which may be more

4744
02:35:50,639 --> 02:35:53,680
commercially minded and i'll do a couple

4745
02:35:52,799 --> 02:35:55,358
for me

4746
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:57,200
that i think are actually going to be

4747
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:58,960
more unique and a perfect example of

4748
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:02,159
that is i did the green crack with the

4749
02:35:58,959 --> 02:36:02,959
gb6 tricks and people had no interest in

4750
02:36:02,159 --> 02:36:04,799
it

4751
02:36:02,959 --> 02:36:07,438
but i kept telling people like this is

4752
02:36:04,799 --> 02:36:09,279
going to be a phenomenal pairing and a

4753
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:11,359
friend of mine is growing them now and

4754
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:13,760
they're ridiculous and the same thing

4755
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:16,640
with the lucy and the gb6 tricks

4756
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:19,120
99 of people have no interest care not

4757
02:36:16,639 --> 02:36:20,478
about the lucy at all if anything like

4758
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:21,840
kind of like you may have thought when

4759
02:36:20,478 --> 02:36:23,039
they see the butterscotch they think oh

4760
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:24,318
is that from cannerado and they're my

4761
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:26,080
god that might be interesting it's from

4762
02:36:24,318 --> 02:36:27,199
canorado

4763
02:36:26,079 --> 02:36:29,520
when you tell them it's a butterscotch

4764
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:30,880
hawaiian and is you know from reefer man

4765
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:32,560
and made by some guy named poor white

4766
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:34,318
farmer all of that is

4767
02:36:32,559 --> 02:36:36,079
just noise to them they're not hearing

4768
02:36:34,318 --> 02:36:37,840
anything that they there's nothing that

4769
02:36:36,079 --> 02:36:39,680
sounds good to them there

4770
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:41,760
and it's unfortunate because you know

4771
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:44,239
out of a lot of these plants like the

4772
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:46,639
lucy tricks the super silver haze tricks

4773
02:36:44,239 --> 02:36:49,760
the burma tricks the green crack tricks

4774
02:36:46,639 --> 02:36:53,358
these older kind of you know

4775
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:55,600
pre 2010 whatever varieties that were

4776
02:36:53,359 --> 02:36:57,439
created by people with not a mind

4777
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:58,720
towards commercial production

4778
02:36:57,439 --> 02:37:00,239
um

4779
02:36:58,719 --> 02:37:01,438
those are some those are some phenomenal

4780
02:37:00,239 --> 02:37:03,119
plants

4781
02:37:01,439 --> 02:37:04,800
you know they're like the pairing is

4782
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:06,880
going to be really really unique so i

4783
02:37:04,799 --> 02:37:08,959
think when when i when i do something i

4784
02:37:06,879 --> 02:37:10,799
think like what am i doing

4785
02:37:08,959 --> 02:37:12,639
why am i doing it and is it just

4786
02:37:10,799 --> 02:37:14,639
repeating the same thing if i'm just

4787
02:37:12,639 --> 02:37:16,879
going to repeat the same thing then like

4788
02:37:14,639 --> 02:37:19,279
what is the point of it just make more

4789
02:37:16,879 --> 02:37:20,239
of the same to do that i'll just make s

4790
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:21,760
ones

4791
02:37:20,239 --> 02:37:23,840
i mean if people really want that then

4792
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:25,439
just take gelato 41 and just make s ones

4793
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:28,079
and take a lot of 33 and just make s

4794
02:37:25,439 --> 02:37:31,040
ones just do all s ones you know just

4795
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:33,840
stop reading at all just make s ones

4796
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:34,640
and if that's kind of your thing do that

4797
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:36,398
but

4798
02:37:34,639 --> 02:37:37,920
that's not my thing i want to make

4799
02:37:36,398 --> 02:37:40,959
something that i'm actually interested

4800
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:43,040
in growing like i'm excited you know to

4801
02:37:40,959 --> 02:37:45,438
i'm excited when i see

4802
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:48,319
like i've seen the lucy tricks and it

4803
02:37:45,439 --> 02:37:51,760
has the same butterscotch profile as the

4804
02:37:48,318 --> 02:37:53,119
lucy but way better structure way better

4805
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:54,880
bag appeal

4806
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:56,479
much improved yield

4807
02:37:54,879 --> 02:37:58,398
like

4808
02:37:56,478 --> 02:38:01,119
beautiful beautiful but it has a

4809
02:37:58,398 --> 02:38:02,478
distinct profile and my feeling is that

4810
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:03,760
because this is being grown by a wreck

4811
02:38:02,478 --> 02:38:05,760
facility

4812
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:07,840
when it hits the market

4813
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:10,000
people will not have seen something like

4814
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:12,079
that and that stokes me

4815
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:14,239
whereas like yes people will buy you

4816
02:38:12,079 --> 02:38:15,200
know gelato 41 tricks if we sold it to

4817
02:38:14,239 --> 02:38:17,359
them

4818
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:19,040
but they might not buy lucy tricks

4819
02:38:17,359 --> 02:38:20,640
but i think that if you can get them to

4820
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:22,319
try that flower if you can get them to

4821
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:23,119
try that concentrate

4822
02:38:22,318 --> 02:38:25,119
like

4823
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:26,720
it will become something that they seek

4824
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:28,880
out because like you were talking about

4825
02:38:26,719 --> 02:38:30,398
the craft stuff it's unique and there's

4826
02:38:28,879 --> 02:38:33,039
no denying something that's different

4827
02:38:30,398 --> 02:38:35,519
from everything else it stands apart for

4828
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:37,040
better for worse it stands out

4829
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:39,120
so i think yeah when i when i do a

4830
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:41,280
project i think a lot about

4831
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:43,359
kind of just filling in the gaps and

4832
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:45,040
kind of moving in a direction that other

4833
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:46,399
people aren't moving in no i don't

4834
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:47,359
really honestly think about a lot of

4835
02:38:46,398 --> 02:38:49,199
people i don't really think about what

4836
02:38:47,359 --> 02:38:51,760
other people are doing at all

4837
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:53,040
i mean i should consider probably what

4838
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:55,120
the market wants but at the end of the

4839
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:56,720
day what i have found is that there's

4840
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:58,399
enough people that are passionate about

4841
02:38:56,719 --> 02:39:01,119
the work that i'm doing

4842
02:38:58,398 --> 02:39:03,119
that i don't need to consider

4843
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:04,720
the people who don't want it

4844
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:06,720
you know and if and like i said if i'm

4845
02:39:04,719 --> 02:39:09,760
doing a collab and they want me to do

4846
02:39:06,719 --> 02:39:11,119
you know for gelato 41 or runts or apple

4847
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:13,120
fritter or something to involve those

4848
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:14,479
varieties in there we can do that

4849
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:16,640
but at the same time i'm going to go and

4850
02:39:14,478 --> 02:39:18,559
do my weird thing and across this burma

4851
02:39:16,639 --> 02:39:19,840
that nobody cares about except for maybe

4852
02:39:18,559 --> 02:39:21,439
three people

4853
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:23,120
and

4854
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:24,639
it's fine because it's what makes me

4855
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:26,399
happy it's the seeds that i'm most

4856
02:39:24,639 --> 02:39:28,478
excited about when i see a bunch of you

4857
02:39:26,398 --> 02:39:30,398
know gelato 41 seeds and whatever in my

4858
02:39:28,478 --> 02:39:31,840
fridge it's like

4859
02:39:30,398 --> 02:39:32,959
it doesn't really do anything for me i

4860
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:35,200
know they're going to be phenomenal i

4861
02:39:32,959 --> 02:39:36,239
know they're going to photograph well um

4862
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:38,159
you know i know it's going to look

4863
02:39:36,239 --> 02:39:39,359
really good i know it's going to smoke

4864
02:39:38,159 --> 02:39:40,559
good and it's going to have good flavor

4865
02:39:39,359 --> 02:39:42,000
i know it's going to you know it's going

4866
02:39:40,559 --> 02:39:42,879
to make people happy

4867
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,079
but

4868
02:39:42,879 --> 02:39:45,358
there's a lot of other things you know

4869
02:39:44,079 --> 02:39:47,039
they could they could grow jelly breath

4870
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:49,600
or dosey lotto or whatever and it would

4871
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:52,399
probably do the same thing for them

4872
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:54,960
yeah i get the sentiment but uh i

4873
02:39:52,398 --> 02:39:56,959
certainly feel like you know man after

4874
02:39:54,959 --> 02:39:58,239
my own heart in terms of you know do

4875
02:39:56,959 --> 02:40:00,879
your own thing and just make the weird

4876
02:39:58,239 --> 02:40:03,439
crosses that you like i love that so

4877
02:40:00,879 --> 02:40:05,358
the next question i would have is i've

4878
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:07,760
noticed that you've done a few crosses

4879
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:09,680
using exotic mike's work where do you

4880
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:12,559
rate that because i noticed that you

4881
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:14,720
know exotic mike gets a lot of

4882
02:40:12,559 --> 02:40:17,519
praise from a lot of people but i've

4883
02:40:14,719 --> 02:40:19,358
also had a lot of friends like people i

4884
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:21,920
know in real life i've seen it myself

4885
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:24,000
they grow the gear out and there's a

4886
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:25,600
surprisingly large amount of hermes in

4887
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:27,840
the gear you know i'm probably going to

4888
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:30,000
cop some heat for that but

4889
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:32,079
you know where do you find his work is

4890
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:34,318
this just an acceptable risk when you're

4891
02:40:32,079 --> 02:40:36,000
growing out these types of genetics and

4892
02:40:34,318 --> 02:40:37,680
where do you rate exotic genetics in

4893
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:40,639
general

4894
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:43,520
yeah so from from mike i've used the

4895
02:40:40,639 --> 02:40:45,278
cooking cream cut um which is you know

4896
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:48,079
that cup winning cut

4897
02:40:45,279 --> 02:40:50,319
and so i've used that one it's a hash

4898
02:40:48,079 --> 02:40:53,039
monster people love that there's been a

4899
02:40:50,318 --> 02:40:53,920
lot of requests lately from people

4900
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:56,240
for

4901
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:58,159
four plants that will wash well and

4902
02:40:56,239 --> 02:40:59,680
everybody knows that that plant washes

4903
02:40:58,159 --> 02:41:01,760
really well

4904
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:04,159
so i know that if we cross it you know

4905
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:06,639
the result will be just that

4906
02:41:04,159 --> 02:41:08,879
um as far as like kind of where i rate

4907
02:41:06,639 --> 02:41:11,358
mike and mike's work one i've met mike

4908
02:41:08,879 --> 02:41:13,599
i've spent time with mike um mike is a

4909
02:41:11,359 --> 02:41:16,479
really really solid person it's like

4910
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:18,720
super humble really really good guy

4911
02:41:16,478 --> 02:41:20,000
and you know you're not going to please

4912
02:41:18,719 --> 02:41:22,159
everyone

4913
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,760
in terms of there being some intersex

4914
02:41:22,159 --> 02:41:26,159
expression in the work

4915
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:27,600
i'm not surprised he works with a lot of

4916
02:41:26,159 --> 02:41:29,520
different plants there's a lot of cookie

4917
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:31,359
stuff in there

4918
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:33,279
even some of the sherb stuff and whatnot

4919
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:34,399
is in there and he does a lot of male

4920
02:41:33,279 --> 02:41:36,239
female

4921
02:41:34,398 --> 02:41:37,519
regular stuff i think he's about to drop

4922
02:41:36,239 --> 02:41:38,719
a feminized line which would be his

4923
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:40,640
first one

4924
02:41:38,719 --> 02:41:42,398
and so i think that you know from doing

4925
02:41:40,639 --> 02:41:44,799
that standard male female you run the

4926
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:45,840
risk of of seeing some of that intersex

4927
02:41:44,799 --> 02:41:47,438
expression

4928
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:49,920
i do know though that that there's

4929
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:51,359
people that are like super fanatical

4930
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:53,680
about his work

4931
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:55,920
um he's got a lot of people that find

4932
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:58,398
gear in there that they just love and it

4933
02:41:55,920 --> 02:42:00,879
may just be that that they find you know

4934
02:41:58,398 --> 02:42:02,159
some intersex expression but they find

4935
02:42:00,879 --> 02:42:04,079
some cuttings that they're like yeah

4936
02:42:02,159 --> 02:42:05,039
this one will work and then they run

4937
02:42:04,079 --> 02:42:06,478
with it

4938
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:08,560
um

4939
02:42:06,478 --> 02:42:10,079
in that regard i think it's fine mike

4940
02:42:08,559 --> 02:42:12,239
charges what i consider to be a

4941
02:42:10,079 --> 02:42:13,359
reasonable price for his seeds so if

4942
02:42:12,239 --> 02:42:14,559
you're going to find some intersex

4943
02:42:13,359 --> 02:42:16,720
expressions i don't think it's the end

4944
02:42:14,559 --> 02:42:19,119
of the world because the prices he keeps

4945
02:42:16,719 --> 02:42:20,639
the prices very very reasonable

4946
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:22,720
if you charge a ton of money and the

4947
02:42:20,639 --> 02:42:23,920
work is unstable i think that's kind of

4948
02:42:22,719 --> 02:42:25,278
where like i would draw the line

4949
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:28,960
personally

4950
02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:30,319
and i also know that you know he's um

4951
02:42:28,959 --> 02:42:31,358
he's definitely willing to like work

4952
02:42:30,318 --> 02:42:32,799
with people i think if people have

4953
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:34,239
issues and whatnot i don't think he has

4954
02:42:32,799 --> 02:42:36,799
any issue replacing it or being

4955
02:42:34,239 --> 02:42:39,520
communicative like if he's had problems

4956
02:42:36,799 --> 02:42:42,159
with certain lines which i don't know

4957
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:43,600
that he has had a huge number of issues

4958
02:42:42,159 --> 02:42:44,959
like as far as like with like the

4959
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:46,399
cookies guys where they just had to like

4960
02:42:44,959 --> 02:42:47,839
disappear and some other people that

4961
02:42:46,398 --> 02:42:48,719
whatever i don't feel like naming right

4962
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:50,239
now

4963
02:42:48,719 --> 02:42:52,799
where they kind of just disappeared for

4964
02:42:50,239 --> 02:42:55,520
a while and pop back up with a new line

4965
02:42:52,799 --> 02:42:57,199
so i re i rate mike pretty well and most

4966
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:59,920
mostly because just i've spent time with

4967
02:42:57,200 --> 02:43:01,680
him and he could have a huge ego and he

4968
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:02,478
could kind of be an [ __ ] if he wanted

4969
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:03,760
to be

4970
02:43:02,478 --> 02:43:05,119
but he's not

4971
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:06,239
he's like he's one of the most decent

4972
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:08,399
people you're going to meet in this

4973
02:43:06,239 --> 02:43:10,318
business so that goes a long way with

4974
02:43:08,398 --> 02:43:11,760
with me like i said i think he's pretty

4975
02:43:10,318 --> 02:43:13,760
transparent with people about the work

4976
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:16,079
that he's doing

4977
02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:18,398
so can we expect to see you working with

4978
02:43:16,079 --> 02:43:20,478
any seed banks going forward and if so

4979
02:43:18,398 --> 02:43:21,920
which ones like what would be important

4980
02:43:20,478 --> 02:43:24,478
to you about if you're going to be

4981
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:26,318
dealing with a seed bank how would you

4982
02:43:24,478 --> 02:43:28,318
want to go about establishing that type

4983
02:43:26,318 --> 02:43:30,159
of relationship

4984
02:43:28,318 --> 02:43:32,079
yeah that's i mean that's tricky to be

4985
02:43:30,159 --> 02:43:34,959
honest i don't really know

4986
02:43:32,079 --> 02:43:38,079
that that's what i want to do

4987
02:43:34,959 --> 02:43:40,478
i've worked with one seed bank before in

4988
02:43:38,079 --> 02:43:42,639
a limited capacity it's not really

4989
02:43:40,478 --> 02:43:44,879
something that's like kind of front and

4990
02:43:42,639 --> 02:43:46,239
center for me

4991
02:43:44,879 --> 02:43:47,679
i have enough people that are like

4992
02:43:46,239 --> 02:43:49,359
interested in my work that i don't

4993
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:51,680
really need to do that

4994
02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:53,279
and i kind of am cultivating a different

4995
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:55,840
type of model

4996
02:43:53,279 --> 02:43:57,600
than other breeders like i'm not really

4997
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:59,279
looking to sell

4998
02:43:57,600 --> 02:44:00,720
on a smaller scale

4999
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:02,239
to just like you know all these

5000
02:44:00,719 --> 02:44:04,079
different people and i mean that's that

5001
02:44:02,239 --> 02:44:05,439
is what the seed banks do i do get

5002
02:44:04,079 --> 02:44:08,318
requests from people to list with

5003
02:44:05,439 --> 02:44:10,079
certain seed banks but

5004
02:44:08,318 --> 02:44:11,278
there there's some good ones and i've

5005
02:44:10,079 --> 02:44:13,200
you know i've seen some people that have

5006
02:44:11,279 --> 02:44:15,680
worked with some of them before but it's

5007
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:18,159
not really something that i'm really

5008
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:19,600
actively kind of seeking out obviously

5009
02:44:18,159 --> 02:44:21,359
the biggest things to me would be just

5010
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:22,960
that it they'd be stand up that they'd

5011
02:44:21,359 --> 02:44:25,200
be trustworthy and they provide good

5012
02:44:22,959 --> 02:44:26,959
customer service i mean the last thing

5013
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:28,560
you want is someone having a problem

5014
02:44:26,959 --> 02:44:30,478
with them that that affects poor it

5015
02:44:28,559 --> 02:44:32,318
reflects poorly on you for working with

5016
02:44:30,478 --> 02:44:33,920
them and i'm sure you've seen you know

5017
02:44:32,318 --> 02:44:36,000
there have been some some fly-by-night

5018
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:38,159
seed banks or

5019
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:40,079
questionable practices with some of them

5020
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:42,478
you know in in all kinds of ways whether

5021
02:44:40,079 --> 02:44:44,318
it's paying vendors or you know not not

5022
02:44:42,478 --> 02:44:46,639
delivering the appropriate seeds or you

5023
02:44:44,318 --> 02:44:47,920
know tampering with the seed packs or

5024
02:44:46,639 --> 02:44:50,000
all kinds of things that have happened

5025
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:51,200
out there over the years so there you

5026
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,398
know there's some seed banks that

5027
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:54,399
friends of mine have had good

5028
02:44:52,398 --> 02:44:55,599
relationships with um i know my buddy

5029
02:44:54,398 --> 02:44:57,680
unknown profit has had a good

5030
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:59,439
relationship with seeds here now i know

5031
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:01,040
my buddy green team has also had a good

5032
02:44:59,439 --> 02:45:03,359
relationship with them

5033
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:05,439
so you know that's somebody that if it

5034
02:45:03,359 --> 02:45:08,079
lined out it would make sense but

5035
02:45:05,439 --> 02:45:10,318
i'm not sure that you know the work that

5036
02:45:08,079 --> 02:45:12,639
i do necessarily has kind of the

5037
02:45:10,318 --> 02:45:15,199
commercial profile that they might want

5038
02:45:12,639 --> 02:45:17,039
and as far as like promoting i don't

5039
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:18,800
really do a lot of promoting i just kind

5040
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:19,840
of post what i like and

5041
02:45:18,799 --> 02:45:20,799
you know

5042
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:22,239
i just

5043
02:45:20,799 --> 02:45:23,920
i'm i don't really know that i would be

5044
02:45:22,239 --> 02:45:26,318
a good partner honestly for someone

5045
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:28,639
because i don't really care to promote a

5046
02:45:26,318 --> 02:45:30,639
whole lot if you look at my instagram

5047
02:45:28,639 --> 02:45:32,719
it's really just it's just me just

5048
02:45:30,639 --> 02:45:34,079
sharing flower and kind of thoughts on

5049
02:45:32,719 --> 02:45:35,199
things that i like

5050
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:37,039
and

5051
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:38,479
mostly work that we've been doing or you

5052
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:39,600
know promoting some of my friends in

5053
02:45:38,478 --> 02:45:42,318
their work

5054
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:44,000
and you know just really kind of taking

5055
02:45:42,318 --> 02:45:46,559
what we had on the forum and just

5056
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:47,920
putting it on instagram not really

5057
02:45:46,559 --> 02:45:49,600
trying to

5058
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:51,200
you know create a whole thing beyond

5059
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:52,880
that it's just it just kind of is

5060
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:54,720
exactly what it is it's like these are

5061
02:45:52,879 --> 02:45:56,639
the flowers this is what we're growing

5062
02:45:54,719 --> 02:45:58,799
and i really use instagram as kind of

5063
02:45:56,639 --> 02:46:01,840
like a like a networking tool to be able

5064
02:45:58,799 --> 02:46:03,759
to talk to other people about you know i

5065
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:05,120
really like facility design i'm

5066
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:06,639
interested in environmentals i'm

5067
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:08,880
interested in lighting i'm interested in

5068
02:46:06,639 --> 02:46:11,119
a lot of these other factors and kind of

5069
02:46:08,879 --> 02:46:12,318
just really improving that aspect of the

5070
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:14,560
cultivation

5071
02:46:12,318 --> 02:46:15,760
not so much for like you know buy these

5072
02:46:14,559 --> 02:46:17,119
seeds and they're going to be here and

5073
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:18,639
they're dropping here it's a lot of work

5074
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:19,920
to do all that it's a lot of time and a

5075
02:46:18,639 --> 02:46:21,680
lot of commitment

5076
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:23,040
um i find that i have better

5077
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:25,439
relationships with some of the larger

5078
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:26,960
farms and enough of my friends kind of

5079
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:27,760
run these facilities

5080
02:46:26,959 --> 02:46:30,239
that

5081
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:32,079
i don't you know they understand my work

5082
02:46:30,239 --> 02:46:33,760
they appreciate my work and so being

5083
02:46:32,079 --> 02:46:35,600
able to just kind of work with them

5084
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:37,840
enables me to still do what i want to do

5085
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:39,359
without having to kind of deal with

5086
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:40,799
things on a smaller scale because

5087
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:42,640
there's a lot of blowback that comes

5088
02:46:40,799 --> 02:46:43,840
from also the people i don't think

5089
02:46:42,639 --> 02:46:45,278
people think about that i think they

5090
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:46,239
just are excited to work with a seed

5091
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:47,760
bank

5092
02:46:46,239 --> 02:46:49,279
they don't think about okay the customer

5093
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:51,840
service they provide or you know this

5094
02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:52,960
person this one person had an issue but

5095
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:54,559
you're dealing with hundreds of people

5096
02:46:52,959 --> 02:46:56,239
or thousands of people so you know

5097
02:46:54,559 --> 02:46:57,359
there's issues that pop up and kind of

5098
02:46:56,239 --> 02:46:58,879
like you said people have had issues

5099
02:46:57,359 --> 02:47:00,880
with certain breeders and whatnot and

5100
02:46:58,879 --> 02:47:03,679
then it becomes like a whole online

5101
02:47:00,879 --> 02:47:05,519
thing and it's it's more energy than i'm

5102
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:06,960
than i think i currently wanna you know

5103
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:08,319
extend in that direction if somebody

5104
02:47:06,959 --> 02:47:10,398
wanted to do like

5105
02:47:08,318 --> 02:47:13,199
like a small amount in a limited drop or

5106
02:47:10,398 --> 02:47:14,559
something i would be inclined to do that

5107
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:17,600
um

5108
02:47:14,559 --> 02:47:18,719
but not really like a full commitment to

5109
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:20,479
say like yeah i'm going to keep

5110
02:47:18,719 --> 02:47:22,079
promoting and do all that stuff i've

5111
02:47:20,478 --> 02:47:24,079
seen people kind of get upset with with

5112
02:47:22,079 --> 02:47:24,879
seed producers too for not promoting and

5113
02:47:24,079 --> 02:47:27,039
not

5114
02:47:24,879 --> 02:47:28,478
tagging them properly and reposting and

5115
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:30,319
all i don't i don't want to get into all

5116
02:47:28,478 --> 02:47:31,840
that's a big it's just too much to me

5117
02:47:30,318 --> 02:47:34,639
would mostly be like hey if you like my

5118
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:36,639
work great you can carry it if you don't

5119
02:47:34,639 --> 02:47:39,039
care to carry it don't carry it it's

5120
02:47:36,639 --> 02:47:40,799
totally fine and um

5121
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:42,640
yeah but i know like i said i know a

5122
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:44,079
nonprofit has had a good relationship

5123
02:47:42,639 --> 02:47:45,439
with seeds here now and my buddy from

5124
02:47:44,079 --> 02:47:47,600
green team as well

5125
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:49,200
and a couple other people that i know so

5126
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:52,399
probably would lean would lean towards

5127
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:53,200
working with them if that was the case

5128
02:47:52,398 --> 02:47:55,439
yeah

5129
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:57,359
cool i mean it makes sense right so i

5130
02:47:55,439 --> 02:48:00,079
think we're now on to our last couple of

5131
02:47:57,359 --> 02:48:02,720
questions before we get to the rapid

5132
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:05,359
fire ones at the end so a pertinent

5133
02:48:02,719 --> 02:48:07,199
question i ask all the guests what is

5134
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:09,200
your preferred style of growing and by

5135
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:12,560
that i mean are you an organic or more

5136
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:15,920
of a synthetic guy how do you do it

5137
02:48:12,559 --> 02:48:17,840
so for outdoor cultivation i mean number

5138
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:20,398
one i when it comes to like the organic

5139
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:22,159
versus synthetics i don't really draw a

5140
02:48:20,398 --> 02:48:23,519
hard and fast line i think there's

5141
02:48:22,159 --> 02:48:25,680
products from both sides that really

5142
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:28,079
make sense i know there's people running

5143
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:29,920
like no-till or low-till organic gardens

5144
02:48:28,079 --> 02:48:30,959
with amendments and worms and they leave

5145
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:33,200
the leaves and they do all that and

5146
02:48:30,959 --> 02:48:34,879
that's dope but indoor that never made

5147
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:37,840
any sense to me i grew up indoor

5148
02:48:34,879 --> 02:48:39,599
cultivating so to me it's always been

5149
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:41,520
you know initially was bottle nutrients

5150
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:43,760
and then it was salts

5151
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:45,359
just to be able to get the cost down and

5152
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:47,760
at the end of the day like

5153
02:48:45,359 --> 02:48:50,079
i never really noticed a huge decrease

5154
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:52,239
in the quality i have done like fully

5155
02:48:50,079 --> 02:48:54,239
organic like amended soil

5156
02:48:52,239 --> 02:48:56,239
and you know i actually like to do that

5157
02:48:54,239 --> 02:48:57,920
for final hunts i think it really gives

5158
02:48:56,239 --> 02:49:00,079
the plants an opportunity to pull what

5159
02:48:57,920 --> 02:49:02,000
they want from that but when you try and

5160
02:49:00,079 --> 02:49:03,600
maintain the soil and do all that in its

5161
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:06,000
indoors it kind of becomes a pain you

5162
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:08,880
need a lot more space

5163
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:11,120
outdoor yeah the organic soil

5164
02:49:08,879 --> 02:49:13,039
like fish emulsions all that stuff i've

5165
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:14,479
always been a big proponent of that

5166
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:16,800
style of gardening for the outdoor

5167
02:49:14,478 --> 02:49:18,159
plants i think that they love it i think

5168
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:19,599
there's really something really really

5169
02:49:18,159 --> 02:49:22,000
special about being able to cultivate

5170
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:23,840
outdoors i love it

5171
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:25,760
that's definitely something that you

5172
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:27,359
know that i appreciate about having the

5173
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:29,920
chance to spend in norcal is all those

5174
02:49:27,359 --> 02:49:31,200
years being able to grow outdoors

5175
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:33,040
in spite of the fires and everything

5176
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:34,640
else for indoor

5177
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:37,040
i definitely prefer

5178
02:49:34,639 --> 02:49:38,879
cocoa usually is the preferred medium i

5179
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:42,479
have a lot of experience in rockwool as

5180
02:49:38,879 --> 02:49:44,398
well rockwool is just cleaner um but i

5181
02:49:42,478 --> 02:49:46,239
kind of like i appreciate cocoa i find

5182
02:49:44,398 --> 02:49:48,159
it to be kind of like an in between

5183
02:49:46,239 --> 02:49:50,879
between like rock wool or some kind of

5184
02:49:48,159 --> 02:49:53,119
you know soilless medium or you know

5185
02:49:50,879 --> 02:49:55,519
um i don't know amended soil or whatever

5186
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:57,840
it might be a pro-mix or whatever that

5187
02:49:55,520 --> 02:50:00,239
might be with peat with peat and whatnot

5188
02:49:57,840 --> 02:50:02,318
so i would probably say my favorite over

5189
02:50:00,239 --> 02:50:04,239
the years has been cocoa i find that you

5190
02:50:02,318 --> 02:50:05,439
know i can grow really large plants in

5191
02:50:04,239 --> 02:50:07,840
there

5192
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:09,439
multiple irrigations per day and for

5193
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:10,960
years and years and years it was house

5194
02:50:09,439 --> 02:50:13,520
and gardens uh house and garden

5195
02:50:10,959 --> 02:50:15,358
nutrients which i really appreciated and

5196
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:17,439
you know now i find you know you can use

5197
02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:20,559
floraflex you can use veg bloom you can

5198
02:50:17,439 --> 02:50:22,000
use all these products

5199
02:50:20,559 --> 02:50:23,039
really a lot of people and this is

5200
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,639
friendly advice to anyone who's

5201
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:27,040
listening a lot of people are getting

5202
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:28,398
taxed on their nutrients um at the end

5203
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:30,000
of the day the nutrients are just one

5204
02:50:28,398 --> 02:50:32,239
component you can't buy your way out of

5205
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,920
hard work so all the equipment all the

5206
02:50:32,239 --> 02:50:35,279
tools all the fertilizer whatever you're

5207
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:37,359
spending all this money but if you're

5208
02:50:35,279 --> 02:50:40,640
not actually doing the work

5209
02:50:37,359 --> 02:50:42,000
i would take a low-tech garden with hard

5210
02:50:40,639 --> 02:50:43,840
work over

5211
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:45,279
a garden with all expensive bottle

5212
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:46,639
nutrients and whatnot it's just it

5213
02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:49,520
doesn't make any sense if people are

5214
02:50:46,639 --> 02:50:51,039
listening don't pay for water buy salts

5215
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:53,279
if you're gonna do that

5216
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:55,359
and if not buy amendments and mix your

5217
02:50:53,279 --> 02:50:58,239
own soil

5218
02:50:55,359 --> 02:51:00,318
yeah really solid advice so

5219
02:50:58,239 --> 02:51:02,840
do you have a favorite product you like

5220
02:51:00,318 --> 02:51:04,478
to plug at all

5221
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:06,000
um

5222
02:51:04,478 --> 02:51:09,119
that's a good question

5223
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:10,639
i would say as far as a favorite product

5224
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:12,160
um

5225
02:51:10,639 --> 02:51:14,159
i don't really think i'm loyal to

5226
02:51:12,159 --> 02:51:15,920
anybody at this point i mean there's

5227
02:51:14,159 --> 02:51:17,200
some lighting companies that are pretty

5228
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:20,079
decent

5229
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:22,960
it's i mean god i don't i honestly don't

5230
02:51:20,079 --> 02:51:24,159
know i mean i would say

5231
02:51:22,959 --> 02:51:25,759
ah

5232
02:51:24,159 --> 02:51:27,279
man yeah i really don't know i mean

5233
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:28,559
there's there's some products that i've

5234
02:51:27,279 --> 02:51:31,120
used but

5235
02:51:28,559 --> 02:51:32,719
no one that i would really recommend off

5236
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:34,160
top i would tell people you know to

5237
02:51:32,719 --> 02:51:36,318
avoid gavita

5238
02:51:34,159 --> 02:51:39,439
um i could tell people what to avoid

5239
02:51:36,318 --> 02:51:41,439
more than anything do it um do it yeah i

5240
02:51:39,439 --> 02:51:43,840
would say avoid gavita avoid avoid

5241
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:46,559
advanced nutrients

5242
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:48,960
avoid water-based nutrients if you don't

5243
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:51,600
need them like literally don't buy

5244
02:51:48,959 --> 02:51:53,599
anything that's that's mixed with water

5245
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:54,880
buy fluoroflex because it's cheap if you

5246
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:57,040
want

5247
02:51:54,879 --> 02:51:58,719
foliar if you need to

5248
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:00,560
to supplement it

5249
02:51:58,719 --> 02:52:03,199
look at what the agriculture industry is

5250
02:52:00,559 --> 02:52:04,799
doing and that's you know stop buying

5251
02:52:03,200 --> 02:52:07,200
something just because it has a fancy

5252
02:52:04,799 --> 02:52:09,599
package on it i mean jr peters has a

5253
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:11,200
product called stem very inexpensive

5254
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:13,200
tons of micronutrients but if it was

5255
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:15,680
bottled by advanced it would cost like

5256
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:17,040
five times as much 10 times as much

5257
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:18,880
um

5258
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:21,040
yeah i would say you know look look into

5259
02:52:18,879 --> 02:52:22,398
the leds and you know compare the

5260
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:23,920
compared the different technologies that

5261
02:52:22,398 --> 02:52:25,519
are out there there's a lot of people on

5262
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:28,000
instagram right now giving a lot of good

5263
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:29,600
information on leds and you know feel

5264
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,760
free to reach out to the people and ask

5265
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:33,520
and learn you know and see

5266
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:36,079
learn you know about the value of an

5267
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:38,319
adjustable spectrum light and

5268
02:52:36,079 --> 02:52:40,159
look at you know the cmhs you know and

5269
02:52:38,318 --> 02:52:41,600
consider consider you know how you're

5270
02:52:40,159 --> 02:52:42,959
operating your garden how you're setting

5271
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:46,079
it up and

5272
02:52:42,959 --> 02:52:47,278
um yeah cleanliness you know probably if

5273
02:52:46,079 --> 02:52:48,639
i was going to plug a product it would

5274
02:52:47,279 --> 02:52:49,520
probably be bleach or something of the

5275
02:52:48,639 --> 02:52:50,398
sort

5276
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:53,040
because

5277
02:52:50,398 --> 02:52:55,358
cleaning is fundamental people do not

5278
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:57,200
want to clean they seem to forget that

5279
02:52:55,359 --> 02:52:59,520
we're basically like housekeepers and

5280
02:52:57,200 --> 02:53:00,640
janitors for plants at this point

5281
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:03,760
so

5282
02:53:00,639 --> 02:53:05,199
keep it clean and um yeah i don't know i

5283
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:07,200
would say there's there's definitely

5284
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:09,680
companies that are worth avoiding out

5285
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:10,640
there that would not be worth messing

5286
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:12,960
with

5287
02:53:10,639 --> 02:53:14,239
and um yeah

5288
02:53:12,959 --> 02:53:16,799
yeah i don't know

5289
02:53:14,239 --> 02:53:18,639
good call so just to wrap up our kind of

5290
02:53:16,799 --> 02:53:20,799
growing questions do you have any

5291
02:53:18,639 --> 02:53:23,358
growing tips for the listeners or i

5292
02:53:20,799 --> 02:53:26,398
guess maybe more specifically do you

5293
02:53:23,359 --> 02:53:28,800
commonly see people making certain

5294
02:53:26,398 --> 02:53:31,920
mistakes with growing what's the mistake

5295
02:53:28,799 --> 02:53:33,438
you see people commonly doing

5296
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:36,318
um

5297
02:53:33,439 --> 02:53:37,439
common mistakes overfeeding is a common

5298
02:53:36,318 --> 02:53:40,719
mistake

5299
02:53:37,439 --> 02:53:43,279
trying to buy their way out of out of a

5300
02:53:40,719 --> 02:53:46,879
problem that they created

5301
02:53:43,279 --> 02:53:48,479
there is no solution to hard work

5302
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:50,719
pay attention

5303
02:53:48,478 --> 02:53:52,639
be diligent don't do something when it's

5304
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:54,239
convenient for you do it when the plant

5305
02:53:52,639 --> 02:53:56,639
needs it

5306
02:53:54,239 --> 02:53:58,239
when you build your systems and you are

5307
02:53:56,639 --> 02:54:00,398
designing a space

5308
02:53:58,239 --> 02:54:03,279
consider all the various factors think

5309
02:54:00,398 --> 02:54:04,959
about where you're going and not kind of

5310
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:07,600
what you can afford right now and where

5311
02:54:04,959 --> 02:54:08,879
you are and so as you design as you buy

5312
02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:11,680
as you build

5313
02:54:08,879 --> 02:54:13,358
um think about all of that and

5314
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:15,200
prioritize the plan

5315
02:54:13,359 --> 02:54:16,720
like i said no amount of automation no

5316
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:18,240
amount of cameras or sensors for this

5317
02:54:16,719 --> 02:54:19,438
that and the other is a replacement for

5318
02:54:18,239 --> 02:54:21,039
actually having experience with the

5319
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:22,559
plant

5320
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:25,120
there's a lot of people that have you

5321
02:54:22,559 --> 02:54:27,119
know horticulture degrees

5322
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:28,479
and whatnot they think that they know

5323
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:30,000
better than the plant they think that

5324
02:54:28,478 --> 02:54:32,318
they can look at a chart

5325
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:33,680
and or meter or readings and this and

5326
02:54:32,318 --> 02:54:35,600
that and the other and that's that's

5327
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:37,840
that actually is what's happening it's

5328
02:54:35,600 --> 02:54:40,399
not when you look at the plant

5329
02:54:37,840 --> 02:54:42,639
if you can't tell what's happening you

5330
02:54:40,398 --> 02:54:45,039
have not spent enough time with it

5331
02:54:42,639 --> 02:54:48,159
i mean i can if you walk into a room and

5332
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:50,800
it feels wrong if it smells wrong if the

5333
02:54:48,159 --> 02:54:54,000
leaf feels wrong if the if the structure

5334
02:54:50,799 --> 02:54:56,239
on the leaf looks off if the general

5335
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:58,478
like the general shape form or kind of

5336
02:54:56,239 --> 02:55:00,799
like the stance of the plant is off

5337
02:54:58,478 --> 02:55:02,318
something is wrong in your room

5338
02:55:00,799 --> 02:55:04,000
and i think a lot of people they over

5339
02:55:02,318 --> 02:55:05,519
light their gardens they overfeed their

5340
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:07,840
gardens like

5341
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:09,520
they do too much and pay attention not

5342
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:12,000
all strains are the same not all

5343
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:12,880
cultivars want the same thing

5344
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,639
so

5345
02:55:12,879 --> 02:55:16,239
think about that when you're setting up

5346
02:55:14,639 --> 02:55:17,920
your garden if you want to design

5347
02:55:16,239 --> 02:55:20,079
something to be able to grow multiple

5348
02:55:17,920 --> 02:55:21,760
different varieties make sure you can

5349
02:55:20,079 --> 02:55:23,680
have different feeds on each bench or

5350
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:26,478
each table

5351
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:28,079
and keep it really really clean you know

5352
02:55:26,478 --> 02:55:29,119
i think a big mistake that people make

5353
02:55:28,079 --> 02:55:31,359
is like

5354
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:33,279
they you know i mean you're only gonna

5355
02:55:31,359 --> 02:55:35,920
get what you put into it that's all

5356
02:55:33,279 --> 02:55:38,399
you're gonna get out of it if there's no

5357
02:55:35,920 --> 02:55:40,559
like i can tell when a person

5358
02:55:38,398 --> 02:55:42,239
has neglected their garden and i've had

5359
02:55:40,559 --> 02:55:43,840
people watch my garden before and i can

5360
02:55:42,239 --> 02:55:45,439
tell like they just watered it right

5361
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:47,279
before i got back

5362
02:55:45,439 --> 02:55:49,120
and the plants you know have a little

5363
02:55:47,279 --> 02:55:50,399
bit of curl on the leaf or a little bit

5364
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:51,600
you know they have a little they you

5365
02:55:50,398 --> 02:55:52,719
know they're going to dry back and

5366
02:55:51,600 --> 02:55:54,318
they're going to burn and i don't care

5367
02:55:52,719 --> 02:55:55,599
what they said i know i know exactly

5368
02:55:54,318 --> 02:55:57,039
what they did

5369
02:55:55,600 --> 02:55:58,479
um but yeah my biggest advice would

5370
02:55:57,040 --> 02:56:00,160
probably be just

5371
02:55:58,478 --> 02:56:01,920
you know don't be afraid to experiment

5372
02:56:00,159 --> 02:56:04,719
but don't change too many variables at

5373
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:07,120
once either like you won't know what

5374
02:56:04,719 --> 02:56:08,799
actually caused the effect be patient

5375
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:09,920
and think about what you're doing think

5376
02:56:08,799 --> 02:56:11,759
about whether or not you're trying to

5377
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:12,799
learn to cultivate a specific variety

5378
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:14,398
think about whether you're trying to get

5379
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:15,679
experience with different equipment

5380
02:56:14,398 --> 02:56:18,719
think about you know whether you're

5381
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:20,159
happy with you know b grade buds and

5382
02:56:18,719 --> 02:56:22,398
when it comes down to harvesting and

5383
02:56:20,159 --> 02:56:24,318
drying and curing like give it the

5384
02:56:22,398 --> 02:56:25,840
attention that it deserves when you run

5385
02:56:24,318 --> 02:56:27,199
something and put that much time into

5386
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:28,880
something and you don't cure it properly

5387
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:30,319
you don't store it properly

5388
02:56:28,879 --> 02:56:32,398
like

5389
02:56:30,318 --> 02:56:33,760
you're wasting your time you're never

5390
02:56:32,398 --> 02:56:34,719
gonna see the full potential of that

5391
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:37,200
plan

5392
02:56:34,719 --> 02:56:39,278
and um yeah i would just say just you

5393
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:41,920
know be diligent be thoughtful

5394
02:56:39,279 --> 02:56:43,680
and pay attention you know care and the

5395
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:45,920
more you care the better the better your

5396
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:47,359
garden will turn out and don't be afraid

5397
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:48,799
you know to ask questions don't be

5398
02:56:47,359 --> 02:56:50,800
afraid to reach out to people you'd be

5399
02:56:48,799 --> 02:56:52,478
surprised especially nowadays how

5400
02:56:50,799 --> 02:56:53,840
helpful some people will be like i'm not

5401
02:56:52,478 --> 02:56:56,879
saying that inspector is going to answer

5402
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:59,359
your message if you ask but he might

5403
02:56:56,879 --> 02:57:00,159
and you know i think a lot of people too

5404
02:56:59,359 --> 02:57:01,520
they

5405
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:03,039
they want to

5406
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:04,560
they want to be great they're afraid

5407
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:06,960
they're afraid to make mistakes and

5408
02:57:04,559 --> 02:57:09,840
understand that all of us made mistakes

5409
02:57:06,959 --> 02:57:12,639
all of us have ruined a bat all of us

5410
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:14,398
have flooded a room or you know inserted

5411
02:57:12,639 --> 02:57:15,920
a bulb improperly or whatever it might

5412
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:18,559
be all of us have done it and we've done

5413
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:21,680
it multiple times

5414
02:57:18,559 --> 02:57:23,920
and be diligent with your ipm be

5415
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:26,239
diligent if you

5416
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:28,478
if you think it doesn't matter and you

5417
02:57:26,239 --> 02:57:30,639
start taking a day here a day there and

5418
02:57:28,478 --> 02:57:32,398
skipping this or skipping that i promise

5419
02:57:30,639 --> 02:57:34,398
you it's going to bite you and it's

5420
02:57:32,398 --> 02:57:35,199
going to be months of cleanup

5421
02:57:34,398 --> 02:57:37,039
and

5422
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:38,720
you that a little bit of time that you

5423
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:39,920
neglected is going to come back to bite

5424
02:57:38,719 --> 02:57:42,239
you in the ass

5425
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:44,478
every single time you can always look

5426
02:57:42,239 --> 02:57:47,439
back and see where you were lazy and it

5427
02:57:44,478 --> 02:57:49,679
will come back and bite you

5428
02:57:47,439 --> 02:57:51,359
yeah some phenomenally solid advice

5429
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:53,840
right there for all the growers looking

5430
02:57:51,359 --> 02:57:56,000
to improve their game a bit so

5431
02:57:53,840 --> 02:57:58,159
last question before a little quick fire

5432
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:00,398
round we can see that there are more and

5433
02:57:58,159 --> 02:58:02,799
more states coming online regularly and

5434
02:58:00,398 --> 02:58:04,719
we can also see that it's really hard to

5435
02:58:02,799 --> 02:58:07,519
find good flower in the majority of

5436
02:58:04,719 --> 02:58:09,840
these states like for example

5437
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:11,520
you know in on the east coast in places

5438
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:13,680
like mass like i can only think of like

5439
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:16,000
two people where i'd be able to get good

5440
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:18,880
flower from them and that's like mass

5441
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:20,639
medical and then like chemdog slash that

5442
02:58:18,879 --> 02:58:23,358
guy from maine those guys are obviously

5443
02:58:20,639 --> 02:58:24,879
crushing it so i guess my question is

5444
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:27,439
for people who are from these smaller

5445
02:58:24,879 --> 02:58:29,278
states just coming online is really no

5446
02:58:27,439 --> 02:58:30,639
established scene and i know i know that

5447
02:58:29,279 --> 02:58:33,200
mass has a bit more of an established

5448
02:58:30,639 --> 02:58:34,559
scene than most places but i digress if

5449
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:36,240
you're from a state where there's less

5450
02:58:34,559 --> 02:58:37,680
of an established scene it's hard to

5451
02:58:36,239 --> 02:58:39,600
find good flower

5452
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:42,000
what are some tips for

5453
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:44,479
the kind of communities in these places

5454
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:46,398
to just lift their game and produce

5455
02:58:44,478 --> 02:58:50,318
better quality flour and get up to

5456
02:58:46,398 --> 02:58:51,119
scratch with the west coast for example

5457
02:58:50,318 --> 02:58:53,039
well

5458
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:54,960
i'm going to have kind of a defeatist

5459
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:57,920
attitude i think about the recreational

5460
02:58:54,959 --> 02:59:00,318
market at least out east for a while

5461
02:58:57,920 --> 02:59:02,159
this market is going to be dominated by

5462
02:59:00,318 --> 02:59:03,840
by the big players by the people that

5463
02:59:02,159 --> 02:59:06,478
have the deep pockets

5464
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:08,960
so if your goal is to try and produce a

5465
02:59:06,478 --> 02:59:11,599
higher grade quality flower

5466
02:59:08,959 --> 02:59:14,318
i honestly think that the best you could

5467
02:59:11,600 --> 02:59:17,439
hope for is probably like a cheesecake

5468
02:59:14,318 --> 02:59:20,000
factory level of flour

5469
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:21,600
where it's good but anybody who knows

5470
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:23,760
something phenomenal something truly

5471
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:26,159
special will never be impressed by it

5472
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:27,840
and the the big reason why is because of

5473
02:59:26,159 --> 02:59:30,959
everything that goes into it in terms of

5474
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:32,719
how it's harvested how long it sits

5475
02:59:30,959 --> 02:59:34,159
um it goes out for testing then it gets

5476
02:59:32,719 --> 02:59:37,599
jarred up then it goes and sits on the

5477
02:59:34,159 --> 02:59:39,920
shelf there's just such a gap in between

5478
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:41,920
that scene and when it actually hits the

5479
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:44,079
market that the flower is just going to

5480
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:45,520
be like degraded by the time a consumer

5481
02:59:44,079 --> 02:59:47,120
actually gets it so if you're used to

5482
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:49,520
getting something really phenomenal high

5483
02:59:47,120 --> 02:59:51,600
end it's going to be really really tough

5484
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:54,000
as a producer

5485
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:55,760
there are states that are more friendly

5486
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:57,920
i think maine is one of those states

5487
02:59:55,760 --> 02:59:59,520
that seems to be that like smaller

5488
02:59:57,920 --> 03:00:00,799
producers can kind of get more into the

5489
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:03,680
market there

5490
03:00:00,799 --> 03:00:05,358
so that might be worth considering i do

5491
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:07,600
think that you know

5492
03:00:05,359 --> 03:00:08,720
try i mean if you really really want and

5493
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:10,640
you're really really committed to

5494
03:00:08,719 --> 03:00:12,959
actually producing for the market like

5495
03:00:10,639 --> 03:00:14,959
on the recreational side

5496
03:00:12,959 --> 03:00:16,639
you're gonna have to raise some capital

5497
03:00:14,959 --> 03:00:18,959
and try and make a run of it and be

5498
03:00:16,639 --> 03:00:21,278
willing to fight tooth and nail for you

5499
03:00:18,959 --> 03:00:22,799
know three four five years

5500
03:00:21,279 --> 03:00:24,079
and i don't know that there's a ton of

5501
03:00:22,799 --> 03:00:25,679
people that are willing to do that

5502
03:00:24,079 --> 03:00:27,920
because the biggest producers on the

5503
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:29,279
medical side of the market

5504
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:30,879
they're not going to want to make the

5505
03:00:29,279 --> 03:00:32,960
transition a lot of people i saw that

5506
03:00:30,879 --> 03:00:34,719
happen in california not a lot of people

5507
03:00:32,959 --> 03:00:37,759
have transitioned successfully through

5508
03:00:34,719 --> 03:00:38,559
64. a lot of people disappeared a lot of

5509
03:00:37,760 --> 03:00:41,279
people

5510
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:43,680
are not made to exist in a corporate

5511
03:00:41,279 --> 03:00:45,439
structure they're just not built for it

5512
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:48,079
it's a whole different beast of a

5513
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:50,239
situation and i also think to be

5514
03:00:48,079 --> 03:00:52,799
completely blunt like the red the amount

5515
03:00:50,239 --> 03:00:54,318
that people get paid by these facilities

5516
03:00:52,799 --> 03:00:56,318
is not equivalent to what they were

5517
03:00:54,318 --> 03:00:58,879
earning so a lot of a lot of the most

5518
03:00:56,318 --> 03:01:01,199
talented growers are not going to want

5519
03:00:58,879 --> 03:01:02,799
to work for these facilities and i guess

5520
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:03,840
a big thing is that like if you are a

5521
03:01:02,799 --> 03:01:05,920
grower

5522
03:01:03,840 --> 03:01:07,600
are you capable of operating in a in a

5523
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:09,200
semi-corporate environment because

5524
03:01:07,600 --> 03:01:10,640
whether you like it or not that's what

5525
03:01:09,200 --> 03:01:12,800
you're doing you know you're analyzing

5526
03:01:10,639 --> 03:01:13,760
costs you're managing people

5527
03:01:12,799 --> 03:01:15,438
you're dealing with you know

5528
03:01:13,760 --> 03:01:17,040
unemployment and payroll and all of this

5529
03:01:15,439 --> 03:01:18,559
stuff that that's not why a lot of

5530
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:19,760
people got into it

5531
03:01:18,559 --> 03:01:22,879
so

5532
03:01:19,760 --> 03:01:25,520
i think you know i think in a few years

5533
03:01:22,879 --> 03:01:27,679
after all of this settles there will be

5534
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:30,720
an opportunity for some of these smaller

5535
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:32,318
craft places to pop up and you know i'm

5536
03:01:30,719 --> 03:01:33,840
very very much looking forward to that

5537
03:01:32,318 --> 03:01:35,920
because i just don't think that it

5538
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:38,000
should cost that amount of money

5539
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:39,520
to and require that much security and

5540
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:41,040
that much tracking and all of these

5541
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:43,040
crazy things

5542
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:45,279
to be able to you know grow an eight

5543
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:47,040
lighter and you know have a small i mean

5544
03:01:45,279 --> 03:01:48,800
the equivalent of a small craft brewery

5545
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:50,960
it just it shouldn't it shouldn't be

5546
03:01:48,799 --> 03:01:52,239
that much different from that

5547
03:01:50,959 --> 03:01:53,839
in terms of you know they don't have to

5548
03:01:52,239 --> 03:01:55,279
have security in front of their spaces

5549
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:56,960
they don't have to have cameras in every

5550
03:01:55,279 --> 03:01:58,000
corner

5551
03:01:56,959 --> 03:02:00,239
they don't have to pay all these

5552
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,600
exorbitant taxes

5553
03:02:00,239 --> 03:02:02,799
and they let them pop up pretty much

5554
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:05,840
anywhere

5555
03:02:02,799 --> 03:02:07,358
you know for for us you know it's hard i

5556
03:02:05,840 --> 03:02:08,880
think for a lot of guys to make that

5557
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:10,479
transition for a lot of people to make

5558
03:02:08,879 --> 03:02:12,159
that transition

5559
03:02:10,478 --> 03:02:14,559
if you can get enough people on the same

5560
03:02:12,159 --> 03:02:17,600
page you can try and make a run at it

5561
03:02:14,559 --> 03:02:19,600
but if you're looking to produce higher

5562
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:21,359
quality i mean i don't honestly think

5563
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:23,200
that we're going to see the level of the

5564
03:02:21,359 --> 03:02:25,279
quality of flour that we saw in the

5565
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:28,399
medical days in california

5566
03:02:25,279 --> 03:02:30,399
on the rec market for a long time

5567
03:02:28,398 --> 03:02:32,398
i think best case scenario a lot of the

5568
03:02:30,398 --> 03:02:34,318
flour that's on the market is b grade i

5569
03:02:32,398 --> 03:02:36,559
think a lot of the oil that's on the

5570
03:02:34,318 --> 03:02:38,719
market is better because the oil is

5571
03:02:36,559 --> 03:02:40,639
processed so quickly and then it doesn't

5572
03:02:38,719 --> 03:02:42,719
get it's more

5573
03:02:40,639 --> 03:02:44,719
the bho that they're making in

5574
03:02:42,719 --> 03:02:46,719
california as an example from the fresh

5575
03:02:44,719 --> 03:02:48,318
frozen material it's a lot easier to

5576
03:02:46,719 --> 03:02:49,920
preserve it and bring it to market in a

5577
03:02:48,318 --> 03:02:52,000
stable state where it still has a really

5578
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:53,920
really strong terpene profile and still

5579
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:56,398
has a nice solid effect

5580
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:58,719
if the flower isn't stored precisely all

5581
03:02:56,398 --> 03:03:00,799
along the way before you get it it's

5582
03:02:58,719 --> 03:03:02,239
gonna be an inferior product i mean i've

5583
03:03:00,799 --> 03:03:03,679
seen shops in oregon like that where

5584
03:03:02,239 --> 03:03:04,959
it's you know it's 80 degrees in there

5585
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:06,000
and they've got the jar sitting there in

5586
03:03:04,959 --> 03:03:07,839
full light

5587
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:09,279
and when you ask them you know if they

5588
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:11,120
understand about oxidation and

5589
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:13,200
temperature and the terpenes you know

5590
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:15,120
and they they don't they had no clue

5591
03:03:13,200 --> 03:03:17,520
what i was talking about

5592
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:20,000
so i think that you know for the

5593
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:22,880
quality scene on the east coast i think

5594
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:24,799
that there are people producing

5595
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:26,079
quality flower but i think a lot of them

5596
03:03:24,799 --> 03:03:27,679
are going to stay medical a lot of them

5597
03:03:26,079 --> 03:03:28,639
are going to stay underground

5598
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:31,200
and

5599
03:03:28,639 --> 03:03:33,519
i think there probably are some

5600
03:03:31,200 --> 03:03:35,520
facilities that are trying to produce

5601
03:03:33,520 --> 03:03:36,479
higher grade flower but at the end of

5602
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:38,319
the day a lot of the people that are

5603
03:03:36,478 --> 03:03:40,000
bankrolling these facilities that's not

5604
03:03:38,318 --> 03:03:41,359
really what matters to them they're just

5605
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:44,079
looking to grab market share make

5606
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:45,279
revenue you know

5607
03:03:44,079 --> 03:03:46,559
they they just want to recoup their

5608
03:03:45,279 --> 03:03:48,159
investment and potentially flip their

5609
03:03:46,559 --> 03:03:50,159
business um

5610
03:03:48,159 --> 03:03:52,000
hopefully you know california will see

5611
03:03:50,159 --> 03:03:53,600
some brands that survive and exist i

5612
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:55,840
know some people out there

5613
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:57,760
that are doing you know that are fully

5614
03:03:55,840 --> 03:03:59,680
intending to do good quality work and i

5615
03:03:57,760 --> 03:04:03,040
think if a market could sustain that it

5616
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:05,120
would be a larger market like california

5617
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:07,200
yeah of course and you just raised a

5618
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:09,439
really interesting point that i want to

5619
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:12,319
touch on for a second there have you

5620
03:04:09,439 --> 03:04:15,840
ever met a bud tender who legitimately

5621
03:04:12,318 --> 03:04:15,840
impressed you with their knowledge

5622
03:04:16,398 --> 03:04:19,840
oh wow no

5623
03:04:18,079 --> 03:04:21,680
um

5624
03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:23,600
yeah even at archive i've met some

5625
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:25,840
people that were like knowledgeable you

5626
03:04:23,600 --> 03:04:27,279
know and they were pretty passionate but

5627
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:28,799
nobody that ever really impressed me

5628
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:31,520
with their knowledge and this is no this

5629
03:04:28,799 --> 03:04:33,358
is no disrespect to anyone but if you

5630
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:35,600
knew that much about this if you were

5631
03:04:33,359 --> 03:04:38,239
that passionate about this like

5632
03:04:35,600 --> 03:04:40,318
is that really where you would be

5633
03:04:38,239 --> 03:04:42,719
like yeah like the reason why i bring it

5634
03:04:40,318 --> 03:04:44,959
up is because i got sent an email and

5635
03:04:42,719 --> 03:04:47,039
there was some like event like for is

5636
03:04:44,959 --> 03:04:48,079
like the bud tender awards or something

5637
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:50,240
and they were like oh would you would

5638
03:04:48,079 --> 03:04:51,600
you like to come and document it and

5639
03:04:50,239 --> 03:04:53,039
obviously they don't realize i'm in

5640
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:54,880
australia but more importantly like all

5641
03:04:53,040 --> 03:04:56,560
i was thinking to myself is like

5642
03:04:54,879 --> 03:04:58,559
what would i be documenting like the

5643
03:04:56,559 --> 03:05:00,478
mediocrity like

5644
03:04:58,559 --> 03:05:02,478
i like yeah like i've

5645
03:05:00,478 --> 03:05:04,799
i'm disappointed by bud tenders

5646
03:05:02,478 --> 03:05:07,278
consistently it's like

5647
03:05:04,799 --> 03:05:09,920
just the most passe thing to do if

5648
03:05:07,279 --> 03:05:12,079
you're superficially into cannabis

5649
03:05:09,920 --> 03:05:13,760
yeah i had i had to explain so i went

5650
03:05:12,079 --> 03:05:16,318
into one dispensary i had to explain to

5651
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:17,520
them i asked if they had any live resin

5652
03:05:16,318 --> 03:05:19,199
and they said oh we've got this and i

5653
03:05:17,520 --> 03:05:21,520
was like well that that's co2 and they

5654
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:22,960
were like oh but yeah but it's live i

5655
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:24,479
was like no

5656
03:05:22,959 --> 03:05:26,318
no like

5657
03:05:24,478 --> 03:05:27,599
i said that's not what i'm asking about

5658
03:05:26,318 --> 03:05:29,760
i said you have any like fresh frozen

5659
03:05:27,600 --> 03:05:31,040
material like bho extract i'm like

5660
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:32,880
that's the only way it would be like

5661
03:05:31,040 --> 03:05:34,240
that and i had to explain to them the

5662
03:05:32,879 --> 03:05:35,438
difference and then one of them asked me

5663
03:05:34,239 --> 03:05:37,600
hey you know you know you know a lot

5664
03:05:35,439 --> 03:05:40,000
about cannabis like do you want a job

5665
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:40,960
here and i i'm not not to be rude i

5666
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:41,920
laughed

5667
03:05:40,959 --> 03:05:44,839
um

5668
03:05:41,920 --> 03:05:46,719
but not not like that but only to say

5669
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:48,960
like no

5670
03:05:46,719 --> 03:05:50,159
like um this is my life is my whole

5671
03:05:48,959 --> 03:05:51,519
upset i don't have to get into it with

5672
03:05:50,159 --> 03:05:53,600
them but like

5673
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:56,000
you should know that you should know the

5674
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:59,040
difference between live resin and butter

5675
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:01,120
and sugar and wax nbho and co2 it's

5676
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:02,319
really not that complicated

5677
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:04,160
like

5678
03:06:02,318 --> 03:06:05,920
all you need to do is care to educate

5679
03:06:04,159 --> 03:06:07,039
people but the reality is like i said

5680
03:06:05,920 --> 03:06:09,439
about the companies that are running

5681
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:11,439
these places the bar is so low they pay

5682
03:06:09,439 --> 03:06:12,559
so little they care so little about the

5683
03:06:11,439 --> 03:06:14,398
training

5684
03:06:12,559 --> 03:06:15,680
and kind of helping build these people

5685
03:06:14,398 --> 03:06:16,719
up just like most companies they don't

5686
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:18,720
really care about building up their

5687
03:06:16,719 --> 03:06:20,318
employees why would they care

5688
03:06:18,719 --> 03:06:21,840
so

5689
03:06:20,318 --> 03:06:23,920
they you know unfortunately most people

5690
03:06:21,840 --> 03:06:26,159
that come in what if you've listened all

5691
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:27,920
they say is what's the highest thc thing

5692
03:06:26,159 --> 03:06:29,119
you have for the least amount of money

5693
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:30,239
that's literally what people are

5694
03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:31,520
interested in

5695
03:06:30,239 --> 03:06:32,799
like

5696
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:35,279
yeah that

5697
03:06:32,799 --> 03:06:37,278
that's it you know the the test results

5698
03:06:35,279 --> 03:06:38,319
are a whole nother thing you know that's

5699
03:06:37,279 --> 03:06:39,600
like

5700
03:06:38,318 --> 03:06:41,840
i mean

5701
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:42,800
some states are more strict than others

5702
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:44,318
but at the end of the day you know

5703
03:06:42,799 --> 03:06:46,318
there's been stories you know out of

5704
03:06:44,318 --> 03:06:48,478
washington and other places with labs

5705
03:06:46,318 --> 03:06:49,680
completely faking test results

5706
03:06:48,478 --> 03:06:51,278
and um

5707
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:53,439
it's kind of unfortunate like we live in

5708
03:06:51,279 --> 03:06:55,439
a thc kind of dominant society people

5709
03:06:53,439 --> 03:06:57,120
really just only care about

5710
03:06:55,439 --> 03:06:59,680
the majority of the customers that come

5711
03:06:57,120 --> 03:07:01,840
in just care about the thc level

5712
03:06:59,680 --> 03:07:03,920
you know and if it's 30 it sells faster

5713
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:05,439
if it's 25 it sells fast if it sells 20

5714
03:07:03,920 --> 03:07:07,760
great below 20 they're not super

5715
03:07:05,439 --> 03:07:10,800
interested

5716
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:13,279
yeah it's it's interesting right i i

5717
03:07:10,799 --> 03:07:14,799
remember hearing that uh one of the

5718
03:07:13,279 --> 03:07:16,159
testing companies i can't remember who

5719
03:07:14,799 --> 03:07:17,438
it was not even if i remembered i

5720
03:07:16,159 --> 03:07:19,600
probably wouldn't want to say the name

5721
03:07:17,439 --> 03:07:21,279
but they were like you know you'd pay

5722
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:22,640
for the test and then you'd also pay a

5723
03:07:21,279 --> 03:07:25,120
little extra fee if you wanted it to

5724
03:07:22,639 --> 03:07:27,920
test over like you know 26 or something

5725
03:07:25,120 --> 03:07:29,760
i was just like oh yeah cool

5726
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:32,318
oh yeah

5727
03:07:29,760 --> 03:07:34,960
oh yeah that's i mean people people have

5728
03:07:32,318 --> 03:07:37,199
shopped around for

5729
03:07:34,959 --> 03:07:38,959
testing companies like to see

5730
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:40,560
who will test higher because they know

5731
03:07:38,959 --> 03:07:42,639
that they'll they'll get a higher ticket

5732
03:07:40,559 --> 03:07:44,478
for that

5733
03:07:42,639 --> 03:07:45,760
yeah so

5734
03:07:44,478 --> 03:07:48,398
that's

5735
03:07:45,760 --> 03:07:50,800
interesting but also sad but

5736
03:07:48,398 --> 03:07:53,599
not unexpected given where we're at

5737
03:07:50,799 --> 03:07:54,799
anyway on to our last little run of

5738
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:57,920
questions what i like to call the

5739
03:07:54,799 --> 03:08:00,239
quickfire questions so these ones you

5740
03:07:57,920 --> 03:08:03,200
know feel free to answer them as quickly

5741
03:08:00,239 --> 03:08:05,199
or as long as you'd like first one

5742
03:08:03,200 --> 03:08:07,600
what's your favorite weed that you've

5743
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:08,640
ever smoked

5744
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:10,800
wow

5745
03:08:08,639 --> 03:08:12,879
um

5746
03:08:10,799 --> 03:08:15,679
probably this the cali mist we used to

5747
03:08:12,879 --> 03:08:18,559
get in san diego in like early 2001

5748
03:08:15,680 --> 03:08:18,559
2002.

5749
03:08:18,799 --> 03:08:22,559
wow yeah that that sounds like a really

5750
03:08:20,799 --> 03:08:24,318
nice throwback

5751
03:08:22,559 --> 03:08:26,000
yeah it was phenomenal it was beautiful

5752
03:08:24,318 --> 03:08:27,278
you could smell it in the air no matter

5753
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,398
if somebody was smoking or wherever they

5754
03:08:27,279 --> 03:08:31,680
were smoking it you could it was

5755
03:08:28,398 --> 03:08:34,799
distinct it had an incredible high

5756
03:08:31,680 --> 03:08:36,639
that was super clear you felt lifted but

5757
03:08:34,799 --> 03:08:38,879
clear no

5758
03:08:36,639 --> 03:08:40,559
no tiredness no anything to it really

5759
03:08:38,879 --> 03:08:44,159
really beautiful and then the other one

5760
03:08:40,559 --> 03:08:45,920
was honestly some some willie nelson

5761
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:48,318
that they had at harbor side i used to

5762
03:08:45,920 --> 03:08:49,359
vend to harbor side and i went in there

5763
03:08:48,318 --> 03:08:51,760
one time

5764
03:08:49,359 --> 03:08:53,200
and they had bought a pound of it my god

5765
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:55,359
i think they paid like six or seven

5766
03:08:53,200 --> 03:08:58,479
thousand for it at the time and when

5767
03:08:55,359 --> 03:09:01,040
pounds of sour were going for 36 34

5768
03:08:58,478 --> 03:09:03,840
significant

5769
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:06,479
but they gave me some of it and the high

5770
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:08,159
from that was phenomenal i mean really

5771
03:09:06,478 --> 03:09:09,760
really really special flower it never

5772
03:09:08,159 --> 03:09:12,398
made the shelf they split it up amongst

5773
03:09:09,760 --> 03:09:14,559
themselves back there

5774
03:09:12,398 --> 03:09:16,478
interesting stuff okay so on the

5775
03:09:14,559 --> 03:09:19,278
opposite end of the spectrum what's the

5776
03:09:16,478 --> 03:09:22,159
worst weed you've ever smoked and the

5777
03:09:19,279 --> 03:09:24,479
follow-up is what's the worst weed that

5778
03:09:22,159 --> 03:09:26,398
you've smoked that somehow got

5779
03:09:24,478 --> 03:09:28,719
commercial traction and other people

5780
03:09:26,398 --> 03:09:30,318
seemingly thought it was pretty good

5781
03:09:28,719 --> 03:09:32,159
wow the worst weed that i've ever smoked

5782
03:09:30,318 --> 03:09:34,639
was probably the brickweed i smoked in

5783
03:09:32,159 --> 03:09:36,079
miami when i was like 16.

5784
03:09:34,639 --> 03:09:38,879
um

5785
03:09:36,079 --> 03:09:41,039
since then i've been like no i'm i won't

5786
03:09:38,879 --> 03:09:43,519
do that um the worst weed that's gained

5787
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:47,279
commercial traction is probably the mac

5788
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:49,920
or the purple punch either one of those

5789
03:09:47,279 --> 03:09:51,760
yeah two two contenders that we've heard

5790
03:09:49,920 --> 03:09:53,200
before actually no we haven't heard the

5791
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:55,359
mac we've heard pebble punch but there

5792
03:09:53,200 --> 03:09:57,359
you go a new one bringing mac to the the

5793
03:09:55,359 --> 03:10:00,159
worst commercial one but i see where the

5794
03:09:57,359 --> 03:10:02,000
merit is so the next one is if you're

5795
03:10:00,159 --> 03:10:04,238
stranded on a desert island you can only

5796
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:07,040
take three strains with you what three

5797
03:10:04,238 --> 03:10:07,039
are you going to take

5798
03:10:07,439 --> 03:10:10,960
wow

5799
03:10:08,478 --> 03:10:13,119
probably

5800
03:10:10,959 --> 03:10:15,358
the chem d

5801
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:17,520
uh probably

5802
03:10:15,359 --> 03:10:19,840
the tk

5803
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:19,840
and

5804
03:10:20,478 --> 03:10:22,639
probably

5805
03:10:21,760 --> 03:10:24,398
like

5806
03:10:22,639 --> 03:10:26,639
the lavender

5807
03:10:24,398 --> 03:10:28,719
um or some something along that line of

5808
03:10:26,639 --> 03:10:30,238
the the old perps i'd probably say

5809
03:10:28,719 --> 03:10:31,760
because that that would i mean i'm gonna

5810
03:10:30,238 --> 03:10:34,559
miss the sour but i think i think if i

5811
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:36,478
combine the 91 and the uh

5812
03:10:34,559 --> 03:10:37,760
or if i can buy the tk and the d i could

5813
03:10:36,478 --> 03:10:39,519
probably get something that i like in

5814
03:10:37,760 --> 03:10:41,279
there

5815
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:43,680
love it and you just wave goodbye to

5816
03:10:41,279 --> 03:10:44,640
sativas at that point

5817
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:46,559
hey

5818
03:10:44,639 --> 03:10:47,760
i'm on an island it'll be everything's

5819
03:10:46,559 --> 03:10:50,079
gonna be fine

5820
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:52,079
yeah lovely

5821
03:10:50,079 --> 03:10:55,920
okay so the next one is

5822
03:10:52,079 --> 03:10:57,840
if you could have back one clone that

5823
03:10:55,920 --> 03:10:59,439
you had lost or a clone that you'd

5824
03:10:57,840 --> 03:11:02,799
wanted but were just never able to get

5825
03:10:59,439 --> 03:11:04,000
your hands on what one would it be

5826
03:11:02,799 --> 03:11:06,478
wow

5827
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,478
um

5828
03:11:07,279 --> 03:11:11,600
um

5829
03:11:08,478 --> 03:11:13,599
probably that lavender honestly it's i

5830
03:11:11,600 --> 03:11:14,880
just have a farm space for it i've never

5831
03:11:13,600 --> 03:11:16,238
haven't had anything like it in my

5832
03:11:14,879 --> 03:11:19,920
garden since

5833
03:11:16,238 --> 03:11:19,920
it would probably be that that lavender

5834
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:23,359
yeah it's a really special plan i've

5835
03:11:21,680 --> 03:11:26,479
been lucky enough to be able to smoke

5836
03:11:23,359 --> 03:11:28,079
some grown out by duke and it's uh very

5837
03:11:26,478 --> 03:11:31,438
very memorable

5838
03:11:28,079 --> 03:11:32,478
nice lucky indeed

5839
03:11:31,439 --> 03:11:34,559
so

5840
03:11:32,478 --> 03:11:37,199
on to our very last question if you

5841
03:11:34,559 --> 03:11:39,359
could go back in time to any place any

5842
03:11:37,200 --> 03:11:42,479
time frame throughout all of history to

5843
03:11:39,359 --> 03:11:45,439
presumably get some seeds or a clone

5844
03:11:42,478 --> 03:11:47,438
where and when would you go

5845
03:11:45,439 --> 03:11:50,439
wow

5846
03:11:47,439 --> 03:11:50,439
um

5847
03:11:50,639 --> 03:11:55,760
man

5848
03:11:52,799 --> 03:11:57,519
[Music]

5849
03:11:55,760 --> 03:11:59,120
probably colombia

5850
03:11:57,520 --> 03:12:01,359
i think i think that a lot of

5851
03:11:59,120 --> 03:12:03,520
interesting work has come out of there

5852
03:12:01,359 --> 03:12:05,680
and it would have to be before we

5853
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:08,238
started traveling around the world and

5854
03:12:05,680 --> 03:12:09,600
polluting the genetic gene pool

5855
03:12:08,238 --> 03:12:12,879
um

5856
03:12:09,600 --> 03:12:15,359
probably some of the colombian and if

5857
03:12:12,879 --> 03:12:15,358
not

5858
03:12:15,680 --> 03:12:18,398
if not the colombian some of the asian

5859
03:12:17,680 --> 03:12:20,238
stuff

5860
03:12:18,398 --> 03:12:22,799
like something something out in thailand

5861
03:12:20,238 --> 03:12:25,039
or cambodia or laos i think would be

5862
03:12:22,799 --> 03:12:27,438
really really phenomenal flower all

5863
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:29,439
things being equal so i'd probably aim

5864
03:12:27,439 --> 03:12:31,120
aim towards one of those

5865
03:12:29,439 --> 03:12:32,479
both kind of with the same intention

5866
03:12:31,120 --> 03:12:34,800
really looking for something with an

5867
03:12:32,478 --> 03:12:37,278
incredibly like psychedelic uplifting

5868
03:12:34,799 --> 03:12:37,278
type hi

5869
03:12:37,520 --> 03:12:41,200
yeah fantastic sounds like something i

5870
03:12:39,600 --> 03:12:43,840
would consider doing

5871
03:12:41,200 --> 03:12:45,439
so with all that being said do you have

5872
03:12:43,840 --> 03:12:46,880
any shout outs or comments you'd like to

5873
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:48,238
make

5874
03:12:46,879 --> 03:12:50,238
um

5875
03:12:48,238 --> 03:12:52,238
i would say if anything i just want to

5876

03:12:56,478 --> 03:13:00,238
the years

5880
03:12:58,318 --> 03:13:02,318
good friend of mine who really helped me

5881
03:13:00,238 --> 03:13:03,760
a whole lot when i landed in oakland and

5882
03:13:02,318 --> 03:13:04,879
didn't know anybody and didn't have

5883
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:06,880
anything

5884
03:13:04,879 --> 03:13:08,799
and really looked out for me and knew a

5885
03:13:06,879 --> 03:13:11,278
lot about growing knew a lot more about

5886
03:13:08,799 --> 03:13:14,238
growing than i did at the time and now

5887
03:13:11,279 --> 03:13:16,159
you know he calls me for advice um but

5888
03:13:14,238 --> 03:13:18,639
still one of one of my greatest friends

5889
03:13:16,159 --> 03:13:20,959
and i super appreciate him and then my

5890
03:13:18,639 --> 03:13:22,478
buddies from icmeg who i would not be

5891
03:13:20,959 --> 03:13:25,599
here without

5892
03:13:22,478 --> 03:13:27,679
my buddy stoney uh my buddy frost boss

5893
03:13:25,600 --> 03:13:29,040
my buddy prophet my buddy norcal my

5894
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:31,200
buddy dz

5895
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:32,399
um just all all the people that i kind

5896
03:13:31,200 --> 03:13:34,399
of came up with and that made

5897
03:13:32,398 --> 03:13:35,920
opportunities for me and gave me a

5898
03:13:34,398 --> 03:13:37,199
chance

5899
03:13:35,920 --> 03:13:38,478
when i was just trying to make a run of

5900
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:40,079
it out west a lot of these guys were

5901
03:13:38,478 --> 03:13:42,000
born and raised out here

5902
03:13:40,079 --> 03:13:43,600
and you know they didn't have to extend

5903
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:45,520
any hospitality or do anything of the

5904
03:13:43,600 --> 03:13:47,040
sort but they definitely gave me a lot

5905
03:13:45,520 --> 03:13:48,880
of opportunity

5906
03:13:47,040 --> 03:13:50,239
and a couple of my friends from chicago

5907
03:13:48,879 --> 03:13:52,559
um who

5908
03:13:50,238 --> 03:13:54,879
were basically the reason that i thought

5909
03:13:52,559 --> 03:13:56,639
that this was possible and

5910
03:13:54,879 --> 03:13:58,799
were the ones that it convinced me to

5911
03:13:56,639 --> 03:14:00,318
come back to the west coast after i

5912
03:13:58,799 --> 03:14:01,119
tried the first time and it didn't work

5913
03:14:00,318 --> 03:14:02,959
out

5914
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:04,319
and gave me an opportunity and kind of

5915
03:14:02,959 --> 03:14:06,799
just plugged me with with the right

5916
03:14:04,318 --> 03:14:08,000
people and you know were always there to

5917
03:14:06,799 --> 03:14:09,438
kind of help me even when i couldn't

5918
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:11,760
afford to pay them

5919
03:14:09,439 --> 03:14:14,079
um just really you know super grateful

5920
03:14:11,760 --> 03:14:15,200
and honestly for my mother and my

5921
03:14:14,079 --> 03:14:17,439
grandmother

5922
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:19,760
who in spite of me being completely

5923
03:14:17,439 --> 03:14:21,680
insane in their eyes have always

5924
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:23,359
supported me and encouraged me and never

5925
03:14:21,680 --> 03:14:24,960
told me that i was incapable of doing

5926
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:26,479
something and that's probably the best

5927
03:14:24,959 --> 03:14:27,759
advice that i would give anybody who's

5928
03:14:26,478 --> 03:14:30,799
actually taking the time to listen to

5929
03:14:27,760 --> 03:14:33,120
this is that you are completely capable

5930
03:14:30,799 --> 03:14:34,719
of doing it if you of whatever it is

5931
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:37,200
that you want to achieve if you're

5932
03:14:34,719 --> 03:14:39,840
willing to apply and work and work and

5933
03:14:37,200 --> 03:14:42,000
single-mindedly focus on something and

5934
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:44,079
be be good people don't let people take

5935
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:46,318
advantage of you and give give what you

5936
03:14:44,079 --> 03:14:46,318
