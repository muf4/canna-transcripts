coming on the show again

79
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,580
hey thanks for having me back man it's

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,919
been a while

81
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,560
yes super Keen I was looking at it it's

82
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:38,639
almost been a year since we last chatted

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,098
so really yeah it's flown by hey yeah

84
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,598
that's it seems like that was a quick

85
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:44,699
year because

86
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,560
it doesn't seem like that long that long

87
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,179
to me as it seems like we were just we

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,039
were just talking about uh the Bahama

89
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,060
drop but I guess I guess it's kind of

90
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,098
flown by

91
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,259
well hey you you touched on it yourself

92
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,759
I guess for a man who's been as

93
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,939
productive and as busy as yourself

94
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,759
probably not hard to understand why the

95
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,739
time's flown by give me a little bit of

96
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,539
a rundown on what's been going on for

97
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,819
you in the past year how did the Bahama

98
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:12,060
Mama drop go in your opinion

99
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:14,938
uh I think it went amazing I mean for us

100
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,500
it was it brought in a lot of new a lot

101
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:19,319
of new Growers maybe to the soulfire

102
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,379
brand uh like the just the way that we

103
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,839
um you know revealed it and just like

104
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:26,399
unfolded it for people on Instagram like

105
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,258
doing our reveals showing the pictures

106
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,779
that we grew

107
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,240
um I just thought I brought maybe a lot

108
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:35,819
more people into the fold

109
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,560
um so yeah I guess last time that you

110
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,540
and I got together

111
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,819
um that was a year ago we talked about

112
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,840
that was the first drop of Bahama then

113
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,519
this year we did a uh the the second uh

114
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,459
volume of it which was much smaller like

115
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,740
we sold out pretty much instantly like

116
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,779
it was just gone you know

117
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,180
um and it was just as cool and you know

118
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,799
now we're on to other things but yeah I

119
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,079
to answer your question I think the

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,660
Bahama was big for the soul fire Soul

121
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,939
fire brand we keep seeing just crazy

122
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,699
heat that people are are finding in

123
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:12,000
there and yeah it's awesome

124
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,939
I would have to 100 agree with you that

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,100
drop in my opinion was one of if not the

126
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,079
biggest in the past couple years in fact

127
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,699
and a number of questions sort of

128
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,379
stemming from what you just answered so

129
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,139
then I guess the first place to start is

130
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,699
I noticed that the uh part two of the

131
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,340
Bahama Mama drop was a little more

132
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,080
limited I was curious to ask is there

133
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:32,459
any strains out of that drop that you

134
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,680
think will come to gain a bit more

135
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,478
notoriety even though maybe you didn't

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,579
get quite as many packs out as the first

137
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,319
drop

138
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:42,659
uh yeah so

139
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,819
I think I mean

140
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,620
I think like the weekend at Gary's I

141
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,000
think it was our first opener with like

142
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:53,579
a Gary strain uh or a great Gary cross

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,620
that and the gas nana I mean

144
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,319
some of the things that we just saw in

145
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,519
that which the gas Nano was

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,620
um was banana runs with with Gary Payton

147
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,899
and just some of the banana flavors that

148
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,360
we saw in there that weekend at Gary's

149
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,339
is is so just greasy and it's such a

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,319
good breeder that Gary

151
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,599
um I think those ones are gonna when

152
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,180
when people really dive into them I mean

153
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,560
I had to I did a remake so I don't know

154
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,418
a lot of people I guess it's the first

155
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,680
place you'll you'll hear it

156
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:25,318
um because I haven't told anybody this

157
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,939
but I did a remake of a lot of the

158
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,860
strains that we ran out of that people

159
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,199
fell in love with from the Bahama drops

160
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,460
so like Bahama Berry which is from

161
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,000
volume one

162
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:37,439
um we sold so many of those and people

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,478
just keep asking for it and there's so

164
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,478
many ones that they love of that same

165
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,579
thing with the weekend at Gary's so

166
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,639
um I remade some of those I also did

167
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,359
some bx's and

168
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,120
um

169
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,120
and yeah and then we remade the Bahama

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,519
S1 because that went out as a freebie

171
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,340
and for the first month of the Bahama

172
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,439
the first Bahama drop and you know I

173
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:02,939
think we gave up gave away like 30 000

174
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,579
of those

175
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,560
um so now we've remade the Bahama S1 as

176
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,478
a as a retail pack it'll just be priced

177
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,759
at our normal our normal pack price and

178
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:14,038
that'll that'll drop sometime after this

179
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,259
mindful maybe a month or so a month or

180
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,818
two so yeah

181
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,580
um but to answer the question I think

182
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,240
out of out of that second

183
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:23,879
um

184
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,740
the second release I think for me

185
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,759
weekend at Gary's is probably going to

186
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,360
be one that we see a lot of the

187
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,180
um

188
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,740
I don't know the lemon peel I mean the

189
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,598
lemon peel cross

190
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,759
the Bahama peel there I think the hash

191
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,978
lovers once they really get in there and

192
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,479
they start finding the the terp profiles

193
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,639
in there like when we were trimming up

194
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,199
all the the testers oh my God I was

195
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,400
trimming it with a couple hash guys and

196
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,139
you know they were just trying to walk

197
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,579
out the out the door with their all the

198
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,900
bags they trimmed they're like I'm

199
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,538
writing my name on this one I'm taking

200
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,579
this one home you know what I mean so

201
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:59,219
just there's just so much in that second

202
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:00,538
I wish I had more of I wish I would have

203
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,160
had more of them to share with people we

204
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:04,978
just didn't

205
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,479
yeah what a great answer and many of the

206
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:09,000
strains you mentioned were some of the

207
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,560
ones that I had sort of earmarked myself

208
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,478
and you know it's funny you mentioned

209
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,220
the Bahama berries I I popped a pack of

210
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,918
that myself because it caught my eye so

211
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,919
there you go you are so nice speaking to

212
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:22,740
the Testament of it uh the gas the gas

213
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,478
Nana man it's got some traction behind

214
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,180
it undoubtedly a lot of people I've

215
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,399
spoken to are really excited for it it's

216
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,680
an interesting pairing as well how would

217
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,240
you describe the flavors do you get the

218
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,918
banana coming through or is it more

219
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,899
dominated by the Gary

220
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,778
no the the banana comes through strong

221
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,879
so I was a little scared to do it like

222
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,559
you know I was like oh I don't know

223
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,019
exactly how this is gonna go I know

224
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,018
Gary's a great breeder and I know the

225
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:53,759
banana runs that I was using was very

226
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:56,700
candy banana very creamy Laffy Taffy

227
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,039
fake banana and I was like you know if I

228
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,899
can get

229
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,079
if I can get what I'm looking for out of

230
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,659
this which is like a a greasy gassy but

231
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,920
yet still fake banana smell then I'll be

232
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:09,539
happy and

233
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,278
I'm happy to say that like we

234
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:12,899
accomplished that so there's a there's

235
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,759
some green phinos in there and then

236
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:17,458
there's like some jet black phinos in

237
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,319
there as well so our selection of that

238
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,379
the one that we kept

239
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,140
which I didn't even find it so I so uh

240
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:28,439
our partners here in in Seattle uh no

241
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:30,659
mids they found the one that I actually

242
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,040
um I actually kept I found a bunch of

243
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:34,439
great ones like the ones I pictured and

244
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,500
showed were great but the one that he

245
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,320
found is just so intense with the banana

246
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,778
terp like that fake candy banana terp I

247
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,480
had to I had to keep his and it's yeah

248
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:48,080
so I guess the base best way I can

249
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,778
explain it is like a super

250
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,000
mechanic shop greasy smell which I

251
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:56,700
believe comes from the Gary and then

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,139
that fake banana so something completely

253
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,519
different than you'll see in a banana

254
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,100
runs but

255
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,480
very intense very intense Great Taste

256
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,300
too

257
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,019
sounds beautiful and while we're on the

258
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:12,539
topic of uh Gracie gas I noticed that

259
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,278
the Manda sold out very quickly from the

260
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:16,919
Bahama Mama series and not not

261
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,080
surprising do you think that you'll re

262
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,479
look to remake that one at all it seems

263
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,940
like it was extremely popular

264
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,060
uh maybe I don't think I'll remake it

265
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,880
but I may I may go through it and and

266
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,739
use it later

267
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,659
in another project but I don't have any

268
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,019
plans to remake it and it wasn't in our

269
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:39,059
in our remake schedule for um

270
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:43,139
for the ones that we just remade with

271
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:47,639
the with the Bahama so a short answer no

272
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:51,000
not looking to to uh remake that one but

273
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,379
possibly look through it hunt a bunch of

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,120
them and maybe find something to work

275
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,700
out of there

276
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,159
yeah beautiful stuff and would you say

277
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,320
that in general uh one of the sort of

278
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:04,980
strategies you use as a breeder is that

279
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,600
you do look to continue the breeding

280
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,339
forward each generation so like you say

281
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,560
you make the man do this cross and then

282
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,300
next one maybe you breed with that and

283
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,500
like keep working it forward or do you

284
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:18,719
sometimes just go back to the same thing

285
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,000
um I generally don't go back to the same

286
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,560
thing because I don't know we try to

287
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,480
keep it fresh we try to keep it unique

288
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,879
but if you've watched the pattern of

289
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,879
Soul fire I guess over the years you

290
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,039
know we've been out like six seven years

291
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,838
and a lot of our a lot of our lines come

292
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,939
from our original Black Banana line

293
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,399
right so

294
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,339
um a lot of them build on that

295
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,078
um so yeah I I would imagine to see some

296
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,760
offshoots if we sign if we find

297
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,739
something amazing but you know the the

298
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:51,179
Bahama that came from the original black

299
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,740
black banana line uh you know the the

300
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:56,099
Don Mega that came from our original

301
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:59,459
Black Banana Line This mind flare you

302
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,899
know it's it's a few steps from that

303
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,838
right because that was from the Yu jelly

304
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:06,299
but still you know originated from that

305
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,600
original work and I I think we just want

306
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,679
to see how far we can can push it and

307
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,540
how

308
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,219
how much we can improve it I guess if

309
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:16,679
that makes any sense

310
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,940
yeah definitely and I want to look back

311
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,379
to that but I got to quickly ask you

312
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,560
this question I've just been personally

313
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,778
curious about did you name the strain

314
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,599
Don Mega after your dog or is the dog

315
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:30,899
named after the strain oh no the dog is

316
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,700
named after this train yeah I love that

317
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,919
he's a cute dog I was like I would love

318
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,019
if this dog was called Don Mega it's

319
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:40,078
like such an imposing name on this cute

320
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:44,578
little dog yeah yeah so hopefully so

321
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:46,439
that's a he's a lilac fluffy Frenchie I

322
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:47,578
don't see any of them here in in Seattle

323
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,160

324
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:52,379

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,600
um I bought from a friend and I'm gonna

333
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,078
pair those two together so they're like

334
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,120
soulfire selected Frenchies I'm not

335
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:18,359
gonna have a bunch of Glitters it's not

336
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,459
my job it's not you know I'm not jumping

337
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,720
in the dog game that's not my not my

338
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,838
thing but

339
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,420
um I do find it super interesting like

340
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,040
that you should see the genetic profiles

341
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,679
that come with these dogs right like

342
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:35,278
they break it down to the allele

343
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,539
um so it's really cool to to see the

344
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,939
breeding that's going on with these dogs

345
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,980
so I'm gonna have one litter maybe two

346
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,220
litters of some soul fire pups and that

347
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,039
that'll be it for me rifle lose her mind

348
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,620
she already doesn't want to do it

349
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,659
the the male one you mentioned she's a

350
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,220
cutie when I saw the photos of her I was

351
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:54,719
like man I don't think I've seen a male

352
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,660
Frenchie before

353
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,899
yeah the murals are are super cool man I

354
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:03,778
mean she's got uh she's uh she's a

355
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:06,480
chocolate chocolate try try Merle Coco

356
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:09,360
try so yeah yeah she's got like cocoa

357
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,940
Paws and then like that cow that cow

358
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,100
print look and just a personality and

359
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,459
she's super small she's like 22 pounds

360
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,040
and he he's like 20 he's supposed to

361
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:23,819
finish out at about 25 pounds 25 pound

362
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:25,078
fluffy so I love it I guess that uh the

363
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,260
breeding you're gonna do is just just

364
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:30,719
regular release only not Femmes

365
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,759
no yeah yeah no it's not even regular

366
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,519
like you have to go and get these guys a

367
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,338
C-section artificial inseminated it's

368
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,679
like a whole process that oh yeah yeah I

369
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,720
really wouldn't want to do all the time

370
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,578
you know what I mean and like at least

371
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,320
the Breeders that I got my dogs from

372
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:48,359
they don't they're not like puppy mills

373
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,060
they don't keep their dogs in cages or

374
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,980
you know anything like that like they're

375
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,359
like family dogs and that's how our dogs

376
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,699
are because

377
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,579
you know anything less than that I I

378
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:01,979
wouldn't I wouldn't deal with it so yeah

379
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,659
um yeah no they're great I I love them I

380
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,519
didn't I didn't really know

381
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,600
that was gonna fall in such love with

382
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,799
them but yeah they got great

383
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,259
personalities

384
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,299
beautiful I love it I love it well let's

385
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,278
go back to a question that we normally

386
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,838
start the episodes off with what have

387
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,078
you been smoking on

388
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,820
uh so right now mostly a lot of a lot of

389
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,859
hash rosins so I'm smoking mostly the

390
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,560
[ __ ] mind melter I washed a bunch of

391
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,459
it when we did our when we did our test

392
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,018
for the for the Mind flare run and um so

393
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,299
that one I mean that's our first Don

394
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:35,820
Mega Femme well actually yeah yeah

395
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,019
that's the Megamind the uh the Megamind

396
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,820
is what we watched I didn't wash the

397
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,139
wine melter uh that's what I've been

398
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,399
smoking on I I've been using my puffco

399
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:46,019
just because I could travel around with

400
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,278
it you know I just gotta travel around

401
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:50,639
that [ __ ] thing when I'm on the run

402
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,379
and [ __ ] and then I I actually uh put

403
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,180
some in some little pens just for me in

404
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:55,679
the you know for the me and the homies I

405
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,979
just give them pass them out some pens

406
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,259
and and dude it blows man like

407
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,600
sometimes I forget you know when you put

408
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,759
when you have hat like good hash rosin

409
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,459
in a [ __ ] pen

410
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,740
um I was in the this is a horrible story

411
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:12,838
but I was in the uh grocery store the

412
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,579
other day and I was like I was in the

413
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,220
mid aisle I was looking at some [ __ ] and

414
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:19,138
then I just rip on this [ __ ] pen in

415
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,060
you know and I just blow it out I I

416
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,680
guess I forgot where the [ __ ] I was at

417
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,778
you know and

418
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,239
I look over in this like old lady is

419
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,338
looking at me like what the [ __ ] oh my

420
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,899
God what the [ __ ] are you doing and she

421
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,560
just got hit with this Cloud I was like

422
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:37,078
oh God but yeah yeah it's it's you know

423
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,518
the thing about those uh hash browns and

424
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:39,958
pens is they actually smell like pot

425
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,060
when you blow them out I guess is the

426
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:45,000
more the point of the story it really

427
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:47,278
smells like you just smoke some pot and

428
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,958
whereas a lot of these other like pens

429
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:53,100
and [ __ ] you get from the store smell

430
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:55,739
like I don't know not like weed you know

431
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,480
so I guess that's why I I enjoy those

432
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,759
but yeah that's what I've been smoking

433
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,180
uh just a little bit the hash that I

434
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,099
made I got some um Bahama Bahama Berry

435
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:06,599
flour from Nomads

436
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,759
um yeah I smoked a joint of that the

437
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,938
other day it was pretty tight

438
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,220
um so yeah I had a nice strawberry

439
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,620
stripe nice strawberry on the exhale

440
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,000
which is [ __ ] so I can't wait till

441
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,500
you grow yours and we'll see if you get

442
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,240
the if you get the strawberry on the

443
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,880
exhale you're gonna have to let me know

444
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,298
yeah look super Keen I'll keep you

445
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,340
filled in and uh Forever on listening uh

446
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:31,558
we're specifically gonna drop this

447
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,359
episode on the first when uh the new

448
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,399
mind flayer release comes out so why

449
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,619
don't we use this opportunity to sort of

450
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,900
dive into it and take a little quick

451
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:42,058
rundown of some of the strains in the

452
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,220
drop if that works for you sure unless

453
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,200
yeah let's get into it let's do it well

454
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,900
look we've already sort of spoken about

455
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,640
the mine melter a little bit what sort

456
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,080
of additional characteristics would you

457
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
mention about this one would you say

458
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,279
that it's specifically made for the

459
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,859
concentrate enthusiast

460
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,720
uh no I wouldn't go that far and I I

461
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:02,579
just I can't go that far because I

462
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,860
haven't washed a bunch of them right so

463
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,599
I watched the Megamind I watched the

464
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:08,159
Megamind and that's the don don Mega

465
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,480
with the Mind flare and I already kind

466
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,340
of knew that I was gonna wash just

467
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,220
because you know Don Mega watched so

468
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,720
well and you know I had a bunch of them

469
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,360
that we tested and I had this one that

470
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,400
was just monster big huge plant

471
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,979
um and it was ugly as [ __ ] so I'll just

472
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,019
be honest it was super ugly but I was

473
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,880
like oh man yeah I was feeling that I

474
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,519
was feeling the the nugs I was like I

475
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,020
think this thing's probably gonna wash

476
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:33,480
and you know I did the trick where you

477
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,700
you cut off a nug and put in a in a

478
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,779
glass or a jar of ice and water and

479
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,460
shook it up

480
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:40,558
maybe it'll look like a snow globe in

481
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,298
there you know and uh I called up the

482
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,558
homeboy and I was like man I sent him a

483
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:44,759
little video of it I said what do you

484
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:47,160
think you think the thing's going on

485
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,079
she's like oh yeah I think it is so you

486
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,820
know I I froze that one and washed it

487
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,019
and that's the [ __ ] that I was smoking

488
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,759
but um

489
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:55,918
I can't say that

490
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,359
that uh

491
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,860
you know the everything in there I

492
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,918
wouldn't make a claim like that until we

493
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:05,159
get some more feedback from other people

494
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,780
uh on that so but there's a lot of cool

495
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,360
stuff in there

496
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:12,000
a man of integrity I love that I think

497
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,659
uh some breeders would just happily say

498
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,179
that every strain washes very well

499
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,340
no I can't I can't I can't uh I can't

500
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:23,700
attest to that I I watched the the

501
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:26,519
Megamind it dumped for me it was like

502
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,679
really pretty pretty hash and I I try to

503
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,879
only keep the best and I still got you

504
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,100
know I don't keep like the full spec

505
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,860
like all the bags or anything and I I

506
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:37,019
felt like I got a really tight return

507
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:39,599
and I was happy with it so if you're

508
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,099
looking for a washer Dominic is always a

509
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,699
a good choice

510
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,279
um

511
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,980
to go with so Megamind other than that

512
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,119
you're on your own figure it out for

513
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,460
yourself

514
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,139
definitely and uh yeah Megamind my

515
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,538
apologies I had a brain fart there when

516
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,640
I said mine melter so the next one I'd

517
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:58,859
love to ask you about is the utter

518
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,840
Madness I think this one looks beautiful

519
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:03,418
based on the the photo you posted the

520
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,099
other day and the the parental lineage

521
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,080
is very appealing to a lot of people

522
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:09,359
especially those who are particularly

523
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,159
impressed by some of the photos of the

524
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,379
Bitties you put up in the Bahama Mama

525
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,840
drop what sort of plants can people

526
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,559
expect out of the utter Madness

527
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,298
super Frosty so this one I've seen it

528
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,160
now I grew it

529
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:25,440
um now we've seen growing with dragon

530
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,480
which is like a soul fire team member if

531
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,580
you're not familiar with them he's a

532
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,279
moderator in our Discord he's been he's

533
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,859
been you know growing our stuff for

534
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,379
years he has a YouTube channel a great

535
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,178
guy super helpful Dude too like he'll

536
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,860
answer any question you have just like I

537
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,798
will but I mean he's always there to

538
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:46,199
answer questions for for Growers so I

539
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:47,759
always send him we don't have testers at

540
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,100
soulfire

541
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,538
um not anybody can just test for us or

542
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,399
any of that so

543
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,740
but we have a few few different people

544
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,340
that have been with us for years that

545
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:02,400
are you know passionate about the brand

546
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:05,220
and just growing pot in general

547
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,840
um generally guys that grow in tents at

548
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,259
home right

549
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,599
um because that's I think my base is

550
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,879
mostly guys that grow at home and which

551
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:18,418
I'm very proud of

552
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,820
and he grew it and [ __ ] crushed it

553
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,620
um and then I saw no mid-seattle they I

554
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:26,159
was just down there looking at all their

555
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:28,319
ones and they're crazy so that structure

556
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,779
of the Bitties that people really loved

557
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,339
and that color that pink magenta that

558
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,599
Pop

559
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:38,819
um comes through and then

560
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,980
the Mind flare gives it to like

561
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,839
some more

562
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,159
stack even though it was already kind of

563
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,459
that Blockhead was already kind of

564
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,340
stacky and then the frost which I was

565
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,220
surprised on because the Bitties itself

566
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,839
um it wasn't the frostiest for me at

567
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,120
least that Blockhead cut the one that I

568
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,619
used in that cross it wasn't the

569
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,298
frostiest

570
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:03,479
um but these ones that come out from

571
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:05,339
this cross are insanely Frosty so it's a

572
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,640
good it's a good choice and it's kind of

573
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:12,119
got like a fruity

574
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,220
parfait like a fruit yogurt smell to it

575
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,500
it's cool it's definitely if you're into

576
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,240
colors you're into Frost

577
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,400
um and you're into something finishing

578
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,960
early like the the those pictures that

579
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,559
we the picture we put up from the

580
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,940
Bitties reveal dude that's day 48.

581
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,279
really

582
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,120
that's day 48.

583
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:35,158
I had no idea yeah so and I saw the

584
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,899
exact same thing when I grew up

585
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,020
and I saw the exact same thing that I

586
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,659
just saw down at no mid-seattle they're

587
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:45,418
at the scene they're at the same day as

588
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:47,700
um Dragon over in in Michigan and there

589
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,860
it's it looks to most guys they would

590
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,980
call that done I mean obviously dragon

591
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:55,558
and Nomads and myself were taking it to

592
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,019
63. for me as a rule of thumb I like to

593
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:00,418
take everything to 63.

594
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:01,918
um but these look damn near finished at

595
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,620
48.

596
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,000
so if you're looking for a fast strain

597
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:08,759
if you're looking for something to be

598
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,558
done quick uh utter Madness is probably

599
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,058
probably something you want to go for

600
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,158
for sure

601
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:16,558
that's brilliant and you you sort of

602
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,500
touched on a a general thread I wanted

603
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,839
to swing by you which was that at least

604
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,759
from my perspective it seems as though

605
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,879
there's some amount of conscious

606
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,980
decision making going into trying to

607
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,780
beef up the yields and I feel like as a

608
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,000
community we've sort of backed ourselves

609
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,038
into a corner with some of the hype

610
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,298
strains it feels like more and more it's

611
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,339
just accepted that you're going to get

612
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,798
smaller yields but I feel like your work

613
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:42,298
largely speaking has all of those exotic

614
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:43,319
characteristics but as you just

615
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:45,538
mentioned you're trying to pull the

616
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,579
flowering times down a bit and getting a

617
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:48,960
bit better structure and yield is this

618
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,658
something you did consciously think

619
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,079
about or am I just like wishful thinking

620
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:57,840
no you're right so you know when I

621
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,460
looked at the Bahama line

622
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,319
there was some

623
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,220
crosses in there that were extremely

624
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:07,558
heavy so like the Bahama Berry heavy uh

625
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,600
NFC could be very heavy creature Panic

626
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:11,220
heavy but some of the other ones were

627
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,480
not as heavy as I would like them still

628
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,120
Frosty's still beautiful still

629
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,460
everything you want to see in in an

630
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,979
exotic strain still have the turb still

631
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,960
taste amazing when you smoke it just all

632
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,019
the things you want but we're trying to

633
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,980
maybe make that stack better and so like

634
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:31,259
whereas the Bahama would be a lot more

635
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,240
flour very little leaves great for

636
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,558
trimming you know what I mean sometimes

637
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,140
you know there's just a little bit of

638
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,538
elongation in there that I was trying to

639
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,820
on this drop

640
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:48,480
trying to shorten trying to fill in that

641
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:50,819
stack and I feel like that's you know

642
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,220
what what mindful brings to the table is

643
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:55,859
an amazing stack and a faster faster

644
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,579
finish a faster ripening

645
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:59,459
um

646
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:03,298
and then like a chocolatey more

647
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:06,000
grease your terp to it and it looks like

648
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:08,038
uh in my opinion from what I've grown

649
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,440
and what I've seen Grown

650
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,359
um it it really brought some Frost to it

651
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,840
which I wasn't expecting I was expecting

652
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:17,699
a lot less frosts to be honest

653
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,879
um from the Mind from the Mind flow drop

654
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,279
but we got lucky and we got we got some

655
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,200
Frost out of it but it wasn't it wasn't

656
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,899
what I was breeding for with this with

657
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,419
this drop there you go happy accidents

658
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:33,000
are always welcome they happen yeah and

659
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,799
while we're on the topic give me a

660
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,500
little bit of a rundown about what it

661
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,658
was about the mine flyer when you first

662
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,538
saw it or whenever it happened that made

663
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,880
you decide this is the next uh pollen

664
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:47,038
donor to do what impressed you about it

665
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,580
oh it was the smoke on this one like

666
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:53,400
well the smoke and the interesting story

667
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:57,000
that that the Mind flow that we use from

668
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:59,400
this actually came from uh my my good

669
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,240
friend Vic from King County kennels who

670
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:06,120
who had grown and I gave him a box of uh

671
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,099
of beans way back in the day and he grew

672
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:09,599
that and he was like bro look at this

673
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:12,418
thing and I came over and looked at it

674
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,819
it has like all these crowns and and

675
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,740
fingers coming out of it and wild leaves

676
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:19,079
and just super and he was like and you

677
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,519
know it finishes super early and I was

678
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,899
like dude that's awesome let me let me

679
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,119
get that and I held on to it for a long

680
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,740
time and grew it a bunch of times the

681
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,599
homeboys grew it they grew it you know

682
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,940
they mono cropped it they're loving it

683
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,500
and I was like dude I love this [ __ ] so

684
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,140
you know shout out to Vic for for

685
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,900
turning me on to to that that plant and

686
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,659
I mean I think that happens a lot I

687
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,640
we have a tight group of friends type

688
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,299
group of Growers that we hang out we all

689
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,980
grow [ __ ] together you know and and if

690
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:48,839
they grow something of mine or or

691
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,099
anything they they were like oh dude

692
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:52,619
this is tight you should you know check

693
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,418
this out and then I grow it and so I

694
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,759
think you need that that community and

695
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:59,640
then to select from I'm lucky enough to

696
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,619
have it really so yeah beautiful stuff

697
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,179
and it as you said it's sort of a

698
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,759
testament to the work that can be done

699
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,259
when you uh have like a bunch of friends

700
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,579
helping out I was just thinking of that

701
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,379
saying what is it you know it takes a

702
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:11,879
village to raise a child it's almost a

703
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,140
bit like that to find the right pollen

704
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:19,559
donor yeah no for sure like soulfire

705
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:21,059
you know I I love coming on and doing um

706
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,359
podcasts and talking about the company

707
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:26,819
and and and being on Discord and talking

708
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:29,459
with people about you know the brand and

709
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:33,000
what we're doing but it's no by no means

710
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,159
me I mean there's a it's a big

711
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,778
it's a big thing to get it done it's a

712
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,419
big thing to get your seeds out it's a

713
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:41,759
big thing to select plants and it's it's

714
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,320
not just me at all it's a bunch of

715
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,778
people that make it happen and if they

716
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,158
weren't there or they weren't

717
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:49,259
um helping me out it would it just

718
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,419
wouldn't be it wouldn't be done so it's

719
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,720
no one-man band over here

720
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,340
that's it shout out to the whole team

721
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,200
shout out to the whole team as well as

722
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:59,579
your uh lovely lady I know she does a

723
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,360
lot of work behind the scenes as well

724
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:04,918
yeah she she does the most

725
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:06,778
undoubtedly so if we take a look at the

726
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,179
next mine player drop one of the really

727
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:11,220
caught my eye was the turn because I

728
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,519
don't believe I had seen you use the

729
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,319
rose cake before as a as a mother tell

730
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,319
us a little bit about the rose cake and

731
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,939
then how did the turn work out with it

732
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,460
yeah so

733
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,440
that one I will say so we got that from

734
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,019
Bellevue cannabis um they had it they

735
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,120
were growing it for a long time

736
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,759
um I just love the chirp on it I love

737
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,798
this the the creaminess of it the the

738
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,200
cakiness of it I was always a big fan of

739
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,519
like I don't know the cakeier strains

740
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,259
like the wedding cakes and things like

741
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,019
that way back when they were like the

742
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:45,359
cool thing you know and and

743
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:47,220
um just the look you know me I love pink

744
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:50,099
I love pink

745
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,960
pot I think that it's

746
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:53,278
I don't know I think it's underrepresent

747
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,259
you know under

748
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,179
represented

749
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:59,819
um out there in the strains and it just

750
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,140
it was unique it totally caught my eye

751
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,460
and I was like you know what let me grow

752
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,100
this a few times

753
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,620
I grew it a few times I probably sat on

754
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:10,319
it I don't know

755
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:12,418
months and months like you know I grew

756
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,859
it quite a few times before I really was

757
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,419
like you know what let's let's put this

758
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,339
in and then

759
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,799
you know then we had to grow it from

760
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:22,079
there again we had to grow the progeny

761
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:25,079
out and the progeny the smell is just

762
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,658
amazing you know the fruity cakey smell

763
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:30,359
is awesome so that's why I made it

764
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:33,240
lovely stuff and how do you think the

765
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,979
The Strain turnt ended up incorporating

766
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,480
you know the Mind Flair and the rose

767
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,058
cake

768
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,940
uh

769
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:44,819
uh I mean I think it's at least gonna

770
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,880
bring that the the time down not the the

771
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:50,099
rose cake was even a fast uh or a long

772
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,840
flower because it wasn't

773
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:53,099
um so I just think with the Mind flavor

774
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,439
we're always bring it we're bringing

775
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,240
these times down a little bit

776
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,000
um and then

777
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,980
you know the one I think it might be the

778
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,798
next one that we reveal actually it just

779
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,839
it has a lot of color it has

780
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,879
it has a lot to it it has a lot to it

781
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,199
and I think really the terp is what it

782
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,720
is

783
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,500
um I'm trying to select

784
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,480
for good smelling things that that

785
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,460
people are gonna like I mean we got to

786
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,839
get some different stuff out here you

787
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,480
know because there's just

788
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:27,240
you can only have gelato so many times I

789
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,759
love gelato gelato is amazing

790
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,259
um but we can only have so many variants

791
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,359
of that

792
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:35,158
um and we just gotta try to I maybe

793
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,379
that's why the Bahama was popular with

794
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,000
people because it was different like

795
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,220
there were some different there were

796
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,419
some different characteristics to it

797
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,100
um same thing with the Mind flare some

798
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,020
different characteristics and I think

799
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:48,599
that's kind of what the rose cake added

800
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,879
to this would be something different

801
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,579
yeah okay that's that's a great way to

802
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,159
sort of put it in just as a personal

803
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:58,139
thought I I feel like um

804
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,059
what you're saying is 100 correct right

805
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,038
like there can only be so many gelatos

806
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:05,278
but I also feel like you've done a good

807
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,898
job of uh helping to incorporate into

808
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,359
your work but also do it in a unique way

809
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,158
because if you look at like the why you

810
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,319
jelly and all the work that's come from

811
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,299
that I think there's a strong argument

812
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,339
to be made that like while there is

813
00:31:15,298 --> 00:31:19,440
gelato in there it's really like not

814
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:21,058
just gelato or even gelato derivative

815
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,340
you've sort of turned it into your own

816
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,740
thing do you think that that'll be a

817
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,599
sort of method you use going forward in

818
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,099
terms of like yeah maybe there is

819
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,319
cookies in a cross but it's not like

820
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:33,538
your regular cookies

821
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:36,178
right and I think that's I think what

822
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:39,058
what you said is what

823
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:41,399
um I think every breeder should do every

824
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:44,819
seed maker should do is try to make

825
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:47,579
something your own you know like it's

826
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,918
anybody can take two two hype cuts and

827
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,678
put them together and be like oh this is

828
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,179
that you know what I mean but make

829
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,179
something your own

830
00:31:54,179 --> 00:32:00,000
make it individual

831
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:01,919
and and unique and then and then

832
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,019
incorporate some of the flavors that are

833
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,778
already kind of out there and you'll see

834
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:08,099
that what you make is something new and

835
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:09,778
something all your own even though it

836
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:13,379
may have something that we've seen

837
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:16,200
before but you Incorporated your own

838
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,278
flavor with it so now it's it's all new

839
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,340
so

840
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,778
yeah don't just take two two cuts that

841
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,699
you you pick up at the farmer's market

842
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,859
slap them together and and think you did

843
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,240
something I think you gotta

844
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:29,219
kinda

845
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,798
you gotta make something first

846
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,380
so yeah certainly and that that's a

847
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,480
sentiment we hear echoed by many guests

848
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,860
I should have asked you earlier but I

849
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,200
think now's a good time before we keep

850
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:42,658
moving on when I pop those Bahama Berry

851
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,120
seeds in Minecraft if the Australian

852
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:47,278
federal police is listening oh geez when

853
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,439
I when I put those seeds they raced out

854
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,659
the gate and I thought beautiful healthy

855
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,980
seeds what I want to see and then it got

856
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,440
me wondering because I don't actually

857
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,419
ask this question enough on the show how

858
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,100
long do you think it takes for a seed to

859
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,080
become fully viable because in the past

860
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:03,058
I think I've said to someone as long as

861
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,460
you give like the seed like six weeks on

862
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:08,158
the plant it should probably you know be

863
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,480
pretty happy do you do you let it really

864
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,159
go because I've heard some people like

865
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,659
they just let the plant go to like 13

866
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,820
weeks you know because it's just like

867
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,620
more is better maybe I don't know where

868
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:18,599
do you stand on that one are we talking

869
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,918
about when we're harvesting seeds yeah

870
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,719
if you're just because a lot of our

871
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,759
listeners like to make their own seeds

872
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,600
how long do you think it takes

873
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:29,819
right it does not take that long so uh

874
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,339
we've had this debate as well

875
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:34,558
um when I'm making seeds I'll I pretty

876
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:36,480
much run the plant

877
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,278
um the same amount of time as if like we

878
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,740
were flowering the plant sometimes if

879
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,419
you let them go for too long

880
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,339
um those seeds will start to crack and

881
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,919
you'll start to they'll split open and

882
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,240
the seeds will still be viable uh but

883
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,100
they look weird like you'll see along

884
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,159
the edge there'll be like a little split

885
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:54,959
opening and I just don't know how long

886
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,720
those seeds will probably hold hold on

887
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,720
the Shelf uh as much when they have like

888
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,600
an actual air hole in there but yeah I

889
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,558
think to answer your question I you know

890
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:11,279
I'll bring the plants down about 63 hang

891
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:14,338
them and and let them just completely

892
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,899
completely dry I would imagine and this

893
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:17,699
is just anecdotal

894
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:20,039
um that those seeds are still ripening

895
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:22,618
while they're drying so they're still

896
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:25,559
probably going through like a you know

897
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:28,800
some sort of growth process of ripening

898
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:30,059
on the vine so you know I give them a

899
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,820
long dry

900
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:34,199
while they're hanging I wait mostly

901
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,419
because it's just

902
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,759
absolutely irritating to try to sort

903
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:43,858
seeds in any kind of stock that's still

904
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,659
wet or not 100 bone dry especially for

905
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:48,418
the way that that we do it our technique

906
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:50,639
by using the easy seed so

907
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,319
let them go to 63

908
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,919
hang them up

909
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,260
and then let them you know get a solid

910
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,118
solid drive maybe two weeks even and

911
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,160
then easy seat amount and then they

912
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,160
should go in your in your uh

913
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:08,098
refrigerator for a winterization for I

914
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:10,559
don't know a month to 45 days

915
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:12,480
yeah beautiful info there I love that

916
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,759
and you know what I had seen those

917
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,460
cracked seeds before and uh did wonder

918
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,960
what the situation with that was and I I

919
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,300
got a surprisingly really good

920
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,159
germination from them so I I yeah you

921
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,960
will I really was a bit confused because

922
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,179
I was sort of expecting them to not Germ

923
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,740
at all so thank you for that info yeah

924
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:30,480
so I wouldn't worry about that like

925
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:32,399
those ones that have the if they have a

926
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,019
little crack in it they're they're gen

927
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,820
they generally pop just fine I don't

928
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:37,920
know if they're gonna sit you know make

929
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,539
it like 10 15 years because sometimes we

930
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,159
pop seeds that are like 10 years old man

931
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:42,838
and have no problem as long as they keep

932
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:44,460
refrigerated not in your freezer but

933
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,039
refrigerated

934
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,960
um seeds will last a decade in my

935
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,338
experience but

936
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,380
um yeah people freak out man about

937
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:54,000
Caesar like oh these seeds are these

938
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,619
seeds are so pale or these seeds don't

939
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,099
have tiger stripes right these seeds are

940
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,780
dude seeds are like phinos right every

941
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,280
plant has a different different looking

942
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:06,300
seed

943
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,119
um Don Mega seeds are super pale

944
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:12,780
beautiful germination cookies and cream

945
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,460
seeds from from Mike Super pale

946
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,519
like white pill

947
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,780
pop amazing so seeds are different and

948
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,639
don't think oh this one doesn't have

949
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,260
tiger stripes it's that tiger stripe

950
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,639
[ __ ] just rubs right off it's just

951
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,119
outside coating

952
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:29,338
so that's just you know it's just it's

953
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,260
just seeds are different remember like

954
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:32,880
Gorilla Glue back in the day anything

955
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,760
that you cross the Gorilla Glue

956
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:40,140
absolutely itty bitty tiny seeds tiny

957
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,200
micro seeds yeah so some great info

958
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:45,480
there I love it and as uh you mentioned

959
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,098
earlier you know you you make a lot of

960
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,780
seeds you give away a lot of freebies

961
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:51,300
and so I'm imagining you must end up

962
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,040
with a lot of like I love giving away

963
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,960
freebies can we give away free how do we

964
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,400
give away freebie [ __ ] here oh let's do

965
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,960
it bro let's figure it out maybe we'll

966
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,400
do it through our Discord I was inspired

967

redundant statement you're probably

971
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,598
already on there because it's so good

flare boxes Give It Away on your Discord

980
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,420
it'd be awesome oh my God people

981
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,260
get get them stoked I'm gonna I'm gonna

982
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,180
have to be like 500 renamed entries in

983
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,220
that cross because this box is insane

984
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:33,598
and we'll talk about it soon I did just

985
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:35,639
want to quickly ask you before we move

986
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,760
on what do you think is the best thing

987
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,379
to do with all of the uh material that's

988
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,940
left over after you've shucked all the

989
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,800
seeds out because it sounds like you dry

990
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,539
it till it's really crispy so the seeds

991
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,980
come out easily what do you think is the

992
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:48,960
best thing to do with that spent

993
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,199
material so to speak

994
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,599
I just throw it away it's gross

995
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:57,358
um I just throw it away because there's

996
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:59,280
something there's some sort of you know

997
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:02,400
chemical change that happens when a

998
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,119
plant is actually pollinated versus it's

999
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,000
just left to flower and never you know

1000
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,720
and never get that pollination so

1001
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,940
um

1002
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,259
yeah all that extra material I just I

1003
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,260
just throw it right away I don't think

1004
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,420
it would make anything very good it

1005
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,760
smells great and it it looks pretty

1006
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,940
decent but yeah no I don't keep it

1007
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,460
I just and the way you know the way I do

1008
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:29,280
it I do it in like a big pan

1009
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,159
and like a like a barbecue pan or like a

1010
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,599
baking pan type deal and then I I shuck

1011
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,098
a plant off in there and then I'll just

1012
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,920
you know with gloved hands just sit

1013
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:40,740
there and break it up into the finest

1014
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,200
material and then then you kind of like

1015
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:45,419
pan for gold to get your seeds to go to

1016
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,578
the bottom and then you just remove that

1017
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,420
top layer and then I run it through the

1018
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:53,880
easy seed and boom it just it just

1019
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,519
cleans them up I it was absolutely hell

1020
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,440
before that machine to be honest

1021
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,838
with the volume you're doing I I can

1022
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,420
only imagine the frustration before you

1023
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,820
had that so yeah oh God it was a

1024
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,159
nightmare glad to hear the easy seed has

1025
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,900
made life easier for you we just

1026
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,199
mentioned the um the Box you're doing

1027
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,300
and I love I love the box it's a it's a

1028
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,980
concept that's catching on among the

1029
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,900
community I guess before we delve into

1030
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,000
the specifics of the Mind player drop

1031
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,440
I'd just like to quickly ask do you

1032
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,699
think you'll look to do a box going

1033
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,700
forward with most releases

1034
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,358
yeah sometimes I can some it just

1035
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,220
depends on how much stock we have

1036
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:35,819
um you know there's a new phenomenon

1037
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:38,519
coming on in America where

1038
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,920
um hydro stores because of the farmer

1039
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,679
Bill and because of seeds being you know

1040
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,858
quote unquote legal now

1041
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:49,019
um hydro stores are carrying

1042
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:52,078
seeds so you can just walk into a shop

1043
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:56,400
and buy seeds here and that's going to

1044
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,060
change the landscape when it comes to

1045
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,740
everything breeding

1046
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:04,679
where you buy your seeds all that stuff

1047
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:07,199
how it works breeders may need to scale

1048
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:08,759
up who knows you know but this is

1049
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,098
happening there's nothing we can do to

1050
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,839
to you just might as well roll with it

1051
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:16,079
because

1052
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:18,480
um that's going to be the new way so

1053
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,180
I think I like to do a box because I

1054
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,740
feel like I can give people a lot more

1055
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:26,460
um I try to generally try to keep it

1056
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:29,459
kind of small as far as like uh how many

1057
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,679
strains I put on a lineup

1058
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,019
um it's it's by it's by design that we

1059
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,838
only do six to eight because I think

1060
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:38,338
it's ridiculous to think that somebody's

1061
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,400
gonna go out and buy

1062
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:43,858
you know 18 of your strains

1063
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,139
and spend you know these guys will put a

1064
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,639
a lineup of like 18 different strains

1065
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:50,699
and they want 200 a pack for every

1066
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:51,659
strain that's crazy I like to do six to

1067
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,519
eight

1068
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:55,319
100 bucks a pack that's the soul fire

1069
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,719
standard right there and then in a box

1070
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,780
you just get all kinds of freebies and

1071
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:03,059
free [ __ ] and fun stuff and

1072
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:07,980
you know it's affordable it's definitely

1073
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:09,358
affordable so this box particularly we

1074
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,760
um a lot most of the time we just let

1075
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,319
Area 51 handle it because the logistics

1076
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,540
of getting them out to people are a pain

1077
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,820
in the ass and Area 51 is local so it's

1078
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:20,159
easy for us and let them deal with the

1079
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,059
headache but this time

1080
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,098
um

1081
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:24,838
I just went crazy pissed off the office

1082
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:26,579
and just pissed off and just said you

1083
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:29,219
know what let's make sure that every

1084
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,599
bank that wants 10 of them can get them

1085
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:34,019
you know

1086
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:36,660
and so yeah every every verified bank

1087
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:39,239
had an opportunity every verified vendor

1088
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:41,578
had an opportunity to get 10 so you'll

1089
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:44,039
be able to get them from from them if

1090
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:46,680
they if they got in on it yeah beautiful

1091
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,239
to hear because uh if if the listeners

1092
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:50,578
haven't seen these books is very

1093
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,319
generous and there's a lot of cool swag

1094
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:54,060
in there particularly some of the the

1095
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,559
seeds in there that I'm not sure you can

1096
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:57,659
get elsewhere or at least not at the

1097
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:01,078
moment no and you never and you never

1098
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:04,379
will so yeah I put in it's one or the

1099
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,680
other on on the hood candy freebies that

1100
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:10,320
are in there and if you you'll get them

1101
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,460
in the box and and that's it so if you

1102
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,119
they won't be in part of the hood

1103
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,800
Kenny's drop yeah love it and look uh

1104
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,900
you know a lot of cool swag in there

1105
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,820
especially the hood candies freebies you

1106
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,500
mentioned and uh if people have been

1107
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,300
paying close attention they might have

1108
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,659
picked up some little clues that the

1109
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,700
hood candies feminized uh lineup is in

1110
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:31,858
the pipeline do you want to give us

1111
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:33,179
maybe a little idea idea about what it

1112
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:35,098
was about the hood candies that

1113
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:38,219
stimulated you to look at it as the next

1114
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:40,559
line to work forward

1115
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:41,939
yeah I just loved I mean first the

1116
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,338
community loved it they're always

1117
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,838
they've been asking for forever I kind

1118
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:48,059
of just hadn't done it because we had

1119
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,159
all these other projects going

1120
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:52,199
um and then you know I was just like all

1121
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,819
right it's time you know let's let's do

1122
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,858
this but we got to do it right you know

1123
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,240
we got to have the right crosses in

1124
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:59,098
there this one we're really going for

1125
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:02,039
flavor you know this one we're really

1126
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,720
going for smell I mean that's what

1127
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:06,659
we're going for Terps on this one that's

1128
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:10,318
what we bred for and and it's in testing

1129
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:12,179
now so I really can't it it may you may

1130
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,759
see it pop up in September you may not

1131
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:16,379
it just really depends on how how it

1132
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,200
goes so

1133
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:21,660
nice and you just got my brain sort of

1134
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,519
ticking there do you try to have a

1135
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:25,440
certain amount of releases per year like

1136
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,318
say two a year or is it really just like

1137
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,179
up to the whims of how it works out

1138
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,460
is really up to the whims of how it

1139
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:36,059
works out I mean it could be none of

1140
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:39,179
your if if everything just comes out meh

1141
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:41,219
or it doesn't meet the criteria

1142
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:43,139
um to stay relevant I believe you have

1143
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,199
to you know keep it unique keep it fresh

1144
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:48,598
has to be fire you know every time and

1145
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:51,239
if it I'm kind of going for a soul fire

1146
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,859
signature look like if it has that

1147
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,419
signature look if you can look at my

1148
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:56,400
pictures if you can look at things that

1149
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,838
other people grow and say yeah that

1150
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,000
soulfire right there I don't even need

1151
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,039
you to tell me I don't need you to tell

1152
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,739
me who who grew that or who bred that

1153
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,719
because that's a soul fire strain and I

1154
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:09,059
think that's what we're striving to

1155
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,519
become something where you

1156
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:13,199
you look at it and you know and the only

1157
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,139
way to do that is through proper

1158
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,578
selection and being able to say no or

1159
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:19,139
being able to say this doesn't make it

1160
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:21,300
into the line or this this whole line

1161
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:24,420
doesn't make it out to the public

1162
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,039
so yeah maybe you know you never know

1163
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,300
sometimes things just don't don't make

1164
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,800
it so even though we talk about it now

1165
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,859
you see some freebies

1166
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,380
in a box or you you there's some you

1167
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:35,699
know Whispers of a of that line coming

1168
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,900
if it doesn't make it through our

1169
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:39,179
quality of

1170
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,940
it won't be there that's great to hear a

1171
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:43,500
good sort of uh quality assurance and I

1172
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,679
guess to talk a little more General

1173
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,380
about say how could I phrase this your

1174
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:51,598
sort of trajectory as a breeder I

1175
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,160
certainly have noticed that you're

1176
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,079
you're doing things in this very

1177
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:57,960
professional sort of way in the sense

1178
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,940
that like often I don't even hear about

1179
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,740
your work like a lot of breeders they'll

1180
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,900
tell you hey I'm testing this out blah

1181
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,759
blah blah your work it's professional in

1182
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,019
that it you just hear about the drop

1183
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,520
coming and the testing's already

1184
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:10,858
happened and you you didn't even know

1185
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,358
about it and I wonder is this something

1186
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:13,739
you're intentionally doing moving

1187
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:15,480
forward because it certainly feels like

1188
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:17,338
it could be a paradigm shift where

1189
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,599
that's how breeders start working where

1190
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:19,920
it's like you don't really know what I'm

1191
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:21,119
doing right now but you'll hear about it

1192
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,858
in six months

1193
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,960
right I mean I think that's how they

1194
00:45:22,858 --> 00:45:27,779
should be working if you're not growing

1195
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,780
if you personally aren't making your

1196
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,819
seeds and growing your seeds then you

1197
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,099
shouldn't be dropping your seeds it's

1198
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:37,079
that it's that simple so if you make

1199
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,359
something you grow it and you feel like

1200
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,920
it's awesome and it was awesome for you

1201
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,659
then you can have confidence in giving

1202
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,818
it to other people so uh yeah there's no

1203
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:50,759
there's no like this is the upcoming

1204
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:53,519
dropping it's happening for sure because

1205
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,980
I want it to that's that's not how it

1206
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,039
works it's not I can't will it to happen

1207
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,599
it has to happen because it was quality

1208
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,679
enough for it to happen

1209
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,338
so I I think that's probably how a lot

1210
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,980
of

1211
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:09,119
breeders maybe I don't know I I don't I

1212
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,059
only really

1213
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,680
[ __ ] with like my mic and and the guys

1214
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:15,358
in my circle so I don't know what the

1215
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,098
other people do I don't really pay much

1216
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:18,000
attention to them

1217
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,800
um

1218
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,079
so I would hope that's how they do it

1219
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,818
yeah look I think it's going to be a

1220
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,280
growing Trend I just I always love it

1221
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:27,900
when a log on and I see a new upload

1222
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,780
from you because it's usually a very

1223
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,059
mouth-watering picture but if we just

1224
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,380
jump back to the hood candies you know

1225
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:36,420
we mentioned it's coming in the future

1226
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,400
it's looking promising I guess with

1227
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,440
everything we've said so far it might be

1228
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,358
a bit of a no-brainer that people look

1229
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,220
at the block monster and think hey this

1230
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:47,159
is the one tell us a little bit about

1231
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:49,078
the block monster that's coming out

1232
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,000
oh and the mind player dropped yeah so

1233
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:55,859
that that thing is it's just got this

1234
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,679
chocolatey Z Terps you know and it's it

1235
00:46:55,858 --> 00:47:01,799
was again a fast fast Vision finisher

1236
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:04,139
super Frosty uh really vigorous like

1237
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,420
early on in the garden it just it was a

1238
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:09,358
bully that's not a guy's name it was it

1239
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:11,338
was growing just so fast it was like you

1240
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:12,719
know bullying its neighbors around and I

1241
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:16,980
was like man this thing is a monster in

1242
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:18,719
here so um yeah it was it was a fun one

1243
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,559
it was a really a fun one to work with I

1244
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,939
think people are going to be really

1245
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:21,779
happy with I think we're gonna see a ton

1246
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,300
of great

1247
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,819
a great uh finals that come out of that

1248
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,099
yeah and I love it I love I love when

1249
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:32,159
people get it and then the joy that they

1250
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:34,680
get from growing it I mean that's a huge

1251
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:37,500
part of this for me the the reward I get

1252
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:39,480
from the happiness like the actual joy

1253
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:44,039
that people get from growing our strains

1254
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:48,179
I I talk to them every day every day

1255
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:51,300
um I I if you posted on Instagram

1256
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:53,338
you'd be don't be surprised if I pop up

1257
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,318
and like it and and say something about

1258
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:58,199
it because I if you're growing my gear

1259
00:47:55,318 --> 00:48:00,800
I'm I'm behind you 100 I'm you'll hear

1260
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:04,980
from me that's great to hear I love that

1261
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,140
so I did see on Instagram someone uh

1262
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,480
posted up a cross called Californian

1263
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:11,519
demon the LA Crush cake cross mine

1264
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,980
player and it got me wonderings right

1265
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,719
how many crosses do you make when you

1266
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,400
initially do a lineup and if you had to

1267
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,318
guess what percentage of them make it

1268
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,539
through to the end stage of like getting

1269
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:25,019
to Market

1270
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:27,420
yeah so we make a lot uh we we make a

1271
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:31,259
lot and we grow them all so I can't I

1272
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,000
don't know a a percentage of it but you

1273
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,480
know when we make a line it starts out

1274
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,858
very big and then we go through there

1275
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,920
and we look at

1276
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:42,719
who who gets to stay which which crosses

1277
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,480
are good enough and a lot of times a lot

1278
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:49,019
of them are amazing but just didn't work

1279
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:51,780
with this the design of this lineup it

1280
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:53,880
just didn't work with the flow of it so

1281
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:56,099
um you know I'll look at it I'll pick

1282
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,838
out which one do I you know this one's

1283
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,579
going to be a great Soul fire slap or

1284
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,920
sometimes sometimes a soul fire slap

1285
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:03,900
might not even be tested you know

1286
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,460
soulfire slap is such a it's a it's a

1287
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,160
community and that's what that that

1288
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,659
California demon is the soulfire slap is

1289
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,960
such a

1290
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:16,199
a community engagement uh

1291
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,000
a group thing you know a lot of times

1292
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:19,739
those aren't human tests those just go

1293
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,460
out as a soul fire slap you slap up a

1294
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:25,379
sticker you you put it in Discord

1295
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,940
um if it's awesome I'll post it on

1296
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,160

some more about some of the ones that

1308
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:55,318
you've tested with but I did want to

1309
00:49:53,639 --> 00:49:57,239
quickly mention it because you you spoke

1310
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:59,099
about you know your home is with exotic

1311
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:01,559
mic you don't really drift too far

1312
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:03,539
outside of your immediate circle people

1313
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,799
would probably be aware and if not you

1314
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:06,960
definitely need to get on to it you've

1315
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,300
been doing uh your own podcast with Mike

1316
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,318
The Grow life with the Bros tell me a

1317
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,760
little bit about that how's it been

1318
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:13,199
going for you being on the other side of

1319
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,720
the mic

1320
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:18,598
dude I you know what you know how that

1321
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:20,279
came about as I was just so inspired by

1322
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,660
our first meeting because you're such a

1323
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,099
good host you know what I mean I went

1324
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:25,019
back to Mike and I was like man you know

1325
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:26,760
I hate I never wanted to do these

1326
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:28,380
[ __ ] podcast things because honestly

1327
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,000
I don't like it to be ever about me

1328
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,338
because it's not about me like I was

1329
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,760
saying before soulfire is a team like

1330
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:38,519
from the guy in his that grows at home

1331
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,980
to you know Soul flower in the in the

1332
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:42,420
office that that sends out everything to

1333
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,579
all the workers in there to everybody

1334
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,139
else like are so much more important

1335
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:47,700
than me in this

1336
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:50,098
um so I never wanted to be like front

1337
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:51,000
for Face Forward front in front of the

1338
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:53,338
whole thing

1339
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,380
um but then you know I did your your uh

1340
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:58,380
podcast and a lot of people really

1341
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,059
enjoyed hearing about about you know the

1342
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,099
story and all that stuff and I was like

1343
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:05,400
man like we should do one but

1344
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:08,579
we should just do a podcast in Discord

1345
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:12,358
that's live where we can give away stuff

1346
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:14,480
and interact with the uh interact with

1347
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,400
the audience just right there

1348
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,780
and really just [ __ ] because that's

1349
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,119
what we do all the time anyway I mean

1350
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:23,040
the guy calls me you know every morning

1351
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,420

1352
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:28,019
just [ __ ] about everything that's

1353
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,000
going on from politics to pot to just

1354
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:31,440
what's going on in our life and so

1355
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,739
pretty much every morning we'll have a

1356
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,240
two-hour chat about just [ __ ] so so we

1357
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:38,279
wanted to put that in front of people in

1358
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,379
kind of a funny way and interact with

1359
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,800
people that uh

1360
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:46,318
that enjoy that so yeah so hey you were

live interaction component that is one

1367
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,079
of the aspects of this show but what did

1368
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:02,940
you think about Mike's rap verse in the

1369
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,099
start of the show look I still want to

1370
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,000
get uh Mike on the show so I'm not I'm

1371
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,000
not going to comment on it

1372
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:16,259

1376
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,900

as well when he was like with the milk

1378
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,220

turn that down so uh very appreciative

1413
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,940
nice all right yeah let's do it that

1414
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:43,679
sounds awesome so if we jump back to uh

1415
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,300
the the strandless from the mime player

1416
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,399
there's sort of only one that we haven't

1417
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,099
touched on too heavily which is the soul

1418
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,680
Sonic how do you feel the Gary paired

1419
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:56,160
with the uh the Mind player oh I felt it

1420
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:59,519
was great so I don't know man like that

1421
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:04,500
for anybody who's doing any projects or

1422
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:06,480
or working any lines I was a little um

1423
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,659
I don't know I was a little resistant on

1424
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:12,059
using the Gary uh at first I grew it and

1425
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:13,379
I liked it and I thought it was good you

1426
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:14,700
know it was really good I had a great

1427
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,800
smell

1428
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:19,259
um but something special happens when

1429
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,318
you um when you breed with it it breeds

1430
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,119
amazingly well so when we put it with

1431
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:25,800
that and you can just see from the the

1432
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:28,380
picture that I posted so we did like

1433
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:32,220
again we um a pre

1434
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:34,559
a pre exclusive with that Soul Sonic on

1435
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:36,539
420 where you could get it just for I

1436
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,200
think a few days

1437
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,940
um

1438
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:42,058
and just from the pictures of it like

1439
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:43,500
the way the leaves are the I loved

1440
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:46,440
growing it I had so many keepers of it

1441
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,179
that yeah I I don't even know it was

1442
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,599
hard to narrow down and that's I think

1443
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:54,899
that's kind of what how you make it into

1444
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,119
a line in our camp like you can you can

1445
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,980
test something and be like ah you know I

1446
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,318
got one keeper out of like a bunch or

1447
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,539
you know whatever but if you have one

1448
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:05,460
that it's like hard to find a keeper

1449
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:07,259
because you have so many Keepers you're

1450
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,559
just like ah I can't keep all of these

1451
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,000
plants but I I should you know that's

1452
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,740
how you that's how you make it into the

1453
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,219
line and and that was definitely the

1454
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:20,159
case with um with soul Sonic yeah I

1455
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:21,779
loved it it's great so that Gary just

1456
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,179
puts his gas

1457
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,099
like a greasy gas on on pretty much

1458
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:28,259
everything it it touches

1459
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:30,599
that's that's great to hear and I

1460
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,599
specifically wanted to ask you a few

1461
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:36,059
people have said that Gary and even as

1462
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,800
an extension cookies can sometimes be a

1463
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:40,019
bit of a bully in crosses because it's

1464
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,700
so dominant do you find that that's the

1465
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:42,960
case or do you think it's just a matter

1466
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:44,519
of pairing it with something that's

1467
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,380
equally dominant so you get a bit of

1468
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:49,440
both representation

1469
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:53,338
I think you need I think it's

1470
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:56,700
it's the pairing I I will say

1471
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:58,799
that one that Gary is kind of a bully

1472
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:02,239
like it definitely leaves its mark on

1473
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:05,880
its cross right like it it has this

1474
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:08,519
greasy residue that's on the

1475
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,338
on the flowers that's and then that just

1476
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,500
man when you smell it it's so amazing so

1477
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:16,078
I I really like it I like the way that

1478
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,460
it breeds but yeah it's a it's a bully

1479
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,440
for sure I wouldn't say that all the

1480
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,179
cookie strains are like that but that

1481
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,940
one yes

1482
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:25,259
but I think it's progeny or better than

1483
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,240
it itself

1484
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,619
and that's just my personal opinion the

1485
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:29,639
things it makes are better than the

1486
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:32,880
original

1487
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:34,318
yeah beautiful stuff and while I've got

1488
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,180
you here I want to ask you because I got

1489
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,818
to admit I wasn't really particularly

1490
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:40,379
familiar with the cake mix before you

1491
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:43,619
sort of introduced it with the baby

1492
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:46,140
cakes you got me wondering do you have

1493
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:48,000
any strong feelings on Cherry Pie I feel

1494
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:49,379
like it's sort of starting to make a

1495
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
little bit of a comeback but I've also

1496
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,940
never really heard you speak about it do

1497
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,260
you have any strong thoughts on it

1498
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:57,480
um I think it's awesome I've seen it

1499
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,700
grown a ton I remember growing it back

1500
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,440
in the day and it had some stability

1501
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:03,838
issues if you had the right the real cut

1502
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,818
of it right yeah so I had I definitely

1503
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,799
had some stability issues

1504
00:57:05,818 --> 00:57:10,920
um but I think with how

1505
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,960
you know the modern Gardener is a lot

1506
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:14,700
more Savvy when it comes to you know

1507
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,519
dealing with problems dealing with

1508
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:19,980
intersex issues I mean now we've we've

1509
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:23,880
grown we've all grown enough cookies

1510
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:27,420
to know how to spot and and deal with it

1511
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:32,700
it's it's a much more educated um

1512
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:35,220
I guess landscape so I have the cut I I

1513
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,899
also just recently reacquired the cherry

1514
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:39,118
pie

1515
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,660
um I need to grow it again to like

1516
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:44,700
re-familiarize myself so yeah it is

1517
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:47,818
making a small comeback though and I

1518
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:49,919
think the the the flavor and the terp of

1519
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:51,960
it when it's grown

1520
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,139
the the right way

1521
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,699
is amazing so

1522
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:58,500
definitely it's definitely got some

1523
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:00,598
unique sort of uh characteristics about

1524
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:03,239
us that's cool to hear we may hear more

1525
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:05,760
about it in the future I would love to

1526
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:07,919
ask you I feel like uh gas has had a bit

1527
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,500
of a Resurgence in the past few years as

1528
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,420
like a general flavor type would you say

1529
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,579
that you agree with that and do you

1530
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:17,099
think it's still on the up and up or

1531
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:19,859
we're sort of plateauing a bit

1532
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:21,539
well I don't know I think uh I think one

1533
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:23,880
of the cooler things about you know

1534
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:26,818
cannabis and cannabis breeding is the

1535
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:30,119
locales so like certain areas in the

1536
00:58:26,818 --> 00:58:32,818
country like certain flavors if you go

1537
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:34,680
to La it's gas they love gas down there

1538
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:36,900
you know you go to the Bay maybe it's

1539
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:39,779
more z-term more cookies you know they

1540
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:41,880
still like gas too it's just different

1541
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,579
areas of the country like different

1542
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,980
things I know like New York went on a

1543
00:58:44,579 --> 00:58:51,000
crazy tangent for like sour d it was

1544
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:53,039
everything had to be sour d and

1545
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,880
um so these things they come in waves

1546
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:59,579
they come in in different regions uh

1547
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,740
have different popularities so yeah I

1548
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,539
think gas is always going to be popular

1549
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:05,159
sometimes it's going to resurge and then

1550
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:07,798
it'll die down and maybe like you know

1551
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:09,719
like a z-term or a cookie turp will pop

1552
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,980
up it's I mean that's just kind of what

1553
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:13,679
makes it cool

1554
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,298
yeah definitely why have you heard about

1555
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,318
have you heard about some new gas that I

1556
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:17,358
don't know about because I'm gonna need

1557
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:19,679
to know

1558
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:22,679
look I I was hoping it was going to be

1559
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,419
coming from you to be honest what's hot

1560
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:26,338
on the rear what's hot on the radar I

1561
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,220
need to know what if you what have you

1562
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:32,338
seen lately have you heard about

1563
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:34,078
um I've seen hardcore ogs1 getting a lot

1564
00:59:32,338 --> 00:59:35,759
of traction recently there must be like

1565
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,039
a specific S1 that people have found

1566
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,859
that's really special really no I

1567
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,558
haven't but I'll be investigating look I

1568
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:45,298
know that you're uh your reach spreads

1569
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:47,280
far and wide so hopefully next time we

1570
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:48,960
chatter you got it in the stable or you

1571
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,400
can give me an update at least that's

1572
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,838
right you never know now I want to find

1573
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,940
it sounds like it sounds like it might

1574
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:56,279
be interesting that's cool yeah I mean

1575
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,260
I'm always looking for I I'm I'm always

1576
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,859
looking for what the what the other guys

1577
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:03,480
are doing you know like um I'm uh

1578
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:06,239
I'm just like all the other I'm just

1579
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,039
like any other seed guy that I buy

1580
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:10,500
everybody's seeds every other breeder

1581
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:12,599
any breeder that that is out there that

1582
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:15,780
uh looks interesting I've bought your

1583
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:17,338
shed I have it and I'm popping it

1584
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,660
currently I go through a lot of

1585
01:00:17,338 --> 01:00:19,619
different people's stuff looking for

1586
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:21,960
unique

1587
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:23,700
things and I think if if you know

1588
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,559
anybody out there is thinking about

1589
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:27,480
doing like making doing projects

1590
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:30,059
breeding I think you should and I think

1591
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,980
I think you should pop everybody you

1592
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,059
know popping so far is cool and you're

1593
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,440
gonna find some heat you're gonna find

1594
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:36,180
some stuff you love but but pop

1595
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,240
everybody's go pop mic stuff go pop

1596
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:40,618
whoever pop other people's stuff find

1597
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:42,239
find all that heat because that's how

1598
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:44,760
we're gonna get the new stuff

1599
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,259
you know like it's come it's become so

1600
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,339
mundane

1601
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,680
um

1602
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:51,920
like where's the new flavors at

1603
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,838
you know I'm I'm waiting

1604
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:58,798
I'm waiting I love that that's great

1605
01:00:54,838 --> 01:01:01,440
where's the heat like you know I don't

1606
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:03,719
know that's it man yeah for the longest

1607
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,818
time I've said that I think the uh the

1608
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:08,818
wheels of our community metaphorically

1609
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:13,798
spin on people popping seeds

1610
01:01:08,818 --> 01:01:16,318
oh no it does 100 like if if you're sick

1611
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:17,818
of seeing the same strains or you're

1612
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:19,679
sick of there not being a new flavor

1613
01:01:17,818 --> 01:01:21,239
then start popping seeds if you're not

1614
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,980

gonna find those somebody somebody has

1617
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,519

1618
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,440
it could be whatever but they have it in

1619

01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:35,699
post it on Instagram probably never

1622
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,020
gonna tell their buddies about it they

1623
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:40,159

1624
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:43,980
it's just gonna come and go

1625
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:46,199

1626
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:49,139
raspberry Mama inside heavy dice tent

1627

1634
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,980
it that's it man you gotta have your

1635
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:10,260
finger on the pulse I was interested in

1636
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:12,420
asking I'm I'm particularly Keen to get

1637
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:14,880
my hands on one of these boxes because I

1638
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,619
noticed inside it is the Mind flare S1

1639
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,200
and I'm not sure you can get that

1640
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:21,720
anywhere else have you tested those at

1641
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:22,798
all slash what am I yeah I cool what are

1642
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:26,699
we expecting

1643
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:30,119
uh I grew some just uh a nice it's a

1644
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:32,279
it's really close to the original the

1645
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,280
original mind flare that I that I grew

1646
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:37,500
and and used for this so

1647
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,298
um yeah those are in the box it's not

1648
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,699
part of the drop you can only get it in

1649
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:45,179
the box so there'll only be x amount of

1650
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:48,118
them uh out there you know so

1651
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:49,919
enjoy I like to do that I like to I like

1652
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:51,960
to make things very limited because I

1653
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,298
feel like that makes them you know

1654
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,519
cooler like if you were in that moment

1655
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:58,679
if you were there to

1656
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,519
to get those things then you got them

1657
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:04,980
and if you weren't then maybe you can't

1658
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:07,259
and yeah yeah that's it you missed the

1659
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:09,000
boat guys don't don't be left that's

1660
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,220
right don't miss the boat yeah because

1661
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,500
and we do that with a lot like our last

1662
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:16,318
supper cross that was out in the in the

1663
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:18,059
uh Bahama line guys are always asking us

1664
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:20,039
about that like oh my God we got these

1665
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:21,660
last supper freebies with like some

1666
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:23,759
banana runs packs and these are the most

1667
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:26,098
amazing things so Frosty the turps are

1668
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,380
crazy where are they at where can we get

1669
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:30,000
them you can't if you didn't get them if

1670
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:32,160
you didn't get that freebie for that

1671
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,699
thing it is gone and we're not remaking

1672
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:39,058
it so uh we do that

1673
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:40,980
for sure on purpose for sure so yeah be

1674
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:43,200
there in the moment or be

1675
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,780
wanting or maybe you could find it out

1676
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:48,000
there you know like guys have [ __ ] so

1677
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,859
you never know but while we're on the

1678
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,480
topic I would love to hear because I

1679
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:53,400
know sometimes this is a hard one

1680
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,019
because you you tend to want to know a

1681
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,079
bit more info before you give an answer

1682
01:03:55,019 --> 01:04:00,358
but if you could only recommend one of

1683
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,640
the Mind player crosses just as that you

1684
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:04,199
think is sort of a crowd pleaser what

1685
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,298
would you recommend and as a follow-up

1686
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:08,480
what is your personal favorite of the

1687
01:04:06,298 --> 01:04:08,480
drop

1688
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,858
um yeah so if I

1689
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:16,079
if I was a guy and I was looking at the

1690
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:18,719
menu and I was just like you know what I

1691
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,839
can only get one which one am I gonna

1692
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:23,759
get which one I'm like I probably go

1693
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,798
it's hard to say because they're all so

1694
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,660
different and you know you have

1695
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:29,460
different reasons for forgetting

1696
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:31,618
something but if I was a guy looking for

1697
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,960
something to wash and I was a hash guy

1698
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:38,039
I'd go Megamind

1699
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,780
um if I was a guy that is going for like

1700
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:41,519
bag appeal

1701
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:44,880
you really can't go wrong with any of

1702
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:47,400
them but that's a hard question yeah

1703
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,140
it's hard utter Madness is is an awesome

1704
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,798
one

1705
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:52,379
um

1706
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:54,559
yeah if I just had 100 bucks and I had

1707
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,358
to pick one I don't know I don't know

1708
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,519
it's tough isn't it it's tough because

1709
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:01,679
like like I like we were talking about

1710
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:03,420
earlier when we designed this line

1711
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:05,399
we put each one in here for a different

1712
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:08,099
reason you know

1713
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,119
so they all have a reason why they're

1714
01:05:08,099 --> 01:05:11,700
here

1715
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,980
exactly well what's your personal

1716
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:17,159
favorite

1717
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:18,960
I I don't have a straight up personal

1718
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:21,838
favorite because I can't I couldn't

1719
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,539
choose like Soul Sonic over mind melter

1720
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:27,599
be I just couldn't and I couldn't choose

1721
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:29,460
like mind melter over Megamind so I I

1722
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,519
don't know who would be my personal

1723
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:35,280
favorite I suggest like a mind melter

1724
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:38,338
maybe if you're if you're new uh to Soul

1725
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,260
fire you won't go wrong you know if if I

1726
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:43,318
was a if I if I've never heard of

1727
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:47,059
soulfire before I had 100 bucks to spend

1728
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:48,599
and this is going to be my my

1729
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:50,880
intro

1730
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:52,980
go mind melter strawberry mind melter

1731
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,079
you're gonna kill the game

1732
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,858
you'll fall in love

1733
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:58,079
um

1734
01:05:55,858 --> 01:06:00,239
yeah there that's I guess that's what

1735
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,680
I'll say that's a good recommendation I

1736
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:03,419
was gonna say yeah I think like the

1737
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,940
heavy yields and the Terps are going to

1738
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:07,980
help so that's a good one and yeah just

1739
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,720
to loop back quickly you mentioned a

1740
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:11,460
little earlier that you you know you pop

1741
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:13,739
a lot of other breeders stuff and you're

1742
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,900
familiar with who's doing what I was

1743
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:17,279
curious to ask are there any strains or

1744
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,798
breeders that have caught your eye

1745
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,819
recently

1746
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:23,338
um

1747
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:25,558
yeah I mean I like I definitely like

1748
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:29,880
what like Bloom is doing

1749
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:32,220

1750
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:35,700

no I didn't pop Chernobyl I didn't find

1761
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:07,019
any any keeper sadly but um it was like

1762
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:09,118
a quirkle it was like a quirkle cross oh

1763
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:13,619
yeah uh crazy train is the Crazy Train

1764
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:16,318

1765
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:18,059
thing full of seeds tons like dude from

1766
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:21,358
all over the years I have a big Vault

1767
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:23,760
but he has like a huge Vault and uh he

1768
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:26,519
gave me a bunch of crazy train uh seeds

1769
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,500
and I I popped those I didn't find what

1770
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:30,420
I was looking for like turb wise so none

1771
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,858
of them really made the cut but

1772
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:33,599
um and that's the case with a lot of

1773
01:07:31,858 --> 01:07:34,858
different breeders like I'll pop a bunch

1774
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,599
of stuff there'll be some heat there'll

1775
01:07:34,858 --> 01:07:39,000
be some tight stuff but it just has to

1776
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:42,900
like make the cut so

1777
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,940
um yeah that and yeah I'm always buying

1778
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:47,280
I'm always buying seeds I have a buying

1779
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,858
seed problem I I would imagine like

1780
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,119
everybody else

1781
01:07:48,858 --> 01:07:53,279
yeah look I think I think we're all

1782
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:56,338
addicts in that regard

1783
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:58,200
um just out of uh like a a general sort

1784
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:00,779
of curiosity slash follow-up I remember

1785
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:02,939
in the last episode we chatted about uh

1786
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,220
the flave being one of your memorable

1787
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:06,960
ones oh yeah did you know that Miss Jill

1788
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:08,578
is uh putting that out again like you

1789
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,760
can get it again

1790
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:14,900
yeah I wonder how I mean I wonder how

1791
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:17,640
like close to what it what it was before

1792
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,020
is yeah so do you know when that's

1793
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,239
coming out because I'll definitely grab

1794
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:24,000
some well I think it it might even be

1795
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:26,338
out now but you nodded on the head the

1796
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,319
I've got a question about that purely

1797
01:08:26,338 --> 01:08:29,880
because the original it was like Romulan

1798
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:32,279
by a space queen

1799
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,798
that's right and the ram the Romulan was

1800
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:36,239
heavied man yeah and so like there's a

1801
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:38,039
lot of like you know question marks

1802
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,678
around Romulan these days but on top of

1803
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:42,479
that they also listed as Peach Romulan

1804
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:44,219
and not just Romulan and so I'm like oh

1805
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:46,500
is that their way of subtly tipping

1806
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:48,539
their hat that it's not the same

1807
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,779
yeah maybe because that wasn't what the

1808
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:53,579
original one was yeah yeah exactly but

1809
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:55,319
um who knows did they put up any

1810
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:58,079
pictures of it or anything because I can

1811
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:00,539
tell from like the pictures how similar

1812
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:02,880
it really is because it's the flavor

1813
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:04,859
that we used was very unique like the

1814
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,719
one that Mike selected

1815
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:09,000
um it was very unique

1816
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,480
yeah look I'm I'm trying to pull it up

1817
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,640
on my phone now it's on Miss Jill's page

1818
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:15,479
but it should be like kind of eggy and

1819
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,779
like

1820
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:21,119
big big bright green or yeah bright

1821
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,319
hairs I'll have to send you a photo off

1822
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:23,939
the upside I'm trying to pull it up but

1823
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,580
I can't find her Instagram right now

1824
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:28,079
when I'm under the crunch I always like

1825
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,640
dude everybody always is getting deleted

1826
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:31,920
so

1827
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,480
yeah it's so terrible it's wow that's

1828
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,640
part of the reason why we went to to

1829
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:37,919
Discord you know

1830
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,660
yeah right the constant persecution on

1831
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,159
Instagram is horrible

1832
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:42,719
yeah I wonder if anything's gonna

1833
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:44,759
actually change because it's like you

1834
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,259
can like you see paid advertisements for

1835
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:49,259
cannabis but then also people getting

1836
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:51,179
banned yeah no I don't think it's Gonna

1837
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:55,380
Change it's not gonna change until it's

1838
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:57,659
federally legal I mean yeah the rock can

1839
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:59,760
the rock can take down a a bottle of

1840
01:09:57,659 --> 01:10:01,979
tequila and that's fine and nothing

1841
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,860
against The Rock I love the rock

1842
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:07,259
um but you know God forbid like you post

1843
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:09,179
some pot then you could just be banned a

1844
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:11,100
lot of it is the is the like the the

1845
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:12,779
weight that they give

1846
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,300
um the report

1847
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:19,139
like so sometimes you'll get reported

1848
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,480
for uh hate speech or or all this other

1849
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:23,400
crap that has not you know that

1850
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:25,139
around you know it's a it's not even

1851
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:26,759
what it is but

1852
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:28,679
um they'll pull your post down because

1853
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,840
somebody said that you were you know

1854
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:32,399
being abusive by posting pot it doesn't

1855
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,920
even make any sense

1856
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:36,899
yeah it's it's definitely it feels a bit

1857
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,539
like the wild west doesn't it

1858
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:42,839
yeah a little bit it's just over over

1859
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:44,039
policed it's crazy because you know you

1860
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,860
can watch somebody literally get

1861
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:50,460
murdered on Instagram that's fine you

1862
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:53,219
know that doesn't come down but a guy

1863
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:54,480
posts a plant and it's oh you know he

1864
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:57,000
loses his whole account that he's had

1865
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:59,279
for years it just doesn't make sense to

1866
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,439
me honestly yeah do you think that

1867
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,019
Discord will become even more popular

1868
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:07,139
than what it is now oh yeah oh yeah it's

1869
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:09,300
gonna be huge I mean I told so I wish I

1870
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:12,000
could take credit for like

1871
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:15,119
a lot of cannabis guys moving to Discord

1872
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,399
but I really can't like Lem here in in I

1873
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,500
knew about Discord years ago just for my

1874
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:21,539
kids playing like video games and me

1875
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,500
playing video games with them it took

1876
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:23,340
over

1877
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,039
um

1878
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:30,239
for like TeamSpeak so like we would use

1879
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:31,979
TeamSpeak or Ventrilo back then and

1880
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:33,718
um Discord came along and my kids were

1881
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:35,039
like oh dad like you know Discord is

1882
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:37,980
away and when I first used it I was like

1883
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:40,079
this [ __ ] sucks like it's not that

1884
01:11:37,979 --> 01:11:42,238
intuitive there's so much different

1885
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,519
things going on I wasn't into it at

1886
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,839
first and then after a while and I was

1887
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,239
able to figure out how to kind of use it

1888
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,800
and how versatile versatile it is I was

1889
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,019
like oh this is pretty cool you know and

1890
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,300
then um there's a there's a breeder up

1891
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:58,080
here in in Washington named lemon lemon

1892
01:11:54,300 --> 01:12:00,300
hoco uh lamb and he has a Discord a

1893
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:01,619
cannabis Discord and it was you know

1894
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,119
they got a lot of different stuff going

1895
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:05,939
on in there they got all this stuff

1896
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:07,859
going on and uh that's when I first saw

1897
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:09,419
that idea and I was like okay and I set

1898
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:11,399
up the soul fire Discord we didn't have

1899
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,158
any barely any followers we basically

1900
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:16,139
just sit and and chit chat in there with

1901
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,719
like me and dragon and just a couple of

1902
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:21,539
the the regular guys and

1903
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:24,840
um you know I told Mike about it and at

1904
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:27,000
first and and and then and then at that

1905
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:28,800
point then like uh Masonic started his

1906
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,439
own Discord and he started you know

1907
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,520
getting his thing going and then uh I

1908
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:34,559
was telling Michael I was like hey man

1909
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,659
we you should do a Discord bro blah blah

1910
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,820
he's like nah I hate Discord that [ __ ]

1911
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:41,219
sucks just like how I was when I first

1912
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:43,319
saw it you know and uh he's like nah

1913
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:46,020
this [ __ ] [ __ ] sucks and then

1914
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:48,840
um after a while after he just had had

1915
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:50,460
enough of it with like Instagram he you

1916
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:53,819
know he started doing his nft steps and

1917
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:57,840
he's he set up a uh Instagram and

1918
01:12:53,819 --> 01:13:00,000
um then we her uh Discord rather and uh

1919
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,199
yeah and he just kind of got used to it

1920
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,079
I think that's what's gonna happen I

1921
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:07,379
think a lot of guys who Maybe

1922
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:09,059
aren't that tech savvy or it's not that

1923
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,719
intuitive for them I think they're going

1924
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:14,640
to they're going to come along because

1925
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,100
um I mean really that's where the core

1926
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,440
of the soulfire base is is in Discord

1927

like yeah it's it does have that um

1943
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:59,698
longitudinal ability to track threads

1944
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:01,079
and things like that which is definitely

1945
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:02,939
something that people have been calling

1946
01:14:01,079 --> 01:14:05,100
for for a long time which is like really

1947
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,658
great to see and as as your Discord

1948
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,920
illustrates you can really get them

1949
01:14:06,658 --> 01:14:10,379
popping with a lot of different

1950
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,699
functionalities and sort of various

1951
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,380
different things happening at different

1952
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,639
times there's a lot of reasons to be on

1953
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:18,000
there

1954
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,679
yeah no for sure and you know it takes a

1955
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,260
lot of work too like I have I have an

1956
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,060
entire staff of um moderators that are

1957
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:27,000
in their 24-hour Summit different time

1958
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:30,900
zones so that like you know we can just

1959
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,719
keep it like uh a positive space that's

1960
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:35,158
um about what we designed it for which

1961
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:38,039
is growing pot and talking to other

1962
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:41,460
people about growing pot and sharing

1963
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:43,500
um Tech and sharing ideas you know like

1964
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:46,020
we have a whole area just about getting

1965
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,600
your setup right a whole area about you

1966
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:50,040
know every different facet and you know

1967
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,920
you really get to know these guys I mean

1968
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:55,979
in Discord you have pretty much

1969
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:58,020
24-hour access to the breeder who's

1970
01:14:55,979 --> 01:15:00,539
making your safes so you can talk to

1971
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:02,760
them about you know whatever at any time

1972
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:05,880
and I think that right there alone just

1973
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:07,800
changes the game so there's a lot to it

1974
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:10,500
if you set up a Discord just be ready

1975
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,119
for the uh the bumps here and there but

1976
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:15,060
there's just so so many different things

1977
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:18,599
you can do it's it's awesome

1978
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:21,480
yeah definitely huge functionality huge

1979
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:23,520
functionality cool I was just gonna uh

1980
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:25,079
mention that one thing we hadn't

1981
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,380
actually spoken about yet a little bit

1982
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:30,059
uh off the topic of the Discord is where

1983
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:31,199
do you think like the flavor demands are

1984
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,400
going in the future like what do you

1985
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,439
think is going to be the next big

1986
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,000
popular flavor to take the scene by

1987
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:39,000
storm

1988
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,279
well I think I think gas is like you

1989
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:45,179
said making a comeback

1990
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:47,219
um I think it's cycling cycling back uh

1991
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:48,899
I don't know I'm waiting for like a new

1992
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:51,300
flavor profile to pop up we were just

1993
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:53,399
talking the other day about like

1994
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:55,800
watermelon strains and how I've never

1995
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:58,259
I've never tried a strain that they say

1996
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,360
tastes like watermelon it actually does

1997
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:02,340
I would love to if you have one out

1998
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:03,899
there and you're like so fire there

1999
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:06,300
really is a watermelon strain that

2000
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:08,399
actually tastes like uh watermelon I

2001
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,840
would love to try it I haven't not like

2002
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:13,500
one that's like banana or like

2003
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:16,739
strawberry or like orange or apple like

2004
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:19,079
our our Apple uh our Apple Pucker strain

2005
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:21,779
that was in the Bahama is amazingly like

2006
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:24,600
apple it's crazy like apple I would love

2007
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:26,519
to see that flavor profile uh take off I

2008
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,020
I just saw I was at the homeboys house

2009
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:32,640
the other day it was

2010
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:34,620
growing his uh his pucker UPS and it was

2011
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,320
crazy Apple

2012
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:41,279
so yeah I don't know I'd like to see

2013
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:43,139
like a flavor like that like a true

2014
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:43,920
Apple come out

2015
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,600
um

2016
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:49,140
I don't know I don't know where we're

2017
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:52,020
where we're going uh as far as flavors

2018
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:54,179
yeah I I certainly can attest that I I

2019
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:55,860
haven't really come across many true

2020
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:57,600
Apple flavors so that's neat to hear the

2021
01:16:55,859 --> 01:17:01,859
Apple Pucker will have to get on to that

2022
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:03,719
oh it's it's insane yeah in terms of the

2023
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:05,399
watermelon I haven't likewise haven't

2024
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:08,960
ever really come across it but I think

2025
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:12,119
Bodhi says he's got a land race

2026
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:14,279
African hash plant I think uh I can't

2027
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:16,619
remember if the Ethiopian watermelon

2028
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:18,599
hash plant is what he calls it but again

2029
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:22,219
that that's getting a bit uh wild and

2030
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:25,199
Untamed to be dealt with it

2031
01:17:22,219 --> 01:17:26,760
yeah I mean yeah he he had a lot of

2032
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:29,039
great he has a lot of great flavor

2033
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:32,159
profiles and honestly I haven't popped

2034
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:33,779
any of his beans for a long time I think

2035
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:36,299
the last thing I popped from him was

2036
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:37,800
like uh what was it like in a Kai or

2037
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:40,020
something maybe it was a long time ago

2038
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,779
I'll have to I have to Circle back now

2039
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,580
that you writing it down right now

2040
01:17:41,779 --> 01:17:46,079
that's great he's got some cool stuff in

2041
01:17:44,579 --> 01:17:48,658
there for sure

2042
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:52,019
yeah we have to Circle back and give him

2043
01:17:48,658 --> 01:17:53,639
a give him a a little test pop there and

2044
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:56,280
see what we can find

2045
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:58,380
out of curiosity have you ever come

2046
01:17:56,279 --> 01:18:00,238
across like a real passion fruit

2047
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:03,480
flavored strain

2048
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:05,099
like a like a guava yeah well I have you

2049
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:06,599
so this is actually another point that

2050
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,159
I'm only just starting to learn

2051
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,840
um a passion for it's like common where

2052
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:13,139
you're at like the fruit passion fruit

2053
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,179
here in Washington no okay yeah I mean

2054
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:17,219
we it just rains all the time right so

2055
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:19,020
we don't we don't get any of the cool

2056
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:21,060
fruits that you have down there in

2057
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:22,440
Australia no we don't give any of that

2058
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:23,760
[ __ ] no because it's like I was talking

2059
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:25,139
to someone the other day and they said

2060
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,579
oh you know I've never had it and it

2061
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:28,140
made me realize like yeah I guess I just

2062
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:29,939
take it for granted that it's just such

2063
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:33,000
a commonplace fruit down here that um

2064
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:36,000
anyway it's like a it's like a a sour

2065
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,880
tart not like super sour but like a

2066
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,100
Tarter version of like sort of a mango

2067
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,679
with some more floral influence in there

2068
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:46,079
more like citrusy almost but beautiful

2069
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:48,179
stuff but another flavor profile which I

2070
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:51,119
feel you don't really come across very

2071
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:54,840
much like in that same vein as the Apple

2072
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:57,319
right I mean maybe I don't know maybe we

2073
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,819
just haven't haven't I I

2074
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:01,380
believe that this isn't it like the

2075
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:04,198
flavor profiles that we have right now

2076
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:06,480
that's there's no way that this is it we

2077
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:08,158
just we haven't created them yet or they

2078
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:11,639
haven't been discovered yet like

2079
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:13,859
somebody's gonna discover them so I mean

2080
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:15,659
you know back in the 70s when they were

2081
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:18,679
growing pot I was pretty much just

2082
01:19:15,658 --> 01:19:21,059
skunky skunky pot there wasn't all these

2083
01:19:18,679 --> 01:19:22,440
strawberries and watermelons that are

2084
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:25,500
you know and all these different flavors

2085
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:28,439
they weren't there so there's more to

2086
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,698
come I mean I don't know I talk to

2087
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:31,799
people all the time and they just seem

2088
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:34,799
so like down and downs about

2089
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,760
where cannabis is in general

2090
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,400
um

2091
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,980
yeah and about like the flavors that are

2092
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:42,599
around they they talk as if we're at

2093
01:19:40,979 --> 01:19:44,339
like the peak and it can never be better

2094
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:46,260
and this is it

2095
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:47,460
and I just don't think that that's the

2096
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:50,219
case

2097
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:52,020
you know I think I think we're we're

2098
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:53,880
nowhere near the top I think we're we're

2099
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:56,820
still creating I think there's so much

2100
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:59,520
more stuff for like like new guys coming

2101
01:19:56,819 --> 01:20:00,779
on to like create there's there's so

2102
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,179
many new breeders coming out there's

2103
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:05,039
going to be cool stuff being made yeah

2104
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:07,500
definitely I feel like there's so many

2105
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:09,779
like because I think this plant is very

2106
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:11,760
well capable of producing any smell

2107
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:13,920
possible and so yeah where's all that

2108
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,560
stuff we haven't smelt uh-huh it's

2109
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,420
coming don't worry like whether it's uh

2110
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,360
whether it's me making it or somebody

2111
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:23,819
that has it right now in like some seeds

2112
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,619
that they made and dude that's why I

2113
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,539
always encourage people like hey if you

2114
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:29,939
find something cool in a pack of seeds

2115
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:32,279
you get from me please by all means

2116
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:34,019
breed with it make something new make

2117
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:37,259
something your own

2118
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:39,000
um it you do not need to ask me I still

2119
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:41,760
get these messages all the time like hey

2120
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,060
is it okay if I yes is it okay wait yes

2121
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,619
yes it is okay it's open source I want

2122
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,300
you to breed with it I want you to make

2123
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:50,099
your own things I want you to create

2124
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,119
something new so I have something to

2125
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,179
work with

2126
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:57,000
so yeah that's great philosophy I love

2127
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:59,420
that I uh I do want to ask I'm not the

2128
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,779
gatekeeper of the [ __ ] at all

2129
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:05,460
and if they if if you buy a pack of

2130
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:08,880
seeds from soulfire you already know

2131
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:11,399
like it's it's inherently yeah ingrained

2132
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:14,100
that you have my blessing to go ahead

2133
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:16,799
and and work that line create something

2134
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:20,340
create something new yeah that's amazing

2135
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:23,340
so I did want to ask the uh with the

2136
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:25,800
Bahama Mama drop we we had the part two

2137
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:27,679
um after you know the initial uh success

2138
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:30,420
of the the part one of the Bahama Mama

2139
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:33,779
is there any chance we're going to see a

2140
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:35,520
similar thing with this more recent drop

2141
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:36,658
uh there won't be a part two of the Mind

2142
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,640
fire

2143
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,839
yeah there won't there won't be a part

2144
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:43,260
two

2145
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:46,140
um of it I think we did the part two

2146
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:49,320
because of what I said earlier where

2147
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:51,539
I think it's unfair to put out so many

2148
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:54,479
strains at one time

2149
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:57,359
and put that stress on you know just the

2150
01:21:54,479 --> 01:22:00,238
common Gardener's pocket like oh here's

2151
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:01,738
14 strains but you can only pick a

2152
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,819
couple at the you know what I mean no

2153
01:22:01,738 --> 01:22:08,639
I'd much rather put out six and then six

2154
01:22:05,819 --> 01:22:11,399
to eight and then maybe in

2155
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,780
six months later you get another six to

2156
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:15,359
eight from that strain if we had that

2157
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:16,979
many that should go into it

2158
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:19,319
um so but with the Mind flare I think

2159
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:22,139
this is we're just going to do this this

2160
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:23,399
six and and and that'll be it there'll

2161
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,679
be different freebies or maybe different

2162
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:28,079
exclusives you'll see

2163
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:30,960
um but there won't be a there won't be a

2164
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:33,420
a part two and we we made enough stock

2165
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:36,840
so that there's plenty of boxes that go

2166
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:38,579
out and yeah that'll be it that's the

2167
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:40,860
exciting stuff I'm Keen to here and I

2168
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:42,658
guess it further just reinforces that

2169
01:22:40,859 --> 01:22:44,698
there's no better time than now guys

2170
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:47,039
don't don't wait around this is it jump

2171
01:22:44,698 --> 01:22:49,259
in yeah I think I mean our our

2172
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:52,560
pre-orders are insane so like once it

2173
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:54,600
goes it's it's gone and and then um

2174
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:57,179
we'll you know we'll be doing this uh

2175
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,579
Hood candies testing and if Hood candies

2176
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:03,480
makes it great we'll see that you know

2177
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:06,059
in the in Winter and or end of fall

2178
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:08,039
maybe winter of this year if it makes it

2179
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:10,140
if it doesn't you know we'll see you

2180
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:11,519
next year with something we're not we're

2181
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,140
definitely not a company that's known

2182
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,239
for like putting up putting out drops

2183
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,960
back to back to back we don't do it

2184
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:18,238
um

2185
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:21,658
yeah you can count my drops on your hand

2186
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:24,359
I believe yeah hey that's that's good to

2187
01:23:21,658 --> 01:23:25,619

2188
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:27,439
wanted to touch on was there anything we

2189

01:24:58,439 --> 01:25:02,158
deep dive after we get off the phone

2230
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,140
based on the sounds of this

2231
