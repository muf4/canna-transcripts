um I guess actually you know what's kind

35
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:39,000
of random is I pulled out uh some banana

36
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,599
OG from the very first wash it did with

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,478
um Adam from some actual like really

38
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:48,199
nice trim and it was a 90u and it was so

39
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,679
uh insanely good it was like this is

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,799
trim hash and it was like some of the

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,520
best hash I'd ever seen at that point it

42
00:01:51,799 --> 00:02:00,039
was like 2014 and it was just complete

43
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:01,798
full melt beautiful hash from trim and

44
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,478
and it was actually the next year that

45
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,479
we then uh continued on and did a whole

46
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,399
fresh Frozen project and like made some

47
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,560
of the like most amazing hash those next

48
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:16,719
years with the like Coastal gr um just

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,560
in no dust just as as clean as possible

50
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,080
Gran from the beginning um thinking

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,840
about it from hash from the beginning

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,680
but um put put away some of that in the

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,959
the freezer for like a long time and I

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,319
found it and pulled it out and um was

55
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,280
actually just rolling some spliffs and

56
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,958
it rolls in so nice with uh some decent

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,280
tobacco and then um mixed it actually

58
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:43,039
with some gmob and some Mandarin double

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,840
Mandarin uh Cherry Lime dog uh from the

60
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,519
Nukem farms and rolled a several of

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,759
those up to go to the beach and

62
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,120
collected a whole bunch of rocks

63
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,919
actually have an outdoor shower and

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
bathtub and so collecting really

65
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,000
interesting rocks to to go under the

66
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,679
shower and the and the tub so each rock

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,680
is actually hand chosen under your your

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,560
feet and um but had to roll some splits

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,959
for that but it was pretty cool to like

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:13,319
find that this

71
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:15,239
90 uh uh you um trim hash from so long

72
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,639
ago that just it held up and it actually

73
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,360
cured in a a way that was just so nice

74
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:24,079
to to roll with and so the last two days

75
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,040
I've kept going to that even though it's

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,640
from

77
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,639
2014 yeah that stuff though kind of a

78
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,479
little bit better and go then like

79
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,399
having like yeah no it fluffs it's super

80
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,438
fluffy and then it like it just all of a

81
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,039
sudden is like gone once you like start

82
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:42,519
absorbing it in with your your fingers

83
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,840
and get that heat uh but yeah it was

84
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,799
kind of funny 10 years 10 year vintage

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,598
yeah I dabbed some of that with you I

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,438
think probably from the next year I

87
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,560
think it yeah yeah when it was the fresh

88
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:55,479
frozen and it was and that was really

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,479
good yeah it was so tasty and then I was

90
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,438
super blazed we were down at that thing

91
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:03,359
at the honeysuckle Lotus party when I

92
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:05,120
met those guys and uh me and Johnny went

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
down there and I remember I was hitting

94
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,840
it and I was like I had never seen the

95
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,280
straight banana before and I was like

96
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,680
wow it really is banana you know right

97
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,120
yeah old and then the kind of candy

98
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,560
runts kind of thing like all at once and

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,120
then there's that gas with it too yeah

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
definitely

101
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,560
nice yeah gorgeous and what

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,960
about I'll have to cut that out probably

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,759
gorgeous and what about yourself Mr me J

104
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,519
what you been smoking on the all the all

105
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,000
the throat stuff is definitely you know

106
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,758
if you're smoking a lot of weed I think

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,478
everyone

108
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:45,080
understand uh I myself have been smoking

109
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,639
on um as I'm doing work and stuff I've

110
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,159
been smoking on this little bit of

111
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,079
probably kind of similar to what he's

112
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,439
smoking on texture-wise it is um I think

113
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,639
it was made from dry weed but it's water

114
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,199
has and I got it from the dude Jerry who

115
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,519
I met at a at a party

116
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,639
up at the 101 and uh he's the dude that

117
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,599
does Jerry seed Swap and stuff and I had

118
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,038
met him before and he had this

119
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,080
Vietnamese hash and when you smell it

120
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,759
it's very like Pine and terpinolene

121
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:21,159
smelling and um it smokes really nice

122
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,360
but I didn't actually smoke any right

123
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,400
now because on the last one when we had

124
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,400
sticker Farmer on I was smoking it right

125
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,519
before the show and during the show

126
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,279
and then I started going into some kind

127
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,198
of a thing and I couldn't remember where

128
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,719
the hell I was at and after a while I

129
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
was like I don't know where my train of

130
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,880
thought was I don't know what's

131
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,279
happening and I realized like yeah I

132
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,879
probably shouldn't be smoking the

133
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,638
Vietnamese

134
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,319
hash show let's smoke it after the show

135
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,120
but it's great for like the daytime

136
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,840
because it's um really clear and I

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,079
thought maybe it might have a little bit

138
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,239
of like the heart racing sativa stuff

139
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,800
because I'm not really used to

140
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,519
Vietnamese stuff and uh it wasn't it's

141
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,400
really Pleasant and I can't say it's

142
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,959
mild because it gets you high but it it

143
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:13,159
is really like Pleasant and enjoyable

144
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,159
and um as hash it doesn't have any kind

145
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,880
of a flavor of being like the heavy

146
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,840
terpinolene or anything it just has a

147
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:23,800
nice good old school hash flavor and uh

148
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,679
I've been smoking it in a little in a

149
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,240
little homemade Oak pipe that my kid

150
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,400
made it's all it's all charred and

151
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,478
everything it's like you can see it's

152
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:37,000
got the little hat wow yeah and then I

153
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,800
smoke it with a um with a torch lighter

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,680
from real far away so it just kind of

155
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,720
like it kind of Vapes it like a like a

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,918
cold star dab in a sense so you really

157
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,520
get a good flavor um but you know it's

158
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,680
it's it's silly but uh it's just kind of

159
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:55,120
fun because it's like you know my kid's

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,720
too young to be smoking and stuff but he

161
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,079
saw people carving pipes and he's like

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,319
oh that's a thing to carve and he likes

163
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,878
to whittle so and then I I took it and

164
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,520

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039

170
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,680
you mentioned the tie I'm smoking some

171
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,199
uh some rizar which was grown by my

172
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,199
buddy bin chick and he's actually doing

173
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,319
some cool work with ABC everyone should

174
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,000
check that out but rizar is Chernobyl by

175
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,400
TGA everyone knows that um by a Str

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,720
called is by my body always be flowering

177
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:37,478
but it's like the mother is um Black Tie

178
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,599
which is the a seeds the black

179
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,439
Vietnamese cross to the tie anyway it

180
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,399
just channels all that so this plant

181
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,279
it's like a tie it's like a jungle um

182
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,439
and he grew it Outdoors so it's just

183
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,679
like got this awesome you know sort of

184
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:54,360
sativa effect I love it it uh it ties in

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,879
perfectly with your tie hash and it also

186
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,439
ties in perfectly with our first story

187
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,360
actually which is or you got something

188
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,719
to show and tell first uh tie Tai dog

189
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,280
when I was in Hawaii last year a guy had

190
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,919
did a double cross of tie on the black

191
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,758
dog over the last several years and like

192
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,079
realized who I was and came up and

193
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,680
brought me the seeds of it so kind of

194
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,038
super fun and called it TI Tai dog I

195
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,319
thought that was a really great name

196
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,918
that's awesome you could almost like

197
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,039
generate a sativa line of black dog out

198
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,560
of

199
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:29,598
it I don't know how sativa they'll be

200
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,639
looking with black dog in it but yeah

201
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,158
don't

202
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,120
F it's already yeah those would be

203
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,718
really cool hybrids though um oh also uh

204
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,879
as far as cold start dabs that's like

205
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,760
one of my favorite ways to go but uh

206
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,720
gmob from radical herbs is what I've

207
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,399
been uh smoking on lately and like their

208
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,920
last year's Harvest was insane the last

209
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,519
two years just so good and just complex

210
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,479
and diverse some of the most tpine

211
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:59,639
diverse testing I've ever seen in hash

212
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,039
um and just the Savory and the gas and

213
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,159
the dessert it's like all these things

214
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,919
kind of happen so that's kind of a go-to

215
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:07,399
over and over again and then I also

216
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,000
found some of the old banana sfv dog in

217
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,679
the freezer and pulled that out so it's

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,399
kind of cool because that was the mail

219
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,039
that uh was used in the original gmob

220
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,720
and so it was kind of cool to taste

221
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:22,639
those back and for it what was the uh

222
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,040
one we were dabbing after your Premiere

223
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,600
when I came up there when I stayed at

224
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:30,559
your house it was a banana

225
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,360
something oh do you remember

226
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,838
that one was good high on it was so good

227
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,839
I just remember like I mean of course

228
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,920
set in setting right and I was have yeah

229
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,079
well we did a few and I think we did do

230
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,958
Straight banana OG and I think we did do

231
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:48,199
banana sfv dog and Mandarin that night

232
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:52,078
but it might have been the simply Adam

233
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,120
um banana OG because he did I think I

234
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:57,679
pulled out some of those where he did

235
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,078
actually a a freeze dryer and a air

236
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,559
dried kind of uh

237
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:05,399
batch where each one was

238
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,399
blind uh style where just have a number

239
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,039
on it and he had a whole pasting note

240
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,078
thing but I think I pulled some of those

241
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:16,278
out um for the full banana but we also

242
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:19,120
had some green Source I think some of

243
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:22,078
the banana dog crosses which were a

244
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,200
little bit more um kind of full hashy

245
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,639
flavor but melted really nice too but

246
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,480
okay I just remember that it was

247
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,078
definitely something banana but I think

248
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,759
it was different because I remember

249
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,159
I think it was a little bit different

250
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,759
because I had already tried the other

251
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:39,399
one and uh I just remember that the

252
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:41,039
effect on it like I said set in setting

253
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,958
right like of course we were having a

254
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,799
lot of fun and everything but I just

255
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,199
remember like feeling like the the

256
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,838
feeling of like hitting it and just like

257
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,079
the warm feeling of well-being with no

258
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,639
like edge of anything it was just like

259
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:57,638
oh this is that was a nice one I liked

260
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,399
that one a lot I think it's actually the

261
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,000
exact same one that I just was dabbing I

262
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,759
think the banana sfb dog cuz I'd had

263
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,639
that jar it was a large one I put away

264
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,120
in the jar for or in the fridge for a

265
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,759
while so yeah sounds right yeah I think

266
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,560
that might be it there I'm jealous I'm

267
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,639
jealous banana sfv dog sounds

268
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,638
incredible we should probably jump into

269
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:23,680
our first story for this week which is

270
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,200
uh tying back to the tie we referen

271
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:29,879
before uh let me get a little sticker

272
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,278
out here we go so Thailand's flag that

273
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,639
their stance on cannabis is likely going

274
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,679
to change they've actually gone so far

275
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,680
as to say that all cannabis businesses

276
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,638
need to be prepared to have shut up shop

277
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,278
within the next 12 months this is

278
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,278
obviously a huge backflip from the

279
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,519
former government's surprise

280
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,240
legalization which has led to many

281
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,560
westerners flocking to Thailand in the

282
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,919
hopes of setting up their own cannabis

283
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,799
Empire many have been critical of this

284
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,039
and have cited this as possibly one of

285
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,639
the major reasons for the reform

286
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,439
although a new government has taken

287
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:06,720
power which is likely a

288
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:09,399
contributor uh this is however um there

289
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,440
has been further concerns raised that um

290
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,078
the the intention initially was that Tha

291
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,399
Nationals would be the predominant

292
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:18,120
players within the industry given that

293
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,879
currently it's run by majority expats

294
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,399
with ties involved in the business um

295
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,759
it's looking as though things are going

296
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,000
to shut down there is a strong vocal

297
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,480
opposition to the change however with

298
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,198
many protesting the changes hopeful that

299
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,360
they can get some sort of back flip on

300
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:35,599
the ruling however Thailand is not a

301
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,199
traditional Western Country and so you

302
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,759
do have to wonder if any of these

303
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:41,838
protesting would lead to any change I

304
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,559
guess the question becomes what do we

305
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,399
think is this the end of legalization

306
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,919
for Thailand and to the greater Asian

307
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,198
scene given Thailand was cited as

308
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,759
possibly the first domino in a chain

309
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:56,240
that may lead to more legalization in in

310
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:59,799
Asia in

311
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,360
general yeah what do you think Jesse

312
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:06,159
um yeah it's pretty pretty sad to see

313
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,720
because we definitely wanted to see the

314
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:13,000
continue domino effect of of more and

315
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:17,000
more places adopting um less

316
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,879
Draconian uh laws towards cannabis and

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,799
towards people being able to have the

318
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:25,399
right to to grow a plant I think it's a

319
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:29,559
human right um and so many

320
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:34,120
places still have very very intense laws

321
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,879
uh Asia has a lot and so and many places

322
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,799
near Thailand that still have death

323
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,600
penalties for things um and in the US it

324
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:46,198
wasn't that long ago that people were

325
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,120
getting death sentences um are current

326
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:53,359
president even work towards

327
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:57,320
having uh sentences be more strict for

328
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:01,519
drug offenders and now using this moment

329
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,240
to uh give more control towards

330
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,480
pharmaceutical companies with cannabis

331
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,399
as a as a way to say you're legalizing

332
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,519
something um but as far as Thailand it

333
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,600
was just really nice to see that happen

334
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,078
that that moment like maybe it can lead

335
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,079
to more one of my favorite things was

336
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:22,519
was seeing um farmers were using

337
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,198
cannabis for chicken feed and they would

338
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,278
stop they stopped using

339
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,679
antibiotics uh and we having better

340
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:32,159
results and healthier chickens just

341
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:34,838
adding cannabis so that that all of the

342
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:38,480
things that can benefit from not having

343
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,040
these uh horrific laws when it comes to

344
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,199
a plant that can bring so much benefit

345
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:45,919
to people um is is really important but

346
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:47,479
I'm not necessarily that surprised

347
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,159
because there's always a pendulum of

348
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,440
things and it's like you swing One

349
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,958
Direction and then things swing back the

350
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
other way instead of finding the

351
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,799
balanced approach that makes sense in

352
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,039
things it's always like oh cool we have

353
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:02,838
this way and then you go too far with it

354
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,360
in certain ways and it's by say saying

355
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,160
too far I don't think there's any too

356
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,560
far when it comes to freedom but there's

357
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,120
too far when it comes to taking um and

358
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,758
so like that mindset of how you you do

359
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,360
something if you're going someplace to

360
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,320
uh the green indust industry kind of

361
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,399
like concept of

362
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,040
uh um profiting off of something and and

363
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:29,120
taking from something instead of just

364
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,958
uh being a part of producing medicine

365
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,120
being a part of growing something well

366
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:37,119
or being a part of community um so yeah

367
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,959
I guess often we just we just see that

368
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,839
swing right back after we think

369
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,159
something

370
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:48,759
improves um but once it it already

371
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:54,159
happened and I don't think uh we've seen

372
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:57,800
too much bad from it so um I I hope that

373
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,318
whatever does happen um it it swings

374
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,519
back towards decriminalization of a

375
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:06,318
medicinal

376
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:10,480
plant yeah it's one of those ones where

377
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:12,519
um like my cynical take on it is just

378
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,199
like [ __ ]

379
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,879
Americans because I'm like

380
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:21,719
okay I really like capitalism I like the

381
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:25,919
idea of people having opportunities to

382
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,240
be able to make something and Elevate

383
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,120
themselves and their people and their

384
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,600
families and I like the idea of people

385
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,198
in Thailand being able to take because

386
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,519
um Thailand has a really long

387
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,439
established cannabis culture everybody

388
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,839
knows like taii weed is like one of

389
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,800
those things like oh Thai stick or you

390
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,880
know all these different things and that

391
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:51,439
part you know southeast Asia in general

392
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:53,039
has a lot of it's obviously um been

393
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,880
there a long time because they have

394
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,759
really unique cannabis that almost

395
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,159
stands out as its own thing that's

396
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,759
different than everything else in the

397
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:03,159
world and um you know it would have been

398
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,000
cool to be able to

399
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:09,480
see like there when I talk to people a

400
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,599
lot of people were like oh they don't

401
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,599
there they they've everything's been

402
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,958
held back enough that they kind of need

403
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,958
help to be able to produce on a level to

404
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,078
be able to turn have it be like a

405
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,279
business thing and so you go okay that

406
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,759
would be cool for people to come in and

407
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,279
help them do their thing but as soon as

408
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,960
I started hearing about it everything

409
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,558
I'm hearing about was like oh

410
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,960
everybody's just

411
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:39,599
shipping last year's California weed out

412
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:43,240
the back door or out wherever to go over

413
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:46,319
there and liquidate it and when you go

414
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,759
somewhere to buy weed I had a um I have

415
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,159
a friend uh from Canada and he was like

416
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:51,759
yeah I just went to Thailand he's all

417
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,519
guess what I bought and I'm like oh

418
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:58,440
what' you get you know he goes I just

419
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,679
bought an eth of California half brown

420
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,798
run

421
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,919
for

422
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:08,200
$85 and I was like that's what's going

423
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:11,360
on I was like oh my God like this is so

424
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,240
it was so disappointing and um it's like

425
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,279
when I went to then then what happens is

426
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,359
all around the world of course everybody

427
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,359
always wants to know it's not just it's

428
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,240
not just you looking at the magazine

429
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,759
Center fold and going oh that that's a

430
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,640
new thing I've never heard of it it's

431
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,599
popular why is it popular it must be

432
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,038
good it happens no matter where you go

433
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,119
so there were people in Thailand who

434
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,000
were going well I mean we have this

435
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,119
stuff but you don't get a lot of weed it

436
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,919
doesn't look like what people want so

437
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,399
people were interested in being able to

438
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,400
produce the kind of weed that was like

439
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,600
worldwide contemporary competitive weed

440
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,320
and um I was like the same thing in um

441
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,639
like in Jamaica all the

442
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:58,079
weed that is really grown for production

443
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,400
it tends to be the stuff that I look at

444
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,240
and go that

445
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,320
that even though it's not specifically

446
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,720
I'm like that is like that's California

447
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,399
weed that's Amsterdam weed and you can

448
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,679
look at the plants and go this isn't

449
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,159
what would have come from India that was

450
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,559
originally Jamaican ganja you know and

451
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:19,159
um it's a trip

452
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,599
because that's kind of the same deal

453
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,760
it's like in in Jamaica when I talk to

454
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,879
my friends who live way up in the in the

455
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,079
hills and they are like yeah my grandpa

456
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,360
he grew a lot of weed he was one of the

457
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:34,879
first big big weed guys in the area and

458
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,839
you know I'm like oh that's cool you

459
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,400
know like what do you guys do you guys

460
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,798
grow and he's like yeah it's been

461
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,880
eradicated so hard in our area um that

462
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:45,798
there's not a lot of weed in general

463
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,720
right here a lot of the weed comes from

464
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:49,839
the production centers which they grow

465
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,600
all this other stuff I was talking about

466
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,759
but he was like we still in this area

467
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,240
when we do grow weed we grow the

468
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,400
traditional weed we call the Indian that

469
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,480
came with the with the people from India

470
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,200
when first when it was first introduced

471
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,200
basically and when we plant that it

472
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,080
grows and we don't have to do anything

473
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,600
to it and when we tried to grow all this

474
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,879
other stuff it rotted it died in

475
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,319
droughts it wasn't as hearty it did

476
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,440
wasn't you know what like we would call

477
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,960
here we would say like it's land racy

478
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,400
it's like you know and and he brought me

479
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,240
some of the weed and it was like really

480
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,400
stringy and it smelled like terpinolene

481
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,919
and Pine and um it had a really great

482
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,679
high but it wasn't what you would want

483
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
to produce which I imagine is probably

484
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:37,200
what it was like in Thailand you know

485
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,320
but um what would be cool in Jamaica

486
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,240
would have been if people would have

487
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,399
gone there and been like look if you can

488
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,400
just dial this in a little bit and get a

489
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,840
little bit of irrigation and dry it a

490
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,840
little bit better you guys can produce

491
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,199
Jamaican weed that's incredible because

492
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,798
it was really good weed it just hadn't

493
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,640
been handled like we would have handled

494
00:20:51,798 --> 00:21:00,119
it and um and but but it was so like the

495
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,280
identity of it was such making ganja

496
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,798
which was Indian weed grown in Jamaica

497
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,639
for a hundred years or whatever you know

498
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,400
and so um it would have been really cool

499
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,120
if people could have gone into Thailand

500
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,880
and been like okay you know we have

501
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:16,359
things that might have been eradicated

502
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,919
here that are these old Thai heirlooms

503
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,079
and let's find the things that are in

504
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,640
Thailand that are good that work here

505
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,199
and then let's try to dial in your

506
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:28,000
drying practices and dial in this and

507
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,120
try to help like them get their you know

508
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,519
people who want to go there really you

509
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,239
know as Carpet Baggers like go there and

510
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,158
try to build up what they have and then

511
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,679
refine it but instead what happens is

512
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,760
Americans and I'm American I can't like

513
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,159
say like oh [ __ ] Americans but

514
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:48,519
[ __ ] Americans we show up over there

515
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,120
and we see an opportunity and we're just

516
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,599
like let's just ship in all this stuff

517
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,399
and we'll sell it over here and not only

518
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,199
do that but take everything that they

519
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,080
have going on and try to kind of push in

520
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,440
and then have them grow all the same

521
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:07,918
things that we would grow and do it the

522
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:09,840
same way and I remember uh back in the

523
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,120
day hearing about how Amsterdam had weed

524
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,839
and you could go there and and like you

525
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,158
know everybody knew about Amsterdam if

526
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,158
you were alive in the 80s and the 90s it

527
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,600
was like whoa Amsterdam there's places

528
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,799
where you can buy weed buy seeds it's

529
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:27,719
crazy and so there was like that tourist

530
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:29,158
aspect where you know like people said

531
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,558
you know people come here and they do

532
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,880
their thing but they were just like

533
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,720
[ __ ] Americans and it got to the

534
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,880
point where after a while Amsterdam's

535
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,558
like we don't really want weed that much

536
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,960
because people eat four space cakes and

537
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,440
throw up on the sidewalk and they get

538
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,319
drunk and they're vulgar with it

539
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,960
everything's like vulgar like why is it

540
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,798
got to be so [ __ ] much you know and

541
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,278
it's just like such like a cultural

542
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:55,720
mindset and it kind of works where

543
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,519
you're at but when like the old west

544
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,038
lands somewhere that has cultural

545
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,720
sophistication and established cultural

546
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,919
practices over thousands of years and

547
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,558
then all of a sudden you're just there

548
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,840
and you're like hey I'm [ __ ] Billy

549
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,759
the Kid and I'm gonna [ __ ] roll an

550
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,558
ounce and eat a [ __ ] cheeseburger

551
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,519
with eight Patties on it and [ __ ]

552
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,079
throw up on the street with my friends

553
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,158
you're just like it's not really helping

554
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,000
it get established and I think that kind

555
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,760
of happened to Thailand and that's like

556
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,640
my hot take on it and then there's other

557
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,440
ways to look at it with a lot of nuance

558
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,559
which is just that it probably was like

559
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,759
you said with the pendulum swinging it

560
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:37,038
probably was a little bit much too soon

561
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,558
in a place that's so conservative and

562
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:42,440
surrounded by very conservative uh areas

563
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,720
where I'm sure there's pressure on the

564
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,278
royal family there from places where

565
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,720
they're like hey we're right over here

566
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,359
and we hang people for having seeds like

567
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,679
this is not this you know there's

568
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,879
probably a lot of nuance and stuff going

569
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,120
on too but I don't think it ever helps

570
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,240
when there's like you know people just

571
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,918
doing things in this big vulgar American

572
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,880
way you know it's like yeah it's a lot

573
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,038
of fun but at the same time I feel like

574
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,400
it uh it probably got overly exploited

575
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:16,158
and I don't think that the outside

576
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,880
influence probably helped I think

577
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,120
there's some truth into people saying

578
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,000
that and I I can't imagine that that's

579
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:26,639
just not a factor you know it was a

580
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,599
pretty fast change I remember um

581
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,080
scrolling through Instagram and I saw

582
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:34,599
the hashtag for black dog and these kids

583
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,240
in Thailand had made these shirts of

584
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,719
black dog and like it said black dog in

585
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,319
the back and they had a beautiful

586
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,720
picture of a black dog flower on the

587
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:45,558
front and they had all their faces uh uh

588
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,519
with smiley faces in front and things

589
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:49,798
like that to make sure they stayed

590
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,639
Anonymous um because the laws were

591
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,000
actually quite rough at the time um and

592
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,919
that's just what 2015 16 it was still

593
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,919
pretty pretty bad and I comment oh cool

594
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,480
shirts and they were like whoa wow cool

595
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:04,480
like Hey we're sorry we didn't asked to

596
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,679
make them but can we send you some and

597
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,880
so they sent some really cool Black Dog

598
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:12,360
shirts and stickers and um and the story

599
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,080
behind it was they actually were growing

600
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:16,038
it and it was they were growing Black

601
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,199
Dog seeds and made made a good selection

602
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:20,640
and we're growing wead and uh they ended

603
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,798
up kind of having their spot be

604
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,080
compromised and they were pretty worried

605
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:27,558
about getting in a lot of trouble and so

606
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,798
they took down the room and but they'd

607
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:30,398
got this really good picture of the

608
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,960
flower before the end like okay let's

609
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:35,959
pivot and do a t-shirt company with this

610
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,558
this picture of the black dog flower and

611
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,278
it was yeah just like kind of wild to

612
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,000
see but that was really not that long

613
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:45,679
ago that they were facing some serious

614
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,839
legal uh fears of going doing some

615
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,480
serious jail time for having a grow room

616
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,480
vers uh it just being

617
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,880
full everything kind of goes and then

618
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,120
now who knows what it's going to swing

619
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,278
back to yeah yeah and I think that is an

620
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,319
important sort of CounterPoint to make

621
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:06,440
which is that on the one hand it's very

622
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,000
clear to see and to point to what you

623
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,798
could argue as like a form of sort of

624
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,679
exploiting the the newly legalized

625
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:15,720
landscape you know with everyone rushing

626
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,200
in but I think the the really relevant

627
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,120
Counterpoint you have to make is that as

628
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,919
much as there is all this runs and Gary

629
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:28,519
pton being imported there is a very

630
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:31,640
thriving and um you know active younger

631
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,519
seen in Thailand that want all of this

632
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,080
you know Californian popular strains

633
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,558
just like young people in Australia just

634
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:39,038
like young people in America so it's

635
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:40,678
yeah I think it is worth you know

636
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,798
pointing out that there is there was

637
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,360
partially a demand for it there's

638
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,158
obviously a lot of people in Thailand

639
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:49,798
who I'm sure want to see like a more

640
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,278
Tero and a natural expression but yeah I

641
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:54,639
think it's it's worth worth uh comparing

642
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,880
both but you know in in terms of talking

643
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,600
about coming in and taking over this

644
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,520
works perfectly with our next story

645
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:05,918
which is that uh our good

646
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:08,599
friend Uncle burn he's back again he's

647
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,720
always in the news but in this time for

648
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,959
different news we're talking about him

649
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,278
today because burner and cookies have

650
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,000
announced their strategic news with

651
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:21,558
their intent to acquire cookies Florida

652
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,519
assets from a company called turp HQ the

653
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,359
announcement follows in the recent wake

654
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,879
of the Florida Supreme Court ruling that

655
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,158
will now allow adult youth cannabis

656
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,919
legalization measures to be on the

657
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,000
November ballot this also needs to take

658
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,080
into account the recent DEA scheduling

659
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,319
playing another vocal another big factor

660
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:45,240
so basically burner sees the Florida

661
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:47,158
ballot as very likely to win he's going

662
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,038
so far as to hedge his bets that it's

663
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,159
going to be worth becoming an active

664
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,720
player in Florida and for the people who

665
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,440
aren't aware cookies is a parent company

666
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,360
they license out the ability for other

667
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,840
companies to run cookies stores in

668
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,079
respective States that they're not

669
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,278
currently operating in so if you look at

670
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:05,079
burner's Instagram and the cookie stores

671
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,440
he regularly visits and shout outs those

672
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,480
are the ones that he and the parent

673
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,759
company own the other ones they're

674
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,000
privately owned so he's hedging his bets

675
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,798
that the Florida ballot is going to pass

676
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,278
and that there's going to be a huge New

677
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:19,759
Market in Florida on top of the

678
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,960
currently existing one I guess the

679
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,158
question needs to be asked do we think

680
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,278
it's going to be legalized and do we

681
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,919
think burner is ahead of the curve on

682
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:31,599
this one or just a bit optimistic

683
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,519
what do you think Mr main

684
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,879
Jane

685
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:42,960
um yeah I don't know I mean I think

686
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:46,200
uh as potentially big of a business as

687
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,519
they are and can be I think it's kind

688
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,960
of I think it's always it's like a a

689
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:55,960
worthwhile bet you know to just go okay

690
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,079
like if if it if it works it works and

691
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,558
if it doesn't then you know know it it's

692
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,720
not going to work out but if it works

693
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,639
out like they're they're going to win

694
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,200
you know and

695
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,799
um you know it's like it's it's

696
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,558
capitalism like once things are business

697
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,359
that's the that's the one thing like

698
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,319
that's what sticker farmer said last

699
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,639
time it's like people who are in

700
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,359
business they're in business they're

701
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,640
going to do business you know and when

702
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,959
you when they're looking at it they're

703
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,320
basically looking like okay if this is

704
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,798
going to be a good place to potentially

705
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,918
make a lot of money then get in there

706
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:34,079
and try to um try to control it it's the

707
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,519
same thing as you know like as that's

708
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,720
why I said about Thailand it's like yeah

709
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,798
people are just gonna show up and just

710
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,319
try to make a whole bunch of money like

711
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:47,079
that's just that's what like that is

712
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:49,240
that is the American thing to do is to

713
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:53,359
just try to go wherever you can and make

714
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:57,038
as much money as you can make and um you

715
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,879
know it's uh it's one of those things

716
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,319
it's like

717
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,799
not not what I'm into because it's not

718
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,839
what I would want to spend all my time

719
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:10,319
and energy on but like those guys that's

720
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,759
what they're into doing and um and

721
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,720
basically if all of a sudden they

722
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,879
weren't doing that then there would be a

723
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,600
vacuum and you would see who else coming

724
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,440
in you know and I've talked to Jesse

725
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:26,759
about this in the past like

726
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:29,159
um as much as there's a lot of different

727
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,440
details and new nuance and everything to

728
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,919
the whole story of all whatever

729
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:38,080
California legal cannabis branding

730
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:40,600
cookies burner all this

731
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:44,639
stuff there's like

732
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:47,158
um there's that aspect of like the

733
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,000
American dream you know where it's like

734
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,799
okay I can start here with this little

735
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,759
thing and like turn it into this this

736
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:58,440
big thing and it's one of those weird

737
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:00,119
things because if you're of one and

738
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,960
there's there's not only two mindsets

739
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,599
but if you're on one Far Side you're

740
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,759
like I don't want to see

741
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,359
anybody do good at

742
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,480
all and then there's the people who are

743
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:13,199
like I want to see people do good but

744
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,720
not at the expense of anything else and

745
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,159
then there's the people who are just

746
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,558
like just [ __ ] hustle and get money

747
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:25,000
you know and

748
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:26,798
um the most pure form of capitalism

749
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,278
unfortunately is the people who are just

750
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,960
like where can we get to where's the

751
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:33,359
next opportunity I'm going to take

752
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,759
advantage of it and as much as that's

753
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:40,240
not my natural mindset so that's not

754
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:42,000
what I do like I said if it there's

755
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,880
always going to be that person that does

756
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,759
that so you're always if you're not

757
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,600
there it's gonna just create a vacuum

758
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:52,519
and someone else is going to do it and

759
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:55,918
in this case um you know say what you

760
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,960
will about those guys but like in the

761
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:03,360
case of burner at least went from being

762
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,558
a guy who was like a bud tender to a guy

763
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,719
who all of the sudden was

764
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,678
internationally recognized and has a lot

765
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,278
of stuff under his belt that he's done

766
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,000
and then turned into you know now

767
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:17,119
cookies you're like it's this big huge

768
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,880
thing and you know it's like somebody's

769
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,719
going to do it they're going to do it

770
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,080
and when there's opportunities like this

771
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,600
there's no way that they're just going

772
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:29,638
to be like oh yeah whatever not not you

773
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,119
know brisket for the biscuit as they say

774
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:35,398
there was going to be like okay we could

775
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:38,158
maybe go down there and uh and do it so

776
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:40,439
just you know I think that's what's

777
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:45,039
what's going on is anything that opens

778
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,360
up those guys yeah I mean I know they in

779
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:51,240
Thailand they had a big presence too

780
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,599
cookies the genetics the company all

781
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,960
that stuff it's just there's people are

782
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,638
going to do that Germany just opened up

783
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,000
you're probably going to see cookies in

784
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:01,558
Germany and

785
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,759
and as much as it's like okay like you

786
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,839
know there was like the cookies and bod

787
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,839

789
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:16,158

791
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,679
incense in the mail and [ __ ] is like

792
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,440
what I would consider like a hippie dude

793
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,519
that's super cool DJ's drum and bass

794

795
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,319
and like way on that side of it he

796
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:34,079
travels places he trades people seeds

797
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:37,119
you got you got him on the one hand and

798
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:40,558
then you got cookies on the other you

799
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:44,398
know and you want to see like somebody

800
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:47,440
like that be the person doing that but

801
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:49,719
people like that they don't do that you

802
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,080
know you're burner's the one who's gonna

803
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,720
do that kind of [ __ ] so bod's not going

804
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,558
to show up and try to take over the

805
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,480
German Market cookie gonna do that you

806
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:02,558
know and it's everybody you know but it

807
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,319
but but yeah whatever happened to that

808
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,798
uh it just I it I think it was not a

809
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,599
good fit I don't think it really I don't

810
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:14,039
think it was a good fit in the sense

811
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:16,960
that the people who want what cookies

812
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:19,639
brings to the table a majority of them

813
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,480
don't want what bod brings to the table

814
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,280
and the people who want what bod brings

815
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,480
to the table don't want what cookies

816
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,240
brings to the table and it would be cool

817
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,480
if there was overlap but

818
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,838
in I think it used to be easier for

819
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,240
there to be overlap a long time ago

820
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:39,358
because when you saw something you were

821
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,239
offered that and everyone saw the same

822
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,279
thing and if it was on channel two

823
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,959
everybody saw channel two and now

824
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,879
everything's in bubbles and so the

825
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,800
people who are going to say that cookies

826
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,799
is

827
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,200
mids are the people who are going to be

828
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,359
like have you seen this crazy thing have

829
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,719
you seen you know Pine saw and the

830
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:01,519
people I talked about this at a

831
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:05,279
different point too they're in different

832
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:07,880
bubbles so like I I don't think that

833
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,119
they were able to and this I I said this

834
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,760
before the thing before the while they

835
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,920
were still doing it I was like I don't

836
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,119
know what each bubble's GNA get from the

837
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,320
other because I have friends that I talk

838
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,519
to and I'm like oh what's the cool stuff

839
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,760
you have and they pull out all this

840
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:27,239
stuff and I'm like this is gelato and

841
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,520
this is gelato and this is gelato and

842
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,078
this is this is the same thing and

843
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,719
they're like but look at this one and

844
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,880
they're like this is this and I'm like I

845
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,159
understand like it has it's been crossed

846
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,559
with whatever like it's sh Banger like

847
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,399
yeah it's cool it's good but it's good

848
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,920
like for the market of the people that

849
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,119
are in that bubble where it's like of

850
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,440
all these types this one is really good

851
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,200
but for somebody like me there's nothing

852
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:57,159
novel about it it's so similar to what

853
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:59,719
the last thing was and then somebody

854
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,598
like Bo is going to like make like some

855
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,759
kind of trippy poly hybrids with the

856
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,680
same things and you're going to be like

857
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,079
oh that's cool that has like the gelato

858
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,399
color but then you smell it and you're

859
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,480
like oh it has that thing in there that

860
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,760
is different and they're to they just

861
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,920
kind of sit they sit in two different

862
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,560
worlds I think in general even if they

863
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,838
were to incorporate a little one from

864
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,358
the other it's still going to always

865
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:27,599
wind up I think kind of splitting off

866
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:32,119
and and being in two two different world

867
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:36,680
worlds really you know um I I had heard

868
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,599
that um burner was pushing it a lot and

869
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:40,598
that there was other people in cookies

870
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:44,920
who were not into

871
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:47,119
it I could imagine that yeah yeah so I I

872
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,119
heard that he that like it seemed as if

873
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,119
he was really Keen to make it happen but

874
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,960
it was other for other powers that be he

875
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,559
was I mean I I I was told at some point

876
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,440
that like bodies I think it was uh Sun

877
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:03,920
Sunshine 4 or whatever that is Sunshine

878
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,400
Daydream Sunshine 4 one of those things

879
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,079
that burner was like that's my favorite

880
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,240
weed and it's like cookies if they put

881
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,160
that in a myar everybody who is that in

882
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,318
that bubble is going to pull it out and

883
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,559
go what did what they did a bait and

884
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:20,838
switch this isn't this isn't cookies

885
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:24,039
weed this is something else even though

886
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:26,039
you got burner saying this is better

887
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:28,119
they're still going to be like I was

888
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:30,159
looking for this everybody knows that

889
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,920
cookies Paradigm of that kind of weed

890
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:35,239
where it's the gelato runs was able to

891
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,200
jump in there because it's gelato all

892
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:41,078
this different stuff but it

893
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,919
doesn't you know they don't have like a

894
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,119
I don't know I just think the the

895
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,119
overlap isn't there and it's a trip when

896
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:52,280
you know people like I

897
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:55,000
know people who if weed is anything like

898
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,680
this other weed over there it's just

899
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,039
instantly going to be described in a

900
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,559
derogatory way like if there's the

901
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:03,920
people who if they smell a little bit of

902
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:06,759
terpinolene it's like instantly that's

903
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,838
that's train wreck that's Jack that's

904
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,720
that thing and then you're like well I

905
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:13,759
know what you don't like about those but

906
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:15,279
this one is different but it's there the

907
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,720
same thing with green weed people would

908
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,519
be like no I only smoke purple or it

909
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:24,799
doesn't look visually crazy and you're

910
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,119
like yeah but when you smoke it and they

911
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,240
could smoke it and think it's the best

912
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,280
when they're like it but I like pretty

913
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,879
weed and you're like what are you doing

914
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,760
with you know but that's just how how it

915
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,440
is that there's there's big splits in

916
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,079
what people um consider good and then

917
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,119
you have some it's all subjective is

918
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,800
what's funny and then when you get

919
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,318
things that are subjective you get a lot

920
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,000
of people who really don't have their

921
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:50,960
own opinion so that's what tends to

922
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,400
happen that that's what pop is right so

923
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,119
like if you go okay um this is what

924
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,800
everybody likes right now there's always

925
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,240
a lot of people who are like yeah it's

926
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,560
what's good I can tell it's good because

927
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:04,519
everyone likes it and then there's a lot

928
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,199
of people who are like yeah but this

929
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:09,599
thing's good too and they're like well

930
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:11,598
but nobody likes it so it doesn't even

931
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,119
they won't even take the time to

932
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,039
discover if they like it and it's just

933
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,640
human nature that's what we do we go in

934
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:21,239
these groups and some people like purple

935
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:23,078
shiny flashy weed and you know and I

936
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:26,358
mean you can incorporate that too and

937
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:29,480
turn you know like it it's not

938
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:32,199
completely out of bod's wheelhouse to be

939
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,679
able to go okay I'm going to pull a fast

940
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,960
one on you and you're going to look at

941
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:37,118
it and you're going to think it's all

942
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,079
these things but then I Incorporated

943
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,240
these new

944
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,400
traits but most people who like the

945
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:47,959
character of different weed like me or

946
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:50,519
bod or Jesse or you like we we of course

947
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,199
are going to be like okay I want to have

948
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:57,599
like all of us here and bod all have

949
00:39:54,199 --> 00:40:03,118
purple Frosty pretty bag appeel crazy

950
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:05,519
weed but we like it because we like it

951
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,800
not because it's the only thing you can

952
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:11,079
like we also have a bunch of other stuff

953
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:15,359
that maybe might not ever be as popular

954
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:16,920
with the big group but among the small

955
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,199
groups that are here and there somebody

956
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,079
would be like oh that's awesome I'm glad

957
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:22,879
all you I'm glad you don't just have

958
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,640
purple Frosty pretty weed you have this

959
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,559
odd thing I like this one this is the

960
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:29,400
one I liked because of it being a

961
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:33,000
subjective experience you know it's a

962
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,639
weird weird thing but um yeah I mean I I

963
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,719
think people just get I think groups get

964
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,639
stuck and then um I'm sure whoever's

965
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,480
running cookies is like no we're not GNA

966
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,318
put that weed in our bags it's not gonna

967
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,000
not going to work and they probably get

968
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,000
bad feedback if they try it you

969
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,239
know yeah possibly to their own

970
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,880
detriment there you go well look I mean

971
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:00,039
this uh this sort of works into our our

972
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,280
next topic which is that on the uh the

973
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:05,880
last episode we had sticker Farmer on

974
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,040
and um and on that episode he was

975
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,119
talking about how the New York scene is

976
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,960
actually playing a huge role in what's

977
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,960
currently popular in the overall picture

978
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,920
of the states at the moment and we've

979
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,838
seen a rise in their distribution

980
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,000
especially in the Advent of the new

981
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:24,679
sprayed pack Revolution so what we're

982
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,679
actually seeing is that the New York

983
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:29,318
scene is playing a major role in

984
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:31,719
determining what is popular in terms of

985
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:33,880
distribution the issue is that many of

986
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:35,519
the New York stores and little bodegas

987
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,838
that are selling this cannabis are not

988
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,440
registered and are not technically legal

989
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,759
so The Blacklist has posted an

990
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,159
interesting article stating that last

991
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,880
week alone 75 of these stores have been

992
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:48,519
clamped down and closed and that's just

993
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,400
in the first week There's plans for

994
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:52,759
hundreds more of them over the coming

995
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,720
weeks or two so I guess the question

996
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,200
becomes does this positively or

997
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,879
negatively affect the scene having the

998
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,159
police crack down on these small

999
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,079
supplies many people have argued that

1000
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:05,960
it's going to push the distribution back

1001
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,400
onto the street which may benefit the

1002
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,880
community what do we think I'll throw it

1003
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,800
over to you

1004
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,680
Jesse uh police cracking down on

1005
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,720
anything doesn't help anything ever no

1006
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:24,598
absolutely not no

1007
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:26,679
um but uh yeah just just know I I don't

1008
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,200
know like how how can that help anything

1009
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:32,679
ever let let people compete um I know

1010
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:35,000
it's probably pretty rough for a lot of

1011
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,440
licensed Farmers dealing with the

1012
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,760
situation over there because it's like

1013
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,318
you go through all this effort and um

1014
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,920
and anything kind of

1015
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,719
goes

1016
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,000
um my main concern is when when you get

1017
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:53,159
to those kind of places where you end up

1018
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,280
doing

1019
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:58,639
something to uh anything goes or

1020
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,400
something of like standards aren't good

1021
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:03,279
with potency or other things are added

1022
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,000
and things like that and it's like where

1023
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,519
everything could be fine especially if

1024
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,400
you did it from like a medical

1025
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:14,960
perspective or um that if

1026
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,920
anyone has issues then that ends up

1027
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,519
being the detriment to that kind of uh

1028
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,480
Freedom around the plant um so yeah I

1029
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:27,440
definitely worry about a bunch of shops

1030
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:30,240
just having anything go selling whatever

1031
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,159
without any kind of Standards but at at

1032
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,318
the same time like we've never really

1033
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:39,279
seen regulations or police help anything

1034
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:41,279
so um I I just always I missed the the

1035
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,480
medical days here I think that should

1036
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,920
have always been just strengthen the

1037
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,240
rights around medical and the testing

1038
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,480
and patient safety and quality and it

1039
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:55,318
never should have been um this

1040
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:58,480
recreational kind of concept with

1041
00:43:55,318 --> 00:44:00,279
um yeah I I just it just loses so much

1042
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,318
it's over taxed it's over regulated it's

1043
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,880
a broken system something that should be

1044
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:07,000
profitable in California is completely

1045
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,119
not everyone who's tried uh has has lost

1046
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:15,358
all kinds of uh money and time and

1047
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:17,760
effort and has tried so hard and um I'm

1048
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,400
New York at this moment has a a much

1049
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,359
more a lot more freedom but when things

1050
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,480
go too far in One Direction and then you

1051
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:30,440
get police cracking down um

1052
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,679
yeah again I I don't think it ever helps

1053
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,559
quality or anything when police come in

1054
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:40,199
and do anything I think it's more about

1055
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:41,839
people should be uh educated and and you

1056
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:43,480
if if everyone's educated then people

1057
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,039
are not going to want to go to the Shady

1058
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,318
spots right like you're going to go to

1059
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,119
the spot where you actually have

1060
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,759
connection and so I think uh the

1061
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,920
competition comes through quality

1062
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,599
through standards through connecting

1063
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,200
people with information um so I think

1064
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:01,240
the the places that dedicate to that

1065
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,679
will probably live through this the ones

1066
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:05,000
that don't will make a little bit of

1067
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:06,358
money for a little bit before uh things

1068
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,880
kind of

1069
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:12,000
change yeah and I'll I'll just quickly

1070
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,480
add before I let uh Mr meanin take over

1071
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,838
that I think one of the interesting

1072
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,838
things about this is that there's been

1073
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:21,199
so much rhetoric from you know the the

1074
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:24,159
the uh the Cannabis control policy and

1075
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:26,639
the roll out of um legalization in New

1076
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,279
York and yet it seems like the rhetoric

1077
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,159
doesn't match like to be like yeah we're

1078
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,880
legalizing it and and of course you need

1079
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:34,719
regulations but to immediately start by

1080
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,280
clamping down on all these like

1081
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,519
particularly mum and pop small sort of

1082
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,960
you know they they're like most of them

1083
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:43,559
are like bodas you know like they're not

1084
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,119
they're not these huge Enterprises it is

1085
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,800
it's interesting to see you know what I

1086
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,160
mean like that the first step in them

1087
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,318
sort of trying to roll it out is to just

1088
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,960
sort of clamp down so hard but what's

1089
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:55,159
your thoughts Mr main

1090
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:58,318
Jane well like Jesse was saying like

1091
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:00,558
we're with when we had Medical that was

1092
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:04,519
there was you know there was weed

1093
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:08,519
stores and they were operational and

1094
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:10,440
everything was kind of going fine and

1095
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:13,239
um yeah I

1096
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,358
mean it's I don't

1097
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:19,279
know the the way that

1098
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:23,719
um the way that they set everything up

1099
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:28,839
it really incentivizes people to do

1100
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:31,399
things the wrong way in that if you have

1101
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:34,000
a store you can imagine it's a lot

1102
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,920
easier to to just go ahead and rent a

1103
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,159
building and get a bunch of weed and

1104
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,960
sell it from there and if you do it that

1105
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:43,118
way you're going to be able to sell it

1106
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,559
for really cheap you're going to be able

1107
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,119
to sell everything you know it's cheaper

1108
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:49,559
because you get it for Less you don't

1109
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,000
have to test it you don't have any

1110
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,960
responsibility if anything happens who's

1111
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,440
is it we don't know it's just you know

1112
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,679
these they're just these little burner

1113
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:03,720
Bo Vega stores you know and

1114
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:05,440
um if I don't know I feel like if if it

1115
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:08,000
would have continued under the model

1116
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,358
that was already kind of working they

1117
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
could have just Incorporated

1118
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,480
everything like in in California it

1119
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,159
could have stayed this way and I think

1120
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,760
it would have made a working model for

1121
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:24,078
other places too to

1122
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,480
where um I don't know that's it's a it

1123
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,960
was a funny thought that I had and I

1124
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,318
understand that there's it's a little

1125
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:35,440
bit more it's it's a little different

1126
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:40,000
than that but if you say um we legalized

1127
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,000
weed right and

1128
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,960
then we legalized weed and we have a

1129
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:52,359
huge problem with the black

1130
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:55,880
market like just let that like soak into

1131
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:57,679
the brain for a second we legalized weed

1132
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,240
but there's a huge problem with the

1133
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:03,399
black market if you legalize weed how is

1134
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,799
there a black market exactly so they

1135
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,119
didn't legalize weed they

1136
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,318
regulated and they

1137
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:14,838
basically supercharged the black

1138
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:17,679
market because there's so much incentive

1139
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:19,318
to be in the black market and so little

1140
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,000
incentive to be

1141
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:23,558
legal so if they could have just taken

1142
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,960
what was originally going on in

1143
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:29,160
California under

1144
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,920
215 everybody had incentive to go okay

1145
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:33,039
this we're going to we want to create

1146
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:36,519
clean products because we know that this

1147
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:40,920
is going to everybody and it's basically

1148
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:44,960
a medical system but because cannabis is

1149
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:47,280
inherently medicinal regardless of any

1150
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,559
conditions that you might have you don't

1151
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,040
have to have anything wrong with you for

1152
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,960
cannabis to be a medicine that you don't

1153
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:58,119
have to have anything wrong with you for

1154
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:00,920
for for food or water or clean air to be

1155
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:04,599
medicinal they're inherently medicinal

1156
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:07,400
things that are healthy and clean right

1157
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:10,599
and like they say the the poison is in

1158
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,160
the dosage you know like it's like it of

1159
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:15,559
course everything can be maybe a little

1160
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:17,759
bit out of out of hand but weed

1161
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:20,519
surprisingly enough out of everything

1162
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,559
I've ever discovered in the whole world

1163
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:26,000
seems to be about the least harmful to

1164
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,680
the majority of people who use it and

1165
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,559
people are like oh oh well it makes some

1166
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:32,239
people be schizophrenic and I'm like

1167
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:36,280
yeah I believe that but like out of all

1168
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:38,959
the people who I know who smoked weed

1169
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,599
and were crazy they were [ __ ] crazy

1170
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,440
and yeah smoke weed you could also say

1171
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,559
like you know potato chips cause

1172
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,119
schizophrenia because if you look at

1173
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:51,119
schizophrenic people there's 15% of them

1174
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,599
that they were eating a lot of [ __ ]

1175
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:57,039
potato chips you know and so like

1176
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,240
schizophrenia causes schizophrenia weed

1177
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,279
just is not the right medicine for

1178
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:03,000
schizophrenia it's not the best medicine

1179
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,599
for it that's for sure because naturally

1180
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,719
it does make you paranoid it can be I

1181
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,280
could see how like that wouldn't be if

1182
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:11,439
you're schizophrenic you're not like hey

1183
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,519
dude smoke a bunch of haze or something

1184
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,798
it's not the greatest thing to do but

1185
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,960
probably like maybe straight CBD weed

1186
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:20,480
might be really helpful you might find

1187
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,199
some novel canabo combinations that if

1188
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,400
you give them to somebody who is

1189
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,358
schizophrenic and you believe that THC

1190
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,318
triggered it you might discover that no

1191
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,920
actually this is what happened but

1192
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,440
there's no real studies on that being

1193
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,798
done so there's these little things that

1194
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,720
people say is harmful about it but

1195
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:41,719
overall it's coffee and caffeine can be

1196
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,639
really not great foral

1197
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:46,879
illness te it happened I just saw this

1198
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,598
thing I can't remember who it was but

1199
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,200
one of these companies Panera or

1200
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,000
something uh not to you know say that's

1201
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:59,919
who it was but it was a company like

1202
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:02,000
that had a really strong tea and they um

1203
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,880
it was it was whatever I can't remember

1204
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,440
what it was but it was like you know 300

1205
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,880
milligrams in a cup and people are like

1206
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,159
cool and they drink 12 cups and all of a

1207
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,680
sudden they got a gram and a half or

1208
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,399
whatever of of of caffeine in their

1209
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,919
blood all at once and they have heart

1210
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,720
failure and that's like caffeine is just

1211
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,079
completely unregulated you can buy

1212
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,118
bottles and no do and you can eat you

1213
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:25,280
know whatever and it's no big deal you

1214
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:29,720
know I think the the lethal dose of

1215
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,798
aspirin is like uh 27 of the of the week

1216
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:35,558
tablets or something like that like it's

1217
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:37,880
like 12 extra or whatever you know and

1218
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:40,319
um all these things they're just like

1219
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:43,519
they're they're everywhere and there's

1220
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:47,719
no big deal about it and weed was in a

1221
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:50,000
position where it was basically like you

1222
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:51,919
had a lot of incentive to go okay

1223
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,199
instead of doing anything where I'm

1224
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,358
going to take this and I'm gonna I'm G

1225
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:59,919
to ship weed to Japan or sing poor or

1226
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:02,880
whatever it was it was like no I have

1227
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,760
stores that are around me and I can take

1228
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,480
my weed and make sure it's really high

1229
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,799
quality and compete in a natural

1230
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,000
American sense of true capitalism and

1231
00:52:09,798 --> 00:52:13,719
bring it in and be like do you want mine

1232
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,440
and they're like no it's not good enough

1233
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:17,199
and you're like okay I need to improve

1234
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,240
my product I need to improve my

1235
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:21,318
marketing I need to improve my attitude

1236
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:22,719
I need to improve the way I treat people

1237
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:26,199
whatever the [ __ ] making your stuff

1238
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,798
not sell it can be solved by doing good

1239
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:30,919
capital Capital ISM the way you would

1240
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:32,759
with anything else that you were making

1241
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:36,000
but

1242
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,599
they legalized it and now they have a

1243
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,798
huge problem with the black

1244
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:45,960
market it really wasn't like a big thing

1245
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:48,519
at the time of 215 where it was like and

1246
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:51,639
I will say that things had started to

1247
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:55,239
get out of control but I think they got

1248
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:57,558
out of control because there was only

1249
00:52:55,239 --> 00:53:01,318
these little tiny you can't take the

1250
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:05,280
whole country and then just make it so

1251
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:07,199
that it's actually like legal in just

1252
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,440
California because what's gonna happen

1253
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,159
California's going to become and remain

1254
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,358
the huge production Center that it's

1255
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:15,199
always been and it's going to dwarf

1256
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,759
everything and everybody's going to go

1257
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,798
there as the source for this product but

1258
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,640
had they actually gone you know what

1259
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:23,679
what was working in California seems to

1260
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:26,000
be working pretty good let's do it

1261
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,598
everywhere everybody within your own

1262
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
state can all sell to medical patients

1263
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:34,559
who is a medical patient anybody who

1264
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,599
gets a benefit in their health mental or

1265
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,440
physical from consuming cannabis

1266
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,318
products and who is that that's almost

1267
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,880
everybody as we were already saying

1268
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:46,880
except for possibly a very small

1269
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,640
minority of people and likely it's we

1270
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,200
don't even know if that's if it's

1271
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:55,000
causation or cor correlation it's not

1272
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:58,039
necessarily determined so

1273
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,639
um now you you have this situation where

1274
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:02,239
in New York they're going through and

1275
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,400
they're busting all these shops and

1276
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,798
there's all these different shops if

1277
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,400
they were under a 215 model all those

1278
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:12,079
shops would have already paid to have a

1279
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,880
shop they would go oh I mean we'd prefer

1280
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:18,160
not to get busted but we can't jump

1281
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,920
through all the Hoops of this of this

1282
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:23,679
form of of legalization which is this

1283
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,838
heavy regulation so if they would have

1284
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:28,078
just modeled it the way of the working

1285
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:31,880
system we already had that was producing

1286
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,240
billions and billions of dollars then it

1287
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,720
would they wouldn't be in the position

1288
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:39,118
they were in now you would just have a

1289
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:42,199
bunch of mom and pop bodegas who pay a

1290
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:46,119
licensing fee to carry products that

1291
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:48,480
have to be proven safe and effective and

1292
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:52,400
then you'd be able to have everything

1293
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,760
work and it would just be a huge

1294
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,680
economy money machine it would just be

1295
00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:00,160
like just going cra crazy in all these

1296
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:03,598
states but instead this little bit of

1297
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:05,239
money funnels to these big uh Regulatory

1298
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,359
Agencies and everybody else who's

1299
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:09,719
involved with that side of it and

1300
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:12,480
everybody is incentivized to have a

1301
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:14,239
bodega and have it just be like we're

1302
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,559
just going to sell [ __ ] until we get

1303
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,279
busted and then they get shut down and

1304
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,599
they probably go rent another place I'll

1305
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:24,119
bet the bodegas that just got closed

1306
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:26,880
I'll bet 20 to 80% of them will get

1307
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,720
rented back out to new people people who

1308
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,480
just set up weed shops in those same

1309
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:32,759
exact locations and they'll just

1310
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,798
continue to bust them and it'll just be

1311
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,720
all goofy whereas under the like the the

1312
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:39,599
model of having medicine for everybody

1313
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:41,959
you know regardless of whether oh you

1314
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,079
don't have to have cancer or whatever it

1315
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,318
is that makes it a medicine it's a

1316
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,839
medicine for pretty much everybody you

1317
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:53,798
can go byy uh Tylenol PM you can go buy

1318
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:55,519
Theraflu you can go buy aspirin you can

1319
00:55:53,798 --> 00:55:57,719
go buy all these things that are like

1320
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,599
yeah they're give you liver failure you

1321
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:04,759
can die they're gnarly they're addictive

1322
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:06,480
in a real uh real physically dependent

1323
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,440
way where it's like you actually really

1324
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,559
need these but everybody can get them

1325
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:15,679
everywhere and and it's kind of all good

1326
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:17,119
um you know which of course now

1327
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:18,719
hopefully that's not what happens to

1328
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,559
weed where you have to be the aspirin

1329
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:23,879
company to sell the weed which is

1330
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:27,200
another step of Regulation that now

1331
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,280
doesn't exist but uh I I just think that

1332
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:32,480
was the real problem in places like New

1333
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:36,559
York is that they legalize and everybody

1334
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:38,599
goes it's legal now and in reality it's

1335
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,480
there there's too much of a barrier to

1336
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:42,480
entry for everybody to be able to have

1337
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,519
it be like it was legal because we

1338
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,400
living here saw what it was like when it

1339
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:50,000
was basically legal and the economy

1340
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,639
flourished everybody was involved

1341
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,798
everything was competition and

1342
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:56,400
capitalism in a healthy way there was a

1343
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:58,599
lot of collaboration there was a lot lot

1344
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,000
of tears of prices there was a lot of

1345
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:03,480
different things that were going on and

1346
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,960
it kind of which led to better weed farm

1347
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,000
farmers get paid better better

1348
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,880
connection with medicine the same kind

1349
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,559
of community members coming in and and

1350
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,838
guiding their choices for what works

1351
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:17,200
with them and um and fresh weed coming

1352
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:18,639
in that you could actually smell over

1353
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:22,199
the

1354
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:24,759
counter rolling pre-rolls right then um

1355
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:28,798
instead of it all just being packaged

1356
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:31,799
and sitting and distrib ution and um and

1357
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:34,519
the farmers are losing the customers are

1358
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:37,519
losing and so who's

1359
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:40,639
benefiting yeah all

1360
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:42,960
around that's it that's it well look

1361
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:45,400
while we're on the topic of New York

1362
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:49,318
I've seen an increasing number of photos

1363
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:52,318
over the past few weeks of some very

1364
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:55,639
funky colored weed and I think it's come

1365
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:58,079
to the climax with uh we've seen a photo

1366
00:57:55,639 --> 00:58:00,960
doing the recently I'll flash it on the

1367
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,240
screen of what looks like some

1368
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,960
artificial colored moon rocks I'm sure

1369
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:07,639
you guys have probably seen one or more

1370
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,480
of these photos I guess the question

1371
00:58:07,639 --> 00:58:11,279
becomes do you think this is going to

1372
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,838
continue on I mean when moonrocks

1373
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,720
initially came out you could certainly

1374
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:16,440
say they were bit of a fad you know they

1375
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:19,199
didn't really stay around for very long

1376
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:22,000
as a popular idea but I have to say I

1377
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:23,919
have seen more and more of these

1378
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,798
artificially infused snugs going around

1379
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,119
and I have to think that it's because

1380
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:31,159
they've likewise being infused with the

1381
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:33,200
fake turps what do we think is this

1382
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:34,798
going to be like the original moon rocks

1383
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:36,759
and they'll fall off quickly or do we

1384
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:39,759
think this might be here to stay because

1385
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,119
the the turps sort of elevate it is that

1386
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,160
picture blurred out because it's just

1387
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:48,079
too offensive to we what's happening

1388
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:50,159
that might be I blurred out its genitals

1389
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,039
the genitals okay yeah I was gonna say

1390
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:56,399
is that was that an exposed

1391
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:58,359
anus there's a rule

1392
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,280
Yeah well yeah it goes against the

1393
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:04,159
community guidelines for

1394
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:07,280
sure yeah that's wild

1395
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:09,118
right yeah that's really hideous uh but

1396
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,839
I have seen a bunch of these videos too

1397
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,280
where you'll see a bunch of like pound

1398
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:16,480
bags in New York and like some will be

1399
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:19,359
completely purple and kind of this blue

1400
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,159
and this yellowish like yeah I don't

1401
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:25,358
know I wouldn't couldn't imagine having

1402
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,480
anything to do with it yeah I mean I I

1403
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:29,920
think I don't know what going on or why

1404
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,440
no right yeah I mean products I think

1405
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:36,480
people just naturally are like oh let's

1406
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:39,280
try this let's try that I mean that weed

1407
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,760
right there you could have kind of used

1408
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,720
weed that you could probably buy for $40

1409
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,799
a pound and then you can throw that

1410
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:49,798
stuff on and be like I got a new thing

1411
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,280
and if it moves you didn't really lose

1412
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:52,679
very much and then you're like okay

1413
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,440
let's go get the rest of those and we're

1414
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:58,279
just going to throw some more garbage on

1415
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,440
here and make some more fancy garbage

1416
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,160
wheat because like you know I assume

1417
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:07,679
somebody bought that sack and somebody

1418
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,598
sold that sack you know it's a wild uh

1419
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,199
it's a wild thing I mean over the years

1420
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:16,079
I've seen people do a lot of really

1421
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:18,318
silly stuff I mean I've seen people I've

1422
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,160
seen people who really need a need a

1423
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:25,599
little a little you know a a little

1424
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:27,719
advantage or they really need to come up

1425
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,200
real quick and I I've seen people do

1426
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:34,399
some some trippy stuff you know I've

1427
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:38,318
seen people make fake cash I've seen uh

1428
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:40,200
i' I've been I can't remember if I was

1429
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,798
oh yeah no no I was gonna say I sold

1430
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:45,759
fake cash I was not sold fake cash like

1431
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:50,000
in Lots or something or like no but I I

1432
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,520
I was I I was down on hate Street when I

1433
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,440
was a teenager I think I was probably 14

1434
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:56,960
or something and we bought some fake

1435
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,798
acid

1436
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,559
and we ate it which of course could have

1437
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:04,000
been the dirtiest acid ever luckily it

1438
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:05,200
was fake and not bad because bad acid

1439
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,159
sucks you know then you're now you're

1440
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:10,759
just Meed out a couple dollars you know

1441
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:14,838
killer clowns from outer space and [ __ ]

1442
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,680
but we were we were sold bad acid which

1443
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:19,199
like whatever acid's like five bucks a

1444
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:24,118
hit or whatever you know what I mean but

1445
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:26,480
we went back and we found this dude and

1446
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:29,119
uh you know we weren't happy with him

1447
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:32,760
and he wasn't comfortable with us and so

1448
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:37,200
he gave us some fake hash to make up and

1449
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:39,400
this hash was like ground up shake with

1450
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,318
like honey in it or something you know

1451
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,838
so it's like these little grams that

1452
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:44,960

1465
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:13,798
take the skin off and then they put like

1466
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:15,679
ambasal on it so that when people go to

1467
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:17,239
to test it it makes their tongue numb

1468

1479
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:46,358
like it's really like really resinous

1480

know so he buys it for like 40 bucks and

1483
01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:55,519
then we get it back and we open it up

1484
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:58,639
and we're like this isn't weed it had

1485
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:01,440
tons of tricomes but they were not they

1486
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:03,440
weren't they weren't caped they had no

1487
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,639
nothing they were just they were just

1488
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:10,440
little fuzz and it's a plant that grows

1489
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:12,960
in Hawaii that they call cucko and they

1490
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,318
sell it to people who don't know better

1491
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,318
and when we went

1492
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:19,920
back to get the money back from this

1493
01:03:17,318 --> 01:03:22,318
from this little little Filipino dude he

1494
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,440
goes oh you got to go get my get your

1495
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:28,038
money from my cousins and we look over

1496
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,838
and these dudes sitting on a at a picnic

1497
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:32,799
table down there and they were all like

1498
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:35,000
400 pounds and super muscular big old

1499
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:37,838
Hawaiian looking dudes you know and we

1500
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,760
were like yeah well I looked at my buddy

1501
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:43,000
and I go looked like you lost your 40

1502
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,039
bucks you know and we left but like

1503
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,639
people always try to figure out

1504
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:51,760
something to do but what's Wild is

1505
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:55,000
imagine if you could take the shake and

1506
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,359
put the honey in it and create a

1507
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,599
business and have it actually take off

1508
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:01,960
and be a real thing that's what's

1509
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:05,519
happening right now because bud has

1510
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:08,599
become so affordable if it's of a lower

1511
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:10,318
grade that people can now go get stuff

1512
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:12,640
that's of a super low grade and they're

1513
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:15,519
like oh well the colors off the smells

1514
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:18,879
off that's it the color and the smell

1515
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:21,159
guess what food coloring and spray turps

1516
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,318
and now all of a sudden you're turning

1517
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:26,759
you know $20 pounds into who cares what

1518
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,599
who cares if it's a $80 p pound people

1519
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,599
are still like dude I got this eth it

1520
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:34,400
only cost me 20 bucks it's great look

1521
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:36,400
and it's purple or this shit's blue I

1522
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,798
wonder what they did what strand is this

1523
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,278
you know and it's you just imagine like

1524
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:44,038
the weird scam economy now and now you

1525
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:47,358
don't have to sit at the picnic table at

1526
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:51,559
HOA and sell cuckoo you can make a

1527
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:54,719
telegram and a Instagram and a Facebook

1528
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:58,000
and all these other things and reach all

1529
01:04:54,719 --> 01:05:00,118
these people and hey you needed the $40

1530
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,440
sack of something and then people get it

1531
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:05,760
and when they actually get it and smoke

1532
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:08,278
it it's actually weed like not to us

1533
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,039
it's not weed but to whoever bought it

1534
01:05:08,278 --> 01:05:11,719
and couldn't get weed before and they

1535
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:14,200
just got this on the internet somewhere

1536
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:15,919
they're like dude we're smoking proper

1537
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:19,519
like look this shit's so good it turned

1538
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,960
my hands blue you know people don't know

01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,240
wait the turning your hand blue is the

1541
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,960
point where I thought that nobody would

1542
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:31,598
go back for something but I don't know

1543
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,559
you it is it is a step above um yeah I

1544
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:36,200
guess like honey and oregano or whatever

1545
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:37,720
the f yeah I mean I just imagine that

1546
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:41,038
there's there's there's a lot of people

1547
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:44,038
who like the the standard of what is

1548
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,240
good weed was like dude I smoked it and

1554
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:59,598
these people who there was these people

1555
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,119
who were selling weed at like regga on

1556
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:05,359
the river in the parking lot and it was

1557
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:07,480
like not it was not very good and my

1558
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:09,400
buddy had this had this Mexican weed

1559
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,039
that was like really good for Mexican

1560
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,160
like people would think that it was we

1561
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:17,520
called it pretend because it people

1562
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:19,759
thought it was like real real Cali weed

1563
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,038
but it was not but it was like the kind

1564
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,720
of weed where if you could have got it

1565
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,720
now and sprayed it would have been like

1566
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:27,439
oh this is great this is great weed it

1567
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:30,558
just kind of it didn't add up to what we

1568
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,200
what we thought was good weed and I used

1569
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,920
to joke there was these it came from

1570
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:37,838
this from these guys sitting in a

1571
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,559
parking lot and they had this weed and

1572
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:44,000
they were selling it and it was just

1573
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:47,039
like very the quality was like it was

1574
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,639
just like this weed was just dubious you

1575
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,640
know you're just like you just look at

1576
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:53,078

Wrangle one of these buds down and and

1610
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:20,119
get Mr Mr Jean to do do the guinea pig

1611
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:26,319
for

1612
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:29,838
us yeah I definitely uh I definitely uh

1613
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,839
yeah no

1614
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:36,359
no is it

1615
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:38,798
weird definitely we all right well on to

1616
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:42,239
our next story we got a good one right

1617
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:47,479
here so I'm sure many people have seen

1618
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:50,959
the post but uh basically 710 has come

1619
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:53,759
out with uh quite a daming post about

1620
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,000
how they sent the same herb to five

1621
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:59,198
different California labs and got widely

1622
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,960
varying results from 14% THC at the

1623
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:04,559
lowest through to

1624
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:08,798
24% at the highest let me flash the

1625
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:11,039
Right image here we go um so despite the

1626
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:13,439
same plant and the same batch of nugs

1627
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,079
being sent out they got widely varying

1628
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:18,439
results and this is on a background of

1629
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:20,640
the already suspicious variation between

1630
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:23,238
cannabis Labs along with wildly

1631
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,239
outrageous numbers posted from time to

1632
01:09:23,238 --> 01:09:29,559
time including the infamous state flower

1633
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:32,519
headband 41% which we discussed in Prior

1634
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:34,480
episodes overall this largely confirms

1635
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,600
what people have suspected that not only

1636
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:39,399
do you get a huge variation in the

1637
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,719
testing of weed from one lab to another

1638
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:45,599
but also that there may be components of

1639
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:48,600
pay to play or corruption at hand given

1640
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,719
that THC sells weed how rampant do we

1641
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,560
think this problem is do we think that

1642
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:57,319
we can really trust the values on a

1643
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,320
cannabis jar that we see

1644
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:05,158
I'll start off with Jesse what do you

1645
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:07,039
think I I just would expect to like both

1646
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:09,559
those numbers to be doubled with the way

1647
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:13,960
testing has been like everything's 40%

1648
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:18,080
now all of a sudden um but

1649
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:20,319
uh I yeah that's that's a tough one um

1650
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:21,840
there's multiple things that could be

1651
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:27,000
happening

1652
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:29,920
um but it definitely seems like

1653
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,319
like phc levels just got like higher and

1654
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,158
higher because that's what needed to

1655
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:36,039
happen on the to sell and the shelves

1656
01:10:33,158 --> 01:10:40,559
and like you couldn't even be below as

1657
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:43,880
25% or something uh and have it move on

1658
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,400
the Shelf which is just Insanity um so

1659
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,960
it's not just

1660
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:50,839
like the believing the numbers but that

1661
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:54,279
concept of it needing to be a super high

1662
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:57,199
THC for some reason um I think it's it's

1663
01:10:54,279 --> 01:10:59,639
super useful for to know for certain

1664
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:02,079
medicinal things and it also goes with

1665
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:04,560
um good hash producers they tend to be

1666
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:07,559
higher in THC in general and you see

1667
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,360
different varieties that have have that

1668
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,440
but it

1669
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:14,880
uh to to have it be 14 to 24 I'm

1670
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:17,158
surprised I'm I'm glad that certain labs

1671
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,279
are testing that low still I guess that

1672
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:23,359
that gives me some hope even though it's

1673
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:27,000
so so uh varying um

1674
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:28,719
but uh

1675
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,719
I don't know

1676
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:33,399
um I

1677
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,319
don't paying for something or like

1678
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:37,399
knowing that but I've seen a lot of

1679
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:40,158
tests that were actually quite high that

1680
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:44,399
had multiple um Labs test them and it

1681
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,399
still was high so

1682
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:50,039
um yeah I don't know the protocols of

1683
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,479
the test did they

1684
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:56,238
say did they give what what what other

1685
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:58,959
information did they give on that sample

1686
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:02,678
um and what what testing do they think

1687
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,439
is correct on it yeah good question I

1688
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:06,600
guess they didn't really State who out

1689
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:08,399
of all the tests they feel is correct

1690
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,440
but they just stated they just sent the

1691
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,920
same buds from the same plant the same

1692
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:14,479
Harvest to four different Labs so it

1693
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:17,079
does point to what you're talking about

1694
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:20,158
that the individual protocolization of

1695
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:22,719
each lab clearly has some effect you

1696
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:24,719
know if you know we're probably not

1697
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:27,158
going to say it's the entire reason for

1698
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,520
the VAR ility but it has to be at least

1699
01:12:27,158 --> 01:12:30,679
one of a

1700
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:33,280
multifactorial sort of picture about

1701
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:36,840
what happens but I guess the thing that

1702
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:38,800
I was interested in is sort of asking

1703
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,520
the the follow-up question about it

1704
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:44,279
which is that um you know a lot of

1705
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,639
people have been quite vocally critic

1706
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:49,920
critical of uh the purple Pro the little

1707
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:52,359
handheld modular THC testing unit and I

1708
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,399
know that uh I've used one in the past

1709
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:56,319
me Jean's used one in the past there are

1710
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:58,719
some people out there who have been very

1711
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,039
skeptical if not outright critical of

1712
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:04,279
the accuracy of this unit but to me

1713
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:06,119
these results seem to indicate what it

1714
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:08,158
is which is that they fall within the

1715
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:09,840
same range that the purple Pro often

1716
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:11,799
gives and like you know for example I've

1717
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,000
never seen the purple give like 30%

1718
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:17,000
results um but it does often give

1719
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,198
results between 18 and 26% you know

1720
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,119
depending on the quality so I don't know

1721
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:23,479
it makes me think what what can we trust

1722
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:25,158
with the labs because there is such a

1723
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:27,799
variation how do you even know which one

1724
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:30,039
to go by maybe we do need some sort of

1725
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,039
standardization across the board where

1726
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:34,039
all labs and and and I'm sure that they

1727
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:37,158
do to an extent but there would still be

1728
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:38,800
variation um and then finally you know I

1729
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:41,039
I I still think that the purple Pro is

1730
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:43,279
accurate if you you know use it a lot

1731
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:44,600
and then average the results but it does

1732
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:47,559
beg the question you know what's

1733
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:52,280
accurate testing at this

1734
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:54,080
stage yeah I for accuracy um and just

1735
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:56,679
like knowing Labs one of the the things

1736
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:58,519
that I did over the years was uh test

1737
01:13:56,679 --> 01:14:01,359
multiple different clones from different

1738
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,199
Farms the same clone at different farms

1739
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:05,119
and did this this one where it was

1740
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:08,919
actually kind of designed as a showing

1741
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:10,920
Terre in different locations and uh one

1742
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:14,279
was like in the forest with Bryson

1743
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:19,960
Forest Farms another was uh dry farmed

1744
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:23,039
um shiv area um uh high water farms and

1745
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:26,520
then out in the mountains at Moon um

1746
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:29,880
moonmaid farms and I did

1747
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:32,199
four of the of similar varieties for

1748
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:35,520
multiple years and I uh went to Samantha

1749
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:38,559
Miller with pure analytics and even

1750
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:43,600
though they were all just numbered and

1751
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:45,440
went in different um the results were I

1752
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,760
could look at him and I immediately knew

1753
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:49,599
like okay well that is that's harasu

1754
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,159
that's black dog that's Cherry Lime dog

1755
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,520
that's Mandarin um the the turine

1756
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:58,679
percentages were so close we're talking

1757
01:14:54,520 --> 01:15:01,239
about like 100 um the the canabo were so

1758
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:03,000
close year after year and of the same

1759
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:04,718
different varieties and I could see

1760
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,560
slightly different leaning things from

1761
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:10,960
the different um actual places that they

1762
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:14,120
were grown like maybe the a slight

1763
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:15,880
more uh CBD or terpinolene in in the

1764
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:18,639
bryand forest Farm area a little bit

1765
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:22,159
more THC uh in the mountains a little

1766
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:25,359
more kilene and humulene and and Sh

1767
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:28,000
shely area but they were all really so

1768
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:30,079
similar that it was like wow this this

1769
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,039
testing is quite accurate like to see

1770
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:36,719
something three years of five different

1771
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:39,399
varieties grown on on the different

1772
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:41,439
farms and all of them fell exactly where

1773
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:44,559
they're supposed to be from knowing that

1774
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:46,119
plant over all those years uh exactly 20

1775
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:50,600
to1

1776
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:53,359
um uh CBD on the Harless Sue with .5%

1777
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:55,360
cbdv and to get that each time multiple

1778
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,880
years I think is accurate some of these

1779
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:59,719
Labs absolutely can do that but when you

1780
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,440
turn something into just a complete

1781
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:05,399
business and all that matters is that

1782
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:08,759
you have enough THC to make it go on the

1783
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:11,719
market um and at dispensaries

1784
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:13,600
then it's probably not going to be as

1785
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:16,000
accurate anymore because it's become a

1786
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,480
business instead of

1787
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,319
science yeah and then it makes me wonder

1788
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:23,599
too like okay so if you they do five

1789
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:26,519
different Labs you know like

1790
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:30,239
from like a scientific perspective you

1791
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:34,120
go okay so what what happens if you give

1792
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:37,519
five samples to each of the five Labs

1793
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:39,000
that would the lab still would the 14.4

1794
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,600
lab produce the

1795
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,039
14.4 result every time if you had them

1796
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:49,400
do tarpine testing would they show you

1797
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:52,279
the same exact fingerprint of ratios of

1798
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:53,719
of what it is every time and so that's

1799
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:55,519
what's kind of cool like with what

1800
01:16:53,719 --> 01:16:57,960
you're saying Jesse is that you're

1801
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:01,280
you're essentially testing the lab as

1802
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:04,520
they're testing the weed because you are

1803
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:07,840
submitting these samples which are

1804
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:10,199
actually showing you know like that

1805
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,400
that's actually a scientific process

1806
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:13,799
what what you were doing because I

1807
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:15,599
already know what they should be and

1808
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,159
then they happen to fall right in there

1809
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,679
even though it was totally blind going

1810
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:22,479
in and then after year yeah they can't

1811
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:24,920
just look and go oh wow this was gelato

1812
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:27,399
41 so it should be right around in here

1813
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:29,319
31 just go ahead and just write that in

1814
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:31,158
you know like we'll just we'll just

1815
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:35,719
metric wizard it you know and just

1816
01:17:31,158 --> 01:17:37,879
figure it out like uh and

1817
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:40,158
then I I

1818
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:42,400
recently read a couple things like the

1819
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:45,920
SC Labs put up and it seems like they

1820
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:48,119
have kind of dropped the hammer on Labs

1821
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,440
as far as making them go through a lot

1822
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:51,279
more

1823
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:54,079
standardization

1824
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:55,759
and um I don't know if that would be

1825
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:58,119
different now or if those results that

1826
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:01,560
we just saw if that was done now after

1827
01:17:58,119 --> 01:18:04,760
this so-called standardization and um

1828
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:07,520
I'm a little curious about that too but

1829
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:11,719
uh as far as the purple Pro goes when I

1830
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:14,480
used it what I had was I had uh grape

1831
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:16,079
soda skunks and I had a few different

1832
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:18,238
other things too we tested some various

1833
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:21,399
things that I kind of knew roughly like

1834
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:22,799
this is a high THC plant and this isn't

1835
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:26,759
and whatever and then we were able to

1836
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:29,679
see like oh okay yeah 24% cool 21% and

1837
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:31,679
test it three or four times and see that

1838
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,719
and then go okay now let's jump to this

1839
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,560
plant over here and see what that is so

1840
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:37,560
we were doing like grape soda skunks

1841
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,480
that I knew from having smoked ones in

1842
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,920
the population and none of them got me

1843
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:43,959
high but all of them made me feel good

1844
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,920
and I was like these seem and I had seen

1845
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:49,279
tests from labs for a couple of the

1846
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:53,039
plants over the years where it was like

1847
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:55,079
some of the Pia and some of the grape

1848
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:57,158
soda skunks that had the real purple

1849
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:59,920
stems and a certain type of throwback

1850
01:18:57,158 --> 01:19:02,119
plant to a certain part of the the the

1851
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,719
heritage in it it was like okay these

1852
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:08,000
are just CBD plants and so I was able to

1853
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:10,198
go okay let's take the green Pia that's

1854
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,800
more of like kind of a super silver hazy

1855
01:19:10,198 --> 01:19:14,759
looking thing and let's test this one

1856
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,560
and I'm like and I'm sitting there with

1857
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,719
skunk Tech and I'm like this one should

1858
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:23,760
say THC and you put it in and it comes

1859
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:26,039
up and it's like High Teens low 20s High

1860
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,920
Teens low 20s you keep doing it and then

1861
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:30,760
I'm like okay this should be the same

1862
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,359
this one like this and then go okay now

1863
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,400
here's these grape soda skunks that I

1864
01:19:32,359 --> 01:19:40,960
know these and then do them and then

1865
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:44,960
it's like 15% CBD 177% CBD 133% CBD and

1866
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:46,239
it's just all CBD and lower than 3% THC

1867
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,719
basically

1868
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:53,879
non-detectable and then go okay now

1869
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:57,079
let's test Mr Bob's um Puck bc2 and then

1870
01:19:53,880 --> 01:20:00,440
test that and it's like 25% THC and then

1871
01:19:57,079 --> 01:20:02,119
test it again 23% THC you know grinding

1872
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:04,678
up new samples of the same bud and

1873
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:07,039
seeing and you do when you do it like

1874
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:09,880
that it's like undeniable that there's a

1875
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:12,079
certain level of accuracy because

1876
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:14,679
otherwise it would be like now let's

1877
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:16,840
jump back to the grape soda skunk we

1878
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:20,840
just tested and now it's going to say

1879
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:24,159
that it's 21% THC no CBD but nope we're

1880
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:26,000
right back in here 14% CBD so by doing

1881
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,039
it like that I was able to go wow this

1882
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,039
is cool and I don't know how accurate it

1883
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:33,079
is as far as being able to tell you

1884
01:20:30,039 --> 01:20:35,639
there's this much of this in it but it

1885
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:37,519
was useful for me to be able to go okay

1886
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:39,920
so these grape soda skunk this

1887
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,360
population has become true breeding for

1888
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:46,359
CBD dominance for me that was valuable I

1889
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:48,799
didn't need to know if it has 8% or 22%

1890
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:50,920
and whatever it is it's more about like

1891
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,840
that profile of knowing the ratios is

1892
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:56,480
this CBD weed is it THC weed is it one:

1893
01:20:53,840 --> 01:21:00,400
one is it two two to one whatever it is

1894
01:20:56,479 --> 01:21:03,839
you know and so for me the purple Pro

1895
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:07,158
was plenty useful to be worth the price

1896
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:10,400
tag which you I the plants that we pl

1897
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:12,839
that we tested that day they paid for it

1898
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:14,960
right there in a regular lab just to

1899
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,440
know the ratios but that was because of

1900
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:20,319
what it was for me to do I wouldn't say

1901
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:22,879
like if you have a store that you should

1902
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:25,279
test with that but as like a breeder who

1903
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,319
just wants to know did we go see BD did

1904
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:29,559
we go

1905
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:32,119
THC um it was it was really useful you

1906
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:35,679
know I believe you could probably

1907
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:37,719
reverse your mails and see what the

1908
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:40,600
especially if you were careful and you

1909
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:42,359
you pulled off the most resinous parts

1910
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,560
and put it in there as long as you can

1911
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:48,319
get above the 3% which is that which is

1912
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:51,639
the floor on what they test for below 3

1913
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:54,079
THC it doesn't show up below 3 CBD it

1914
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:56,159
doesn't show up but if you can get like

1915
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:58,760
if you could reverse your males and you

1916
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:02,279
were trying to do like CBD or THC work

1917
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:04,880
you could go okay well this maale it

1918
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:07,759
doesn't show any CBD but it shows a

1919
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,480
decent amount of THC or that you know

1920
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:13,400
either way you could figure that out and

1921
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:15,039
it could be useful for that as well um

1922
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:18,238
but I don't know about like real

1923
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:19,198
specific stuff and then I know too that

1924
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:22,399
the

1925
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:26,399
way that it works is

1926
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:29,559
basically accessing a data base of known

1927
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:32,279
numbers which it's been you know it's

1928
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:35,480
like the correlation to what these tests

1929
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:38,399
that were already done using more

1930
01:22:35,479 --> 01:22:41,519
traditional standards and then it goes

1931
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:44,599
okay well when the laser hits

1932
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,520
this it gave us this

1933
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:50,960
profile uh this whatever whatever it was

1934
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:54,560
this little graph of light of whatever

1935
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:57,039
it was the reflection off of it and that

1936
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:00,960
is something that always is 23% in the

1937
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:02,399
labs so it's also going to be reliant on

1938
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:07,319
previous

1939
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:09,839
lab um numbers as I understand it so if

1940
01:23:07,319 --> 01:23:12,079
the labs were super inflated then the

1941
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,880
way it works could also maybe inflate

1942
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:15,519
everything a little bit as far as I know

1943
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:18,920
because it's not actually testing the

1944
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:21,719
weed it's finding a light signature from

1945
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:25,199
the reflection off of the weed and

1946
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:27,840
correlating it with known

1947
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:30,759
data from previously collected samples

1948
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,800
that were tested in a real lab and then

1949
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,159
it and I as far as I know I think it's

1950
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,679
like comes from mineral testing

1951
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:39,960
technology where you can say oh when the

1952
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:42,600
laser hits this and comes back like this

1953
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:45,158
we know that this is this is whatever

1954
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:47,639
this you know this is these these

1955
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:49,519
certain minerals this is opal this is a

1956
01:23:47,639 --> 01:23:51,000
diamond this is whatever you know that

1957
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,320
they use I think that's what it

1958
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,319
originally came from but I'm not

1959
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:59,279
positive I just think I remember that at

1960
01:23:56,319 --> 01:24:01,000
some point so um you know that could

1961
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,439
skew everything too having these

1962
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,479
previous data and that's what it's

1963
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:06,479
running on but as far as a cool tool

1964
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:08,759
like I want one you know and the only

1965
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:11,000
reason I don't have one at this point is

1966
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:16,280
because I didn't want to spend the money

1967
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:18,399
on it and I don't use that kind of data

1968
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:20,639
that much like you can see from if you

1969
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:24,799
hear my story I'm like this Pia is high

1970
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:26,880
THC test it it's high THC this grape

1971
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,039
soda skunk super resonance doesn't get

1972
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:31,639
me high it's high CBD tested it's high

1973
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,760
CBD so like I didn't really learn

1974
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:35,920
anything but it did tell me what was

1975
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,360
going on and it could be cool for things

1976
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,719
like I said like reversed males where

1977
01:24:38,359 --> 01:24:43,279
you're actually like okay I managed to

1978
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:45,639
collect enough of this actual material

1979
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:49,039
that had a lot of resin that I can get

1980
01:24:45,639 --> 01:24:52,719
above the 3% threshold and now I can see

1981
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:55,158
what the ratio is on a mail or there I I

1982
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:58,079
see really good uses for it what about

1983
01:24:55,158 --> 01:25:00,638
just sending in the the leaf sample of a

1984
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:02,920
top of a mail to a lab and then figuring

1985
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:05,400
out your ratio from there yeah and

1986
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,520
that's great but multiply by 10 it gives

1987
01:25:05,399 --> 01:25:09,158
you a little idea or no all that's

1988
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:12,880
always perfect it's just the matter of

1989
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:15,439
that has a cost so like for me if I can

1990
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:18,359
go ahead and buy this thing and it cost

1991
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:20,399
you know a couple Grand and then I'm GNA

1992
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:23,118
sit here and go and test a whole bunch

1993
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:25,000
of stuff then it would be really useful

1994
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:27,079
for that I could see that being like a

1995
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
good thing but like you said you know

1996
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:31,800
whatever it is I think you your plant

1997
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,600
gets to be what 80 days old and it and

1998
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:36,159
and at that point it has a certain ratio

1999
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:39,840
the lab can detect and then you

2000
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:42,198
basically just figure it was 1% THC and

2001
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:45,600
2% CBD and then you know you got a 10

2002
01:25:42,198 --> 01:25:48,279
and 20 if it's around a 100 days or 80

2003
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,039
days is that how that works that's

2004
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:52,800
that's pretty basically it yeah yeah so

2005
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:56,279
I mean that's cool but then when I do

2006
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:58,039
that like if I have a super cool lab and

2007
01:25:56,279 --> 01:26:00,719
they're giving me a great deal as soon

2008
01:25:58,039 --> 01:26:02,840
as I go ahead and test a certain amount

2009
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:05,079
like I'm at this I I've spent this much

2010
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,960
money and then with like the the purple

2011
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:09,559
Pro it like it just continues to work

2012
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:12,600
and there's no real resources it use

2013
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:15,199
it's just keeps on you can test so many

2014
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:18,600
you know so but reversing males is a bit

2015
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:21,719
of effort I guess it it is but like um

2016
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:24,960
like um shaut at 707 seed bank he just

2017
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:28,039
reverses all his males and

2018
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:31,039
um if you have if you have like I have

2019
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:33,600
like several males that I'm I'm growing

2020
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:35,399
I'm growing the progyny from them which

2021
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,960
I kind of would want to do anyway even

2022
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:38,920
if I had already smelled it and knew

2023
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,079
that it was pretty good and knew that I

2024
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:44,079
still want to see like what passes and

2025
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:46,600
what it worked with and so for me it's

2026
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:49,319
not like as attractive of a thing just

2027
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,960
because I'm always going to do the rest

2028
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:54,198
of the work anyway it's kind of like the

2029
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,319
sex testing thing like I'm going to

2030
01:26:54,198 --> 01:26:57,359
going to grow the Ma I'm going to grow

2031
01:26:55,319 --> 01:26:59,359
them till they're males no matter what

2032
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:00,880
so it never has worked for me it works

2033
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:04,000
for different people in different

2034
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,600
situations but um it would still be neat

2035
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,039
to go like right now I have a cloned

2036
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,560
lime pop Kush mail from last year I have

2037
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:14,039
a cloned grape soda skunk I have a

2038
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,840
cloned uh Meer limsky like some new

2039
01:27:14,039 --> 01:27:17,158
clones that I just took last year and I

2040
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,360
made stuff with them and I'm already

2041
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:21,198
growing the seeds from them but right

2042
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,839
now while I have copies of them it'd be

2043
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,960
easy to set some aside and then go ahead

2044
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,560
and like test all of them at the same

2045
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:31,639
stage and go whoa this one's like really

2046
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:35,039
high in THC or like the grape soda skunk

2047
01:27:31,639 --> 01:27:36,719
if I had like a bunch of the males and I

2048
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,439
went ahead and just took a clone off

2049
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:41,158
each and reversed them then I could go

2050
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:44,079
these are all good they're all CBD

2051
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:46,759
dominant but wow this male is producing

2052
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,279
6% and the rest aren't even registering

2053
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:51,960
then it would be like this one makes a

2054
01:27:48,279 --> 01:27:54,599
lot of cannabinoids it's cool for that

2055
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:56,520
and and among males that could be more

2056
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,880
useful because for me with females it's

2057
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:01,760
all about how good they are I don't

2058
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:04,319
really care about the lab result like

2059
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,480
it's interesting to see the reason why I

2060
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,960
like it might have a correlation with

2061
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,759
some kind of chemical but as far as

2062
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,158
whether or not it's a valuable plant or

2063
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:16,760
a keeper like I'm I'm gonna do all that

2064
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:18,679
by just being like I like the plant and

2065
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:20,560
I won I won't change my mind if someone

2066
01:28:18,679 --> 01:28:22,960
goes dude that plant you said was so

2067
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:26,320
good it's only 11% THC I'm going to be

2068
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:29,000
like still 11% is some killer weed you

2069
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:30,840
know like that that just I just learned

2070
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
from the plant I'm not going to learn

2071
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:34,639
anything from the lab results but

2072
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:39,359
there's still a lot of cool things to do

2073
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:41,560
with it and like um honestly beyond all

2074
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:43,399
of the utility of it it's hella fun to

2075
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:45,080
test you just sit there and you grind it

2076
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:46,879
up and you go oh and then it gives you a

2077
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:49,880
number and it's kind of just like a

2078
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,840
video game or something you're just hey

2079
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:54,159
a number a number like it's something

2080
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,480
for your brain you know you're like 133%

2081
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:58,079
oh let's do another one yeah and then

2082
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:59,879
seeing the Target and seeing how it

2083
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,158
works and it was kind of just neat like

2084
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:05,199
knowing that somebody made this really

2085
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:07,879
trippy invention and that regardless of

2086
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:11,678
whether or not it's like super accurate

2087
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:14,000
it was like whoa it's right here on my

2088
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:17,440
kitchen table this is pretty pretty neat

2089
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,840
you know yeah hit my dopamine receptors

2090
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:24,319
in uh in just the right way there you go

2091
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:26,039
yeah you know you're get oh there we go

2092
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:29,039
look while we're on the topic of

2093
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:32,198
percentages and uh turps that sort of

2094
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:33,639
works very nicely with our next topic

2095
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:38,439
yeah you're gonna turn on your light and

2096
01:29:33,639 --> 01:29:41,480
everything oh I'll have to flash back we

2097
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:45,039
are we are no

2098
01:29:41,479 --> 01:29:46,519
long slowly disappearing yeah I I like

2099
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,000
the idea you were you know burning the

2100
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:53,679
candle oil in the midnight it was it was

2101
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:55,960
good um but onto our next story uh jbzy

2102
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,800
recently L put up a post saying the way

2103
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:00,480
to set yourself apart in the current

2104
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:04,079
market is to dial in your post Harvest

2105
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:05,959
process and to preserve those TPS sounds

2106
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:08,319
fairly straightforward doesn't it but I

2107
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:10,639
guess what it shows is that clearly this

2108
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:11,399
is an area where others could be doing a

2109
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:14,359
bit

2110
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:16,158
better is this one of the big sticking

2111
01:30:14,359 --> 01:30:18,799
points for small companies that are

2112
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:20,759
struggling to make a crack in the market

2113
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:24,440
or is this more a message targeted for

2114
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:25,880
larger companies what is your sop mized

2115
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:27,960
I'm going to throw it over to me Jean

2116
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,760
first

2117
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,039
quickly

2118
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,119
um

2119
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:35,719
well

2120
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:38,559
uh

2121
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:41,158
like if I was a viking right now and I

2122
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,760
knew where to go like find unicorn horns

2123
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:45,000
I'd be like dude don't tell everybody

2124
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:47,760
this [ __ ] like you're ruining it for

2125
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,158
everybody don't tell them it really is

2126
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:54,840
it really is like a huge part of how all

2127
01:30:51,158 --> 01:30:57,039
of it um how all of it work works I mean

2128
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:59,840
if if you

2129
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:02,238
grow weed and you know people who grow

2130
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,039
weed you've seen a lot of people

2131
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:07,599
who

2132
01:31:04,039 --> 01:31:09,880
um they grow weed and they don't really

2133
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,159
do anything wrong and you go over there

2134
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,719
and you look at their weed and it's

2135
01:31:11,158 --> 01:31:15,039
almost done and you're like wow this is

2136
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:18,639
one of the best grows I've ever

2137
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:21,600
seen and then they say hey I got some

2138
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:23,920
weed or you tell yourself hey we got

2139
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,760
this weed and then you see it and you

2140
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:29,600
you go what happened here like how did

2141
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:32,760
we get from there to here and there's so

2142
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,800
many places to go wrong you know um

2143
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:37,719
basically

2144
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:41,239
Harvest people say post Harvest but it's

2145
01:31:37,719 --> 01:31:43,880
actually also the actual Harvest timing

2146
01:31:41,238 --> 01:31:46,638
as well you really want to know a plant

2147
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:49,279
if I grow a clone I like to like cut a

2148
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:52,719
if I if I have multiple ones I'm I want

2149
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:55,319
to harvest them over across the window a

2150
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:57,920
little time span to see differences and

2151
01:31:55,319 --> 01:32:00,279
if I only have one plant of it I like to

2152
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:02,319
cut part of the plant and then leave it

2153
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:04,800
and cut another part of the plant and I

2154
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:07,118
like to cut a little bit of what I look

2155
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:09,239
at the plant and go this is too early

2156
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:11,439
you're not supposed to cut it yet and

2157
01:32:09,238 --> 01:32:13,638
then I like to leave a little bit of it

2158
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,919
at the point where you go don't leave it

2159
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:18,639
this is going to go bad and I like to

2160
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:21,800
have a few stages in between and by

2161
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:24,239
doing that you can go oh this one gets

2162
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:26,159
better way later than I thought it was

2163
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,759
gunu and it actually improved when I

2164
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,439
would have normally thought the quality

2165
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:34,280
was just going to drop and with other

2166
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:37,799
ones you might cut them earlier than you

2167
01:32:34,279 --> 01:32:40,000
would think would be what is ideal and

2168
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,360
all of a sudden go oh I didn't you know

2169
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,399
even if it's something you've previously

2170
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:45,359
grown and you try cutting it a little on

2171
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:47,198
the early side or a little on the late

2172
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:48,719
side you might discover that you've

2173
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:52,000
never seen this weed the way it's

2174
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:54,158
supposed to be just Harvest timing and

2175
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,158
once you cut it for Harvest Time CL in

2176
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:57,599
and get it where you think it's perfect

2177
01:32:56,158 --> 01:32:59,879
and you've already done this and you're

2178
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:03,199
actually trying to produce this plant

2179
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:06,400
like produce weed off this plant

2180
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:10,039
then people put it up they don't have a

2181
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:12,359
good room and some people have a good

2182
01:33:10,039 --> 01:33:14,000
room but they don't have enough room and

2183
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:16,238
then it gets to the point and they look

2184
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,920
at it and they go this is dry and they

2185
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:21,599
put it away and then they go it's okay

2186
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:24,158
to put away we're going to burp it it's

2187
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:26,520
all right because it's still going to

2188
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:29,519
dry it's going to finish this stuff it's

2189
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:31,000
gonna we're gonna leave all the leaves

2190
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,199
on it we're going to remove all the

2191
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:37,639
leaves it's okay we half green trimmed

2192
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:40,599
it so it's GNA do well like this people

2193
01:33:37,639 --> 01:33:42,960
have all these different ideas and um in

2194
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:45,119
a lot of case people cases people are

2195
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,239
putting the weed away thinking it's dry

2196
01:33:45,118 --> 01:33:50,118
when it's

2197
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:54,198
not extra moisture leads

2198
01:33:50,118 --> 01:33:57,198
to like very small time compost toasting

2199
01:33:54,198 --> 01:33:59,279
of your weed it's like fermentation yeah

2200
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:02,000
if there's a little bit of extra

2201
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:05,238
moisture then you're going to have

2202
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,439
compounds being produced in your weed

2203
01:34:05,238 --> 01:34:10,559
that should have never been produced and

2204
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:12,960
your weed's going to be sitting in gases

2205
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:16,239
that are like alcohol based and you're

2206
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:18,158
not even G to be getting it's not

2207
01:34:16,238 --> 01:34:20,399
sitting with what it's supposed to be

2208
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:23,519
sitting in there's stuff that comes off

2209
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:25,279
of weed after it's all the way dry that

2210
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,840
when the weed sits in it for a little

2211
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:30,359
bit the weed is getting like marinated

2212
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,119
in goodness and that's what you get when

2213
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:33,799
you have weed and it's all the way dry

2214
01:34:32,118 --> 01:34:38,439
it's all the way perfect and you put it

2215
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:42,159
away and you let it sit for two days two

2216
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:44,000
weeks two months three years depending

2217
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:46,559
on what the weed is you know I have this

2218
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,359
weed in my fridge and it was like some

2219
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:53,039
of the worst weed I've ever seen based

2220
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:55,920
on what my mind tells me about what

2221
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:58,000
should be good weed it's the opposite of

2222
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:01,158
when you see something that looks like

2223
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,800
animal cookies or you know something

2224
01:35:01,158 --> 01:35:05,759
really incredible you just look at it

2225
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:07,600
and you go oh it's really drab and it

2226
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:11,560
has really dark red hairs and there's

2227
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:14,239
not much visible resin and it was like

2228
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:16,480
really plain and really nothing to it

2229
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:21,839
and I've had it put away now

2230
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:24,919
for uh 15 years in the fridge and now

2231
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:27,639
when you smoke it it is the tastiest

2232
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:30,639
weed to me that I've like ever had and

2233
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:35,600
it must have been some kind of a haze or

2234
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:39,159
other you know crazy equatorial thing

2235
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:42,639
hybrid and when you smoke it now it's

2236
01:35:39,158 --> 01:35:45,439
like you smoked some kind of incense and

2237
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:48,000
it just completely sticks in your mouth

2238
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:50,519
and your nose and you just it's just

2239
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,920
everything is this and it was because

2240
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:56,040
it's sad and sat and so post Harvest it

2241
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,399
had a really weird you know it did it

2242
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:59,920
wasn't like that for a while and then it

2243
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:01,879
became like that and that's what people

2244
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:04,760
say a lot of times about things that are

2245
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:06,359
sativas that they get better with a cure

2246
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,920
and I haven't seen that with that many

2247
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:10,479
things because I don't have that many of

2248
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,679
them but in this case it's definitely a

2249
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:16,678
thing and it just has it just is as good

2250
01:36:12,679 --> 01:36:21,199
as it's ever been and um it's really

2251
01:36:16,679 --> 01:36:24,279
common that uh people treat everything

2252
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:26,399
the same and like even me tend to tell

2253
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:29,319
you that weed is the best when it's

2254
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:32,359
fresh curing weed to me is a little bit

2255
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:35,000
of a myth it does pay off in the case of

2256
01:36:32,359 --> 01:36:38,319
certain weird especially like sativa

2257
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,520
type things um and some things like say

2258
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:43,319
if they have tons of tur pineline if you

2259
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:45,679
can like let the terpinolene off gas for

2260
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:47,158
like a whole year at room temperature

2261
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:50,319
then you'll pull out the weed and it'll

2262
01:36:47,158 --> 01:36:53,079
be like oh this has this the craziest

2263
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:55,399
thing happens when it sits and it turns

2264
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:56,840
into these new combinations of these

2265
01:36:55,399 --> 01:36:59,238
chemicals sitting with each other and

2266
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:02,039
you wind up with these crazy flavors and

2267
01:36:59,238 --> 01:37:05,678
smells that are amazing but

2268
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:07,079
um a lot of people think and it's kind

2269
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,319
of something that happens to you

2270
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:11,719
especially when you first start growing

2271
01:37:09,319 --> 01:37:15,238
you think that if your weed gets too dry

2272
01:37:11,719 --> 01:37:17,800
it's going to ruin it but it can really

2273
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:21,000
only be ruined at a temperature high

2274
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:25,360
enough to evaporate off the things you

2275
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:29,158
want and if those things evaporated

2276
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:31,759
easily then we they wouldn't ever really

2277
01:37:29,158 --> 01:37:34,960
make it to when you're smoking them so

2278
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:37,400
like for the most part dry is not the

2279
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:40,319
enemy dry is only the enemy if it

2280
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:42,198
happens too fast so in places like

2281
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:44,759
Colorado where there's really low

2282
01:37:42,198 --> 01:37:47,118
humidity they have to really be careful

2283
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,960
if I lived in Colorado I would have

2284
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:52,439
humidifiers in my drawing room if I

2285
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:54,960
lived in Washington state I would have

2286
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:56,879
dehumidifiers in my drying room because

2287
01:37:54,960 --> 01:38:00,960
there's a sweet spot where you want the

2288
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:02,960
weed to dry at a certain rate and what

2289
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,840
happens when it dries at a certain rate

2290
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:07,399
and I always tell people this is your

2291
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:11,679
weed becomes tempered the way that they

2292
01:38:07,399 --> 01:38:13,638
temper steel using using using heat and

2293
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:16,000
and Co like Stone they use heat

2294
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:18,880
treatment wood they use heat treatment

2295
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:23,279
Kil drying like there's these different

2296
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:26,679
processes that make things be uh stuck

2297
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:29,198
in in the right State and if they go too

2298
01:38:26,679 --> 01:38:32,118
fast to that state or they go too slow

2299
01:38:29,198 --> 01:38:34,799
to that sweet spot then everything just

2300
01:38:32,118 --> 01:38:38,079
gets [ __ ] up so if you can actually

2301
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:40,760
have the right rate of it drying when it

2302
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:43,439
gets to a certain point of being dry

2303
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:45,840
that's it for most things it's not going

2304
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:48,839
to really get worse unless it gets like

2305
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:51,440
heated up and sits in the Sun and it's

2306
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:53,920
not really going to get better unless it

2307
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:55,919
has a really specific

2308
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,800
chemical profile that has things that

2309
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:01,279
actually have been post Harvest and they

2310
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,800
do exist but it for the most part

2311
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:05,198
there's a thing that happens where your

2312
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:07,320
weed just gets perfect and now it's

2313
01:39:05,198 --> 01:39:09,399
perfect and you can put it away and

2314
01:39:07,319 --> 01:39:11,719
ideally you need to put it away like in

2315
01:39:09,399 --> 01:39:16,238
a refrigerator or an air conditioned

2316
01:39:11,719 --> 01:39:18,158
room where everything stays below 65 or

2317
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:19,799
whatever it is to make it stay really

2318
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:22,000
nice and if you can keep it a lot of

2319
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,599
people used to bury their weed in the

2320
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,279
ground in drums and if it's a really

2321
01:39:24,599 --> 01:39:29,599
wooded area and you get your and you put

2322
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:33,639
your weed away you can pull it out and

2323
01:39:29,599 --> 01:39:35,920
it'll be like surprisingly fresh but if

2324
01:39:33,639 --> 01:39:38,560
you rush the process a tiny bit and you

2325
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:40,440
put it away with a tiny bit too Mo too

2326
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,360
much moisture and we're talking a couple

2327
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:46,000
percent here we're talking like if it's

2328
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:49,158
just slightly too moist then it'll go

2329
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:53,118
bad so basically you want to remove all

2330
01:39:49,158 --> 01:39:56,638
the moisture almost without removing any

2331
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:58,880
of the oil and the process to do that is

2332
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:02,039
by having it be slow and steady on the

2333
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:04,118
dry but if it's too slow then the

2334
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:06,479
moisture hangs around too long in the

2335
01:40:04,118 --> 01:40:08,359
beginning of the drying process and does

2336
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:10,079
the same thing it would do if you put it

2337
01:40:08,359 --> 01:40:12,559
away when you thought it was dry later

2338
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:15,399
on in the process so you also need to

2339
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:18,360
get it dry fast enough it's not just dry

2340
01:40:15,399 --> 01:40:21,238
it as slow as you can no because it's

2341
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:23,439
going to dry too slow but back in the

2342
01:40:21,238 --> 01:40:26,519
day everybody always thought if I leave

2343
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:29,238
it up and it gets too dry it's going to

2344
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,679
be ruined and then what people would do

2345
01:40:29,238 --> 01:40:32,879
is they'd come in and they go oh the

2346
01:40:30,679 --> 01:40:35,760
weed it's too crispy and they would

2347
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:39,960
panic and not realize like dude open the

2348
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:42,520
door stuck put a fan in the door wait

2349
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:44,679
till nighttime comes when the humidity

2350
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:47,280
not in Colorado but here when the

2351
01:40:44,679 --> 01:40:50,039
humidity Rises at night and that fresh

2352
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:53,000
air blows in you can go back in and

2353
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:55,039
you'll discover that hey now it's at the

2354
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,399
point point where it's as dry as it can

2355
01:40:55,039 --> 01:41:00,279
get without falling apart and crumbling

2356
01:40:57,399 --> 01:41:03,158
and crushing in your hands and now take

2357
01:41:00,279 --> 01:41:04,920
it down and then go take it and put it

2358
01:41:03,158 --> 01:41:07,399
wherever you have that's the most

2359
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:10,480
controlled and because a lot of times

2360
01:41:07,399 --> 01:41:14,598
when you take you take the big room full

2361
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:17,000
of weed and you put it all into being

2362
01:41:14,599 --> 01:41:18,920
like these big big wires of weed and you

2363
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,599
now you have it in bundles or whatever

2364
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:22,840
you can take those and you can fit them

2365
01:41:20,599 --> 01:41:23,920
in a in a in a even maybe a better

2366
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:26,039
environment

2367
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,800
so what a lot of people they see that

2368
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:30,198
done and they think that the name of the

2369
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:31,960
game is all we got to get it out of here

2370
01:41:30,198 --> 01:41:35,479
and put it in there but if you do that

2371
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:37,639
and it's a little bit too moist then

2372
01:41:35,479 --> 01:41:39,678
same thing too much moisture it can't

2373
01:41:37,639 --> 01:41:43,319
leave it's all stuck and then you get

2374
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:45,560
things spoiling again so people who

2375
01:41:43,319 --> 01:41:49,118
really know what they're doing can

2376
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:51,880
preserve their weed like you know like I

2377
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:54,118
always call it scientific grade it's

2378
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:57,520
like this is a specimen

2379
01:41:54,118 --> 01:41:59,880
and this is the closest thing to being

2380
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,760
perfectly preserved as we can get it

2381
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:05,319
whereas a lot of the weed the most of

2382
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:09,719
the weed you'll ever see in your life it

2383
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:12,479
was either ruined 5% it was ruined 10%

2384
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:15,359
it was ruined 80% there's a certain

2385
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:19,198
level of quality that it was when it was

2386
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:21,079
alive and then you [ __ ] that up by

2387
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:23,198
cutting it too early or cutting it too

2388
01:42:21,079 --> 01:42:25,559
late and then you [ __ ] that up by

2389
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:27,479
handling it rough when you cut it down

2390
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:30,000
and then you [ __ ] that up by not getting

2391
01:42:27,479 --> 01:42:32,559
it hung up and processed and then it

2392
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,238
becomes limp during the processing stage

2393
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,920
and now you've just ruined it right now

2394
01:42:35,238 --> 01:42:40,319
because you know you can ruin weed

2395
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,039
before you ever hang it up and it

2396
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:44,840
happened in a couple hours because it

2397
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:46,639
was laying in a pile limp or whatever it

2398
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:48,960
is and then your weed becomes bruised

2399
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:51,560
and gets messed up you can cut all the

2400
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:54,760
leaves off and green trim it when it's

2401
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:58,199
all the way fresh and now you've just

2402
01:42:54,760 --> 01:43:00,840
taken something that was all enclosed

2403
01:42:58,198 --> 01:43:03,879
and you've opened it up to where the

2404
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:06,360
juice that's inside the plant which is

2405
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:09,359
what you smell when you mow your lawn

2406
01:43:06,359 --> 01:43:12,839
that juice in the whole handling process

2407
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:14,799
now if you were to be super careful and

2408
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:17,159
you have the right weed with the right

2409
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:19,639
moisture content at Harvest and it's

2410
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:21,598
crisp enough you can get away with green

2411
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:23,679
trimming your weed and having it come

2412
01:43:21,599 --> 01:43:25,560
out good enough to Tri trick you into

2413
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:28,279
thinking it's just as good as trimming

2414
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:30,000
it when it's dry but in most cases when

2415
01:43:28,279 --> 01:43:32,399
people green trim that's not going to be

2416
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,479
the case because when you handle wheat

2417
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:37,158
you have to cut the leaves off then you

2418
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:40,359
have to put it in a tub or grab it as a

2419
01:43:37,158 --> 01:43:42,079
big bundle now you have all this juice

2420
01:43:40,359 --> 01:43:44,319
That's supposed to never come out of the

2421
01:43:42,079 --> 01:43:47,599
plant that's rich in chlorophyll and all

2422
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:51,279
this other [ __ ] and it's all going on to

2423
01:43:47,599 --> 01:43:54,039
the weed on the outside of the weed and

2424
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:56,880
it's just not what you should have like

2425
01:43:54,039 --> 01:44:01,319
my analogy for it was always if you take

2426
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:04,400
rose petals and you dry a rose hole and

2427
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:06,599
you pull them off you get like pop Perri

2428
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:09,439
it'll smell like dried rose petals if

2429
01:44:06,599 --> 01:44:12,480
you dry a rose whole it'll smell like

2430
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:15,598
rose petals if you take a rose and you

2431
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:18,039
chop up the petals green and dry them

2432
01:44:15,599 --> 01:44:19,440
it'll just smell like vegetative matter

2433
01:44:18,039 --> 01:44:23,399
and that's another place that people

2434
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:25,238
make a big mistake during Harvest and um

2435
01:44:23,399 --> 01:44:27,879
between all those things that I've

2436
01:44:25,238 --> 01:44:29,479
mentioned you can really you can really

2437
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:31,239
like if you master all those little

2438
01:44:29,479 --> 01:44:37,039
details you can make everything be

2439
01:44:31,238 --> 01:44:39,879
really nice but if you do those things

2440
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:42,238
and a number of other things I mean

2441
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:45,279
trust me I found lots of ways to ruin

2442
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:46,879
weed you can have you can dry in an area

2443
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:48,840
where you don't realize your intake is

2444
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:52,159
pulling in wood smoke from your wood

2445
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:55,880
stove you can do all kinds of different

2446
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:59,079
stuff I I had this year I had a leak in

2447
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:02,440
my room that I didn't realize was there

2448
01:44:59,079 --> 01:45:04,238
and my humidity spiked so bad that a lot

2449
01:45:02,439 --> 01:45:06,559
of the weed that I had that was still in

2450
01:45:04,238 --> 01:45:08,359
that particular room it was all turning

2451
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,000
in there and it wasn't as quality as it

2452
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:11,719
should have been and I just did that

2453
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,319
just now and it luckily it doesn't

2454
01:45:11,719 --> 01:45:16,158
really matter to me because I wasn't

2455
01:45:13,319 --> 01:45:18,479
super attached and I already had big you

2456
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:21,238
know shopping bags full of smoke for

2457
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:24,519
myself and I'm cool but at the same time

2458
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:27,198
I was like oh that weed was really nice

2459
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:29,679
and it's still way better than any of

2460
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:32,439
the stuff you'll ever see with blue dye

2461
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:35,440
on it and whatever stuff it's still like

2462
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:37,598
it's weed but it's not you know it's

2463
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:39,719
never you can't like pull it out and go

2464
01:45:37,599 --> 01:45:42,079
this is what it should look like if you

2465
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:43,800
can pull out weed and show people hey

2466
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:46,000
I'll bet you've never seen what weed

2467
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:49,159
should look like and then you it's like

2468
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,719
you know like of course my my fat kid

2469
01:45:49,158 --> 01:45:53,839
analogies with I always say something

2470
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:57,118
about pizza but imagine like if you all

2471
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:59,560
all the time you've only ever had frozen

2472
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:02,719
pizza and then all of the sudden you

2473
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:05,960
went to like a really really good

2474
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:07,239
Pizzeria and you got a piece of pizza

2475
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:10,679
you'd be

2476
01:46:07,238 --> 01:46:12,839
like oh man you know like in that same

2477
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:15,000
place not going to do the same business

2478
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:16,880
if they're selling the frozen pizza that

2479
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,760
you go get at the supermarket it's just

2480
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,279
not the same thing but when you look at

2481
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:22,320
it you go it's kind of the same thing

2482
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:23,960
isn't it and that's what most people

2483
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:27,559
have with their weed they have something

2484
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:30,599
that is kind of the same thing but that

2485
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:33,039
little bit that separates it is a huge

2486
01:46:30,599 --> 01:46:35,760
difference and that's the same in wine

2487
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:37,719
food whatever it is and people who know

2488
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:40,199
no and people who don't it just doesn't

2489
01:46:37,719 --> 01:46:44,560
matter some people hate would hate the

2490
01:46:40,198 --> 01:46:46,519
pizza at the nice place and so fine have

2491
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:48,920
something for them too but if you really

2492
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:51,280
want to be super competitive you have to

2493
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:53,480
know exactly what the finer details are

2494
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:56,599
of all that stuff and so

2495
01:46:53,479 --> 01:46:57,959
jbz is right but he shouldn't tell

2496
01:46:56,599 --> 01:46:59,679
people and I shouldn't tell people

2497
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,960
either because it starts to close the

2498
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:02,880
gap and then all of a sudden all these

2499
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,639
people it's like hash making now

2500
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,880
everybody knows how to make hash for a

2501
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:08,599
while people were like dude it's 250 a

2502
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,480
gram you've never seen nothing like this

2503
01:47:08,599 --> 01:47:12,199
and people were like dude look at this

2504
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:14,359
and now people are like yeah everybody

2505
01:47:12,198 --> 01:47:16,319
got a washing machine and a freeze dryer

2506
01:47:14,359 --> 01:47:18,479
and they find somebody who grows a cool

2507
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:20,880
strain and all of a sudden there's a lot

2508
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:23,439
of hash makers that are making hash that

2509
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:26,199
10 years ago you would have been like

2510
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:28,039
whoa that's crazy dude and now it's just

2511
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:30,799
like you know I should say 15 years ago

2512
01:47:28,039 --> 01:47:32,840
but it's it's a trip because uh you know

2513
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,880
that it does people learn and that's

2514
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:36,679
cool because people should have the best

2515
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,480
weed but I want to see people having the

2516
01:47:36,679 --> 01:47:41,920
best weed who are growing it and smoking

2517
01:47:39,479 --> 01:47:45,519
it I don't really want to see like the

2518
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:47,480
mega corpse go oh so wait a second

2519
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,320
here's what the edge we need you know

2520
01:47:47,479 --> 01:47:51,439
but luckily it's hard for them to pull

2521
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:54,039
it off anyway

2522
01:47:51,439 --> 01:47:57,079
so there you go we got to make sure that

2523
01:47:54,039 --> 01:47:58,519
their mids stay mids I guess yeah keep

2524
01:47:57,079 --> 01:48:00,920
mids

2525
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:03,800
mids I don't know if that's a secret

2526
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:06,639
it's always been secret is like just

2527
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:10,279
cure it well actually speaking of that I

2528
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:14,400
I I toured the um Glass House spot one

2529
01:48:10,279 --> 01:48:16,960
time and it was like all of this money

2530
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:19,559
to to grow all all of this we and just

2531
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:22,520
huge production and all kinds of workers

2532
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:25,080
and then I see the the dry room and it's

2533
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:27,560
just pathetic and way too small and was

2534
01:48:25,079 --> 01:48:30,399
like what the [ __ ] like all of these

2535
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:32,920
huge green houses and you don't and and

2536
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:34,920
I see that that's been so pervasive

2537
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:37,800
throughout all the years it's just like

2538
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:40,760
grow all of this weed all this into like

2539
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:43,320
the growing of it and then how do you

2540
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,920
take care of it at the end and it's like

2541
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:46,880
would you call it scientific weed or

2542
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:49,800
scientific grade or scientific grade you

2543
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:51,679
know what I me scientific gr totally

2544
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:54,000
yeah and I can see those jars like oh

2545
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:56,599
that's a jar that like you some jars

2546
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,079
somebody might want you to like oh go in

2547
01:48:56,599 --> 01:49:01,000
and pull that nug out and crunch it up

2548
01:48:59,079 --> 01:49:02,639
and smell it like I can see those jars

2549
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,079
are like oh no that's s that's that's

2550
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:07,400
science grade you're like I would only

2551
01:49:05,079 --> 01:49:10,920
touch that with like tweezers and pull

2552
01:49:07,399 --> 01:49:12,799
out the like by the stem and observe it

2553
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:14,760
and because not one Tricom has been

2554
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:17,880
damaged in the process you know that

2555
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:20,199
somebody's taken that care in it and uh

2556
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:23,039
that whole like indoor outdoor thing I

2557
01:49:20,198 --> 01:49:24,559
think that's always been really like the

2558
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:28,519
the quality is based on the end of the

2559
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:30,280
Cure it's not like indoor is better in a

2560
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:32,880
certain way or it looks certain but

2561
01:49:30,279 --> 01:49:36,559
there's but maybe put more care into

2562
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:38,039
that uh that Harvest and then to make

2563
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,800
sure that nothing's damaged because you

2564
01:49:38,039 --> 01:49:42,118
spent more on it and it's a smaller

2565
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:44,159
scale and then you put on the line where

2566
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:45,839
nothing else is touching it and you make

2567
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:47,158
sure that you don't do anything to

2568
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:49,360
damage tricomes and you're not

2569
01:49:47,158 --> 01:49:52,319
pre-trimmed

2570
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:54,759
cool temperature and you know as long as

2571
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:58,359
it's like between 50 and 60 both

2572
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:59,960
humidity and and uh temperature although

2573
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:01,839
right off the bat I always that first

2574
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:04,840
day or two go a little bit drier I might

2575
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:07,360
do like 45% and then go to 50 and kick

2576
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:09,760
it right back to 55 and then have it

2577
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:14,519
hover right there but keep it in that

2578
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:16,400
like below 60 uh 50 and 60 the whole

2579
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:18,560
time temperature the Le the less

2580
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:20,479
fluctuation you get in that temperature

2581
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,960
the better and then when you get it

2582
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:25,559
right at that right point and that's

2583
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:28,439
probably about 10 % uh moisture so 9% a

2584
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:31,119
safer uh putting away 8% is going to be

2585
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:33,638
really safe uh 12% you might have a

2586
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:35,598
little more tpine but make but you have

2587
01:50:33,639 --> 01:50:37,840
to smoke it pretty quick then so you

2588
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:39,480
don't use the little packs that you can

2589
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:41,000
get I won't say the name but you put

2590
01:50:39,479 --> 01:50:44,238
them in there and they keep your weed

2591
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:47,118
60% humidity correct is that a real

2592
01:50:44,238 --> 01:50:48,519
question is that why the is that why's

2593
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:51,920
always squishy and brown I always

2594
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:54,760
wondered about that no uh I don't use

2595
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:58,639
those things but um

2596
01:50:54,760 --> 01:51:00,119
yeah but then yeah putting it into a jar

2597
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:02,199
and putting it in the fridge at that

2598
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:05,198
point right where you got it I I do

2599
01:51:02,198 --> 01:51:07,000
think um it's really about you get it

2600
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:09,158
perfect and then you slow it down as

2601
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,198
much as possible yes and and also to

2602
01:51:09,158 --> 01:51:12,439
your point too there's certain

2603
01:51:10,198 --> 01:51:14,279
terpinolene like I had some of the um

2604
01:51:12,439 --> 01:51:16,279
Athena sue the Harless Sue Athena

2605
01:51:14,279 --> 01:51:18,359
crosses from way back when I even had

2606
01:51:16,279 --> 01:51:20,559
some sitting in a shelf because it was

2607
01:51:18,359 --> 01:51:23,078
so pretty and purple just like almost

2608
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:24,760
like a a flower bouquet like in a

2609
01:51:23,078 --> 01:51:28,359
uh just in a little jar or something

2610
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:30,719
just sticking out off of its stem and uh

2611
01:51:28,359 --> 01:51:33,439
it like a big three years later it still

2612
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:36,359
fully smelled it was so like dark purple

2613
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:39,039
but certain just sitting out completely

2614
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:42,078
certain uh tpin last a lot

2615
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:44,760
longer um certainly trinoline is one of

2616
01:51:42,078 --> 01:51:47,118
them but yeah I think it's just getting

2617
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:49,760
to that that spot where you you you just

2618
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:52,759
put all that care into doing the least

2619
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:55,599
amount of damage to it once you you've

2620
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:59,079
grown it and then and then you put it

2621
01:51:55,599 --> 01:52:01,920
away dry enough to not actually ferment

2622
01:51:59,078 --> 01:52:03,840
and decompose and change colors how you

2623
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:06,920
won uh three different years at the

2624
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:11,560
emerald cut or third second and first I

2625
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:13,960
imagine those um entries you took a lot

2626
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:16,880
of care and like that nug was going to

2627
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:18,078
be your entry from the beginning uh and

2628
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:20,239
you did everything because a lot of

2629
01:52:18,078 --> 01:52:22,719
people probably like oh yeah this bag's

2630
01:52:20,238 --> 01:52:24,879
pretty good and and grab something from

2631
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:27,679
entered that way you I'm assuming you're

2632
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:29,159
like that's the nug I'm going to take

2633
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,359
that down and I'm going to put all that

2634
01:52:29,158 --> 01:52:32,719
love into it because all you have to do

2635
01:52:30,359 --> 01:52:35,359
is put in an ounce or whatever it is so

2636
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:38,078
like you're you're choosing and hand

2637
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:40,679
trimming each one of those by yourself

2638
01:52:38,078 --> 01:52:43,078
I'm sure and right at the point where it

2639
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:45,800
makes sense to do that curious what that

2640
01:52:43,078 --> 01:52:49,198
process is like holding the stem and

2641
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:51,360
then you know I need to remove this Leaf

2642
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:53,678
I need to remove this leaf and then when

2643
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:55,920
it's done it's like it's you know it is

2644
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:57,679
a specimen it's like if you you know

2645
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,840
what I mean like you can go out and like

2646
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:02,599
go duck hunting and and you know shoot a

2647
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:04,760
duck and your dog goes and brings it

2648
01:53:02,599 --> 01:53:07,239
back not that I like I don't hunt Ducks

2649
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:10,840
but you know if you actually wanted to

2650
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:13,718
get like a specimen for like you know a

2651
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:16,239
museum and go okay we're gonna Taxidermy

2652
01:53:13,719 --> 01:53:19,078
this duck then you're probably gonna go

2653
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:21,078
out and probably like net a duck and

2654
01:53:19,078 --> 01:53:22,639
then you're going to figure out okay how

2655
01:53:21,078 --> 01:53:24,439
do you get you know you're going to want

2656
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:25,359
to have it just wind up being perfect

2657
01:53:24,439 --> 01:53:27,919
and that's why I say it's like

2658
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:29,880
scientific you know it's like you want

2659
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:33,960
this thing that you've just captured

2660
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:36,880
from nature to basically stay as close

2661
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:39,319
as you can get it to being preserved

2662
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:42,039
perfectly and that's like why the whole

2663
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:44,599
hash movement now is so cool because

2664
01:53:42,039 --> 01:53:49,078
they figured out all these tricks to

2665
01:53:44,599 --> 01:53:52,840
make that work to where you're you're

2666
01:53:49,078 --> 01:53:54,519
basically capturing the heads and you're

2667
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:55,920
just getting them and you're fit and

2668
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,760
then you know was like people were like

2669
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,440
oh you take it and you put it in here

2670
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:03,560
you dry it it's like well now it's been

2671
01:53:59,439 --> 01:54:07,439
dry the weeds dry dry weed creates weed

2672
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:11,000
dust green dust um it's the they they

2673
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:13,399
dry slower things are different and then

2674
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,359
you know like you you do there's a

2675
01:54:13,399 --> 01:54:16,719
certain amount of of course like off

2676
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:18,719
gasing and different stuff that's

2677
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,960
happening and whereas when people take

2678
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,198
weed and they just very carefully cut it

2679
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:25,239
fresh remove everything

2680
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:28,000
get get that resin away from the weed as

2681
01:54:25,238 --> 01:54:30,638
soon as possible and then put it by

2682
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,719
itself and then get it dried as

2683
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:35,118
perfectly as possible whether it's in a

2684
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:37,319
cold room and it's been microplaned or

2685
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:40,399
screened or whatever or it's put in a

2686
01:54:37,319 --> 01:54:43,039
freeze dryer it's like it's this is as

2687
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:45,679
as as good as you can get it and that's

2688
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:48,439
the same concept with flour if you can

2689
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:50,840
treat your flour like you're trying to

2690
01:54:48,439 --> 01:54:53,158
capture it like you would with hash then

2691
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:55,960
it's like oh it's as clean as possible

2692
01:54:53,158 --> 01:54:58,519
it's handled minimally it's like you

2693
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:01,039
just want it all to be just perfect you

2694
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:03,040
don't want it ever L like you know with

2695
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:05,479
if I want to show you like the very best

2696
01:55:03,039 --> 01:55:08,719
bud you'll ever see I have to go where

2697
01:55:05,479 --> 01:55:12,039
it's standing up and then I have to grab

2698
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:14,599
the stem cut it underneath flip it

2699
01:55:12,039 --> 01:55:16,760
upside down without touching anything

2700
01:55:14,599 --> 01:55:18,960
and then hang it up on something without

2701
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,800
ever touching anything and then when I

2702
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,679
take it off the hanger I'm not going to

2703
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:25,039
touch it it's not going to touch touch

2704
01:55:22,679 --> 01:55:27,359
anything and my scissors are only going

2705
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:30,479
to touch it in the place where I'm

2706
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:32,920
actually doing a removal of some piece

2707
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:34,598
of the plant and then all said and done

2708
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:37,679
you just wind up with this thing and it

2709
01:55:34,599 --> 01:55:40,639
looks exactly as it should it's totally

2710
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:43,239
preserved and by having weed that's like

2711
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,840
that people don't see weed that's like

2712
01:55:43,238 --> 01:55:46,959
that it's not what you wind up getting

2713
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:48,920
and that that's just the mechanical

2714
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:51,279
handling of it that has nothing to do

2715
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:53,399
with the environmental factors that

2716
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:56,519
cause it to be like I said like be like

2717
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:58,118
a tempered Pro product you know and like

2718
01:55:56,520 --> 01:56:00,639
all the weed that I've ever seen from

2719
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:03,439
you I could look right at it and I knew

2720
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:05,159
how I I know exactly what you did I know

2721
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:07,759
that you did all the stuff that I'm

2722
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:11,078
describing because I look at it color

2723
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:13,079
smell resin everything about it you look

2724
01:56:11,078 --> 01:56:16,359
at it and you go oh okay somebody who

2725
01:56:13,078 --> 01:56:17,880
got this wanted to preserve what it was

2726
01:56:16,359 --> 01:56:19,799
and they wanted to get it when it was

2727
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:22,440
good and the first times I saw your weed

2728
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:24,400
you had like Flats of jars and you open

2729
01:56:22,439 --> 01:56:27,198
it up and you go oh I know exactly what

2730
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:29,759
it is genetically because there's not it

2731
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:31,519
hasn't been taken down and even when we

2732
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:36,159
do our best I'm sure we're probably

2733
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:38,560
hitting like 80% or 83% or whatever like

2734
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:42,719
they say in general with plants like

2735
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:44,920
growing plants it's likely that we only

2736
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:47,920
as humans the way our brains work the

2737
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:51,880
way the world is we probably only ever

2738
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:54,960
achieve a certain little percentage of

2739
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:57,118
the potential of a plant like when we

2740
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:59,560
see something and we go oh that's you

2741
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:03,799
nailed that nailing it is probably

2742
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:06,560
getting it like 30 or 40% as good as it

2743
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:09,480
could be if we knew every single thing

2744
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:12,960
of trying to get this balance of these

2745
01:57:09,479 --> 01:57:15,839
minerals and giving it this enzyme and

2746
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:18,840
this amino acid and then putting it in

2747
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:21,679
whatever like a a a lower pressure

2748
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:24,840
environment like growing it in half

2749
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:26,639
gravity or we don't know we only can do

2750
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:28,599
this and so like when we look at our

2751
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:31,960
weed we're like yes we nailed it and

2752
01:57:28,599 --> 01:57:34,440
it's a and it's a this is a 95 this is a

2753
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:37,239
83 and we're so stoked but that's like

2754
01:57:34,439 --> 01:57:39,158
out of what we know and they say that

2755
01:57:37,238 --> 01:57:41,759
it's really likely that we've never

2756
01:57:39,158 --> 01:57:43,839
actually genetically achieved higher

2757
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:47,320
than probably like 20 or

2758
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:50,400
30% o of what plants can really do and

2759
01:57:47,319 --> 01:57:52,399
it's crazy to imagine like so what

2760
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:54,960
people keep making all these strides in

2761
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:57,879
growing where back in the day people are

2762
01:57:54,960 --> 01:58:00,158
like yeah you know I got 6 ounces off a

2763
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:02,279
light and then people were like you need

2764
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:04,000
to get a pound off a light and then

2765
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:05,599
people were like a pound of light you

2766
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,599
should be getting at least two pounds of

2767
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:10,360
light and now people are like no two

2768
01:58:08,599 --> 01:58:12,840
pounds of light that's not that good you

2769
01:58:10,359 --> 01:58:14,359
know and like it just keeps on going and

2770
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:16,279
going and then it gets at the point

2771
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:18,598
where it's like it's supposed to be like

2772
01:58:16,279 --> 01:58:20,800
this and like as far as we've seen we

2773
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:23,078
don't even we don't even know but at

2774
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:26,320
least you wan to you want to do what we

2775
01:58:23,078 --> 01:58:27,880
know is good you know and not have it be

2776
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:29,920
Ms you

2777
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:32,000
know one

2778
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:35,239
day I was about to say one day we'll get

2779
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:37,760
to like the 49 day 5 kilo blue dream or

2780
01:58:35,238 --> 01:58:37,759
you suck at

2781
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:45,920
growing then that'll be mens no all

2782
01:58:43,238 --> 01:58:48,158
diversity you said scientific grade but

2783
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:50,560
it's also artist grade because like just

2784
01:58:48,158 --> 01:58:52,598
putting that kind of love and intention

2785
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:55,079
into something and

2786
01:58:52,599 --> 01:58:56,880
sculpting it and and just that that

2787
01:58:55,078 --> 01:58:59,439
level of care of not damaging and

2788
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:02,480
preserving the thing that you you work

2789
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:04,839
towards and and that can present yeah

2790
01:59:02,479 --> 01:59:09,799
and I mean I consider like active

2791
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:13,679
Hands-On science to be as artistic of a

2792
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:17,800
Pursuit as regular art and I consider I

2793
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:22,239
consider like really engaged art to be

2794
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:25,520
as scientific as science is like doing

2795
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:28,718
anything artistic is very scientific

2796
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:30,719
because it's it's uh all cause and

2797
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:32,840
effect and it's taking note of what

2798
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:35,480
happened when you did this somebody who

2799
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:38,599
learns to sketch really well they're

2800
01:59:35,479 --> 01:59:41,279
100% scientifically minded because they

2801
01:59:38,599 --> 01:59:43,119
conduct the experiment and they have the

2802
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:44,960
result and they observe it and they

2803
01:59:43,118 --> 01:59:47,559
figure out what went right with it and

2804
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:49,560
what went wrong with it and then they do

2805
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:51,760
it again and they do it again and they

2806
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:55,239
do it again and it's the same thing with

2807
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:57,280
s science it's like you don't just um I

2808
01:59:55,238 --> 02:00:00,359
mean of course there's a lot of types of

2809
01:59:57,279 --> 02:00:01,960
art that are just utility and there's a

2810
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:05,359
lot of types of science that are just

2811
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:07,520
utility but both at their finest levels

2812
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:09,880
are basically the same process because

2813
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:13,079
it's all about trying to have a good

2814
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:17,599
idea execute it as well as you can and

2815
02:00:13,078 --> 02:00:20,840
then try to you know like you you you'd

2816
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:23,078
like to innovate in a way that will take

2817
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:25,639
it higher and that you'll actually learn

2818
02:00:23,078 --> 02:00:27,319
something and in both Pursuits if you

2819
02:00:25,639 --> 02:00:29,359
have the Good Fortune for them to really

2820
02:00:27,319 --> 02:00:32,759
work out then you're going to wind up

2821
02:00:29,359 --> 02:00:36,639
with this thing that everybody goes whoa

2822
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:39,840
and kind of um uh like that Wonder

2823
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:41,920
that's really what like is the like I

2824
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,159
believe kind of that the whole point

2825
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,679
like people are like what's the meaning

2826
02:00:43,158 --> 02:00:45,960
of life I'm like well everybody knows

2827
02:00:44,679 --> 02:00:48,000
you know you're gonna live we all know

2828
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:51,039
we're going to live we're going to die I

2829
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:53,238
think like everything is kind of like

2830
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:56,719
all one big

2831
02:00:53,238 --> 02:00:59,198
one big thing like one big blossoming

2832
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:01,439
flower or one big blossoming mushroom or

2833
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:04,919
those are just analogies of what's going

2834
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:08,439
on and everything is just trying to like

2835
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:10,039
experience something and when you can do

2836
02:01:08,439 --> 02:01:13,238
something that actually gives you like

2837
02:01:10,039 --> 02:01:16,639
that Wonder of going holy [ __ ] that's

2838
02:01:13,238 --> 02:01:19,039
like the universe kind of like it's

2839
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:21,239
blossoming for a second you know so it

2840
02:01:19,039 --> 02:01:23,960
might happen in like the tiny the tiny

2841
02:01:21,238 --> 02:01:25,718
stuff or the big stuff but with like Art

2842
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:28,679
and Science both of them are like this

2843
02:01:25,719 --> 02:01:31,039
thing where you know like you're

2844
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:33,279
experiencing it on this with this level

2845
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:35,078
of Wonder and if you've ever been like

2846
02:01:33,279 --> 02:01:37,198
you know super blasted on

2847
02:01:35,078 --> 02:01:38,960
hallucinogenics or whatever you kind of

2848
02:01:37,198 --> 02:01:41,519
sit there and you

2849
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:43,639
go whoa you're like this thing's

2850
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:46,000
happening you know and with with like

2851
02:01:43,639 --> 02:01:48,639
crazy art or science if somebody tells

2852
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,399
you about it or you see it occur it's

2853
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:54,078
the same thing it's this feeling of

2854
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:56,198
Wonder like and and that's what magic is

2855
02:01:54,078 --> 02:01:58,759
you know and like you people always

2856
02:01:56,198 --> 02:02:01,238
think like magic is a dragon magic is

2857
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:04,960
like this like no all this there's all

2858
02:02:01,238 --> 02:02:07,078
this magic is just constantly like like

2859
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:09,279
you know it's blossoming it's blossoming

2860
02:02:07,078 --> 02:02:11,840
like a big giant corpse flower sometimes

2861
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:14,000
and you see like a volcano go off and

2862
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:15,520
sometimes it's blossoming like a lilac

2863
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,279
where it just has all these tiny little

2864
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:19,000
flowers and they're all in a big cluster

2865
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:20,559
and you don't even really notice you

2866
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:23,078
just see this big thing and there's all

2867
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:26,719
this stuff happening inside but like

2868
02:02:23,078 --> 02:02:29,799
that's the whole thing of like being

2869
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:32,118
really into a thing is to is for like

2870
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:34,840
The Wonder of it you know and that's

2871
02:02:32,118 --> 02:02:37,559
what you get when you when you have like

2872
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:39,560
something that you do on a artistic or

2873
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:43,639
scientiic level in this case with the

2874
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:46,639
weed you're just like oh man like this

2875
02:02:43,639 --> 02:02:49,118
really worked and it's crazy and then

2876
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:51,400
when you just have like a giant massive

2877
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:54,479
grow and you're like well everything

2878
02:02:51,399 --> 02:02:56,359
only get gets three hour three days in

2879
02:02:54,479 --> 02:02:58,118
the real drawing room then we're going

2880
02:02:56,359 --> 02:03:00,118
to put it in tubs then we're going to

2881
02:02:58,118 --> 02:03:03,679
burp it then we're going to run it three

2882
02:03:00,118 --> 02:03:06,598
through then you've left you've left

2883
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:09,800
that area of Wonder and you've moved

2884
02:03:06,599 --> 02:03:13,319
into utility and utility has

2885
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:16,039
utility but by

2886
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:18,000
definition it doesn't have wonder you

2887
02:03:16,039 --> 02:03:20,158
know it's not there's no magic you're

2888
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,920
like you've killed the [ __ ] magic so

2889
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:25,238
that's cool a lot of people need weed

2890
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:28,440
great but if you really want to you know

2891
02:03:25,238 --> 02:03:28,439
look Jesse's gone dark

2892
02:03:29,078 --> 02:03:34,279
now Sun's going

2893
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:37,560
down the magic

2894
02:03:34,279 --> 02:03:41,279
magic point my battery might die soon

2895
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:43,760
too um yeah absolutely the Magic in like

2896
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:47,880
everything like I'm just like just

2897
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:49,559
wandering around the the garden and I I

2898
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:51,078
think it's kind of a magic it's like

2899
02:03:49,559 --> 02:03:52,320
you've made these agreements with these

2900
02:03:51,078 --> 02:03:54,039
different plants okay you're going to

2901
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:57,599
grow here and you're going to grow like

2902
02:03:54,039 --> 02:04:00,399
that and like and they just kind of end

2903
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:01,639
up doing it that way like some mint

2904
02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:03,000
might want to take over somewhere but

2905
02:04:01,639 --> 02:04:05,440
you're like no this is kind of the

2906
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:07,960
boundary and that that starts to happen

2907
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:10,279
and I just all kinds of little things

2908
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:12,399
like that just all the magic in the soil

2909
02:04:10,279 --> 02:04:14,920
or like making some seeds and then

2910
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:17,158
somebody grows them in Australia and

2911
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:19,639
then they had the best luck with them or

2912
02:04:17,158 --> 02:04:22,719
something it's it's pretty it's it's all

2913
02:04:19,639 --> 02:04:25,159
this like wild Magic

2914
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:27,719
and the science is completely part of

2915
02:04:25,158 --> 02:04:29,839
that too the constant observation I love

2916
02:04:27,719 --> 02:04:31,920
how you like talking about like

2917
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:33,840
harvesting each different nugs at

2918
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,719
different times too and leaving some on

2919
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:37,000
and seeing that point that's optimal and

2920
02:04:35,719 --> 02:04:39,078
if it's all about production you're not

2921
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,399
going to actually innovate to that point

2922
02:04:39,078 --> 02:04:45,158
that is a little bit better you finding

2923
02:04:41,399 --> 02:04:49,279
that it always having that W of of

2924
02:04:45,158 --> 02:04:51,719
observation to find own something or

2925
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:55,198
just to know something better uh get

2926
02:04:51,719 --> 02:04:55,198
gets lost when it's just

2927
02:04:55,439 --> 02:05:01,158
production hugely look I think we can

2928
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:03,678
tell that uh your your battery is about

2929
02:05:01,158 --> 02:05:06,439
to die so maybe with that we might wrap

2930
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:09,399
it up for this episode so again a

2931
02:05:06,439 --> 02:05:11,759
massive shout out and thank you for our

2932
02:05:09,399 --> 02:05:14,719
incredible guest uh Jesse of biovortex

2933
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:16,520
for joining myself and me and Jean for

2934
02:05:14,719 --> 02:05:18,319

02:05:32,559 --> 02:05:38,840
to add to it except that uh yeah I mean

2942
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:41,960
I think that's the that's what uh sets

2943
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:45,119
stuff apart for you know people to enjoy

2944
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:47,078

02:05:47,078 --> 02:05:55,439
people you know you have to have uh a

2947
02:05:50,399 --> 02:05:58,759
level of uh enthusiasm and and you know

2948

better that's it 100% And my final

2952
02:06:06,158 --> 02:06:10,839
