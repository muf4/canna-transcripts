21
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,478
steve thanks so much for joining us

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,320
thanks for having me and thanks for your

23
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,920
hospitality when i was in your neck of

24
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,839
the woods this year

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
yeah no problem at all so

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,560
first question we've been starting the

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,200
interviews off with lately what are you

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
currently smoking on

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,759
well

30
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,158
a little selection i had just rolled up

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,840
a bud of skunk number one for a little

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,080
nostalgic smoke

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,359
and it reminds me even the feel in your

34
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,319
fingers breaking up skunk it has a feel

35
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:35,680
you know i find like it's a very soft

36
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,158
silky even though it's a tight nug or

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,240
maybe a tight nug it still breaks up in

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,759
your fingers like it if with my eyes

39
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,759
closed sometimes i think i would know

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,239
that with skunk number one just because

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,000
of the feel of the bud

42
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,319
yeah no i i can kind of relate to that

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,640
i've never tried a wide variety of

44
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,639
skunks but i think i know what you mean

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,640
it's

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,959
yeah okay well my first question would

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,880
be

48
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,718
what's your opinion on terms of the

49
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,438
skunk now versus when you were first

50
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,478
experiencing it

51
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,639
you know it's an old standby and it's uh

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,120
such a building block of everything out

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,399
there or many of the things out there

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
and

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
i just like

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,080
i've found the last couple years that

57
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,238
i've been going back to the strains i

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
remember from when i was younger and

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,080
just starting out 30 years ago and i

60
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,759
think i'm still kind of nostalgic for a

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,239
taste of that old northern lights or

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,159
some scout number one or something

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
like they are classics for a reason you

64
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,719
know and i sure love trying the latest

65
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,079
and greatest from everybody too

66
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,759
but uh

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
there's a reason those ones are still

68
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,000
around is there

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,599
you know they have character

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,639
yeah of course

71
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,318
and have you personally noted any kind

72
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,759
of variation over the years because i

73
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,560
think that's the comment that often gets

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,439
through

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,239
yes sir the nlic today

76
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,400
isn't as uh

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,400
it's just not the same as the first ones

78
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
i've been exposed to there's there's

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
some similarities but there's some

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,919
definite differences and

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,519
you know within any population there's

82
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,839
some variation so

83
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,480
you can imagine how many northern light

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,560
seeds got sold over the years and spread

85
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,639
around from seattle before they were

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
even being sold in seed companies you

87
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,359
know so i think there's a lot of

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,560
variation even within nl5 there would

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
still be

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
a lot of

91
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,679
uh

92
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,759
you know recognizable but different

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,159
of course and so do you think that the

94
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,518
nl at least maybe we'll say nl5 just so

95
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,239
we've got a little more of a talking

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,560
point do you think that it's it was a

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,080
line which had variation even when it

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,199
was originally released or it was more

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,680
of like a clone type of thing

100
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,079
i think there was a fairly stable line

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,959
and uh but

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,799
i don't think it uh

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,959
you know clones can have

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,719
sports which is mutations through

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
cuttings which is why

106
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,719
you know pinot gris pinot blanc and

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
pinot noir were all the same seedling at

108
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,239
one point and they shared the exact same

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,120
chromosomes but there

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,438
was a mutation in the cuttings which led

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
to the other two

112
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,199
they're not even sure which was the

113
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,199
first one in that case but i mean with

114
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,079
northern lights that could be the same

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,000
thing where you you get some clonal

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,879
variation over time

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,279
but

118
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,159
mostly you don't a clone is a clone

119
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,159
in most cases you know it would take

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
millennia for some of those tweaks

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,720
happened like they haven't been affair

122
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,478
over time the uh

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
you know selecting from seed when you

124
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,360
grow a pack of seed you always have one

125
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,439
favorite of the bunch maybe you have two

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,319
favorites but they're never all

127
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,040
absolutely unmistakably the same you

128
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,879
know

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,520
regardless how stable

130
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,159
the line may be it's not

131
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,839
uniform like a tray of clones

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
so

133
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,839
the

134
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,918
everybody can pick a little different

135
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,679
one and of course every environment that

136
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,159
it's grown is different even a different

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
water source anything can change like

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,000
you can really taste the difference

139
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,759
between bc hydro and ontario hydro

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,720
largely because of the hard and soft

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
water

142
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,919
so i mean it's uh

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
the environment is half the genetic is

144
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,159
half of what you end up with but among

145
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,240
the you know within the environment

146
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,759
there's lots of variation and within the

147
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
genetic there's at least a little

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,080
variation you know

149
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,918
yeah certainly and you just touched on a

150
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,639
topic i always love to talk about but

151
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,879
really we get to genetic drift do you

152
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
believe that it exists the consensus

153
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,000
we've heard so far is a lot of people

154
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,279
don't think it exists within cannabis

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,959
but you kind of just hinted that you

156
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,359
think it may

157
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:48,159
well if if it does it's it's a very slow

158
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,199
process you know so there's some clones

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
that have

160
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,280
you know that i know even have been

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,759
around for 30 years so i

162
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,359
do i see a massive change in them not a

163
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,080
massive change but sometimes there's

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,879
some slippage or the introduction of a

165
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,800
virus or something you know where the

166
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,839
like with grapefruit grapefruit was a

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,319
cutting i got in 94

168
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,000
and it had no name it was called the

169
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,360
people i got it from called it the only

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,918
thing worth growing

171
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
so as and i always thought they picked

172
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,519
it too early because i thought their bud

173
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
was sweet but it was always really long

174
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,439
red hair and just not quite finished so

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,918
i said i really want to get some clones

176
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,399
of this and try to grow it out and it

177
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:32,079
was i got some in the spring my first

178
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,959
year in vancouver and put them out on

179
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,879
my balcony and flowered like 20 of them

180
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,599
out there i kept one under a light in my

181
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,519
closet to veg when i my first place in

182
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,160
bc right after university and uh

183
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,959
it smelled like as it ripened and got

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,439
truly ripe well beyond the long orange

185
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,918
chairs all over it once it started to

186
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,519
swell up and you have swollen calyxes

187
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,399
and you could smell it was just like

188
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,318
scratching a ruby red i called it sweet

189
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,638
pink grapefruit because it when it

190
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,720
really finishes it's got

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,120
unmistakable

192
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,319
you know sweet pink grapefruit

193
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,478
smell

194
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,240
and it carries into the taste is a bit

195
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,038
but not as much as in the smell the

196
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,199
smell is really obviously sweet pink

197
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,279
grapefruit so it was really nice to find

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,879
that but and i shared that cutting far

199
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,279
and wide anybody that calls it

200
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,439
grapefruit got it downstream from me

201
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,799
because i appended that name to that

202
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,959
found cutting

203
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,038
the um

204
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,198
but do i see different versions of

205
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,120
grapefruit from different corners for

206
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,120
sure and some people i've talked to have

207
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,918
been calling me seeing if they could get

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,478
one

209
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,799
because the ones they've had have gone

210
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,439
to [ __ ] and mostly is that they have

211
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,000
tobacco mosaic virus whereas other

212
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,000
people that have had them the whole time

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,918
and they're perfectly healthy so it can

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
pick up a problem on the way

215
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,079
and in different hands even and then

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,800
that gets passed around and people think

217
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,120
oh this has fallen apart now and it

218
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,319
could be from a variety of factors but

219
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,639
the uh

220
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,479
but do i think it's going to morph into

221
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
a different looking plant like pinot

222
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,399
noir and pinot blanc that's pretty

223
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,560
extreme you know considering they have

224
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,318
the same genetics and the genetic drift

225
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,319
between those

226
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,160
is uh

227
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
not that they weren't born from the same

228
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
seedling

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,759
but they had drift through cuttings and

230
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,800
and that's a

231
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,280
mutation known as a sport i don't see

232
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
why it couldn't happen in cannabis

233
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,319
except for the reason

234
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
that typically cannabis is an annual

235
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,680
and

236
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,200
people like a vine finds our captain

237
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,879
cloned and passed on and so i think it's

238
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
more apparent in something that's been

239
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,200
cloned over a thousand

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
years rather than something that's been

241
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,759
cloned over ten

242
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,879
you know

243
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,039
yeah i think

244
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,200
it would become much more apparent over

245
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,559
time those different clones

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,879
but i think

247
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,039
out the gate you know you're not seeing

248
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,919
genetic drift on cutting

249
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,679
from the same mothers or growing those

250
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,079
into mothers and growing their cuttings

251
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,838
and mothers like i think you could go

252
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
quite a few generations

253
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
all things being equal not not including

254
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,278
the introduction of a virus or something

255
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,799
that causes it to degrade you know

256
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,320
yeah and i mean you bring up a really

257
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,759
interesting point there because i i

258
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,839
can't remember where i read it but i

259
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,838
believe it said that there had actually

260
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,000
not been any laboratory confirmed cases

261
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,000
of tmv and cannabis and i was

262
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,360
immediately suspect when i heard that

263
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,839
like what do you think of that claim

264
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,879
well i don't have a laboratory but from

265
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,360
the

266
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,320
the symptoms that i've seen always

267
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,080
described as tmv

268
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,399
do seem to take down a plant whether

269
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,040
it's actually tmv or not i've never

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,480
verified in a lab but i've seen most of

271
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,480
us have seen those

272
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,600
leaves with the wavy yellow splotchy

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,320
um color of plants that seized

274
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
they ceased to be healthy after that you

275
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,600
know

276
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,320
so i don't know if it's actually tmv but

277
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,600
i know the cannabis community identifies

278
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
typically they would identify that

279
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,839
um

280
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,079
pathology you know

281
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,000
htmv yeah of course that's just what

282
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,599
that's what we think of as and are we

283
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,440
right beats me i've never actually seen

284
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
it under an electron microscope or

285
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
anything

286
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
i am not the the guy with the experience

287
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,120
in the lab so i'm happy to learn

288
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,278
something if we can dispel a myth with

289
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,159
uh science that's a great thing

290
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,399
but

291
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,719
do i know i don't know i haven't seen i

292
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,320
can't confirm or deny

293
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,800
yeah i mean heck maybe if nothing else

294
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,839
it's a good reason to not have tobacco

295
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,838
around cannabis plants

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,278
any excuse

297
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,879
so something i wanted to quickly clarify

298
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,000
from the little story just earlier on

299
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,240
you mentioned

300
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,278
is it the case that that cutting you got

301
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,680
was

302
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,278
what you refer to as i'm not sorry what

303
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,359
you refer to was it the case that that

304
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,360
was grapefruit or the sweet pink

305
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,519
grapefruit because i believe if you look

306
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,360
up the genetics sweet pink grapefruit is

307
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,159
listed as grapefruit cross unknown

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,480
strain

309
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,639
well there's some truth to that because

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,079
the first plant though i definitely

311
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,000
tagged spg for sweet paint grapefruit

312
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,958
and as i was sharing it with people and

313
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,839
showing them from the 19 buds that i'd

314
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,439
grown out there was um

315
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
everybody was like wow that's super

316
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
candy that's super sweet and it really

317
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,240
had a very sweet sweet flavor

318
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,480
and the bag was unmistakably grapefruit

319
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,759
so the first cross i made with those

320
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,278
was with a jolly rancher male

321
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,838
and you haven't heard of that probably

322
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,759
maybe you have but it'd be uh

323
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,639
unusual so that was the very first

324
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:57,439
release of spice of life was jolly

325
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,159
rancher and it actually changed the name

326
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
from the original i had read that

327
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,078
um

328
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,480
in a creek near the house where i spent

329
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,879
my formative years i've never

330
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,639
conceived that i grew up but the where i

331
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,320
started growing my first five years

332
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,360
outdoors i would save a little bit of

333
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,959
seed

334
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,240
after the first couple attempts and then

335
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,159
i thought okay

336
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,079
when i moved to bc i had i called it

337
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,360
medway madness because i grew it at

338
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,479
medway creek

339
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,600
and i had my midway madness seeds

340
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
and

341
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,159
when i got to bc i just had a few film

342
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,200
canisters you know for personal use at

343
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,679
that time

344
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,879
i was always people were always smoking

345
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,519
my homegrown with me because i would

346
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,120
never sell anybody's a bud everybody

347
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,959
would want to buy some of my home groups

348
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,480
it was exceptional but i wouldn't sell

349
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,319
it because i said look you know this is

350
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
exceptional what am i going to do with

351
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,240
your money go replace it i can't so when

352
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,600
it runs out it's gone so i said the most

353
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,519
i'll do is share with let's share some

354
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,519
with you when we get together but i'll

355
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,839
never sell it to you because i can't

356
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,399
grow enough for everybody and once i run

357
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,880
out i can't replace it so i said once

358
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,440
it's legal maybe we'll revisit that but

359
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,278
those seeds i just had because i made

360
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,639
two or three film canisters probably at

361
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,278
that time

362
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,680
and i had a one-page

363
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,120
how to grow your own you know gorilla

364
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,559
style as i did

365
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,720
and i would give anybody that was

366
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,119
bugging me to buy a butt i'd say

367
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,920
here i can give you a one pager of

368
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,120
instructions on how to do it and i can

369
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,360
give you 20 seeds to go get started and

370
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,440
when you get her figured out pass it

371
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,800
along and show some other people how to

372
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
do it and give them some starting

373
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,359
material you know so it was

374
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,159
just a straight hobby play is what i got

375
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,120
into

376
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,039
and then when i was moved to vancouver

377
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,360
having been from london ontario

378
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,439
originally i used to

379
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,759
go down to mark emery's city light

380
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
bookstore and buy two live crew or high

381
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,759
times or whatever the government was

382
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,639
prohibiting so i really

383
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:00,000
like to support his civil disobedience

384
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,560
efforts and once he moved to vancouver

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,198
he just coincidentally was also in

386
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,278
vancouver with hemp bc

387
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,359
and he was selling i think three

388
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,919
varieties of seeds

389
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,079
and they were northern lights northern

390
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,559
light haze and northern light haze

391
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:20,559
hawaiian that bc seed company brought

392
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,559
over from scentsy to fight recall

393
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,440
and the police raided him and busted him

394
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,679
the first time for selling seeds

395
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,519
and i went down to see him

396
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,879
the next week or something i just popped

397
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,278
in we didn't know each other very well

398
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,360
or anything but i said hey remember me i

399
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,879
just you know into that pot rally you

400
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
had in london

401
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,720
i said i see you got busted selling

402
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,759
seeds if you're gonna

403
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,920
keep going with it i'd like to donate

404
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,319
film canister seeds to you

405
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,719
and i remember he peeled the top off him

406
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,399
and said those are coconuts

407
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,480
they're freaking coconuts because they

408
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,320
were really big seeds they were like

409
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,240
small peas really they were fat seeds

410
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,600
those jolly ranchers so he said well

411
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,198
what do you want to call them and i said

412
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,399
i said well i call them medway madness

413
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,078
and we're like yeah nobody's going to

414
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,078
know what that is and big

415
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,239
the midway means nothing outside of that

416
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,519
ontario so i said

417
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,560
i thought about it for a little bit and

418
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,120
they're very tangy it was a tangy herb

419
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,518
you know a little fruity and tangy and

420
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,919
but not overly sweet and i said

421
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,959
jolly rancher you know so we put those

422
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,399
first ones out as spicy life seeds

423
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,359
jolly rancher

424
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,278
and

425
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,560
the jolly rancher

426
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:33,278
got the mail from that was pollinated

427
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,838
later or pollinated the sweet pink

428
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,838
grapefruit cutting and that first

429
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,759
f1 of those was called sweet pink

430
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,839
grapefruit so there's both a cutting and

431
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,000
that first round of seeds that was

432
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,160
called sweet pink grapefruit

433
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,679
and then the second time i crossed the

434
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,240
grapefruit

435
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:55,198
led to the sweet skunk which remarkably

436
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,959
has no skunk and the story's been told

437
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,439
but i'll share it with you again

438
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,119
while i was in vancouver my first order

439
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,759
of business moving out there was to

440
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,879
collect every single cat bang i could

441
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,039
find

442
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,720
and bring it and get seeds from anywhere

443
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,039
i could and just really look at

444
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,120
everything because at the time bc was

445
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,639
the only province in canada with nobody

446
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,399
in jail for growing

447
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,720
and i wasn't worried about selling what

448
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,559
i was growing i just wanted to grow out

449
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,879
a lot and look at it and i had 1500

450
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,198
plants from seed in my backyard in the

451
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,360
summer right in town

452
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,039
they would get to be a meter high or so

453
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,278
before i really started spinning them

454
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,360
out i mean it was a bit crazy and i had

455
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,000
14 lights in the basement at that time

456
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,079
so people and i'd have a live uh music

457
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
for once a week

458
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,559
and have big parties there it was just

459
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,399
stupid but uh

460
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,399
oh the second time i had uh one of the

461
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,159
guys i got cuttings from because anybody

462
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,759
that was selling cuttings i said i'll

463
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,039
take some bring me some

464
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,278
and uh he brought me two trees one had

465
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,159
an orange dash of spray paint on the

466
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:06,400
side and the other nothing and he said i

467
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:08,558
think this one is big skunk i think this

468
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,160
one is northern lights but he wasn't

469
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,798
sure and i'm like for [ __ ] sakes you

470
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,240
couldn't just write an n on one of them

471
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,160
or something you know

472
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,400
like because

473
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,798
he just used them

474
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,959
i took these plants and i labeled them

475
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,798
what he thought they were

476
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,439
as they grew out

477
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,839
it later became apparent that they were

478
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,480
reversed and the but even worse the more

479
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:36,879
on he picked up these cuttings from

480
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,640
one of the trees the one that i thought

481
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,200
was big skunk turned out to be a male

482
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,440
and uh i had like 20 these cuttings i'm

483
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,840
like oh [ __ ] great but but it had

484
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,080
been growing in veg so

485
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,000
vigorously i was like wow well this is a

486
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,879
real neat plant i was really loving the

487
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,720
plant

488
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,960
and then when i saw it was a male i

489
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,480
wasn't loving it quite as much but i

490
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
thought well i'll kill most of them and

491
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,120
keep one because it is super vigorous

492
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,120
and the stem smelled really had a

493
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,519
gorgeous aroma on the stem

494
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,119
and so that you know obviously in

495
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,639
retrospect turned out to be the animal

496
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,959
haze but at the time i thought it was a

497
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
big skunk and uh

498
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,720
i

499
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
made a cross of it with a number of

500
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,839
things i every year basically i was

501
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,240
taken the best male i found out of my

502
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,480
initial years of just collecting all the

503
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,519
females i could growing them out side by

504
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,319
side

505
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:32,558
and then any males i found i would

506
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,798
usually toss but if it was outstanding

507
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,879
for any reason i would keep that male

508
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,599
and let it hit a room of like my

509
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,120
favorite five or favorite six females

510
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,159
going at the time

511
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:47,038
so that was how the sweet skunk was done

512
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,120
was that mail n l hayes mail on the

513
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,240
sweet pink grapefruit cutting

514
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,119
and

515
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,359
when i

516
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,798
brought it out in the seed catalog and

517
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,199
took it down town to him bc i was

518
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,720
calling it big fruit which would have

519
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,880
been okay

520
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,160
it should have just stuck with big fruit

521
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,880
but mark was out of skunk at the time

522
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,960
and he said well because the father is a

523
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,960
skunk pig bud he's like i'll call it

524
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,960
sweet skunk so he just changed the name

525
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,319
on the catalog that was the only time

526
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,079
that happened where

527
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,159
i released the scene with something and

528
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,159
then they you know

529
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,080
the vendor

530
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
changed the name and the catalog was

531
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,879
just what was

532
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:32,720
you know my ad space in cannabis canada

533
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,280
magazine at the time so they just edited

534
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,600
the name from big fruit to sweet skunk

535
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,119
so that sweet skunk name just stuck

536
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,480
because that's what it came out with

537
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,678
right away

538
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,679
and

539
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,519
when i grew it out

540
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,919
what became

541
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,639
famous as sweet skunk now

542
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:55,360
was the cutting of one particular

543
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,320
recessive so i drew out 500 of those f1s

544
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,599
and

545
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:02,319
498 of them

546
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,639
looked like northern lights as i'm

547
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,639
pretty sure the grapefruit cutting was a

548
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,679
really early version of northern lights

549
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,520
the guy i got it from it had it 17 years

550
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
who got it from somebody else that had

551
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,359
it about that long who brought it up

552
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,480
from seattle and it was already old so

553
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,119
this is a

554
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,679
several decades-old cutting when i got

555
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,558
it and that was a long time ago now so i

556
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,000
mean

557
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,480
it's probably

558
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,159
50 years old or something if

559
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,360
if you think about it

560
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,440
but when i grew them out it was mostly

561
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,759
northern lights looking plants

562
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,320
really quite stable even the shockingly

563
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,519
so which really confirms that i think it

564
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,960
was a grapefruit it wasn't early

565
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:45,038
northern lights and then the um

566
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,279
but the two recessives that showed up in

567
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,119
the room were like hazes and they were

568
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,798
removed to the corner

569
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,359
they weren't obviously going to finish

570
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,119
at the same time as most of them so they

571
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,918
got shoved to the corner

572
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,719
and while they were very similar looking

573
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,880
haze type plants one of them was just

574
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,319
like if i have to pick a favorite you

575
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,760
know and i would ask my friends to come

576
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,200
down and rub them and not tell them what

577
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,200
i think and i say if you had to just

578
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
pick one of these which one do you like

579
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,159
more

580
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,079
and everybody picked the same one i like

581
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,559
more they're like i guess this one is

582
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,480
just a little bit sweeter smell you know

583
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,000
and they were both exceptional and and

584
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
so that cutting

585
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
i shared it far and wide because you

586
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,759
know a lot of people are really into

587
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,240
protecting cuttings and i was more of

588
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:30,640
the mind like i hate to be the only guy

589
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,599
with this bud i would really like to see

590
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,080
everywhere i go people pull this out you

591
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,839
know so i really wanted to make sure

592
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,439
that you know i knew lots of growers

593
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,918
wouldn't want it because it's 12 weeks

594
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,360
to flower and they're used to it but i

595
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,200
knew some of them would get the

596
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,759
appreciation of it and go you know what

597
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,519
even if you go 12-14 weeks it makes up

598
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,839
for it because of the stretch

599
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,158
and uh there's a pretty good yield of

600
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,319
fluffy sativa-like buds if i can still

601
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,799
say sativa without getting slapped but

602
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,558
the uh the

603
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,519
beauty of it you know

604
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,519
is it just smells gorgeous and it's

605
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,000
because it's a stretchy

606
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:11,038
you can throw that [ __ ] into

607
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,640
trays for rooting on 12 hours

608
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,200
you don't have to keep the cloning

609
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,799
lights on just root them on 12 hours and

610
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,519
then put those straight into flower like

611
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,679
six and a four or six by six so 36 of

612
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,759
them in a four by four area if you like

613
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,280
to grow lots of little ones if you put

614
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,720
36 of them in a four by four area

615
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:35,119
you will have

616
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,440
36 cricket bats you know they just

617
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,798
they just stretch up into big

618
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,200
fluffy glorious you stretchy buds and

619
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,558
they just smell incredible so people

620
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,159
when uh

621
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,798
you know when standard

622
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,120
good indoor in town was maybe 200

623
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,440
announced that would fetch 300 an ounce

624
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,439
according to my friends that were

625
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,038
selling because they would be growing

626
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,200
you know

627
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,558
grapefruit or i'm trying to even think

628
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,519
of what people were going back and there

629
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,119
was a lot of big buds it was really

630
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,759
it was an amazing time there were some

631
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:11,359
people growing some really fantastic

632
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:13,440
herbs but most of the people aren't ever

633
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,599
growing a lot of fantastic herbs that's

634
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,159
it's the kiss of death of popularity

635
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,359
like at one point a grapefruit perfect

636
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,840
example

637
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,240
it was highly sought after when it first

638
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,720
was showing up as really good quality

639
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,319
product and it was tasty and visually

640
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,600
appealing and everybody's like wow i

641
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,519
can't get enough of that grapefruit you

642
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,439
know the people that were growing it

643
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,400
commercially and exporting it doing a

644
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,320
good job we're making a good name for it

645
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,480
but of course the cuttings get spread

646
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,480
around everybody eventually and then it

647
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,120
becomes the lowest common denominator

648
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,120
because if everybody's growing it

649
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,319
and in the case of vancouver at that

650
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,599
time

651
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,519
um

652
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:55,759
the vietnamese were growing a lot of

653
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,158
lower grade bud picking everything at

654
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,679
six weeks or whatever and just banging

655
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,039
out and once though

656
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,960
once that strain got out into the wider

657
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,879
world or that cutting

658
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,600
it was the kiss of death because it was

659
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,400
it started out super popular

660
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,319
and

661
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,159
that would be the kiss of death because

662
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,678
once it got popular

663
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,679
everybody's doing it and once

664
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
everybody's doing it now it's the regs

665
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,360
or the beasters you know because it's

666
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,839
not being done

667
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,079
with the attention to detail required to

668
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,759
make it special so when the first when i

669
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,599
just give it out to a bunch of really

670
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,278
good growers because i want to see them

671
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,119
grow it you know and i give it to

672
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,200
beginners anybody's starting out i want

673
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,158
to see them get growing some sweeter

674
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,400
herb it helps but the name gets dragged

675
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,720
through the dirt when too much bad

676
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
commercial gets attached to it and then

677
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,319
nobody wants to see it they're like oh

678
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,319
yeah you know a few years later once

679
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,399
everybody have it it was just be

680
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,079
synonymous with shitty weed you know oh

681
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,240
no no we don't want more grapefruit and

682
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,399
then now that sort of flipped around

683
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,798
again as people are kind of missing the

684
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,038
sweet flavors because everything's been

685
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,960
on this pungent kush kick for a while

686
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,000
and very piney

687
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,278
strong

688
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,798
aromas

689
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:12,000
and uh punchy herb but not necessarily

690
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,839
really a pleasure to smoke

691
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,919
yeah yeah it's definitely interesting we

692
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:17,759
i think we've been on the fuel

693
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,880
binge for a while now so to speak with

694
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,879
the ogs and all that

695
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:26,720
variety is the spice of life as they say

696
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,079
and uh i always like i would i never had

697
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,679
one that i thought oh that's the only

698
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,079
thing i want to smoke for the rest of my

699
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,200
life you know i always say boy i sure

700
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,359
want that in my library or my cellar of

701
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,440
jars for the rest of my life i always

702
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,219
want to have access to that flavor do i

703
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,519
want it to be the only flavor [ __ ] no

704
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,679
[Laughter]

705
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,079
yeah no i can agree it's like i like

706
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,519
shiraz but would i give up pinot noir to

707
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:54,639
drink shiraz forever no no no no

708
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,879
well both can i have both you know

709
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,240
yeah definitely and it's it's crazy how

710
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,640
many parallels there were between that

711
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,240
many story that story told and kind of

712
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
the australian scene in that you know

713
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
even right now the vietnamese are the

714
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,720
ones

715
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,038
pumping out the beasts in the same

716
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,200
fashion you described and

717
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,038
i'm even um personally toying with the

718
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,480
idea of maybe giving raspberry mummy out

719
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,919
to a few people but i'm fearful of

720
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,079
exactly what you said like just becomes

721
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,159
synonymous with [ __ ] weed

722
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,558
what happens i mean it's cool it's still

723
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,480
good to get it out there because anybody

724
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,319
can have a chance to grow good weed if

725
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,159
they've got good genetics without them

726
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,240
they don't even have a chance right yeah

727
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,080
so i like to get the genetics out there

728
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,159
but it's always disheartening when you

729
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,918
see a piss poor job done of it and it

730
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,760
because it reflects badly on you to some

731
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,720
degree because people think

732
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,319
oh yeah

733
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,120
you know i talked to this one young

734
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:45,038
american kid recently that works for a

735
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,558
big pot company and he was on a

736
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,960
conference call with some other people

737
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,240
and trying to explain how he was a real

738
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,360
pot expert and whatnot and i

739
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,200
he says

740
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,278
so what strange did you breed and i was

741
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,038
like well like sweet tooth

742
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,000
and he's like sweet tooth

743
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,319
he isn't that the beasters and i'm

744
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
cracking up i'm going that's what a frat

745
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,480
boy that looks at booth packs says you

746
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,240
know not a grow expert

747
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,798
if you're a grow expert that's not what

748
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,880
you say you say oh that looks like this

749
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,798
or you know whatever you might have

750
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,559
some valid input but you say isn't that

751
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,639
just the beast i think

752
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,519
that's the booth pack oh my god you know

753
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,278
shopping fat boys you know you just

754
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,519
you just lost me as far as any

755
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:30,240
credibility with what you know about a

756
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,839
strain you know but if if all you know

757
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,839
is the beast it's because you've just

758
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,798
been looking at the shitty weed mask

759
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,839
people are selling you garbage

760
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,200
yeah it's it's crazy how many people who

761
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,839
are just i call them professional

762
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,038
smokers and they think they're like

763
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,720
you know

764
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,798
like the guy you're talking to basically

765
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
anyway so what i wanted to touch back on

766
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,960
for a sec was you mentioned sweet pink

767
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,439
grapefruit and the original grapefruit

768
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,278
clone possibly being in northern lights

769
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,679
what do you think is the origins of that

770
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,880
like just a worked afghani type of thing

771
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,200
that's what we've heard thrown around

772
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,679
before definitely

773
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,600
i mean beyond that i have no idea but

774
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,360
there's obviously it's afghanica that's

775
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,199
that's uh

776
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,199
i don't know what else exactly and i'm

777
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,480
sure people do i'm sure it's already

778
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,319
been sequenced and explored it's

779
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,679
probably in that uh

780
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,359
violence

781
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,798
yeah the finals galaxy

782
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,479
i bet you they have it i mean i just

783
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,079
haven't looked at stuff lately i've not

784
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,480
been keeping up i'm just trying i've

785
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,038
just spent the last couple years getting

786
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,278
my ducks in a row to get back into being

787
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,798
able to breed in the wide open field

788
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,480
scenarios again

789
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,558
and that's really

790
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,919
to me if i'm not doing selections and

791
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,918
fields

792
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,600
i'm not getting my money's worth you

793
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,000
know i have to pay too much to do it

794
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,158
inside to get polluted results the way i

795
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,640
see it because if the plants

796
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,000
become incapable to survive outside

797
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,759
because they've been living with

798
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,398
crutches so long

799
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,079
they'll never run again you know so

800
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,158
yeah i want to have them

801
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,599
you know where the strong survive

802
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,320
because uh

803
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,639
nature can thin out a lot of you and it

804
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,759
really is a numbers game you know

805
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,679
every time

806
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,919
you're planting seeds

807
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,640
regardless of the source

808
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,559
it's a bit of a lottery so the more

809
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
tickets you have the better chance you

810
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:21,839
have of winning and

811
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,559
you

812
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,639
you don't find you know out of 100 siege

813
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,200
you might find one twice as good as you

814
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,120
found out of 10. but out of a million

815
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,798
seeds it might not be twice as good but

816
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,959
even if it's 10 percent better it's

817
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:35,839
still a vast improvement you know

818
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,840
so

819
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,480
really the uh

820
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:43,278
the ability to start

821
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,839
large numbers of seed and grow them in

822
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:48,480
the open exposed to the elements is

823
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,959
priceless as far as doing selections it

824
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,319
does have to work for you you know

825
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,440
you're going to find out in a hurry

826
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,678
which ones can't stand up in a windstorm

827
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,360
and if you're not worried about that and

828
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,399
you you're happy to stake all your

829
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:04,879
plants that's fine but i may that may be

830
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,879
a condition for me if i need the plants

831
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,720
that stand up on their own two feet

832
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,399
because i'm not planning on staking a

833
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,278
thousand square

834
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:16,319
kilometers of them

835
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:19,519
i want to have plants that are resilient

836
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:22,639
and when i started breeding

837
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,158
in vancouver on a full-time way

838
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,679
i would do

839
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,320
a selection a year outside

840
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,120
for a generation and then i would do two

841
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,079
generations selected indoors

842
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,759
so

843
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,278
before long the plants that i was

844
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,398
working with and the lines i was

845
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,640
developing

846
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,519
were great for indoors and most people

847
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,240
grew them indoors but they were still

848
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,240
decent outdoor plants and uh

849
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,558
and that was always really neat to see

850
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
for me because i've always just grown in

851
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,720
canada at that point

852
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,919
and that i would find amazing tropical

853
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,640
plants like

854
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,960
out of seed from barbados i got what uh

855
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,679
turned out to be original colombian gold

856
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,240
that i've never seen as pure since and i

857
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,720
made two crosses with those i had males

858
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,079
and females and stupidly i didn't keep a

859
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,640
pure line of it because i thought oh

860
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,839
nobody will ever want these are 16 weeks

861
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,278
and

862
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,879
so i used

863
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,398
um actually the same dad as the

864
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
sweet skunk

865
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,879
to make a tropical treat line i had

866
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,440
tropical treat one and two and then i

867
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,840
used the pollen from the colombian gold

868
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,600
on a dutch tree

869
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:35,278
and i believe that was tropical treat

870
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,240
one and the other one was tropical tree

871
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,319
too and then in switzerland later

872
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,399
i made i used uh

873
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,798
i'd grown them out a couple lines and

874
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,759
crossed them later with uh sweet skunk

875
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:50,720
and shishka berry with each of the lines

876
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,879
and called those tropicana one and two

877
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,960
and i think richard from heaven stairway

878
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,360
cornered the market on those but it was

879
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,919
really amazing to me even from the first

880
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,000
tropical treats was to see customers

881
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,080
that ordered these plants through the

882
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,640
magazine back then

883
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,759
and grew them out in northern australia

884
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,840
or hawaii or in mexico or

885
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,599
palm springs or somewhere infinitely

886
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,839
warmer than where i was

887
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,839
and they could see the real potential

888
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,158
like i would see these plants as four

889
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,079
foot skinny little things under lights

890
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,200
and then i would get back the customer

891
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,319
photos

892
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,720
of guys with these 16-foot monsters just

893
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,879
like holy [ __ ]

894
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,720
you know it was so cool to

895
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,720
see that and the

896
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,038
you know it's really been amazing you

897
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,440
know in ourselves included like with

898
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,679
online cannabis community we've made

899
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,640
friends all over the world that we share

900
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,798
this

901
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,120
you know amazing if somewhat

902
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:50,000
controversial hobby and we've been much

903
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,918
maligned and persecuted for it and we

904
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,720
grin and bear it and we keep pushing

905
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,880
onwards and even with uh

906
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,120
you know when we put our personal lives

907
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,640
at risk and at stake

908
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,239
and um

909
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,278
i have nothing but respect for the

910
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,839
people doing it right that's for sure

911
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,599
yeah definitely i mean let's just take a

912
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,959
step back for a moment and fill everyone

913
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,480
in because i'm sure a lot of people are

914
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,079
hugely interested in what you're doing

915
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,679
right now as i am what was it that first

916
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,599
inspired you to start thinking about

917
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,399
moving down south and doing the big

918
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,719
things you're doing now

919
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,959
well um

920
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,519
i had basically taken a

921
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,960
sabbatical from cannabis work as i was

922
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,519
getting really

923
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,440
fed up with the industry and there was

924
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,200
getting to be a bit of a pogrom

925
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,000
happening where we were working in

926
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,558
switzerland so we just decided to close

927
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,640
up shop and uh take some time to

928
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,960
reevaluate what we're doing and i

929
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,360
decided you know what i was a lot of the

930
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,759
seeds retailers because i never did

931
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,759
retail i was always just selling

932
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,679
mainly to distributors even who would

933
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,079
then sell to shops and sometimes the

934
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,600
shop would or shops would order directly

935
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,879
maybe in a country where there wasn't a

936
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,759
distributor

937
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,600
um

938
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,599
so i really just operated on the

939
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,119
wholesale level with them

940
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,159
and

941
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,199
that

942
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,358
degree of insulation was really good for

943
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,918
peace of mind and security

944
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:19,440
but on the other hand i started having

945
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,598
to deal with a lot of [ __ ] in people

946
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,519
putting you know starting to print fake

947
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,519
packs and putting other seeds in it or

948
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,719
their cheap version of it or whatever

949
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,119
and just like

950
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,799
i am so see and i got and selling

951
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,039
knockoffs of them from other

952
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,879
unscrupulous seed companies

953
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,398
and then i got to be at one point i had

954
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:37,759
a look right around then when [ __ ]

955
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,159
was getting to be a real headache and i

956
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,240
was like there's not a single one of my

957
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,200
customers left that doesn't sell

958
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,519
knock-ups of my seeds on the next page

959
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,239
why the [ __ ] am i doing this it's just

960
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,119
you know i said until you've got

961
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,638
some

962
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,879
protection like any other plant breeder

963
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,760
i'm going halfway around the world

964
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:02,960
building out facilities for indoors

965
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,920
field selections greenhouse production

966
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,400
without selling all the pot by the time

967
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,920
all the time but if i just grew grass

968
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,720
for sale of weight it would have been

969
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,880
easy quiet made more money but i was

970
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,439
always into how much can i roll back

971
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,320
into r d because it was to me it was

972
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,159
just that's my addiction is the r d i

973
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,559
want to keep growing that having some

974
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,039
money is good but it's not to be all and

975
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:28,320
end though for me maybe for other people

976
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,759
that's different and that's their

977
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,440
business and i don't care i don't judge

978
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,440
anybody that just wants to grow for

979
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,280
weight but for me i just want to spread

980
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,280
seeds and i want to sprout them

981
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,560
consecutively generation after

982
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,800
generation

983
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,639
and see the development towards the

984
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,320
ideal of

985
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:48,400
the examples that i find most attractive

986
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,079
and you know you cannot you know you're

987
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,320
only in charge of

988
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,880
your own taste you know so

989
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,280
if people like stuff you know that is

990
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,440
calibrated to my taste that's great then

991
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,200
we we're on the same page if not

992
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,400
whatever you breed your other ones i

993
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,960
don't

994
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,480
it's to their own there's absolutely

995
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,079
there's no right or wrong when it comes

996
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,400
to your palette because your palette is

997
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,200
your palette and

998
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,800
i find um you know whether i'm reading

999
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,719
wine reviewers sometimes they'll find

1000
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,280
one so they like wines i don't like and

1001
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,439
that guy always likes wines i do like so

1002
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,440
maybe i'll follow what he's doing better

1003
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,119
and it's the same with with grass some

1004
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,039
breeders are gonna breed stuff that

1005
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,640
appeals to certain people

1006
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,639
and other people are gonna be more

1007
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,559
attracted to stuff from other breeders

1008
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,480
but i think overall

1009
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,078
you know

1010
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,960
it's really fun it's it's just like

1011
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,280
music almost it's like there's music

1012
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,639
but how many kinds of music are there

1013
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,960
you know even within one genre of music

1014
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,078
which is your favorite band you know so

1015
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,000
there's

1016
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,240
it's really uh expression so

1017
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,199
we find the herbs that appeal to us the

1018
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,358
most

1019
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:02,239
and uh i just feel privileged to have uh

1020
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:04,799
indulged myself so long in doing so and

1021
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,039
having took a long break from it which

1022
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,119
my children were young at the time too

1023
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,358
and i wanted them to have a

1024
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,760
you know non-controversial

1025
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,598
upbringing as i was

1026
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,119
leaving europe and going back to the

1027
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,480
dark ages

1028
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,079
and

1029
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,280
and that worked out fine i'd do

1030
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,680
something else i really enjoyed and

1031
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,320
his head was stoned the whole time so it

1032
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,719
was really not a huge sacrifice to take

1033
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,119
a break from the industry all that time

1034
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,679
and as i watched the various

1035
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,280
programs roll out in the canadian regime

1036
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,399
i would read through them the day they

1037
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,440
came out whether it was mma rm and pr

1038
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,720
acm pr than the cannabis act

1039
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,800
and

1040
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,838
i would lose interest by the time i read

1041
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,240
them because i would think

1042
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,480
um the mma er came out when i was gone i

1043
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,358
think so it never really uh

1044
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,039
even while i was gone to mmpr came out i

1045
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,239
remember reading it on my computer in

1046
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:01,599
switzerland

1047
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,279
and i was looking at do i want to come

1048
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,640
back and set this up by the time i'd

1049
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,640
read through it i was like now this is

1050
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,159
designed to fail this is a joke and

1051
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:10,239
there's no way i'd want to work under

1052
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,319
those conditions and if i can't grow

1053
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,559
outside or make cash [ __ ] i can't be

1054
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,920
bothered and

1055
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,239
so

1056
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,800
so it had zero appeal to me to build a

1057
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:23,919
jail to work in you know so the

1058
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,240
then the acmpr came out and it still

1059
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,639
didn't allow an outdoor cultivation so

1060
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,719
it still lacked interest for me

1061
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,639
and it was softer than the mmpr but it

1062
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:36,159
was still nonsensical and now

1063
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,078
the latest

1064
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,000
the cannabis act that came out october

1065
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,039
17th this year

1066
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,639
has allowed open the door for outdoor

1067
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,400
applications

1068
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,159
so now it's starting to get more

1069
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,800
interesting so i'm having a serious

1070
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,679
thought about canada but about five

1071
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,920
years ago even one of my friends

1072
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,440
that was a an academic

1073
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,599
he'd been really trying to get me

1074
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,920
interested in doing an mmpr and i kept

1075
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,359
saying no no no no no no i don't want to

1076
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,760
bother with this [ __ ] let's wait till

1077
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,639
you see something better and so we ended

1078
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,520
up making a company just for studying

1079
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,358
the opportunity and on the different uh

1080
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,039
regimes around the world

1081
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:16,639
and we really were just doing our

1082
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,800
homework and

1083
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,159
and keeping our eye open and staying

1084
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,400
patient and

1085
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,559
when i saw the first draft of the

1086
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,440
columbian regs come out

1087
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,838
it was like they read the mmpr

1088
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,079
took a black marker to most of it and

1089
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,599
cut it down to 12 pages

1090
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,800
so it was like

1091
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,359
oh this is way better you know this has

1092
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,079
some appeal and it involved outdoor

1093
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,759
as an option and i and it ticked all the

1094
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,079
boxes because i'd always wanted to grow

1095
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,839
on the equator as well not for a

1096
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,720
research station that's very important

1097
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:50,239
to me

1098
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,118
and

1099
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,439
i love the tropical terps far more than

1100
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,240
the afghan based ones and i would love

1101
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,838
to drive a combine pulling down sweet

1102
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,319
skunk you know

1103
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,559
for a square kilometer a day you know

1104
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,880
that's fine let's do that so i really

1105
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,838
wanted to to scale up to plant

1106
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,640
equatorial fields by doing a lot of

1107
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,719
selections down there and

1108
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,118
in the constitution of columbia people

1109
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:20,879
are allowed to have 20 plants

1110
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,480
um as a personal supply and that's

1111
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,880
you never ever hear about anybody

1112
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,920
getting hassle for their 20 plants

1113
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,358
um

1114
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,519
sometimes people would pool them

1115
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,799
together the regs weren't really clear

1116
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,519
on

1117
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,440
whether or not it was per household or

1118
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,079
per person and they were deliberately

1119
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,159
vague as many regulations are so that

1120
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,720
they can be interpreted

1121
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,318
by the authorities as they wish

1122
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,679
so the um

1123
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:49,838
but so we ended up putting a few names

1124
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,358
on a property not where we're getting

1125
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:54,239
the license

1126
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:56,480
and just doing a test plan you know

1127
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,919
trying out a bunch of stuff

1128
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,559
while we're waiting for all the

1129
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,599
licensing process to go through

1130
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,239
and

1131
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,920
even from the beginning we were we went

1132
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,039
down there when when we saw this

1133
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,800
initially is a 12 page regulation i'm

1134
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,679
jumping all over but

1135
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,200
the 12-page first draft that intrigued

1136
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,960
me so much and i said i want to shake

1137
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,318
the handle whoever wrote this

1138
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,358
i got down there

1139
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:20,400
um

1140
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,119
august

1141
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,280
22

1142
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,119
2015 or 16 2016. i guess

1143
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,599
we'll players together

1144
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,599
two two and a bit years ago august the

1145
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,599
um

1146
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,598
the

1147
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:42,400
through friends we got invited to go

1148
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,160
and present in the congress of columbia

1149
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,599
meeting with

1150
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,318
the

1151
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,480
lawyer who's a very intelligent woman

1152
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:54,000
that wrote that first draft and she was

1153
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,760
a lawyer for senator juan manuel gallant

1154
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,800
and later we met with him separately and

1155
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,560
uh you know both really sensible people

1156
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,079
that want

1157
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:09,358
you know sensible drug policy really and

1158
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,599
once their first draft came out

1159
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,920
it expanded beyond that

1160
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,760
initial 12 pages but when they tried to

1161
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,280
implement and gave out the first couple

1162
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,200
licenses

1163
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
it was um

1164
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,199
around

1165
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,759
january that year

1166
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,439
and the opposition and government had

1167
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,680
never got a chance to look at it or

1168
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,400
debate it so they put the brakes on it

1169
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,399
so

1170
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,480
it really did hurt the very first people

1171
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,160
to apply because it put them in a

1172
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,920
holding pattern for

1173
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,349
quite a long time

1174
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,000
um

1175
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:43,039
[Music]

1176
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,480
but as after the opposition had a

1177
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,119
went through it

1178
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,519
tightened it up as they saw it and made

1179
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,519
it a little more controlled and awkward

1180
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,280
for the rest of us then it was still

1181
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,000
allowed to be implemented

1182
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,720
the current government is less favorable

1183
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,719
towards cannabis than the last one

1184
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,759
and things aren't moving quite as

1185
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,959
quickly down there as they had been

1186
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,960
so

1187
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,440
that was why i picked it

1188
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,599
but and we really made to that we're the

1189
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,838
only company there to have registered

1190
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,039
genetics actually where we made history

1191
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:16,880
to be the

1192
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,639
registered the first genetics in the

1193
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,800
history of the country so that's kind of

1194
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,400
cool i'm very proud of that and i'm

1195
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,640
happy that we'll be the first ones to go

1196
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,800
into production with them shortly

1197
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:29,199
um but i'm not as excited about

1198
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,960
production like my partners and other

1199
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,519
people are they're really they see the

1200
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,760
production part more than i see

1201
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,679
you know the value in doing the genetics

1202
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,599
work and not just because it's not just

1203
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,318
monetary value to me it's absolutely

1204
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,920
selfish pleasure

1205
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,079
but you know what it still works out

1206
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,079
good for the production team too when

1207
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,240
when i increase the efficiency of

1208
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,680
whatever we're trying to achieve

1209
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,639
so if we want

1210
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,598
high thcv strains well

1211
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,519
let's bump them up from 2 to 20 percent

1212
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,359
or you know if you can do that you just

1213
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,599
made 10 times the production without

1214
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,639
getting another hectare you know

1215
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,280
so

1216
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:10,000
so there's so much importance in working

1217
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,160
with genetics and nowadays with greater

1218
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,199
legality and more and more jurisdictions

1219
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,000
there's so many really qualified people

1220
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:20,000
with skills far beyond me in molecular

1221
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,318
genetics and whatnot that are able to go

1222
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
to town and work on some of these things

1223
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,000
and some of the things they work on may

1224
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,119
not be things that we like and some of

1225
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,079
them may be

1226
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,119
but

1227
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,519
there's no

1228
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,440
substitute for nosing your way through

1229
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,880
the place you know if you're if that's

1230
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,119
what you're looking for if i and i

1231
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,680
follow my nose i really want the most

1232
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,280
aromatic varieties for whatever the end

1233
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,399
goal is whether it's a higher

1234
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,240
cannabinoid content i'm not gonna

1235
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,119
i just don't want to grow ones that have

1236
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:52,159
the smells i don't like and i find

1237
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,960
probably half of the aromas in cannabis

1238
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,759
i don't like in whatever combination you

1239
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,720
know

1240
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,040
like then some it's a thumb totally puts

1241
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:01,919
me off and some totally turns me on and

1242
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,318
there's

1243
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,639
there's some middle ground but uh

1244
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,639
there's a lot of variety in cannabis

1245
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,039
aromas there's far more than in wine i

1246
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,440
forget the actual number of compounds in

1247
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,358
each but it is a substantial difference

1248
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,720
like a factor of 10.

1249
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,358
um

1250
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,279
yeah wow so i mean i've seen a lot of

1251
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,838
photos on your instagram feed over the

1252
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,480
past say a year or so and you like to

1253
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:29,199
use this tag the million seed vino hunt

1254
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,159
is that the goal billion seed search

1255
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:34,960
yeah well what i've actually

1256
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:37,838
working on doing right now is planting a

1257
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,119
hundred thousand seeds a month

1258
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,358
so

1259
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,079
i could do more than that given the

1260
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:46,799
space in hands and materials

1261
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,519
and that's no problem and once uh

1262
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,680
but a thousand seeds some 100 000 seeds

1263
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:52,480
a month that's a good working pool you

1264
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:54,559
know

1265
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,480
most breeders of any sort be pretty

1266
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,838
happy to do that

1267
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,920
and yes it's been a year that's a

1268
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:01,440
significant you know you've cracked a

1269
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,440
million in a year

1270
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,280
well over and

1271
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,838
so i put this million seed search

1272
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,240
hashtag out and said anybody that wants

1273
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,719
to contribute to this

1274
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:16,239
and send me some of their seeds to try i

1275
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:19,118
needed a minimum of 75 but now the rigs

1276
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,039
have changed i need a minimum of 100

1277
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,358
to plant

1278
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,440
them out for characterization

1279
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:26,799
and what i'm offering in return is

1280
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,960
everybody that

1281
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,079
contributes seeds to this million seed

1282
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,519
search

1283
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,960
i will

1284
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:37,679
give them back a detailed grow report

1285
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,400
from that latitude and altitude

1286
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:44,239
and i'm taking it to other latitudes and

1287
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:47,599
altitudes within columbia lona have 11

1288
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:50,399
test zones so i have my main farm in one

1289
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,160
and then one hectare test zone with the

1290
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,318
national university

1291
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,118
in the other 10 zones

1292
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,279
so that's just in colombia so if the

1293
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,200
seeds are make it to colombia they will

1294
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,440
be fully tested and you'll get a full

1295
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,719
report from all these different

1296
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,760
scenarios

1297
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:07,118
and

1298
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,960
i will also

1299
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,200
welcome you to come down and check

1300
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,920
everything out for yourself

1301
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,439
and come for your visit and

1302
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,280
other than that i told people if you

1303
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,960
don't want to contribute seeds just send

1304
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,200
me your wholesale list and we'll buy a

1305
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,679
bunch of you so i really want to try and

1306
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,480
look at everything out there

1307
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,000
and

1308
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,159
if i can't get everything out there

1309
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,920
that's okay i'm not gonna be sweating it

1310
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,239
too bad because you know i'm looking at

1311
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,240
tons

1312
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,800
yeah i'm not missing much if anything

1313
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,920
i'm not missing much

1314
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,920
yeah i mean

1315
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,559
it's a huge undertaking to say the least

1316
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,280
i mean i i don't know anyone who's even

1317
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,240
attempted such a thing on that scale

1318
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,559
yeah that's it you have somebody has to

1319
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,159
to go for it you know you have to

1320
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,760
to dream it before you can do it you

1321
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:55,358
know when i start talking about doing

1322
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,640
stuff like this people that don't know

1323
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,719
me well give me

1324
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,679
you're a dreamer man you'd never be able

1325
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,118
to pull that off then two years later

1326
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,639
even when i got to switzerland i

1327
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,838
remember

1328
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:07,838
you know i got there

1329
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,480
whenever it was it was june i think it

1330
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:13,440
was a little late to get set up for that

1331
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,760
summer

1332
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,240
but i was making grandiose plans for the

1333
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,200
following year and i remember uh getting

1334
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:23,598
a visit from this guy gypsy nirvana

1335
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:25,759
from the uk and he came over

1336
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,280
and uh he wrote a little thing after his

1337
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,040
first visit going all this guy thinks

1338
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,640
he's big [ __ ] he doesn't have anything

1339
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,039
planted yet and he thinks he's gonna

1340
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,799
have all this going by next year

1341
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,079
and he's like we'll see we'll see then

1342
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,760
he came back the next year he's like

1343
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,599
holy [ __ ] god at everything he said

1344
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,200
he was going to

1345
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,440
and it's just a matter of you've got to

1346
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,519
dream it before you can do it you know

1347
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,159
and you have to tell yourself this is

1348
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,800
what i'm going to do i'm i told myself

1349
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,960
i'm gonna get set up in a legal scenario

1350
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,039
to plant fields of grass on the equator

1351
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,519
as soon as i can i don't really care

1352
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:00,318
about breeding northern grass anymore

1353
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:03,039
not i mean i'm interested in it not as

1354
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:05,599
interested as a tropical stuff because

1355
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:08,000
the perfumes have more high notes and

1356
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,240
not the

1357
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,559
not the stank that the kids are into

1358
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:13,838
these days but it's they're only into it

1359
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,079
because they've never had the

1360
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,838
opportunity to try some spectacular

1361
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,839
equatorial grass

1362
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:21,039
maybe unless they live in hawaii or

1363
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:22,558
something right

1364
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:25,039
or australia

1365
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,040
the uh

1366
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,639
i got that one don't worry

1367
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,240
no i mean i picked up on that little

1368
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,119
reference don't worry

1369
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:34,318
yeah

1370
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,800
um

1371
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,639
i loved uh i gotta say i loved your

1372
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,160
grass it was the nicest i tried on your

1373
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,000
land for sure

1374
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,358
oh thank you i'm i'm sure there's

1375
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,039
probably better but i'm glad i could

1376
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:46,880
hook you up with something

1377
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,800
oh it was really nice so most of the

1378
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,480
other stuff i tried from the guys

1379
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,079
brought me with one or two exceptions

1380
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,800
but a few other people brought me stuff

1381
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,519
but it was usually too chemi to smoke

1382
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,280
like i really remember rolling

1383
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:00,880
i roll into big fat paper because he

1384
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,800
gave me like a half ounce and i was

1385
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,240
leaving like the next day from that town

1386
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,839
and i was like well i know don't give me

1387
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,279
all this and i really made him take it

1388
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:08,880
back he didn't want to take it back but

1389
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,559
i said i'll let me keep

1390
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,760
a little bit but

1391
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,680
i just felt bad for him because i'm like

1392
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,559
surely he can find somebody that

1393
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,799
actually wants this because i remember i

1394
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,800
rolled up a big fat joint and i lit it

1395
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,240
and i took about three big puffs on it

1396
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,240
and i looked him in the eye and i

1397
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:25,439
flicked it out the window

1398
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:26,959
and he's like

1399
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,838
what'd you do that for i said i can't

1400
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,679
smoke that grass man i'm so heavy

1401
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:33,440
my lips are still burning from the first

1402
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,639
few puffs i was like i just can't smoke

1403
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,200
weed like that

1404
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:39,039
and he he was just holy [ __ ] you're

1405
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,039
serious and then i pulled out

1406
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:43,759
something else and he was like oh yeah

1407
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,679
there's something else and i said yeah

1408
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,280
so he's he was impressed with what i had

1409
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,440
i had more from another friend that i'd

1410
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,440
met the day before in the same town

1411
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,720
and i gave and i gave it to the guy with

1412
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,159
the kemi reed and i said why don't you

1413
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,838
take this home and smoke it because i

1414
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:57,920
can't finish it before i leave tomorrow

1415
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,239
so

1416
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,240
anyway

1417
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,838
you stood out absolutely

1418
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,599
oh thank you i appreciate that i do want

1419
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,119
to loot back to the start because all

1420
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,280
this talk of holland and all that we

1421
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,760
should probably go back to like canada

1422
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,119
and you know how did you really get into

1423
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,960
things there and then how did that

1424
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,519
transition into then moving to

1425
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,519
switzerland

1426
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:24,960
okay

1427
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:28,639
i started growing my own gorilla style

1428
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:32,079
two plants here three plants there

1429
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:34,078
back in southwestern ontario near london

1430
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,519
in middlesex county

1431
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,680
and the grass i would pull back there

1432
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:41,199
still to this day is up there with

1433
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,639
anything i've had from anywhere in the

1434
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,838
world

1435
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,838
so

1436
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:50,239
i was quickly sold on i am not buying

1437
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,400
any more grass i am growing my own

1438
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:54,078
because what i'm growing is better than

1439
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,280
what i could buy

1440
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,359
and

1441
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,839
it was really just a straight home-grown

1442
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,679
play from the beginning five years of

1443
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,279
that and uh

1444
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,759
been going through university and

1445
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,760
decided at the end of university i'm

1446
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,319
going to move once i'm done

1447
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,480
i'm going to move to dc because it's the

1448
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,239
only province in canada nobody was in

1449
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,599
jail for growing

1450
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:17,679
so it was

1451
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,119
attractive that way i never wanted to go

1452
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:21,118
to jail for growing and

1453
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,959
i moved out there and

1454
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:26,960
[Music]

1455
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,480
really took my hobby breeding to the

1456
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:34,559
next level and ended up taking it pro

1457
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,679
so as i was in vancouver i had opened

1458
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,359
um

1459
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:40,078
us grow shop

1460
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:43,358
where we had lights and fans but only my

1461
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,440
organic soil mix or organic fertilizer

1462
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:48,719
and we had both

1463
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,679
a system for people to grow organic

1464
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:54,078
cocoa mix with steve's special blend and

1465
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,239
worm castings and whatnot and then we

1466
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,599
had a water system that was pure

1467
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,519
aquaponics so i'd uh i started growing

1468
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,960
aquaponics when i very first moved to

1469
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,599
vancouver actually it was the first

1470
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,199
closet i even built i built a quick

1471
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,039
aquaponics system because i'd always

1472
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,358
wanted to try that out and i think that

1473
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:13,358
was the first cannabis grown aquaponic

1474
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,719
which is the best of my knowledge but

1475
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:16,480
he um

1476
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,399
i kept doing it and then

1477
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,639
and it was astounding the results when i

1478
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,280
moved into the next house i was in i was

1479
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,279
i made a literally a mickey mouse system

1480
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,880
that had a mickey mouse shower curtain

1481
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,720
where the water trickled under the

1482
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,039
rubber mates and drained back into the

1483
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:33,118
rubbermaid with the goldfish in it like

1484
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:34,719
i called it the mickey mouse system

1485
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,200
and uh

1486
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,399
but the pot that came out of it was so

1487
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,719
stunning

1488
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,800
that people just lost it they would just

1489
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:44,639
lose their [ __ ] and they would say what

1490
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,240
the hell did you do to grow this it's so

1491
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,679
different than anything else we smoke

1492
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,919
and when i tell them they were just like

1493
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,759
seriously and the puds were brought hard

1494
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,599
it wasn't like you were sacrificing

1495
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,200
weight you would get the same the plant

1496
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,440
would turn out the shape it's supposed

1497
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,279
to if it's healthy the whole time and

1498
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,639
the light's dense enough and it packs in

1499
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,880
its nodes and

1500
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:06,480
the aquaponics just made it burn to a

1501
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,880
white ash a clean white not even gray

1502
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,400
it was stupid how clean it burned and so

1503
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,599
i was a huge fan of that and i thought

1504
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,160
for indoors or greenhouse i would

1505
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,240
if i ever set up another indoor

1506
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:20,639
greenhouse i will only be doing it

1507
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,558
aquaponically put it that way

1508
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,639
and the um

1509
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,960
but other than that i really get a kick

1510
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:29,199
out of growing straight into a field and

1511
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,480
i'm mending the soil sure i'm not above

1512
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,759
adding some

1513
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,039
dolomite lime bone meal or back one or

1514
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,920
molasses

1515
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,279
any

1516
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,639
any assortment of good organic goodies

1517
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,798
the

1518
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,639
but that was it so i was doing this

1519
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:46,318
aquaponics and that was getting

1520
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:48,400
attention of any

1521
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,960
any of the pot raiders they would come

1522
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,480
to the city for a visit and high times

1523
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,039
would want to come to my house and tour

1524
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,199
my gardens or whatever so various

1525
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,920
various ones from andre grossman or red

1526
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:01,519
rosenthal or jorge cervantes they would

1527
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,519
all come through

1528
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,798
there was a annie

1529
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:05,838
i'm trying to think of them all but

1530
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:07,358
there

1531
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:09,279
there was at least four from high times

1532
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:11,519
that used to come through vancouver once

1533
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,519
a year writing an article so they'd come

1534
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:15,599
and look at whatever gardens

1535
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,480
we were doing with the latest strains

1536
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,720
and

1537
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,199
in the technology that we were using and

1538
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,759
whatnot and the aquaponics system was

1539
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:25,679
always quite popular they it was dubbed

1540
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,000
guppy ponics i believe in one of the

1541
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:30,078
magazines maybe red eye magazine with

1542
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,318
nick from the uk

1543
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,318
um

1544
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:38,399
so as i was doing that place

1545
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,200
ed rosenthal was about to go on a

1546
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,760
consulting gig to switzerland for these

1547
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:46,159
three brothers that had one of the maybe

1548
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,359
the biggest commercial grow operation in

1549
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,838
switzerland

1550
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:52,639
and he invited me along

1551
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:55,679
um and said how would you like to

1552
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:58,400
co-consult on this gig i have in

1553
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,480
switzerland right now and i said

1554
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,440
sounds like a blast let's check this out

1555
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,400
so we went over there and i realized how

1556
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,720
legal legal can be

1557
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,720
like you could go to the supermarket and

1558
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:13,199
buy trays of cuttings

1559
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:15,519
right beside the dusty millers geraniums

1560
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:18,399
peppers and tomatoes they had trays of

1561
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:20,559
white widow trays of

1562
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,880
compulti hemp they had

1563
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:25,280
they must have had 40 or 50 varieties of

1564
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,798
cannabis just at the front door of the

1565
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,440
grocery store

1566
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,280
for 7.99 a clone or something like that

1567
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,119
and they had the same little plant tags

1568
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,119
with a picture of the bud or a picture

1569
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,838
of the plant and on the back it would

1570
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,358
say plant in full sun well-drained soil

1571
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:42,639
heavy feeder

1572
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:46,400
you know it finishes in 120 days like it

1573
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:49,759
was just normal it was boring it was so

1574
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,838
normal and and these three brothers one

1575
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,119
of their four farms was a cloning

1576
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,679
operation

1577
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:58,000
and they were cranking out a shitload of

1578
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,919
clones like a hundred thousand a week or

1579
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
something what

1580
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,680
i yeah and i had another partner because

1581
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,358
they were supplying not only to the

1582
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:06,960
grocery stores but to all these

1583
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:08,719
commercial warehouse growers or

1584
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,119
greenhouse growers that were buying them

1585
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,558
20 000 at the time you know so it was

1586
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,960
really industrial they had a couple of

1587
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,839
delivery trucks with shelves in them

1588
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,079
and they had robotic transplanters it

1589
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:22,400
was amazing it was it used to be a

1590
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,000
poinsettia operation and when the

1591
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,838
when the poinsettia business in

1592
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,920
switzerland lost its trade protection

1593
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:32,159
there was a free trade agreement through

1594
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,159
the eu that included moroccan

1595
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,399
poinsettias and even though switzerland

1596
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,879
wasn't part of the eu they had part they

1597
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,519
had some trade agreements with them and

1598
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,760
it literally knocked out the subsidies

1599
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,119
for this poinsettia farm and the guy

1600
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,880
this little man

1601
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,559
nothing to do with graff

1602
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,240
just didn't want to lose his

1603
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,720
multi-million dollar greenhouse

1604
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,719
investment you know so he rented it to

1605
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,118
these three brothers and they cranked

1606
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:00,399
out this clone operation

1607
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,240
it was a marvel to behold back then and

1608
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,200
that was 1999

1609
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:07,838
and today it would still be cutting edge

1610
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,639
so it was pretty cool to go over and

1611
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,318
consult in that operation for two weeks

1612
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,639
and then the weekend in the middle

1613
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:17,039
they'd suggested to us

1614
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:17,039
you should

1615
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,480
check out

1616
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,000
other parts of the country what not so

1617
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,400
we went and explored a bit actually no i

1618
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,880
think it was a on the next next time i

1619
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,039
came back that i went down i thought i

1620
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,599
was gonna be up in that area because

1621
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:34,239
after the two weeks there i was like

1622
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,798
i'm coming back i'm gonna have a farm

1623
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:39,199
this is that i'm shutting down my whole

1624
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:41,679
life in dc and moving here to get a farm

1625
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,679
to grow it wide open legal like tomatoes

1626
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:46,639
i'll happily pay my taxes and be a good

1627
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:48,719
citizen just let me do this and i was

1628
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:51,199
learning to come back and go

1629
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:53,598
so i called my wife and told her to

1630
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:55,598
start preparing and then i came home

1631
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,000
here for two weeks to bc

1632
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,720
and went back over and after the first

1633
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,880
few days her first week up in the german

1634
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:05,118
side where it's a little you know can be

1635
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,480
drizzly and gray and

1636
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,200
you know it's all

1637
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,280
german food and german speaking which i

1638
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:13,759
don't speak german and

1639
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,519
it was okay i was there sitting

1640
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,960
with my german book the first week or

1641

1653
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,200
that weekend check it out and i called

1654
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,200
them and say

1655
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:46,798
i'm not coming back i've got all my

1656
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:49,439
stuff with me we're going to have an

1657
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:52,039
office in an operation down here i'm

1658
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,960
literally the sunshine alone is

1659
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:57,358
justification of me not doing this an

1660
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,440
hour outside dessert this is the smart

1661
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,679
place to do it it's different climate

1662
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,039
it's a better climate and they got no

1663
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:04,399
argument from them because they said oh

1664
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:05,920
that'll give us an excuse to come down

1665
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,760
there more often they love to go for

1666
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,760
their holiday weekends

1667
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,880
so i set up down there

1668
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,920
and uh had a good run of it for a while

1669
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,280
and then things turned sideways there

1670
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,720
when

1671
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,000
sadly

1672
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,399
um

1673
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,440
the the pope

1674
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,358
came down on it in a nutshell and what

1675
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,358
happened was most of the people were

1676
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,159
growing there was no law it wasn't that

1677
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:34,318
can that switzerland legalized cannabis

1678
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:35,199
it was that it never made it illegal for

1679
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:37,838
growing

1680
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,759
it it made it illegal to use it as a

1681
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:42,000
drug and to sell it there were no hash

1682
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,000
bars like amsterdam but there were

1683
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,639
fields of it along the side of the train

1684
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,920
full of white widow or white shark you

1685
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,558
name it

1686
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,599
it was grown wide open and it was sold

1687
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:56,640
wide open in pot stores they would have

1688
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,559
go stuck to the roof in the front walls

1689
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,679
of the stores you know it was ridiculous

1690
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,839
and on the

1691
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:03,679
sidewalk of

1692
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:06,239
chiasso which is

1693
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:08,719
a town there's como and chiasso como's

1694
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:10,879
in italy in gyasus in switzerland and

1695
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:13,598
there's a border on the main street

1696
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,760
basically so the if you walked from the

1697
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,920
italian side into the swiss side there

1698
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,680
were pot leaf sandwich boards all the

1699
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,599
way down the sidewalks for the first

1700
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:24,078
three blocks probably

1701
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:27,760
and people would walk over and buy

1702
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,920
cannabis and walk back to italy and the

1703
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,599
the italians actually had to change

1704
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,480
their laws

1705
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,200
because

1706
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,599
they had the border guys were forced to

1707
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:40,159
charge anybody they found with it

1708
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,640
so they actually reduced that to they

1709
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:43,679
could let anybody go with five grams or

1710
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,598
less

1711
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:48,000
without charging them so

1712
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,760
that was their big win at the time

1713
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,159
but then the people would just walk over

1714
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,599
every day and buy five grams and they

1715
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:54,480
would walk back and the border guys

1716
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,838
would just

1717
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,358
roll their eyes and wave them through

1718
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:59,119
because it wasn't what are they gonna do

1719
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:00,400
take five grams from fifty thousand

1720
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,640
people every day

1721
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,798
just not happening right

1722
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:07,598
so but what happened was an

1723
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:09,679
investigative reporter from rome

1724
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,039
he came up and went into one of the

1725
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:13,759
bigger shops

1726
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,799
i won't say whose shop or whatnot but

1727
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,400
the

1728
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,880
but they had him

1729
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,440
he had a hidden camera and microphone

1730
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,640
and he went in saw that we asked to see

1731
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:27,920
some samples how much a kilo is 1500 a

1732
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:31,199
kilo for this frosty greenhouse grown

1733
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,400
bud you know dutch varieties and he's

1734
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,960
he said

1735
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,280
oh it's such a shame that we can't get

1736
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,119
this in rome he says i could make a

1737
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,359
fortune if i could get this in rome at

1738
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,480
this price and the and the shop owner

1739
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:45,440
said

1740
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,519
hey at this price we offer 24-hour free

1741
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,838
delivery to rome

1742
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:52,239
so that played on the tv

1743
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:55,519
and then the you know the flood of kids

1744
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:58,719
smoking dope on saint peter's square

1745
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:02,000
pope was pissed off about the weed and

1746
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:04,078
he called the prosecutor in the region

1747
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,519
told her if you're a good catholic

1748
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,359
you're gonna round these people up and

1749
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:08,239
do a big inspection and even if you

1750
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:10,159
can't

1751
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:13,118
legally shut them down make their lives

1752
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:15,440
hard and the pope came down on it that's

1753
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:18,318
really what the higher-ups told us my

1754
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,559
lawyer was friends with

1755
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:23,759
with the lady or knew her from school

1756
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:26,240
they were in the same law school and

1757
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,680
i had she didn't even know about our

1758
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,919
company but she came down on it because

1759
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:33,679
my lawyer called her because we had a

1760
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,240
problem with a thief that kept breaking

1761
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:38,399
in and this thief was renowned in this

1762
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,239
neighborhood and i'd caught him and beat

1763
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,079
him up a couple times i was like if i

1764
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:44,639
catch him again what am i going to do

1765
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,480
like i just i say i want to stop myself

1766
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:49,199
to protect them so i said

1767
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,358
get this thief arrested we're tax paying

1768
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:53,838
company we're doing everything above

1769
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,639
board there is literally

1770
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:59,119
no reason not to use them to put them

1771
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,960
away except we didn't know

1772
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,760
they were just

1773
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,079
lining up the ducks to do a big round up

1774
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,760
of the industry and when he brought us

1775
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,359
to her attention

1776
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,880
she's like oh i'm glad you told me about

1777
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:13,038
them because we're just about to round

1778
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,358
up 99 pot companies and we'd never heard

1779
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,680
of this one if we didn't have a sign

1780
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,519
all the other ones were growing and had

1781
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:20,798
retail stores where they were selling

1782
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:22,798
the product

1783
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:28,400
not joints or hash mind you but just

1784
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:28,400
bags of crafts sakety profu mate and

1785
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,200
so she wanted to do a roundup inspection

1786
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,880
of us we're not doing anything illegal

1787
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:37,759
we have all our stuff in order because

1788
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,000
we're a seed company and seeds are

1789
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:43,440
you know unmistakably legal and they're

1790
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,880
being exported to only legal countries

1791
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,400
the federal

1792
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,358
government gave us

1793
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,880
rebates on our annual employee taxes

1794
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:52,880
paid and everything

1795
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,079
is if you were considered an export

1796
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:59,519
company and 70 percent of your

1797
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:01,839
production was exported ours was 97 of

1798
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:03,920
our production was exported

1799
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:05,838
then the swiss government gave you huge

1800
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,480
rebates on all the taxes you paid over

1801
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:11,038
the year so we were really totally above

1802
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,798
board and not hiding anything so we were

1803
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,440
quite uh

1804
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:17,679
quite perturbed when they wanted to do

1805
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,159
this inspection and whatnot but we let

1806
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,838
them go ahead and they get to see

1807
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,199
a mountain of what did you do with all

1808
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,719
the flowers after you take the seeds out

1809
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,919
of them we compost them where do you

1810
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:30,959
compost them in the compost pile

1811
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:33,200
there's literally a mountain of bud

1812
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,480
composting with seeds sprouting out of

1813
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:38,639
it like a chia pet like it's just

1814
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,639
okay so that's what all that bud looks

1815
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:42,960
like yeah so we were able to show them

1816
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:44,239
everything so we didn't have any legal

1817
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,400
troubles but i just thought if you're

1818
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,879
gonna start being a hassle

1819
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,200
i don't need this [ __ ] you know

1820
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,880
so and then i was just happy to wrap it

1821
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:55,358
up at that point and we had a lot of

1822
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,160
seeds produced and stashed too so we

1823
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:58,078
could

1824
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,558
just ride off that for a while so we

1825
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:03,440
shut down the company i actually sold

1826
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:05,519
the facility to shanti baba when i left

1827
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,400
and i was in spain

1828
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:10,639
and then sadly they

1829
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,880
when i had a disagreement in a friendly

1830
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,639
disagreement so i said i'm just gonna

1831
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,400
leave if they're gonna be dicks about it

1832
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:18,719
and he said oh they're just trying to

1833
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,039
scare away you cowboys it was his words

1834
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:22,798
exactly but then a few months later they

1835
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,559
picked them up and stuck him in a

1836
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,639
dungeon condemned by amnesty

1837
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:28,559
international it was like a 400 year old

1838
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:30,719
mendrizio dungeon

1839
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,039
so i felt super bad for the guys he's

1840
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:36,239
the nicest guy i remember writing him a

1841
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:38,480
letter back back in the day but i hope i

1842
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,399
was aware of him i haven't talked to him

1843
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,119
on a dog's age

1844
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,039
but yeah so that was sort of how

1845
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,559
how i got

1846
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,760
through it in canada

1847
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:52,079
in switzerland out of switzerland

1848
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,760
and then uh starting up again now in the

1849
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:57,039
tropics

1850
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:59,039
yeah wow what an adventure

1851
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,440
it's been wild and now and this year's

1852
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:04,240
really going to be something because

1853
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,960
um mexico has just come around

1854
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:09,199
saint vincent jamaica we've been getting

1855
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,400
invites to other parts of the world

1856
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:14,960
throughout africa even asia

1857
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,599
including china and thailand but i think

1858
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:20,639
i am going to focus my efforts this year

1859
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:23,039
predominantly between um

1860
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:24,719
colombia mexico and canada

1861
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,280
and may do

1862
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,519
um i've been offered 20 acres in jamaica

1863
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:32,319
and 20 acres in st vincent

1864
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:35,358
so i'm tempted to take those up because

1865
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:39,279
island time is always a good time but uh

1866
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:41,598
mexico is such a hotbed of amazing

1867
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:44,160
cannabis evolution different valleys in

1868
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:46,400
mexico i've always been intrigued by

1869
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:48,480
you know great oaxacan and the first

1870
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,798
time i was ever in mexico

1871
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,000
was when i was 16 which was a long time

1872
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:54,159
ago

1873
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,239
and the first mexican bud i ever saw

1874
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:59,279
that wasn't brickweed in north america

1875
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:02,479
the first mexican bud i saw in mexico

1876
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,400
was gorgeous frosty purple bud from a

1877
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,719
little mayan guy

1878
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,119
and i was totally

1879
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:12,399
blown away i was 16. it was like i was

1880
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:16,079
just starting to see frosty bud you know

1881
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,039
i was like 14 15 16. you were seeing a

1882
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,119
lot more

1883
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,079
brickweed from mexico or jamaica is what

1884
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:22,238
we had

1885
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:24,399
commonly in canada at that time and a

1886
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,158
lot more hash and oil

1887
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:27,759
because as an import scene and those

1888
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,559
pack a little better

1889
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,039
um

1890
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,960
the local production wasn't really

1891
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:34,798
catching on yet the people were growing

1892
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,640
mexican or jamaican seed and it wasn't

1893
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,198
always working out too well

1894
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,759
so by the time people started growing

1895
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:44,639
modern hybrids like skunk or northern

1896
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,920
lights and modern at the time

1897
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,000
it was a

1898
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,759
real eye opener you'd be like whoa

1899
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,600
this is what it's supposed to be like

1900
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,520
now i get it you know

1901
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,520
so they were like and we and this is

1902
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,000
from here we don't have to import this

1903
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,400
[ __ ] you know this is great so

1904
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,600
we just had time to go to town and learn

1905
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:04,158
how to do it

1906
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,759
and me and my friends all got into

1907
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,439
putting a few plants out and helping

1908
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,359
each other maybe one of them would have

1909
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,678
a place where we could keep a light and

1910
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,520
a few mothers and start some cuts and

1911
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,679
then we would take them out

1912
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,920
so it was uh you know we all grew our

1913
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:21,359
own but it was still a team effort but

1914
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:23,679
it was fun and and you know that that

1915
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,279
was a good time i totally

1916
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,960
always will have found memories of that

1917
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,799
and the people that got pinched you into

1918
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,719
that at the time will not have such fond

1919
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:32,479
memories of it because if you got caught

1920
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:33,359
with one plant back then you were

1921
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:35,039
getting

1922
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,279
general time

1923
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,319
and it still just turns my stomach to

1924
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,279
see

1925
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,199
the

1926
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,880
people that think we should be in a

1927
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:45,838
[ __ ] cage because we have better

1928
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:48,480
taste and herbs than you know

1929
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,600
yeah you know what i mean like i mean i

1930
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,759
saw

1931
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,359
the repression of this not just it was

1932
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,039
not obviously just in canada you see the

1933
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:58,079
whole world how many millions of people

1934
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:00,719
are banged up for this bloody tasty herb

1935
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:03,039
it just made me insane and i always

1936
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,279
thought too that the best way we could

1937
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:07,760
fight back was teaching our friends to

1938
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:09,279
grow their own and teach and telling

1939
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,520
them teach your friends to grow their

1940
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,759
own and really get a strong culture of

1941
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,440
that going so no matter how they

1942
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,360
you know shut down the borders or

1943
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:20,238
whatever they want to build a wall we've

1944
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:22,799
got the goods [ __ ] it it doesn't

1945
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:24,639
we don't need the we don't need mexican

1946
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:28,079
brickweed coming up here by the bail

1947
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,039
we've got kind bud here ourselves and

1948
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:31,039
that's

1949
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:33,279
satisfying but i think

1950
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:34,479
to this day in the majority of countries

1951
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:36,238
of the world

1952
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:38,639
the entire

1953
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:42,399
system the [ __ ] system

1954
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:45,280
is trying to make the plant extinct

1955
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,879
and at that point there wasn't a country

1956
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:49,039
in the world that wasn't trying to make

1957
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,880
the plant extinct

1958
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:53,439
and when you think

1959
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,480
what right does one specie have to make

1960
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:59,198
another species extinct that's the

1961
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,879
ultimate in hubris you know and i just

1962
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:02,879
thought this is

1963
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,159
just unacceptable and i'm thinking not

1964
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,679
on my watch

1965
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:07,279
i'm going to do everything i can to

1966
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:09,760
preserve these plants and spread them

1967
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:10,880
around and i'm not going to be alone

1968
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,960
doing it

1969
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,920
but it really was the people that were

1970
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,520
committed to doing that early on

1971
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,000
that

1972
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,480
there was a really good feeling between

1973
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,719
people that felt the same and you were

1974
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:27,279
happy to share you know

1975
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:29,840
and it wasn't a matter of hoarding and i

1976
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:32,000
can see as it becomes legal people are

1977
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,640
going to want to maintain an advantage

1978
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,840
of having proprietary genetics and stuff

1979
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,320
and i'll be the same too but at the time

1980
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,920
it was really more a matter of

1981
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,479
preservation

1982
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,359
and that we didn't want to see this get

1983
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:47,039
lost

1984
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:50,000
and they were thinking how much

1985
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,679
government spent flying around spraying

1986
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
stuff and

1987
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,440
pulling out plants with helicopters i

1988
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,359
always thought you know

1989
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:59,359
if they can afford to fly around the

1990
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:02,238
country pulling plants out of corn

1991
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:04,079
fields and backyards and cliffs and

1992
01:12:02,238 --> 01:12:06,639
you name it you're thinking what do they

1993
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:09,198
need our money for they've got way too

1994
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,199
much time and money on their hands if

1995
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:13,359
they can fly around the [ __ ] world

1996
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:15,599
ripping herbs out of our yards

1997
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:18,158
you know or the bush like how much does

1998
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,000
that cost that's insane and when i it

1999
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,879
really put me against government and

2000
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,920
that's never changed you know i've just

2001
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,079
lost

2002
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,359
you know any shred of respect for

2003
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:30,479
governments

2004
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:31,359
when they persecute cannabis users

2005
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,399
and

2006
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:33,359
i just

2007
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:36,079
you know

2008
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:38,479
but that's probably going to be lifelong

2009
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:40,479
even when they grudgingly legalize it

2010
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,839
but on shitty terms i'm still not

2011
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:44,158
impressed you know

2012
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,600
so i think well it's still better than

2013
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:47,119
some places where you mean at least

2014
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,120
canadians

2015
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,119
smoking a joint in

2016
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:54,800
most municipalities aren't going to have

2017
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:56,960
a trouble but like in canada

2018
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,719
it's you know changes in every

2019
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,039
municipality right now so there's the

2020
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,158
feds let the provinces do what they want

2021
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:04,560
and the provinces tell the

2022
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:06,719
municipalities you can kind of do

2023
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,960
as you see fit as well so

2024
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:10,960
in one sided town where i am

2025
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,560
you can't smoke in public the other side

2026
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,640
you can smoke anywhere

2027
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,960
you can have a cigarette

2028
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,360
so it's not a consistent open

2029
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,840
legalization it's not a simple legal

2030
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,759
like tomatoes legalization like i'd seen

2031
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,920
in switzerland when i moved there and

2032
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,480
that was the most beautiful to see

2033
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,319
that you could grow a field of weed

2034
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:33,678
as many as you wanted

2035
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:36,319
without any regulation

2036
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:39,119
concerning licensing or anything like

2037
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:41,359
that it was the end use was the issue

2038
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:43,359
and as seeds was my end use and i was

2039
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:45,198
growing research crops that was fine i

2040
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:47,920
didn't have a bong bar

2041
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:50,158
i wasn't selling blocks of hash to you

2042
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,640
know their kids at school

2043
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:55,839
i was simply growing a field of weed

2044
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,840
picking out my favorites

2045
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,199
sampling it as i would

2046
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:04,800
and i mean i'm a real hash smoker

2047
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:06,799
it takes a lot of weed to keep a real

2048
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,480
smoker and melt you know it's not

2049
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,719
something you can do with four plants

2050
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:13,039
which the canadian rigs currently are

2051
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,880
permitting and in bc you can only grow

2052
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:16,479
four plants if your neighbors can't see

2053
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,480
them if your neighbors can see them you

2054
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:20,718
get six months mandatory minimum or

2055
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:23,519
something stupid like it's

2056
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,319
it's so far from a rational legalization

2057
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,480
i mean

2058
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:28,880
i know it's worse than australia and i

2059
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:32,238
think you know i hate to be bitching

2060
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,079
when we've got some ground covered

2061
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:35,279
but it really is one of those cases

2062
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:37,359
where

2063
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:39,599
it's far from good but i'm sure it's

2064
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:41,119
good from afar you know

2065
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,960
yeah i mean

2066
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,719
you having been here and maybe a little

2067
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,640
bit of exposure you know what do you

2068
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,880
think is the way for australia to move

2069
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:51,039
forward given we've got nothing so far

2070
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,960
really

2071
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:55,039
well all you need is nothing they don't

2072
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,119
need to do anything other than return it

2073
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:59,359
to its original state as part of our

2074
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:02,559
[ __ ] planet you know

2075
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:04,639
the regulations are what destroy it the

2076
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,120
it wasn't a problem before they

2077
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,880
regulated it you know the regulations

2078
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:11,279
are where it went downhill so i'm a real

2079
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,079
free marketeer i would be happy if i

2080
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:14,079
could

2081
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,640
pull up at the side of the road and buy

2082
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:18,640
untusted buds from the hippies that live

2083
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,039
there but if

2084
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,640
if somebody else wants to walk into a

2085
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:25,198
pharmacy and get something that's

2086
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,199
verified organic and third-party tested

2087
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:29,279
to be free of contaminants i have no

2088
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:32,399
problem with that some company maybe my

2089
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:35,119
own will exist to fill that need but i

2090
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:38,238
don't think it has to be because let's

2091
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:40,880
face it how many of us have ever ever

2092
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:44,158
had verified clean bud

2093
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:46,560
it's clean because it's generally clean

2094
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:48,319
and and if it's contaminated you can

2095
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,480
smell it you open a bag of weed with

2096
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:53,039
mold in it you don't need a test to tell

2097
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,439
you it's moldy you can smell that moldy

2098
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:57,359
weed as soon as you open the bag you

2099
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:59,519
know

2100
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:01,039
there's and there's degrees of tolerance

2101
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,640
so in canada

2102
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:04,800
cfu's

2103
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,000
colony farming units the limit with

2104
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,679
health canada's 50 000 cfus

2105
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,319
per gram

2106
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:15,840
now i don't know and i've been asking

2107
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:18,158
them repeatedly for a solid year or two

2108
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,800
what is the tolerance

2109
01:16:18,158 --> 01:16:22,559
for cfu per gram

2110
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,000
on cigars

2111
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,480
because if there is a [ __ ]

2112
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,039
discrepancy between what a cohiba can

2113
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:31,039
have and what a reefer can have

2114
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:33,359
we've got a problem

2115
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:36,000
and the the canadian rigs clearly favor

2116
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:38,399
tobacco health canada's absolutely shat

2117
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,000
the bed on this one because they've made

2118
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:44,479
it impossible for a gram of weed

2119
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,960
to equal a gram of tobacco price wise

2120
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:49,519
because they've made a flat tax of a

2121
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,840
minimum a dollar on every gram

2122
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,239
so they don't tax tobacco that way if

2123
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,960
they did tobacco in canada would be as

2124
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:59,119
expensive as it is in australia

2125
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,719
because holy [ __ ] i was surprised to see

2126
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:02,559
how expensive cigarettes were in

2127
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,560
australia

2128
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,039
yeah right that's the real nanny state

2129
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:10,880
at play there yeah but can it but

2130
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:12,238
canada's protecting the tobacco lobby by

2131
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,880
ensuring

2132
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:17,439
even it's not even a question of low thc

2133
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,840
or anything even if i had low thc hemp

2134
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:21,439
flowers they would still tax it a dollar

2135
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,719
a gram which makes it virtually

2136
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:24,719
impossible

2137
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:27,359
in british columbia at least it varies

2138
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:30,000
in canada a pack of cigarettes in bc is

2139
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:31,839
20 in ontario it's 25 so it kind of

2140
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
varies by province how many cigarettes

2141
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,600
are in a pack i think in australia there

2142
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,960
were 30 in a pack

2143
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,159
but

2144
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,480
in bc

2145
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,399
a pack of cigarettes is

2146
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:46,718
in the neighborhood of

2147
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:49,198
12 to 17 dollars so it's creeping up on

2148
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,960
you know it's somewhere between 50 cents

2149
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,319
and a dollar a smoke but not quite a

2150
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,719
dollar a smoke

2151
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,479
but that's the kitten caboodle

2152
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,399
if it was 20

2153
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:59,839
hemp cigarettes

2154
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:03,198
it would be

2155
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:06,239
twenty dollars excise right off the top

2156
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:07,599
then the price of the product plus sales

2157
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:09,919
tax

2158
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,360
so they're absolutely ensuring if i want

2159
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,560
to sell

2160
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:14,799
joints

2161
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,440
for the same price as cigarettes they've

2162
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:20,719
made it mathematically impossible

2163
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:23,279
and there is no reason

2164
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:27,600
to tax cannabis

2165
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:29,840
uh you know a treatment of cancer for

2166
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,800
more than the cause of it

2167
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,079
you know it's absolutely asinine so they

2168
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,239
just uh

2169
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:39,119
the canadian government just pisses me

2170
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:42,559
off endlessly as i'm sure yours does to

2171
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:44,238
you yeah i mean the thing they say to us

2172
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,840
which i'm not sure i imagine the

2173
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:48,079
canadian government would do the same is

2174
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,560
that they say that they're going to tax

2175
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:51,920
more on tobacco maybe they don't do it

2176
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,640
in canada but in australia they say

2177
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,800
we're going to back a tax tobacco harder

2178
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:59,199
because that's how we can still be able

2179
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:01,279
to offer um you know universal health

2180
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:03,119
care because we're covering all the the

2181
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:04,719
burden on the health care system of the

2182
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,679
smokers

2183
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:09,760
that's all the tax crap my my australian

2184
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,359
doctor father-in-law

2185
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,840
explained to me

2186
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,599
who is actually a lung doctor and dealt

2187
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,360
with nothing but people dying of smoking

2188
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,840
diseases his whole life

2189
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:22,319
and he straight up told me

2190
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,400
he said smokers cost the system less

2191
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:26,880
because they die younger it's the people

2192
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:29,279
that are on life support dragging it out

2193
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,199
from 80 to 90

2194
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,119
that have you know a bunch of little

2195
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,879
ailments that are in to see the doctor

2196
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,479
three times a week those cost the system

2197
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,560
a shitload not the guys that die of

2198
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,319
strokes at 50. you know

2199
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,159
yeah i mean it's i'd love to see the

2200
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:43,759
figures behind it but yeah i mean the

2201
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:45,359
taxes

2202
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,400
you just check it out do the math on

2203
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:51,599
smokers die younger and the elder

2204
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:53,359
seniors cost the system the most

2205
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,280
yeah yeah definitely

2206
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:57,198
so seniors getting old that should be

2207
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,439
illegal

2208
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:02,079
yeah okay

2209
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:04,960
i mean i'd i'd love to get that one

2210
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:07,119
for getting old the older you get the

2211
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,960
more you owe

2212
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,359
should be encouraged to die young for

2213
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,289
the good of society

2214
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:15,759
leave a pretty body

2215
01:20:13,289 --> 01:20:18,319
[Laughter]

2216
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,719
something i wanted to ask about is you

2217
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:22,719
referenced it earlier and you can feel

2218
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,719
free to be a little bit ambiguous or as

2219
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,480
specific as you like but i've noticed

2220
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,000
there are a few company

2221
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:28,799
there are definitely a few companies

2222
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,119
that

2223
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,880
offer like you know what looks like your

2224
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,399
work and sometimes it's a bit ambiguous

2225
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,480
just to see like

2226
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:38,399
is this them doing a knockoff or whatnot

2227
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,000
and so i've got one specific i'd love to

2228
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:42,158
ask about is do you have any

2229
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,639
relationship with alpine seeds because i

2230
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,158
can see they offer a whole bunch of

2231
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,520
never

2232
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:49,920
there you go because they offer a bunch

2233
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,719
of sweet grapefruit stuff like femmes

2234
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,480
bxes stuff like that and it looked like

2235
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:57,198
it was more on the legit and just due to

2236
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:59,599
how deep of an offering they had for

2237
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:01,279
sweet pink grapefruit but i guess at

2238
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,199
this point you're just used to it you

2239
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:05,519
know being the game like that

2240
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:08,000
yeah this is an interesting point you

2241
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,920
know is i have been

2242
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,238
you know in some eyes a hothead about

2243
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,279
this over the years but i really have a

2244
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:15,919
fairly

2245
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:18,000
simple understanding of the way this can

2246
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,679
work good for everybody

2247
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,960
when i share

2248
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,800
or sell

2249
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,119
genetics

2250
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,159
like a seat let's say sweet tooth for

2251
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:30,719
example if i make a cross and i call it

2252
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:32,479
sweet tooth and nobody else is called

2253
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,719
their cross sweet tooth you know that's

2254
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:37,919
an original

2255
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:40,960
seed cross and its original name for it

2256
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:44,639
if you take those and make more seeds

2257
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:47,279
with them i only ask that you give them

2258
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:50,239
a new name because the seeds you have

2259
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:52,639
won't be the same as mine you know so i

2260
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:55,678
say i don't mind if you want to call it

2261
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:58,159
dente dulce and put in bracket i made

2262
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:59,199
this f2 a sweet tooth or whatever you

2263
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:01,839
know

2264
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:03,919
but call it something else because it

2265
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,520
it confuses people down the line and

2266
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,239
this is what really happened a lot with

2267
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,480
sweet skunk too actually but the uh

2268
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:11,839
that sweet is a good example

2269
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:13,359
it's uh

2270
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,480
they're all good examples i mean it's

2271
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:16,079
happened with all of them as soon as

2272
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:17,839
your seeds popular

2273
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:20,719
people are making knockoffs of it that's

2274
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,840
a given the uh

2275
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:25,920
there's you know it's the

2276
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,760
only seed breeding in the world that

2277
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,719
couldn't be protected with breeders

2278
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,679
rights

2279
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,480
so

2280
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:34,960
so it was an easy thing for unscrupulous

2281
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,959
hacks to just start chucking pollen in

2282
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:40,480
their closet and calling it a popular

2283
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,560
name but the letdown for me was that

2284
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:44,399
that the vendors would carry them i

2285
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,000
would feel like you know what i want to

2286
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:48,399
stop supplying these people that are

2287
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,639
selling knockoffs of the seeds i work on

2288
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:52,158
because i promote them i get them the

2289
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,840
exposure

2290
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:55,519
into the cup or whatever and then the

2291
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,800
next week everybody's selling it as

2292
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,960
their own and you're just like for

2293
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,039
[ __ ] sakes people have some

2294
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,920
have a little respect and have a little

2295
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:06,719
dignity and [ __ ] give your seeds an

2296
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:08,639
original name because they're your seeds

2297
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,239
i'm happy if you credit them and say

2298
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:12,000
where they came from

2299
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:14,079
i don't really care but if you want to

2300
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,679
i'm happy that shows respect and that's

2301
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:18,800
cool and i did the same thing when i was

2302
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:20,800
making seeds as i would always list to

2303
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,400
the best of my knowledge the origins the

2304
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,480
real origins because

2305
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:26,000
we were preservationists as well we have

2306
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:28,638
a duty to

2307
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,198
carry things on accurately to the best

2308
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:32,960
of our abilities considering even record

2309
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:34,399
keeping was a liability when i started

2310
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,880
growing i didn't even like keeping

2311
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:39,519
pictures i had a couple polaroids

2312
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,199
which i hopefully i still have but from

2313
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,000
way back when

2314
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:44,238
but

2315
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,319
you didn't keep a roll of pictures of

2316
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:48,559
your grow rooms because when people were

2317
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,399
in court the the cops would say well

2318
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,000
here we've got photos of all this crash

2319
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,960
you've grown and that would usually

2320
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,039
against them so you you were

2321
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,119
covering your tracks to keep no records

2322
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:00,960
so it was really a verbal

2323
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,399
oral tradition

2324
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,840
um

2325
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:05,839
so you know

2326
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,600
accuracy and as a breeder you know

2327
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,760
accurate labeling is everything if

2328
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,520
you're not doing accurate labeling it's

2329
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,960
crazy so it just makes

2330
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,040
you don't think i know we can't call

2331
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,000
your switches already called these ones

2332
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:19,920
you know so it's uh not just marketing

2333
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
but it's really

2334
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,119
it makes me crazy when i see people

2335
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,119
growing

2336
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:27,119
her me sweet skunk it wasn't my sweet

2337
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:28,719
skunk but it was somebody's

2338
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:30,399
something to get [ __ ] would self some

2339
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,800
sweet skunk and then everybody would be

2340
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,479
going i like sweets gonna put a turkey

2341
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,880
it's like no it wasn't [ __ ] hard

2342
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:38,399
until that [ __ ] started selling soft

2343
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,600
ones you know

2344
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:41,599
so

2345
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,400
it really dilutes

2346
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,120
your work when people sell their work as

2347
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:49,439
yours you know or mistakenly close like

2348
01:24:47,119 --> 01:24:51,760
easily mistakenly close but like when

2349
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:53,919
people were making i think i gave bodie

2350
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,320
hill online for blockhead

2351
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,800
years ago and say you know and somebody

2352
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,880
made up they understood my point i said

2353
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,039
if you called it square dome

2354
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,639
and put block head back cross you'd have

2355
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,719
no problem i'd be [ __ ] sending you

2356
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:09,359
christmas cards that's super cool

2357
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:11,198
but if people can mistake yours for mine

2358
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:13,279
then it becomes an issue down the road

2359
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:15,279
when people start getting stuff that's

2360
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:17,599
not representative of what i put out and

2361
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,679
they start blaming me for it

2362
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,480
what are you going to think right

2363
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,440
so

2364
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:26,399
that's you know neither here nor there

2365
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:28,319
you know an egregious example was it

2366
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:29,439
still is uh

2367
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:32,000
barney's

2368
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:34,719
barney's farm in amsterdam there was no

2369
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,319
barney's farm when they entered sweet

2370
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,158
tooth in the cup

2371
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:40,238
the sweet tooth they entered in the cup

2372
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:42,638
was grown by a dutch grower who bought

2373
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:44,238
the seeds in vancouver and was actually

2374
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:46,079
growing sweet tooth

2375
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:48,638
i was at the same cup

2376
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,760
unloading a pile of sweet tooth as free

2377
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,960
samples

2378
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:55,679
my seed

2379
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:58,239
sweet tooth was all the rage and the uh

2380
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:59,840
and so the coffee shop at barney's won

2381
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,879
the cup of sweet tooth i was very happy

2382
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:05,679
for them i knew it was our sweet tooth

2383
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,600
then a few months later they come out

2384
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:11,119
with barney's farm

2385
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:13,679
and a seedline called sweet tooth

2386
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:16,238
that they made up you know whatever

2387
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:18,399
heritage they used was totally unrelated

2388
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:20,399
they didn't actually make it with the

2389
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:23,519
sweet tooth from me they took

2390
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:25,439
their own cross and just called the

2391
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,960
sweet tooth and it looked nothing like

2392
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:28,719
it it didn't look like the bud they

2393
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,119
entered in the cup i mean

2394
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:34,079
it was just painful to see

2395
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:36,639
this blatant name ripoff you know and i

2396
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:37,600
just thought that's just shameless and

2397
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:39,920
uh

2398
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,079
later they came out with shisha berry i

2399
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,760
see they had a new release i saw online

2400
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:45,359
somebody sent me a link they said here

2401
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,880
check this out barney just released a

2402
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:50,799
new strain called shishkameri

2403
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:54,079
that's funny because i seem perfect for

2404
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:55,920
making that mid-90s the same crop i made

2405
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:56,800
the sweet tooth swiss with the same dead

2406
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,199
and all

2407
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,960
but it's a new strain at barney's now

2408
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:02,879
and there's it looks like it should be

2409
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,399
descended from shisha berry but their

2410
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,239
sweet tooth doesn't even look like it's

2411
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,399
descended from sweet tooth it's just a

2412
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:10,638
blatant step on the name

2413
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:12,079
and the sad thing is is now there's

2414
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,960
gonna be

2415
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:17,600
people growing out barney's sweet tooth

2416
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,520
and thinking it's sweet tooth or sharing

2417
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,039
it with people and they're going

2418
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,800
hey this is a sweet tooth and they're

2419
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:24,158
like this isn't very sweet you know

2420
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,760
what's the big deal with sweet tooth

2421
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,000
sweet juices and all that it's like

2422
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:30,480
you've never even had the real sweet you

2423
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,399
know so it's a bit painful

2424
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:34,000
to see these people abusing it and

2425
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:36,319
that's one thing i look forward to in

2426
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,359
legalization is i haven't released

2427
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:40,479
anything new since like 2003

2428
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,559
and

2429
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:44,079
i've been working on things for the last

2430
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,600
few years and i'm really excited to

2431
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,519
bring them out but i'm not going to

2432
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,520
mention the name of them

2433
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,000
until i can sue people's asses for

2434
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:56,000
[ __ ] knocking them off you know

2435
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,960
so that's it it's uh and that

2436
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
gives

2437
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,520
more

2438
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,760
viability to the business of setting up

2439
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:07,280
r d centers for seed

2440
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:09,360
you know if if you're out there

2441
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:10,559
going to the ends of the world to plant

2442
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:12,719
fields and

2443
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:15,360
you know do it where you can legally and

2444
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,719
whatnot it means leaving your comfort

2445
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:20,000
zone sometimes

2446
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:22,239
and it's called work but when uh

2447
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
people that are in their bloody

2448
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:26,079
apartments making

2449
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,679
knockoffs in their closet

2450
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:29,279
and then

2451
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,119
they just can't end up with the same

2452
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:32,880
retailer i just didn't want it i won't

2453
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:35,198
deal with the

2454
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:38,000
the retailers that have

2455
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:40,079
a bad um history

2456
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,880
of selling knockoffs

2457
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:45,198
i just pissed me off too much and i

2458
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:48,079
would really like to come back out with

2459
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:50,319
seeds once i can sell them direct

2460
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:53,439
and cut out the middleman

2461
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:56,399
and bring really good quality good value

2462
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:57,759
seeds directly to people but it still

2463
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:00,238
would be

2464
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:02,880
you know another division

2465
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:04,158
and at this point a i'm not ready to

2466
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,199
release them

2467
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:08,079
and b

2468
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:10,319
i'm just gonna decide closer to the time

2469
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:12,319
because i would like to have direct

2470
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:13,519
retail and know that they're not getting

2471
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:15,759
a switch in

2472
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,320
bait and switch practice like even at

2473
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:20,159
many of these other resellers

2474
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,238
they might keep stuff up that looks like

2475
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:24,319
it's available when it's sold out

2476
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:26,238
i mean there's people pretending to be

2477
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:28,559
selling seeds they bought from me 15

2478
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:30,559
years ago for 15 years i know they don't

2479
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,560
still have those seeds

2480
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,080
but they're saying they do because when

2481
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,320
you send them money to order them

2482
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:38,079
they're going to send you a replacement

2483
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:40,079
you know and say oh actually we're out

2484
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:42,079
of that not not well we've been out of

2485
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:44,158
that for 14 years

2486
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:46,238
and it's still on the menu

2487
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:47,839
you know like there's just so many

2488
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:50,079
grease balls

2489
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,400
in the business that i was like i just

2490
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:54,479
can't do it like this i gotta wait until

2491
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,479
i can do it openly illegally again

2492
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:58,319
because there's just so many greasy

2493
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,238
people to deal with and the sad thing is

2494
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:02,319
now that it's legal again

2495
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:03,759
and they got all these stock temps and

2496
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:06,479
whatnot

2497
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,560
it's almost greasier now i think in a

2498
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:11,439
lot of ways it's actually

2499
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:14,239
gone downhill i've seen the caliber of

2500
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:16,158
people involved in the alleged cannabis

2501
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:18,000
trade they may just be involved in the

2502
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:20,238
paper trade but they consider it the

2503
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,279
cannabis trade because they're not

2504
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:23,439
actually

2505
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:24,319
qualified to do anything in the cannabis

2506
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:27,678
trade

2507
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:30,399
so these bloody paper pushers

2508
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:32,319
are really greasing up the scene and

2509
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,319
it's it's at the point where you know

2510
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:36,399
you don't even want to go to a cannabis

2511
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:39,679
convention in canada

2512
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:42,319
because of the greasy low life

2513
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:45,199
industry players these days and

2514
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:46,799
like of the first 15 companies there's a

2515
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:49,359
13 of them

2516
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:52,719
hired a lobby group to press for the

2517
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:54,719
arrests of bud tenders and dispensaries

2518
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,560
because people

2519
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:59,439
were exercising

2520
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:01,840
their power of choice and deciding that

2521
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:03,198
the pot from the local unlicensed

2522
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:06,000
dispensary

2523
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,678
with several magnitudes of quality

2524
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,719
better than what they were ordering

2525
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:13,039
online from these licensed corporations

2526
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:16,079
and those and not all

2527
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:17,760
but most of those corporations lobbied

2528
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:20,479
for their arrests

2529
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,400
and i'm very pro-choice free market

2530
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:25,198
person if people think they're getting a

2531
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:26,559
better product from somebody i go nuts

2532
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:29,039
buy it from them

2533
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,280
and if they think your product sucks

2534
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:32,960
they shouldn't be a captive market for

2535
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:34,639
your shareholders

2536
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,960
you know and

2537
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:39,600
if you have to cage your competition to

2538
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,920
succeed you're a piece of [ __ ]

2539
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,800
and that's those same companies most of

2540
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,800
them

2541
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:47,679
lobbied against

2542
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,600
field grown pot outdoor

2543
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:51,600
they lobbied um

2544
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,360
against homegrown even

2545
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,719
because they really wanted you to have

2546
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:58,639
to buy their 17 grams of over dried

2547
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:01,760
flavorless bud

2548
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:04,400
and most canadians that have sampled

2549
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,280
weed from the legal producers

2550
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:06,158
they've

2551
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:10,079
found

2552
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:12,399
i would say no more than five that

2553
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:14,559
anyone likes the weed from

2554
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:16,399
the rest of them people just constantly

2555
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,039
complain and it's a dance because

2556
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:22,158
they're only allowed to belong to

2557
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:24,639
two lps at a time the patients belong to

2558
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:27,119
the lps so they have to put their script

2559
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,400
with two lps and that was an increase

2560
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:31,198
from one

2561
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:33,359
so they have they're at the mercia and

2562
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:35,119
most of those lps were really get into

2563
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:37,119
the business wanting to serve the wreck

2564
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:39,359
market and the med market was just an

2565
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:42,719
excuse for a little while

2566
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:44,960
and they've left their patients hanging

2567
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:46,880
as they've put the weed out to the wreck

2568
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:50,000
market and the

2569
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:52,960
the government was ultimately failed

2570
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,679
in its uh attempt to create a legal

2571
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,840
industry in a timely manner they wanted

2572
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:59,600
to protect the kids and get rid of the

2573
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,400
black market

2574
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:05,679
and make sure that the supply was safe

2575
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:07,039
and tested and all these noble

2576
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:09,119
pursuits

2577
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,519
but what's happened is

2578
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:12,559
you know the organized crime is the

2579
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,040
government

2580
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,280
it is a lot of the kleptocracy we live

2581
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:19,279
in with the corporations

2582
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:21,119
joined at the hip with regulatory

2583
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:23,039
capture with what's happening there so

2584
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:24,880
you know those guys were lobbying

2585
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:27,359
against outdoor growing because they

2586
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,679
knew it would make their their flowering

2587
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:30,479
facilities into white elephants

2588
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,560
and

2589
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:34,879
it that's just not the way business is

2590
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:38,400
steering government we've got a problem

2591
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:41,359
and it's you know ready to cage us

2592
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:43,519
rather than concede losses to a better

2593
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:46,559
competitor which was the black market

2594
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:50,000
was kicking their ass all over the place

2595
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,960
so you know and the legal market also

2596
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,198
failed

2597
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,960
to come out with edibles and extracts at

2598
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:56,479
the same time as grass i understand

2599
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,560
there was maybe some strategy

2600
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:00,559
politically behind that and that they

2601
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,920
didn't want to lose getting grass

2602
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,800
through

2603
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,359
on the first wave because those in

2604
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,279
opposition were absolutely adamant

2605
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:10,880
against shatter and edibles right the

2606
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:13,439
children the children

2607
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:15,760
and uh so i do believe there was some

2608
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:17,678
strategy probably but they in all the

2609
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,440
states that legalized it they did it all

2610
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:21,600
at once you know

2611
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:24,719
so it was a little disappointing to see

2612
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,400
that uh lack of follow through here

2613
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,880
um

2614
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:30,158
yeah the other point i did i swear i had

2615
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,760
another point

2616
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:33,359
on the

2617
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,639
no i'm enjoying it all one thing i

2618
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,079
wanted to just quickly ask though

2619
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,760
because it was just you mentioned it a

2620
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:40,079
minute ago

2621
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,920
if you did you know get that direct to

2622
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:43,519
customer or even if it went through a

2623
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,079
trusted middleman however you end up

2624
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,920
doing it would that mean a return for

2625
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:49,760
spice of life seeds or would it be under

2626
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,520
a different banner

2627
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,520
and that's a good question and it might

2628
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,199
even be a couple of brands

2629
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,960
you know it's a possibility there's a

2630
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:58,719
good you know of course it would be fun

2631
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,920
to bring back spice

2632
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:04,000
but um sometimes a new project needs a

2633
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,639
new name too you know so

2634
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,399
i'm uh open to doing both even i'm just

2635
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:10,560
not gonna say it because i'm away a

2636
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:12,638
little ways away from that another thing

2637
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,360
that i'm actually considering that you

2638
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:17,760
just brought up is spice of life

2639
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:20,719
verified genetics so i was going to

2640
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,280
offer a three level program essentially

2641
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,560
for producers for me to verify that

2642
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:26,399
they're growing

2643
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,119
what they say they are

2644
01:35:26,399 --> 01:35:29,519
b

2645
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:30,719
that it's an approved quality that i

2646
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,880
think these guys

2647
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:35,439
are doing a pretty good job of this and

2648
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:37,279
the third level being spice of life

2649
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:39,678
brand or their breeders steve buds or

2650
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:41,759
however we want to dress it up

2651
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,760
and say these these guys are doing it

2652
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:45,679
exceptionally well i would be happy to

2653
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,920
call it my own it's [ __ ] good you

2654
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:50,719
know so if i the people i meet that i

2655
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:53,359
believe can do that i'm offering them a

2656
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:55,198
chance the producers

2657
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:57,679
that i think can do

2658
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:58,879
the same quality of grass consistently

2659
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:02,079
that i would

2660
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:04,719
totally respect and i say i would supply

2661
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:06,399
you with genetics forever i'll just keep

2662
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:07,600
sending you new stuff as i want to

2663
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:08,479
release it

2664
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,719
and

2665
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:13,839
there's no upfront costs but i would

2666
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:16,319
like residual 10 cents a gram

2667
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:18,480
on the production of breeder steve

2668
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:21,198
brands let's say and i would have

2669
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:23,599
consistent packaging for them to get

2670
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:25,759
so that it was exactly the same from

2671
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,520
anchorage to auckland you know and

2672
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,679
anywhere in the world if you bought

2673
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:33,280
breeder steve brown buds you knew it

2674
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:34,399
came in this package with this security

2675
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:36,319
feature

2676
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,559
you know and really have us

2677
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:41,279
and then have an annual party

2678
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:45,039
where the licensed spice growers can get

2679
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:46,319
together you can swap seeds we can have

2680
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:48,399
uh

2681
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,319
lots of fun but we'll have definitely

2682
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:52,158
have an annual party for a get together

2683
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:54,000
and i'll encourage this sort of network

2684
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:55,118
of spice growers to share amongst

2685
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,520
themselves

2686
01:36:55,118 --> 01:37:00,079
because if it's so nice when you have

2687
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:02,320
favorite flavors that you know you can

2688
01:37:00,079 --> 01:37:04,559
reliably find a good version of it

2689
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:07,198
consistently wherever you go that just

2690
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,600
doesn't happen in cannabis yet you know

2691
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:11,439
so i think that would be

2692
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,560
you know something to achieve if we

2693
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:13,359
could do it

2694
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,679
so

2695
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:18,399
that's been on my mind

2696
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:20,399
more and more recently because

2697
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:22,799
there's a new window for introducing

2698
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:25,039
genetics into the canadian legal system

2699
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:28,159
right now it used to be that they

2700
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:29,920
original originally there was a window

2701
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:31,839
where they could bring in

2702
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,719
no questions asked genetics for the

2703
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,480
first

2704
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:35,439
x amount of lps

2705
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:37,839
after

2706
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:39,759
a certain date they closed that down and

2707
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:42,639
they could only buy and sell what they'd

2708
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:44,880
had brought into the system

2709
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:46,840
between each other so they were all

2710
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:50,239
selling each other

2711
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:53,199
clones for gouging rates usually

2712
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:54,399
like 50 you know here give me 15 grand

2713
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:57,439
for

2714
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:58,559
um the genetic and then

2715
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:01,198
17

2716
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:03,760
a clone for the 10 000 clones you need

2717
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:05,919
and don't give them to anybody else in

2718
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,119
the big contract it was all just

2719
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,560
okay

2720
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:10,960
but then they're all growing the same

2721
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:13,119
thing like literally every single lp in

2722
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,880
canada grow shishkaburi

2723
01:38:13,118 --> 01:38:16,880
but the sad thing is

2724
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,199
it's a pretty pathetic selection they've

2725
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,639
got i think i haven't seen any of the

2726
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:22,399
lp's do

2727
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,719
do a really nice job with it i've seen

2728
01:38:22,399 --> 01:38:25,759
it growing out like frosty and full

2729
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:28,158
and i think

2730
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,079
i don't know it's just not there's a

2731
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:32,879
another shisha berry clone going around

2732
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:36,319
the black market in bc making fruity

2733
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:38,560
gorgeous fat frosty nugs it's it's twice

2734
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:40,880
as nice a cutting as the one in the

2735
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,800
legal system so that's kind of too bad

2736
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,960
but at least there's a room to bring

2737
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,840
that other one into the legal system

2738
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,480
because

2739
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:51,039
under the new cannabis act

2740
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:54,000
new growers and new licensees are

2741
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:56,000
allowed to bring in

2742
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,039
genetics from wherever they want one

2743
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,118
time so they have to declare them all

2744
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:02,880
at their opening of their license you

2745
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:05,198
know okay here's what i have and they

2746
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,719
have to provide evidence that they have

2747
01:39:05,198 --> 01:39:09,118
you know if they've got

2748
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:10,880
these hundred clones and these hundred

2749
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:12,799
seeds or whatever

2750
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:15,118
so there's going to be a because they

2751
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,000
realize they need a fresh influx into

2752
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:17,920
this

2753
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,679
very closed-loop

2754
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:22,239
system when they

2755
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:24,239
they don't understand the importance of

2756
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:25,759
of genetic diversity that's a

2757
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:26,638
understatement

2758
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,400
but

2759
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,319
the point i was trying to make earlier

2760
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,920
when i was pitching about the how they

2761
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:34,000
could have done that licensing a little

2762
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,679
better when they failed on the roll out

2763
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,279
i just remembered

2764
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:41,520
was they've spent

2765
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:44,880
over 20 years licensing growers to grow

2766
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,880
without ever licensing them to sell

2767
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,960
so all they would have had to do was say

2768
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,960
and every single one of those growers

2769
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,039
wants to go legal but they don't want to

2770
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:56,239
have to open a public company to do it

2771
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:58,000
to meet a bunch of asinine expenses

2772
01:39:56,238 --> 01:40:00,238
and uh

2773
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,960
just let those growers

2774
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:04,158
submit pot for third party verification

2775
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:06,880
if you must

2776
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:09,439
and call that licensed you know hey you

2777
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:12,319
passed the batch cleanliness test you're

2778
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:14,719
in you get to pay taxes and they would

2779
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:17,679
all jump at the possibility so while the

2780
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:19,920
canadian media frets about the canadian

2781
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:22,239
great canadian pot shortage

2782
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:24,319
pot has never been more available or

2783
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:25,678
less expensive in this country than it

2784
01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:29,198
is right now

2785
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:31,600
you would be astounded man you can get

2786
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:35,039
pounds of bud you would like

2787
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:37,600
for under a thousand bucks like 600

2788
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:39,039
bucks 400 bucks

2789
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,440
but you know

2790
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:44,800
yeah it's so cheap here now

2791
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:46,799
it's so cheap and the people that have

2792
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:49,520
are absolutely

2793
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,480
let's call them gormless

2794
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,960
they

2795
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:55,759
they still walk into a dispensary and

2796
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:58,079
pay 15 because they don't know anybody

2797
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,280
that even grows pot or haven't tried to

2798
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:01,519
themselves

2799
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:02,880
but if you have a bunch of friends that

2800
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,400
are growers

2801
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,880
the going price

2802
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:09,359
if you have any fresher growers you're

2803
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,639
literally gonna be able to get nice pot

2804
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:12,559
these days

2805
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:14,880
for so cheap

2806
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:17,520
whereas they go into the dispensary or

2807
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,118
go online to order it from the ontario

2808
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,320
cannabis store or something and they're

2809
01:41:19,118 --> 01:41:22,559
panned

2810
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:24,319
like there's plenty of cannabis in the

2811
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,920
15 to 17

2812
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:27,359
gram range and i think there was some

2813
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,039
that was even higher

2814
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:31,198
and i'm not opposed to there being

2815
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:34,000
luxury items and charging a high price

2816
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:36,319
for stuff that's fine but it shouldn't

2817
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,719
they shouldn't uh you know there's no

2818
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:41,198
ceiling on price but they put a on

2819
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:42,960
upwards price but they put a ceiling on

2820
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:45,439
downwards price you know

2821
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,520
so you can't go through the floor

2822
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:48,960
and make something actually really cheap

2823
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,119
like if i could sell a pack of

2824
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,279
pre-rolled joints that were a gram each

2825
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:55,279
same as a pack of cigarettes

2826
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:57,920
for five dollars less than a pack of

2827
01:41:55,279 --> 01:42:00,559
cigarettes or even a dollar less than a

2828
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:03,118
pack of cigarettes all in

2829
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:06,239
tell me that wouldn't be appealing

2830
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:08,399
to many smokers who are very price

2831
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:10,718
conscious they would say boy oh boy i

2832
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:12,799
can smoke that nice organic grass

2833
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,480
cheaper than i can smoke cigarettes

2834
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,400
would that encourage people to smoke

2835
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:18,718
more nice organic grass rather than

2836
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:20,559
cigarettes i think you would

2837
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:22,639
call me crazy but i think people are

2838
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,039
very sensitive and if they're given the

2839
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:27,279
option to enjoy bud and i know there's

2840
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:30,800
no reason we can't grow

2841
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:33,599
fat frosty full ripe buds

2842
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,440
and have them like cobs of corn

2843
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,440
and there should be no reason you can

2844
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:39,359
drive down the highway pull over at the

2845
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:40,238
side of the road and talk to the farmer

2846
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:42,799
and

2847
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:44,959
pick out a pick out buds from all the

2848
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:47,279
different bins you like you know we're

2849
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:49,679
hanging up hanging up there but they can

2850
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:51,920
be like cobs of corn it doesn't have to

2851
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:55,039
be expensive you could have 12 big one

2852
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:58,158
ounce cobs for two bucks as long as you

2853
01:42:55,039 --> 01:43:00,639
can grow it in the wide open like that

2854
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:03,039
yeah i was doing the math on doing an

2855
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,400
outdoor in canada

2856
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:05,840
um

2857
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:09,679
and

2858
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:11,679
in southwestern ontario only because bc

2859
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:14,000
can't grow good outdoor but it can grow

2860
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:16,639
good outdoor but in some places but it

2861
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,719
can't grow great outdoor bud the only

2862
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:21,520
place in canada that you can grow great

2863
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,840
outdoor bud is in southwestern ontario

2864
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,920
and it's the same

2865
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:29,520
latitude as northern cal and southern

2866
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,520
oregon 42 degrees

2867
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,440
the the reason that makes a big

2868
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,119
difference and people

2869
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:37,439
you know would know

2870
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:40,479
in almost any agriculture whether it was

2871
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:42,719
grapes or cherries or peaches

2872
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:44,559
the harvest starts down south and the

2873
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:47,439
harvest moves north

2874
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:50,960
so they harvest their wine in california

2875
01:43:47,439 --> 01:43:51,759
in august and in bc maybe in october you

2876
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,239
know

2877
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:57,280
oregon and washington in between so the

2878
01:43:54,238 --> 01:44:00,238
the harvest creeps north now part of the

2879
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:01,359
reason for this it's the same with grass

2880
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:02,799
is

2881
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:06,238
that

2882
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:08,000
grass most grass or not all but there's

2883
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:09,839
exceptions to every rule but most of the

2884
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,520
stuff we grow these days is photo

2885
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:15,840
sensitive varieties so it stays in veg

2886
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:19,040
when the days are long it's triggered to

2887
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:22,159
flower when the days are short hence 18

2888
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:23,600
and 12 typically inside and 12 12 for

2889
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:25,439
flowering you know

2890
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,960
and

2891
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:29,599
the thing is

2892
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:31,359
in the northern latitudes or the higher

2893
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,360
latitudes because for your case they'd

2894
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:36,479
be southern latitudes but the higher

2895
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:38,079
latitudes have such a long day in the

2896
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,718
middle of the summer

2897
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:44,559
that it seems to take the plant longer

2898
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:46,880
to snap out of veg and go into flowering

2899
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,199
so say where i live here is like

2900
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:52,239
you get days that are 18 and a half

2901
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:54,399
hours of daylight whereas 10 degrees

2902
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:57,039
further south like in southern ontario

2903
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:59,359
they might only get 16 days hours of

2904
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:01,920
daylight in the longest days

2905
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:04,000
so those plants that have never got to

2906
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:07,520
18 and a half hours they've only got the

2907
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:09,520
16 hours it's less of a leap for them

2908
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,440
to go into flower

2909
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:14,719
so in bc

2910
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:17,759
10 degrees further north i find the same

2911
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:19,840
plants going into flowers slower so by

2912
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,800
the time they do the light is getting

2913
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,159
weaker

2914
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,840
much and much

2915
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:26,238
quickly you know the light is getting

2916
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:28,159
weaker every week so the buds that are

2917
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:29,678
finishing under that weak light don't

2918
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:31,920
look as good there maybe a little

2919
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:34,239
leafier and not as full

2920
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:36,719
whereas in southern ontario

2921
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:37,839
i would pick the same plant four weeks

2922
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:40,239
earlier

2923
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:41,840
and it would be way riper you know so

2924
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:44,399
it's really something to see the

2925
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,199
difference between those two zones and i

2926
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,479
think

2927
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:50,479
once more people realize that people out

2928
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:53,759
west have no clue and when people do

2929
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:56,319
realize the difference in quality

2930
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:58,960
i think uh you're gonna see

2931
01:45:56,319 --> 01:46:01,439
indoor places going out of business in

2932
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,520
three to five years it's really just how

2933
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:05,678
however long it takes them to license

2934
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:08,239
enough outdoor back in southwestern

2935
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:10,079
ontario if they never license enough the

2936
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:12,959
indoors will still be in business but if

2937
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:15,439
they license enough indoors will be over

2938
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,439
because we could have full melt dry sift

2939
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:19,039
for the price of flour

2940
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:21,919
you know versus

2941
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:24,079
growing flowers indoors you know this is

2942
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,480
silly we don't grow coffee in canada in

2943
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:29,118
greenhouses we buy it from where coffee

2944
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:30,718
grows well we don't same with sugar you

2945
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:32,960
know we do great maple syrup but we

2946
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:34,960
don't try and do cane sugar up here

2947
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:38,158
so there's there's cannabis that works

2948
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:40,000
here and that's and most of that is

2949
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:42,719
really just going to work best in

2950
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,600
southwestern ontario so with the outdoor

2951
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,960
market my plan as i come back in the

2952
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,280
circle

2953
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,960
is to release 10

2954
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:52,880
ounces

2955
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:54,399
untrimmed

2956
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,039
before tax

2957
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:58,719
and just tops so all the smaller buds

2958
01:46:57,039 --> 01:47:00,960
would go for extract

2959
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:03,520
and then just the tops from the end of

2960
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:06,560
the very top and then the tops of the

2961
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:08,639
top ring of branches those tops

2962
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:10,960
at ten dollars an ounce

2963
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:13,039
that's cheaper than what most lp seem to

2964
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,880
be selling grams for these days they're

2965
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:16,639
very in the neighborhood you know i

2966
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,239
don't know the actual stats on whatever

2967
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,920
these are selling grams for because i

2968
01:47:18,238 --> 01:47:21,279
don't buy grams when i don't buy from

2969
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,118
lp's so

2970
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:23,920
i'm not saying i wouldn't try a few

2971
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:25,759
there's

2972
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,279
i would say two of them whose spot

2973
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,119
looked worth trying

2974
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:31,359
but uh and there were some positive

2975
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:33,279
reviews and then there's another three

2976
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:34,799
where i'd see some positive reviews but

2977
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:36,158
they didn't look all that good and i

2978
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:38,079
just thought they probably just have

2979
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:39,599
lower standards than i do

2980
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:40,880
but i'm not saying they're all bad

2981
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,400
because it looks like there's a couple

2982
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,840
of decent ones and that i'll give them

2983
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:45,519
that the

2984
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,920
but the outdoor will make them all

2985
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,040
irrelevant because the outdoor can grow

2986
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,279
back there

2987
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:53,439
is this good or better than any indoor

2988
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:55,279
as long as it's done well you can still

2989
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:57,519
screw it up outside i'm not saying

2990
01:47:55,279 --> 01:47:59,198
everybody's outdoor in ontario is better

2991
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,600
than all indoors that's not what i'm

2992
01:47:59,198 --> 01:48:03,759
saying but you know what you're doing

2993
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,320
you can grow better but outdoors there

2994
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:08,239
than you can indoors and

2995
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:09,599
in a good year too you could have a crap

2996
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:11,919
here but you know there's always

2997
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,800
exceptions to the rule but for my money

2998
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:15,920
i'm

2999
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:18,960
backing outdoor southwestern ontario for

3000
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:21,760
both flowers and extracts and i totally

3001
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:23,198
think i can do it at such a fraction of

3002
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:25,840
the cost

3003
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:28,000
and by the math i did a few years ago

3004
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:30,800
and i can't remember exactly how i came

3005
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:33,279
to the number but i had estimated that

3006
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:35,760
the country consumes five to six

3007
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:37,198
thousand acres worth

3008
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,159
considering

3009
01:48:37,198 --> 01:48:42,319
flower extract edibles you know all

3010
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:45,118
all sectors

3011
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:47,519
that five or six thousand acres would

3012
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:49,519
saturate the market in canada

3013
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:51,760
and it's

3014
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,440
it's a lot less

3015
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:56,400
than uh

3016
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:59,879
some people think but that's a lot 5 000

3017
01:48:56,399 --> 01:48:59,879
acres of grass

3018
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:03,198
and

3019
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:05,439
you know with the columbia project i'm

3020
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:07,039
looking at going a lot more than that

3021
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:09,519
i'm starting out with less than that of

3022
01:49:07,039 --> 01:49:11,760
course but once i've acclimatized things

3023
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,880
i want to work with for the ends i want

3024
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:16,239
to achieve

3025
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:19,039
i was really my plan is to get it up and

3026
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:21,839
i will leave it alone once i can get it

3027
01:49:19,039 --> 01:49:24,560
planting harvesting and processing two

3028
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:26,319
square kilometers a day

3029
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,480
that's my goal for

3030
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:31,359
the equatorial project because i want to

3031
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:34,479
come out with vitamin thc and vitamin

3032
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:37,279
cbt and vitamin cbn and have these

3033
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:40,079
things made so inexpensively

3034
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:42,960
that people stop looking at them as

3035
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:45,279
you know a rare drug for the rich

3036
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:48,319
and just start looking at it

3037
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:50,559
as a necessity for everyday people and

3038
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:53,840
all walks of life at any price point i

3039
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:56,639
want i want to make it as ubiquitous as

3040
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:59,360
you know aspirin so that you see

3041
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:01,118
you can get a reliable your aspirin is

3042
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:03,118
aspirin whether you get it in sydney or

3043
01:50:01,118 --> 01:50:05,519
stockholm it looks the same it tastes

3044
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:07,920
the same it is the same right and it's

3045
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:10,639
and it's affordable the poor people

3046
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,359
they don't say uh some days they might

3047
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:12,639
but

3048
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:15,118
overall

3049
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:16,159
many people can afford aspirin

3050
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:18,079
and

3051
01:50:16,158 --> 01:50:19,679
i don't think you should have to be rich

3052
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:22,479
to deserve aspirin

3053
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,000
you know that's just it shouldn't be for

3054
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:25,759
the top 10

3055
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
of the wealthy world

3056
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:30,000
it should be for everybody and

3057
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,599
and cannabis always has been from the

3058
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,840
beginning of time it's been the poor

3059
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:36,239
man's herb it's been the herba kings as

3060
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:38,719
well and the kings maybe got the

3061
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:40,238
dragon's tears pressed from the edges of

3062
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:42,480
their hatches

3063
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:44,158
but they and the poor people might be

3064
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:45,839
boiling stalks

3065
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:46,799
of low-grade

3066
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,319
plants

3067
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:53,760
but it's been there for everybody and in

3068
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:55,920
the middle east in asia in africa you

3069
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:58,560
name it cannabis has been there for

3070
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,880
human history for so bloody long

3071
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:03,360
and the absolute goal of politicians

3072
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:04,159
that feel they have a right to

3073
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:06,880
to

3074
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:09,439
persecute us for its use when it's one

3075
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:10,960
of the basic human foods you know it's

3076
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:11,759
it's everything

3077
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:13,279
it's

3078
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,880
you know i don't have to tell you people

3079
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:17,198
if you're listening to this show you're

3080
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:19,599
in the pot i know that

3081
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:22,319
and if you've listened this long you

3082
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:24,079
might be as crazy as me

3083
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:26,238
well one thing i wanted to quickly ask

3084
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:27,920
is you've made it pretty obvious that

3085
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:29,759
you're into growing organically but i

3086
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,920
wanted to ask what is your opinion on

3087
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:35,039
hydroponic and salt grown weed in

3088
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:37,279
general do you think it can ever compare

3089
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:38,719
you know what i've i've certainly done

3090
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:41,920
it all and

3091
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:43,039
and my best hydro i did uh

3092
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,118
you know

3093
01:51:43,039 --> 01:51:47,359
totally enjoy it and unleash the hell of

3094
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:50,399
it but it was using really clean pure

3095
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:52,000
nutrients too the most of the bottled

3096
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:53,118
nuts that come with coloring and all

3097
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,920
that

3098
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:58,000
i generally find that there's even with

3099
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:00,560
a two weeks of people flushing them in

3100
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,158
that i still find they maybe by the end

3101
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:04,719
of the joint jointer halfway they start

3102
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:06,079
to get this plasticky smell almost

3103
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:08,079
there's just something i don't like

3104
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:10,158
about it

3105
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:12,238
whereas and i'm not saying all organic

3106
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:14,638
grass is done well either because it can

3107
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:16,479
be over fed organic and not burned too

3108
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:18,480
you know there's not a guarantee of

3109
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:23,118
quality that it's organic

3110
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:25,519
but i never find the most exciting weed

3111
01:52:23,118 --> 01:52:28,559
not to be organic let's put it that way

3112
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:31,040
and i think you can grow fantastic hydro

3113
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:33,360
with with if especially if you're mixing

3114
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:35,279
your own salts and whatnot and you're

3115
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:38,238
really cognizant of

3116
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:40,960
leeching them for a totally sweet fade

3117
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:44,799
that they are burning really smooth and

3118
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:46,880
you get a true varietal flavor of each

3119
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:49,520
variety you're growing because there's

3120
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:51,679
no terroir and that's fine if you want

3121
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:53,840
that pure varietal flavor water is a

3122
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:56,239
great way to go i like it with the

3123
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:59,840
aquaponics because i find

3124
01:52:56,238 --> 01:53:02,959
it it's still that clean

3125
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:04,319
but a little bit more life to it seems

3126
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,840
to bring out

3127
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:07,118
more flavor

3128
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:10,719
and more

3129
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:12,880
layers even uh more subtleties

3130
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:12,880
it's

3131
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:18,079
there was a study a long time ago i

3132
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:20,159
remember reading in tom alexander's

3133
01:53:18,079 --> 01:53:22,399
growing edge he was the guy that

3134
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:25,039
published sense amelia tips until he got

3135
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:28,559
busted and since amelia tips really put

3136
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:30,639
me on the organic path for my second the

3137
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:33,679
second time i ever grew hot first time i

3138
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:35,359
grew up i read a book like a grower's

3139
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:38,000
guide or something and then

3140
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:39,759
by that winter before the next spring

3141
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,960
i'd found

3142
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:45,440
since emilia tips in like used magazines

3143
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:47,760
at the head store somewhere by them all

3144
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:49,678
and you'd read all these great blends

3145
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:52,320
from these old oregon hippies and that

3146
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:54,079
and be like oh i gotta up my game and i

3147
01:53:52,319 --> 01:53:56,559
could be adding a lot more organic

3148
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:58,238
components to the soil and what it came

3149
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:59,920
to mean to me was

3150
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:00,799
that if i

3151
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,440
fed

3152
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:05,920
one or two things to the plant

3153
01:54:03,439 --> 01:54:07,598
it was very apparent in the smell and

3154
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:10,239
taste of the grass

3155
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:11,279
if i used a little bit of a lot of

3156
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:13,439
things

3157
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:15,920
none of them dominated the smell or

3158
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:16,879
taste of the plant now case in point

3159
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:20,079
plant

3160
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:22,400
is what it eats it sucks up what it eats

3161
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:24,479
and some people will

3162
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:27,359
be skeptical of that and that's that's

3163
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:30,319
fine my experience is it's [ __ ]

3164
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:31,519
obvious if your nose works because i had

3165
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:33,198
a friend

3166
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,199
the guy i was just meeting at the time

3167
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:36,719
actually been we're friends for a long

3168
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:38,960
time since but

3169
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:41,840
he came into my apartment

3170
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:42,800
and to show me a half pound of weed

3171
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:44,719
and

3172
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,920
he was a friend of a friend and he came

3173
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:48,960
in

3174
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:51,520
and before he even pulled the bag out of

3175
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:55,118
his backpack

3176
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:56,800
i said do you grow with fish

3177
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:58,639
and he said

3178
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,239
what i said refrigerator i said do you

3179
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:02,639
use fish emulsion

3180
01:55:00,238 --> 01:55:04,959
because one of my friends

3181
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:07,920
at home was growing with straight fish

3182
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:10,639
emulsion and his weed smelled like the

3183
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:12,719
shitty ass bottle of fish emulsion it

3184
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:15,039
totally came through in the smell of the

3185
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:16,719
weed but you smoked it and so i asked

3186
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:18,319
this guy because i it just smelled like

3187
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,639
my buddy's weed because i could smell

3188
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:22,639
weed when he came in but i could smell

3189
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:25,279
weed with fish

3190
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:26,800
and not live fish but dead fish and i

3191
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:29,118
said this to him right as he was

3192
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,800
reaching in his bag to pull out the half

3193
01:55:29,118 --> 01:55:33,118
pound he's pulling out the half pound

3194
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,639
and his eyes go wide he says and he goes

3195
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:37,519
kind of white he's like

3196
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:39,039
why did you say that and i said i got a

3197
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,320
friend that grows with fish emulsion his

3198
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:44,840
weed smells just like yours and he says

3199
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:48,238
i put a fish in every

3200
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:50,319
hole you know he was just he was just

3201
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:51,919
he's like nobody ever you know people

3202
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:53,519
just have to go wow that's beautiful

3203
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:55,039
that's great grass

3204
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:57,599
you're the only person that ever said

3205
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:59,118
your weed's fishy you know and he

3206
01:55:57,599 --> 01:56:00,639
couldn't believe it so we hit because

3207
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:02,799
you know it was just an honest remark it

3208
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:04,639
wasn't wasn't trying to be a dick i was

3209
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,760
just being honest about it you know and

3210
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:08,159
uh

3211
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,760
but it's so funny the the way the plant

3212
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:12,238
really carries whatever it's like when

3213
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:14,239
you stick celery and red dye in your

3214
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:16,799
soda you'll turn red you think of the

3215
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:18,079
grass the same way is it will pick up

3216
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,079
you know it's built out of what's

3217
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:21,439
underneath it right it's not just built

3218
01:56:20,079 --> 01:56:22,719
out of thin air

3219
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:24,319
so the

3220
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:26,719
another time the

3221
01:56:24,319 --> 01:56:29,519
from the first year i grew

3222
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:32,319
i had a plant that i used

3223
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:34,880
um a bag with steer manure

3224
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:37,279
and that steer manure

3225
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,679
wasn't composted that long and later

3226
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:41,840
that winter when i was reading about

3227
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:43,920
how well composted it had to be and it

3228
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:46,400
couldn't smell still and it should break

3229
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:48,000
up really soft and it shouldn't be wet

3230
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:49,359
and sticky and smell and i thought all

3231
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,599
the [ __ ] i used was wet and sticky and

3232
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:54,960
smelled but i didn't even think about it

3233
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:57,840
until a non-smoker

3234
01:56:54,960 --> 01:57:00,880
at my girlfriend's house she had

3235
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:02,239
roommates non-smoker came into the room

3236
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,480
and said

3237
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:06,638
what is with that weed you're smoking it

3238
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:08,879
smells like manure

3239
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:09,760
and they were dead serious and they were

3240
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,520
pissed

3241
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,280
and i thought i was funny because i was

3242
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:15,360
naked i just laughed but i went and had

3243
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:17,439
a shower or the next morning or

3244
01:57:15,359 --> 01:57:19,759
something had a shower and when i walked

3245
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:21,598
back into the room it hit me because i

3246
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:23,520
just smoked a joint in there and my once

3247
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:25,039
i had a shower and cleaned out walked

3248
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:28,080
back in the room

3249
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:30,000
he's right it totally smells like manure

3250
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:32,719
and i realized that was because that

3251
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,560
wasn't composted well enough that manure

3252
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:36,800
so then i got really adamant about

3253
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,800
finding the oldest compost i could find

3254
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:40,000
and really becoming a bit of a compost

3255
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,279
nub

3256
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,840
and that made

3257
01:57:41,279 --> 01:57:45,840
that next year that pot that i grew the

3258
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:47,920
second year having done my homework

3259
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:50,800
after that first year

3260
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:53,520
it was so good i measure everything i

3261
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:56,480
see to this day against it you know and

3262
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:58,639
it was just so [ __ ] good and it was

3263
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:00,718
one of the things in about 17 things

3264
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:03,199
mixed in the hole but one of them was a

3265
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:05,840
generous helpings of 100 year old

3266
01:58:03,198 --> 01:58:08,238
chicken compost from a chicken shed that

3267
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:11,760
just got torn down and had been exposed

3268
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:14,319
to the it was just like ground

3269
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:16,800
soft sand almost it was really we had no

3270
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:18,479
smell it was kind of spongy and then

3271
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,560
hundred years they had a chicken coop

3272
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:22,879
there they hadn't had chickens in it for

3273
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:24,239
about 10 years and tore it down and just

3274
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:27,039
been rained on

3275
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:29,839
for a couple years and it was so good

3276
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:32,399
they were really really exceptional buds

3277
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:34,400
that i'll never ever forget

3278
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:35,598
the year before the first year i ever

3279
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:36,719
grew

3280
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,920
i

3281
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:42,239
had already done a bit more homework

3282
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:44,319
than my friends locally

3283
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:46,079
and one of them

3284
01:58:44,319 --> 01:58:47,599
his parents were okay they lived in the

3285
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:49,279
country and they said you can start some

3286
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:50,639
here let's take them away to plant them

3287
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:54,319
so he said okay

3288
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:56,800
so i had a soukretz tin with 2 000 seeds

3289
01:58:54,319 --> 01:58:59,920
from jamaican weed i used to get

3290
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,520
in cans from montreal from jamaican guys

3291
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:04,079
there and

3292
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:06,159
i had those 2000 seeds and i i went and

3293
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:08,238
planted them in trays and we

3294
01:59:06,158 --> 01:59:10,638
transplanted them into little four inch

3295
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:13,039
pots and we left them like that and then

3296
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:15,599
after once the time they were kind of

3297
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:17,198
2000 knee highs then his mom started

3298
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:18,639
going that's a lot of little plants i

3299
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:19,439
want you to start getting those out of

3300
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:21,760
here

3301
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,439
and so the one day i popped over to go

3302
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,639
grab one because they were just starting

3303
01:59:23,439 --> 01:59:26,479
to sex

3304
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:29,039
and there was one

3305
01:59:26,479 --> 01:59:31,598
that was really starting to

3306
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,920
show like a little cluster of pistols on

3307
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:36,800
top and it was just the furthest ahead

3308
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:39,359
of anything in the female department and

3309
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:41,039
i i just said i'm just going to take one

3310
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:44,479
you guys can have the rest of them and i

3311
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:46,479
took that one plant and dug a hole

3312
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:48,238
and planted it at the creek near my

3313
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:50,399
house and that was the first plant i

3314
01:59:48,238 --> 01:59:51,359
ever grew and that was from jamaican

3315
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:53,359
and

3316
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:55,920
it was the only one of two thousand

3317
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:57,198
seeds probably that even finished

3318
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:58,960
the rest of them probably wouldn't

3319
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:01,118
finish in canada but that one just

3320
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:03,359
happened to be a real early one a

3321
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,839
relatively early one and i've never

3322
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:07,920
smelled or tasted it again

3323
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:11,039
until a couple years ago

3324
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:13,279
when i first went to columbia and

3325
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:15,519
i visited some plants in a friend's

3326
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:17,759
place near bogota and greenhouses but

3327
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:20,159
the very then i flew

3328
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:21,119
to uh rizzarelda

3329
02:00:20,158 --> 02:00:22,719
um

3330
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:25,920
it's another department

3331
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:28,158
and that's a area that's known for punta

3332
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:29,760
rojo so i thought

3333
02:00:28,158 --> 02:00:31,359
oh i'm gonna see some punta rojo

3334
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:33,679
visiting farms in the hills here the

3335
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:36,079
first farm we showed up at

3336
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:37,760
i saw this plant across the yard it was

3337
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:40,319
a little shorter than the one i had but

3338
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:42,400
it's always 12 hours there and i knew it

3339
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:44,079
was the same flat from it from across

3340
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:45,920
the yard before i could even smell it i

3341
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:47,679
said oh my god that looks like the it's

3342
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:49,920
the same structure that first plant i

3343
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:51,359
ever grew and same coloring in that and

3344
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,440
i got closer

3345
02:00:51,359 --> 02:00:55,839
and it totally was and i could rub it

3346
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:58,559
and smell it and they're just like

3347
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:01,679
full circle you know i never smelled

3348
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:04,560
that i got whiffs of it in things but i

3349
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:07,199
never smelled that plant again

3350
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:08,960
until i went to colombia and it totally

3351
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:09,919
closed the circle for me because it was

3352
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,920
like

3353
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:14,319
holy [ __ ] that's the first bud i ever

3354
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:16,239
grew is punta rojo and of course lots of

3355
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:17,279
colombian seed ended up going through

3356
02:01:16,238 --> 02:01:19,198
jamaica

3357
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:21,759
so there's no doubt in my mind that that

3358
02:01:19,198 --> 02:01:23,279
first columbian stuff i had it may not

3359
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:24,320
have been pure

3360
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:26,639
may have been

3361
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:28,399
mixed with other colombian things or

3362
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:29,760
jamaican things but it may not have been

3363
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:32,238
it could have been

3364
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:34,159
pure food but it really that one

3365
02:01:32,238 --> 02:01:37,039
expression at least

3366
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:39,519
it blew my mind so it was really fun to

3367
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:40,479
to see that and and again as you get

3368
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:43,280
older

3369
02:01:40,479 --> 02:01:45,519
it's not always about you know

3370
02:01:43,279 --> 02:01:48,479
you only want the latest and greatest

3371
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:49,440
you get nostalgic for flavors you miss

3372
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:51,919
you know

3373
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:54,000
and hey it's not the strongest one punta

3374
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,639
robo it doesn't doesn't put the hurt on

3375
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,760
anybody just a nice light social smoke

3376
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:00,719
light buzz

3377
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:03,039
but very pleasant tasting and definitely

3378
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:05,359
you know you get stoned from it

3379
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:07,039
you just maybe don't get as stoned from

3380
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:09,279
it as you might from something else

3381
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:11,599
that's 30 thc

3382
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:14,158
but then again it's a question of degree

3383
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:16,159
because me with that 30 thc people are

3384
02:02:14,158 --> 02:02:17,439
smoking pinners of

3385
02:02:16,158 --> 02:02:19,839
and

3386
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:21,839
not the same bats or smoke into that

3387
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,679
other one either six and one half a

3388
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:26,480
dozen and the other you're still high

3389
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:28,639
everybody's happy

3390
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:30,319
yeah for sure it's it's hard to compare

3391
02:02:28,639 --> 02:02:33,279
right i just want to quickly jump back

3392
02:02:30,319 --> 02:02:34,719
though too the genesis story behind

3393
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:36,639
sweet tooth because i remember when we

3394
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:38,079
were able to hang out you told me and i

3395
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:39,599
was like man that's such a cool story i

3396
02:02:38,079 --> 02:02:42,000
need to get you to tell that one again

3397
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:43,199
specifically the the blueberry mail you

3398
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,880
were using

3399
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:46,638
yeah so the

3400
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,760
so

3401
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:50,639
of the

3402
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,840
1500 plants i had in my backyard that

3403
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:53,440
summer

3404
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:57,119
and

3405
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:59,519
i am going to say that was 1996 and it's

3406
02:02:57,118 --> 02:03:02,319
a bit fuzzy back then but i do believe

3407
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,199
it was 1996 that summer

3408
02:03:02,319 --> 02:03:05,920
that i

3409
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:06,799
did this big selection in the backyard

3410
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,399
and

3411
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:11,840
of this uh

3412
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:13,118
dj short blueberry seed that mark henry

3413
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,520
had given me

3414
02:03:13,118 --> 02:03:17,279
i think i had five seeds or six seeds or

3415
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,440
something and

3416
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:21,759
the females were no great shakes i never

3417
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:22,799
even kept one but the

3418
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,920
the

3419
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,520
male

3420
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:29,118
there was one male

3421
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:31,920
that had a hard purple top it looked

3422
02:03:29,118 --> 02:03:32,639
like a cluster of dark grapes pointing

3423
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:34,480
up

3424
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:36,639
really tight balls

3425
02:03:34,479 --> 02:03:40,079
but the amazing thing about it was it

3426
02:03:36,639 --> 02:03:42,960
had chromatic resin as they shawn like

3427
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:45,599
all bearings with a metallic chromatic

3428
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:48,480
look to them they weren't clear white

3429
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:50,960
amber cloudy they were ball bearings

3430
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:52,799
they were just shiny metal balls and

3431
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,560
i've never seen that before and i don't

3432
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:56,560
think i've seen it since

3433
02:03:54,560 --> 02:04:00,639
to see that

3434
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:03,760
real real metal sheen on those strikes

3435
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:06,319
and so that plant and and visually it

3436
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:08,880
was stunning with the green leaves

3437
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:10,880
dark purple flowers metallic resin

3438
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:13,279
glistening all over it i've never seen

3439
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:15,520
that present on the mail either

3440
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:18,960
and when you squeezed it

3441
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:21,760
you know it reeked of blueberry jam

3442
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:22,480
it smelled so good of blueberry jam

3443
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:25,520
and

3444
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:26,559
i had one of my three grow rooms in my

3445
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:29,280
basement

3446
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:31,280
set up that i wanted to seed so i was

3447
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:33,359
just gonna take the best male from the

3448
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:35,198
backyard that summer and go down and

3449
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:38,639
pollinate those and that's the one i

3450
02:04:35,198 --> 02:04:40,719
chose and that the top bud of that plant

3451
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:43,279
i actually dried

3452
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:45,279
with my coffee cups in the kitchen

3453
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:47,679
and then i smoked it in little bits in

3454
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:50,158
my bong because it was delicious it was

3455
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:53,039
like liquid blueberry pie filling with

3456
02:04:50,158 --> 02:04:54,799
every long hit it was the most delicious

3457
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:57,679
male i don't think i've even smoked

3458
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,599
other males that male it was like

3459
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:01,840
i'm smoking the top

3460
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,599
and i left the side branches

3461
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,520
to take took into the room in the

3462
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:08,480
basement that had plants

3463
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:10,239
four weeks in or something that were

3464
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:11,678
and that male went off a week or two

3465
02:05:10,238 --> 02:05:14,399
later

3466
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:17,440
and pollinated that room so though that

3467
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:18,839
male was responsible for fathering sweet

3468
02:05:17,439 --> 02:05:21,759
tooth

3469
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:24,000
shishkameri blue domino

3470
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:25,440
plum bud

3471
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,560
there was a fifth one but i can't

3472
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:28,078
remember

3473
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:30,719
those four for sure

3474
02:05:28,078 --> 02:05:32,880
and uh but sadly i didn't rejuvenate the

3475
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:35,279
male and keep it because i was really

3476
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:36,639
thinking of it at the time more as a

3477
02:05:35,279 --> 02:05:39,439
backboard

3478
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:40,880
because the other ones i wanted

3479
02:05:39,439 --> 02:05:42,158
to

3480
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:44,159
preserve

3481
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:45,598
those plants

3482
02:05:44,158 --> 02:05:49,039
and make

3483
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:51,840
that cross to the the mothers

3484
02:05:49,039 --> 02:05:53,118
to really try and stabilize

3485
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,679
a plant

3486
02:05:53,118 --> 02:05:57,759
representative of grapefruit for example

3487
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:58,719
you know and every i would try it with a

3488
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,320
different

3489
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:02,560
outcross

3490
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:04,319
before i did the back cross to see which

3491
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:07,360
ones i could

3492
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:09,359
get to making basically a pure sweeping

3493
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:11,839
grapefruit essentially that was three

3494
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:12,559
two three that was a cubed version of it

3495
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:14,639
so

3496
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:16,639
once you back cross it

3497
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:18,960
twice you square it the third time

3498
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:20,560
you've cubed it and assuming the mother

3499
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,118
you're working with to begin with is

3500
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,760
somewhat stable by the time you've cubed

3501
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:27,279
it you've got a pretty good

3502
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:28,560
representation of it it's not exactly

3503
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:31,118
the same but

3504
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:33,119
it's uh gonna fool most people even

3505
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:35,279
myself sometimes i'm sure i would find

3506
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:37,519
uh sweet two threes that would be

3507
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:39,519
absolute ringers for grapefruit but most

3508
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,360
of them were pretty much

3509
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:43,920
pretty much like grapefruit

3510
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:46,000
and any recessives you got were obvious

3511
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:48,560
because of the blue you know so

3512
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,679
it was a fun one to do that with

3513
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:52,480
um

3514
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:54,399
and i remember the first time i met dave

3515
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:57,519
watson he came up to me at the cup and

3516
02:06:54,399 --> 02:07:00,158
he asked me he said you read sweet 2 3

3517
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:02,719
to be homozygous he says i lurk on

3518
02:07:00,158 --> 02:07:04,399
overgrown cannabis rolled those boards

3519
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:06,239
he says i see what's going on but i

3520
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:08,719
don't post or talk to anybody but he

3521
02:07:06,238 --> 02:07:11,839
says i've been watching and i see that

3522
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:13,840
you made a homozygous strain and until

3523
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:15,599
that one the only other homozygous

3524
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,039
stream was skunk number one he says why

3525
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:18,078
did you do it

3526
02:07:17,039 --> 02:07:20,078
and i said

3527
02:07:18,078 --> 02:07:22,479
everybody's got a plant

3528
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:24,078
that they want to get reliable seeds

3529
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:26,638
from but they can't because they've only

3530
02:07:24,078 --> 02:07:29,519
got this mother so i want to give them a

3531
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:30,800
reliable backboard that they can make a

3532
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:32,000
cross with

3533
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:33,760
and then

3534
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,599
weed out of the cur the following

3535
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:36,880
generations you know because they can

3536
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:39,360
see okay

3537
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:41,440
this one looks like my

3538
02:07:39,359 --> 02:07:43,279
you know muslim bimbi not like sweet

3539
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:44,960
tooth so i'm gonna take keep taking the

3540
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:46,719
ones that look like them all in bimbi

3541
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:48,480
and after a couple generations they'll

3542
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:51,039
have weeded the sweet tooth out if they

3543
02:07:48,479 --> 02:07:53,359
want you know but they'll have

3544
02:07:51,039 --> 02:07:55,118
reliable seeds of their mullen bimbi

3545
02:07:53,359 --> 02:07:57,118
relatively speaking right

3546
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:59,039
so i just wanted to put something out

3547
02:07:57,118 --> 02:08:01,920
stable of course it's easy to knock off

3548
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:03,679
stable seeds they're stable but you and

3549
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:06,000
that's why most seed companies of all

3550
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:08,719
stripes whether they do corn or tomatoes

3551
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:11,359
or grass don't release stable seeds

3552
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:13,599
because a they're a lot of work and b by

3553
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:15,519
the time you get there anybody can copy

3554
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:17,520
them but for me it was like i wanted to

3555
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:20,719
put that into the commons

3556
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:23,199
and have people able to use it

3557
02:08:20,719 --> 02:08:24,239
you know to do their original work with

3558
02:08:23,198 --> 02:08:25,759
you know

3559
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:28,158
yeah it wasn't

3560
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:29,920
so when i see people that are

3561
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:31,279
just making knockoffs of it i'm like

3562
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:33,279
you're missing the point you know this

3563
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:35,679
is useful genetics for you to do more

3564
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:36,479
than just knockoffs with you know

3565
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:38,158
so

3566
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:40,479
i think a lot of people would realize

3567
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:42,158
that you know the this was segueing into

3568
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:44,000
kind of like how you had that joint

3569
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:45,920
experience with dj short and most

3570
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,760
notably producing the blue satellite

3571
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:49,520
which has gone on to have a huge cult

3572
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,440
following what was your recollection of

3573
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:54,400
that experience oh that was really fun

3574
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:56,399
yes so actually the first blueberry i

3575
02:08:54,399 --> 02:08:59,279
ever grew out was that mail

3576
02:08:56,399 --> 02:09:03,039
and while it was in flower

3577
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:06,479
dj was visiting vancouver and came over

3578
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:09,198
to my house and actually uh was able to

3579
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:11,118
see it in person and he was like you got

3580
02:09:09,198 --> 02:09:13,039
a sweet one there and of course he

3581
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:14,319
looked a little a little put out like i

3582
02:09:13,039 --> 02:09:16,399
was banging his daughter or something

3583
02:09:14,319 --> 02:09:18,639
but

3584
02:09:16,399 --> 02:09:21,039
he was okay with it you know he was uh

3585
02:09:18,639 --> 02:09:22,319
he was okay with it it was fun and uh

3586
02:09:21,039 --> 02:09:23,599
there was some mutual respect here i'm

3587
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:25,118
not just going to make blueberry

3588
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:26,960
knockoffs that's not what i'm trying to

3589
02:09:25,118 --> 02:09:28,559
do here right so i knew you'd appreciate

3590
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:30,639
what i was doing and

3591
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:32,960
and we both

3592
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:34,800
you know felt the same way and i've seen

3593
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:36,399
this with other breeders as they say

3594
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:38,159
why'd you get into breeding cannabis you

3595
02:09:36,399 --> 02:09:40,238
think we just want to make it easier for

3596
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:42,638
everybody to grow really good stuff

3597
02:09:40,238 --> 02:09:44,959
because we all believe that there's a

3598
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:47,199
conscious evolution

3599
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:49,198
waiting to happen in humanity and it's

3600
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:51,598
just a question of getting enough tasty

3601
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:52,399
joints into enough hands that people

3602
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:53,279
that

3603
02:09:52,399 --> 02:09:55,519
you know

3604
02:09:53,279 --> 02:09:57,519
it wouldn't normally uh

3605
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:59,040
break out of the mold might be tempted

3606
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:01,679
to by something that just smells

3607
02:09:59,039 --> 02:10:03,359
incredible they taste incredible and it

3608
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:06,480
shatters their

3609
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:08,639
their preconceived notions of

3610
02:10:06,479 --> 02:10:09,359
the world around us but so what happened

3611
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:11,840
was

3612
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:13,598
even we both believed in this potential

3613
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:16,000
evolution of consciousness through

3614
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:18,800
better cannabis for the masses

3615
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,560
and when i got over to switzerland and

3616
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:22,960
got set up and

3617
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:25,760
i was doing it over there

3618
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:27,359
he got in touch with me and said

3619
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:29,599
hey i really love what you're doing i'd

3620
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:30,639
like to come for a visit and discuss

3621
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:32,639
some

3622
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:34,000
some business making a deal i said sure

3623
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:37,039
come on over so

3624
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,719
him and his darling wife came over and

3625
02:10:37,039 --> 02:10:40,078
stayed at my place for bed and had a

3626
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:42,560
look what we're doing

3627
02:10:40,078 --> 02:10:44,238
and said he brought a contract with me

3628
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,119
for me to sign

3629
02:10:44,238 --> 02:10:46,399
and

3630
02:10:45,118 --> 02:10:47,519
said he um

3631
02:10:46,399 --> 02:10:50,799
[Music]

3632
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:53,119
that we should do some releases together

3633
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:55,760
for him to get royalties off of

3634
02:10:53,118 --> 02:10:57,679
that's awesome so i said that's awesome

3635
02:10:55,760 --> 02:11:00,239
i'm honored honored that you're happy to

3636
02:10:57,679 --> 02:11:02,000
do that with me you know so he sent me

3637
02:11:00,238 --> 02:11:04,718
over or brought with him at the time i

3638
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:07,118
can't remember but he got about a number

3639
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:10,480
of seeds into my hand including

3640
02:11:07,118 --> 02:11:12,238
this unreleased berry sativa line

3641
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:14,879
um the only one he'd released was his

3642
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:17,359
blueberry indica line so the

3643
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,920
blueberry sativa was really interesting

3644
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:22,479
one they had the squiggly leaves that we

3645
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:25,840
think of as tmv as lots of blueberry

3646
02:11:22,479 --> 02:11:27,198
does um whether it's dmv or not who

3647
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:29,119
knows but the

3648
02:11:27,198 --> 02:11:31,919
but there was that one and there so

3649
02:11:29,118 --> 02:11:33,039
there's the blueberry sativa there was

3650
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:35,118
the

3651
02:11:33,039 --> 02:11:38,399
moonshine

3652
02:11:35,118 --> 02:11:40,719
her blue moon shined

3653
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:43,598
um

3654
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:45,599
an old flow

3655
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:48,480
and

3656
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:50,319
maybe a blue velvet i but i might have

3657
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:52,799
just been the moonshine the blueberry

3658
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:54,960
sativa in the old flow and those were

3659
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:57,199
kind of his main

3660
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:59,520
three old work lines

3661
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:00,638
of seed that was old and not getting any

3662
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:03,280
better

3663
02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:05,359
and needed to be grown out

3664
02:12:03,279 --> 02:12:08,000
to do stuff with

3665
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:10,238
so he

3666
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
i said okay let me check them out and i

3667
02:12:10,238 --> 02:12:14,158
grew them out

3668
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,719
and of the flow

3669
02:12:14,158 --> 02:12:20,238
there was the most diversity in the flow

3670
02:12:16,719 --> 02:12:22,319
but my very favorites weren't the ones

3671
02:12:20,238 --> 02:12:25,759
with the nice yielding buds but they

3672
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:27,279
were this one with little popcorn nugs

3673
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:30,960
and it really

3674
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:34,880
totally smelled like chocolatey nepalese

3675
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:37,520
hash it totally had that nepalese hash

3676
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:40,078
aroma to it and the nugs were no bigger

3677
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:42,159
than popcorn there was no

3678
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:43,920
top bud to speak of

3679
02:12:42,158 --> 02:12:45,679
the top bud you could see if you look

3680
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:47,520
straight down on it you'd see a couple

3681
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:51,279
of calyxes

3682
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:52,639
and a cluster of leaves curling upwards

3683
02:12:51,279 --> 02:12:54,559
like a rose

3684
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:56,480
and from the side the bottom of those

3685
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:57,599
leaves were all

3686
02:12:56,479 --> 02:12:58,718
mauve

3687
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:01,119
and

3688
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:03,439
the insides would be dark green

3689
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:05,839
but it really looked like a rose and it

3690
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:07,839
smelled like chocolatey hash

3691
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:09,199
and i called it rosebud

3692
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,360
and i hid it

3693
02:13:09,198 --> 02:13:14,719
with a sweet the same

3694
02:13:11,359 --> 02:13:17,118
male as sweet 2 3 if i believe

3695
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:20,078
bx 2 bx2p1 the

3696
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:22,960
black rosebud was my favorite flavor

3697
02:13:20,078 --> 02:13:25,118
of any i called that uh

3698
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:26,800
that stuff we did together i named it

3699
02:13:25,118 --> 02:13:28,319
the joint project

3700
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:29,520
so i said okay we'll do the joint

3701
02:13:28,319 --> 02:13:31,279
project and i thought well i'll do that

3702
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:33,280
with dj maybe i'll do that with some

3703
02:13:31,279 --> 02:13:34,960
other breeders and sell them under my

3704
02:13:33,279 --> 02:13:36,479
joint project

3705
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:38,719
online

3706
02:13:36,479 --> 02:13:39,759
so the blueberry sativa

3707
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:41,920
only

3708
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:44,800
two of them popped

3709
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:47,599
and they were both females so there was

3710
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,719
no male to use again unfortunately would

3711
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:50,719
have been nice

3712
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:53,118
and because we could have kept something

3713
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:54,560
going with that but i used those two

3714
02:13:53,118 --> 02:13:58,238
females

3715
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:59,840
um both in a room with sweet tooth three

3716
02:13:58,238 --> 02:14:02,158
pollinations

3717
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:04,480
and in a room with shisha berry tree

3718
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:07,198
pollination and made uh

3719
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:09,439
blue satellite one and two is how it

3720
02:14:07,198 --> 02:14:11,198
started out and then

3721
02:14:09,439 --> 02:14:12,399
there were subsequent generations of

3722
02:14:11,198 --> 02:14:14,638
each of those

3723
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:17,039
but not very long and and relatively

3724
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:19,199
small amounts they never did a really

3725
02:14:17,039 --> 02:14:21,599
big production of those seeds

3726
02:14:19,198 --> 02:14:23,839
so they were always just

3727
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:26,239
a small section of an indoor room but

3728
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:27,279
never a whole green sweet two three i

3729
02:14:26,238 --> 02:14:29,439
made

3730
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:32,479
in a whole greenhouse the same with

3731
02:14:29,439 --> 02:14:34,559
louis legends ultimate indica

3732
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:36,638
and some blockhead i made some seeds in

3733
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:39,280
really large amounts once i knew these

3734
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:41,199
crosses work out really well

3735
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:42,639
we should make a shitload you know so

3736
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:44,719
then i would do

3737
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:47,039
literally like 100 kilos of seed or

3738
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:48,319
something of the line if i really liked

3739
02:14:47,039 --> 02:14:52,000
it and then

3740
02:14:48,319 --> 02:14:54,559
if i was still just in the early stages

3741
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:56,880
of it i'd consider it dating kind of

3742
02:14:54,560 --> 02:15:00,000
like not gonna marry her just yet but

3743
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:00,000
we're gonna go out again

3744
02:15:02,158 --> 02:15:04,719
and uh

3745
02:15:03,198 --> 02:15:07,118
i would spread them around the spice

3746
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:09,359
testers and that too and see see what

3747
02:15:07,118 --> 02:15:10,960
the what happened but the blue

3748
02:15:09,359 --> 02:15:11,759
satellites were well received and they

3749
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:13,359
were

3750
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:15,840
not everybody loved them and there was a

3751
02:15:13,359 --> 02:15:17,920
lot of variation in all dj stuff you

3752
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:19,760
know and he'd tell you himself there's

3753
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:21,440
lots of variation

3754
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:24,400
he never worked

3755
02:15:21,439 --> 02:15:26,479
he is the absolute opposite of dave with

3756
02:15:24,399 --> 02:15:29,279
skunk number one his skunk number one

3757
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:30,479
was bred to be homozygous the blueberry

3758
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:32,719
was made

3759
02:15:30,479 --> 02:15:35,598
to maintain populations

3760
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:38,239
so it was always a population seeding

3761
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:41,119
that he'd been doing and never trying to

3762
02:15:38,238 --> 02:15:43,359
dial it into one pheno so that's like

3763
02:15:41,118 --> 02:15:45,759
when you the two blue satellites were

3764
02:15:43,359 --> 02:15:49,439
quite comparable one was a little bit

3765
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:51,760
sturdier and uh nicer than the other one

3766
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:52,879
but the flow

3767
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:55,119
there was

3768
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:56,400
really quite a few distinct phenos it

3769
02:15:55,118 --> 02:15:59,198
was uh

3770
02:15:56,399 --> 02:16:01,118
like looking at an adventure mix almost

3771
02:15:59,198 --> 02:16:03,598
which was always popular to me that

3772
02:16:01,118 --> 02:16:04,880
rosebud stole the show and the

3773
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:07,199
moonshine

3774
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:09,359
was neat we did the same cross with the

3775
02:16:07,198 --> 02:16:12,238
moonshine with the

3776
02:16:09,359 --> 02:16:14,960
sweet tooth bx-2p1 and that was

3777
02:16:12,238 --> 02:16:16,959
moonshine rocket fuel the moonshine

3778
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:18,719
rocket fuel was out for a little while

3779
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:19,599
too but again it was kind of a one-hit

3780
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:22,000
wonder

3781
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:23,920
i think it got bought up by like one of

3782
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,078
our customers so it was maybe only

3783
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:28,078
available through heaven's stairway or

3784
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:31,039
one of the retailers

3785
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:33,599
so it wasn't widely represented like

3786
02:16:31,039 --> 02:16:36,478
just strawberry three or three two three

3787
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:40,079
those ones got to every country they

3788
02:16:36,478 --> 02:16:42,879
were selling seeds in large volumes so i

3789
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:46,718
mean there was so much shishkambari in

3790
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:49,518
spain you still see very in spain

3791
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:51,518
you know in places it was funny i had

3792
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:53,359
when i had the blue domino

3793
02:16:51,519 --> 02:16:55,840
in that first crop

3794
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:57,359
i had a customer

3795
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:00,478
in ottawa

3796
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:02,239
that uh really liked it early

3797
02:17:00,478 --> 02:17:03,920
and sort of was one of the first to

3798
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:06,079
throw out the four and said oh i really

3799
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:08,159
like this blue domino so he bought the

3800
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:09,760
rest of it and i never made another big

3801
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:11,280
batch of blue domino it was just that

3802
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:12,159
first f1

3803
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:14,239
and

3804
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:16,959
he bought the whole i might have made

3805
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:18,398
enough too but he bought the whole batch

3806
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:20,638
of whatever

3807
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:23,599
domino blue domino was out so it was

3808
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:26,159
only available from this store in ottawa

3809
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:28,880
so people in other parts didn't know it

3810
02:17:26,159 --> 02:17:31,280
at all but if i went to ottawa i'd seen

3811
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:33,759
like 20 different growers with it and

3812
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:35,599
just blow my mind to

3813
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:38,000
see how regionalized some of those

3814
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:40,239
strains were just because they weren't

3815
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,840
released widely

3816
02:17:40,239 --> 02:17:44,000
so it would have been interesting if

3817
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:46,000
there was more of it to see but if it

3818
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,000
stood the test of time but it may have

3819
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:50,000
stood the test of time around ottawa but

3820
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,920
nobody in vancouver's growing any blue

3821
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,679
domino i'm sure because it was all sold

3822
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:56,000
in ontario

3823
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:57,840
yeah well something along that note

3824
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,478
which has been of interest to me is i've

3825
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:02,558
always wondered what was the land race

3826
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:04,718
or maybe not land race but the afghani

3827
02:18:02,558 --> 02:18:06,079
that you used that went into shishkebari

3828
02:18:04,718 --> 02:18:07,759
like and because i think i read

3829
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:10,638
somewhere that you actually line worked

3830
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:14,000
it for a bit or is that not true

3831
02:18:10,638 --> 02:18:14,879
yes it did it was actually the only

3832
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,679
um

3833
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:19,279
line of only seed lines that i released

3834
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:20,318
with two mothers

3835
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:23,359
so

3836
02:18:20,318 --> 02:18:26,398
i would usually well every other one i

3837
02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:27,280
did was one mother and one female you

3838
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:30,159
know

3839
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:31,040
whereas with the shishkaburi i had

3840
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:32,478
two

3841
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:35,280
workhorse

3842
02:18:32,478 --> 02:18:36,638
afghans one probably an afghan hybrid

3843
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:38,960
but

3844
02:18:36,638 --> 02:18:41,119
very much on the afghan side

3845
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:43,518
but you see different afghans some have

3846
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:46,000
a little more slender leaves some have

3847
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:48,079
the real webby ones and then there's

3848
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,439
some that are just kind of thick medium

3849
02:18:48,079 --> 02:18:50,478
most of them are kind of the thick

3850
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:51,439
medium

3851
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:53,358
um

3852
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:54,800
they tend to be thicker leaves and

3853
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:56,559
thicker plants

3854
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:58,799
and the leaves are even thicker they're

3855
02:18:56,558 --> 02:19:00,239
not a thin leaf they're a thick leaf

3856
02:18:58,799 --> 02:19:02,558
like cardboard

3857
02:19:00,239 --> 02:19:05,439
but they're chunky plants they form the

3858
02:19:02,558 --> 02:19:07,199
basis of all indoor growing genetics and

3859
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:09,359
they add yield to anything that they're

3860
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:11,120
crossed with typically so

3861
02:19:09,359 --> 02:19:12,000
afghanis are

3862
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:14,399
you know

3863
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:16,398
they are to indoor what white is the

3864
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:19,199
rice you know it's like

3865
02:19:16,398 --> 02:19:22,239
the uh there is a red line and yellow

3866
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:23,359
line the red line had red petioles on

3867
02:19:22,239 --> 02:19:26,318
the leaves

3868
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:29,120
it was a little more rounded top and

3869
02:19:26,318 --> 02:19:30,959
chunkier bud but a little stouter

3870
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:33,439
and the yellow line

3871
02:19:30,959 --> 02:19:36,000
was quick to yellow as it got it went in

3872
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:39,280
to fade faster so it got very yellow as

3873
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:41,920
it was getting ripe and it was pointier

3874
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:44,960
and it was a little taller and frostier

3875
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:46,000
but still had that real

3876
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:49,438
raw

3877
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:52,079
mulching leaf afghan aroma and both the

3878
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:54,559
red and yellow were fantastic hash

3879
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:56,000
producers so for i was really into

3880
02:19:54,559 --> 02:19:58,000
screening hash

3881
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,799
when you grow seed crops you get a lot

3882
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,280
of hash as i the one thing about growing

3883
02:20:00,799 --> 02:20:06,239
a seed production crop that i love is i

3884
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:08,720
get to smoke every resin gland i grow

3885
02:20:06,239 --> 02:20:12,159
and still have a commercial crop without

3886
02:20:08,719 --> 02:20:15,199
selling a single resin gland you know

3887
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:16,959
i get spoiled with hash and collecting

3888
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:19,200
it over time i know some people think

3889
02:20:16,959 --> 02:20:20,559
hash from seeded plants isn't as good i

3890
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,439
know other peoples that think it's

3891
02:20:20,559 --> 02:20:22,959
better

3892
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:24,720
it's personal preference i don't think

3893
02:20:22,959 --> 02:20:27,199
it really matters anybody nobody

3894
02:20:24,719 --> 02:20:28,799
complained that hit that melty bubble

3895
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:31,439
but the

3896
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:33,920
but those plants have really large resin

3897
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:36,318
plants and crossing them both at the

3898
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:38,239
same time with that blueberry

3899
02:20:36,318 --> 02:20:40,879
you know in a good

3900
02:20:38,239 --> 02:20:43,039
chunk chunky rose of it if i had maybe

3901
02:20:40,879 --> 02:20:45,199
five types of weed or six types of wheat

3902
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:47,680
in that room for that pollination so

3903
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:49,040
there was a substantial amount of it

3904
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:51,600
um

3905
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:53,040
on that f1 at least and then it was only

3906
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:54,960
more after that

3907
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:56,399
they were so popular

3908
02:20:54,959 --> 02:20:59,599
the uh

3909
02:20:56,398 --> 02:21:02,639
the blueberry really elevated it so you

3910
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:04,239
were still getting a big fat chunky

3911
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:06,000
frosty bud

3912
02:21:04,239 --> 02:21:08,318
but you would get

3913
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:10,959
some more fruit in it and some more

3914
02:21:08,318 --> 02:21:13,600
color like instead of just being

3915
02:21:10,959 --> 02:21:15,599
all the same all of the green color it

3916
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:17,520
would have streaks of purple

3917
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:20,640
and instead of just smelling like

3918
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:23,680
mulching leaves it smelled like

3919
02:21:20,639 --> 02:21:24,639
a little subwa perhaps but very much

3920
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:27,920
fruity

3921
02:21:24,639 --> 02:21:30,639
you know so it was totally elevated it

3922
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:32,719
and still was a good commercial option

3923
02:21:30,639 --> 02:21:35,199
and the thing that any seed producer of

3924
02:21:32,719 --> 02:21:37,438
less times have changed but back then

3925
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,200
most growers really only interested in

3926
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:41,120
commercial seed the guys that were

3927
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:42,319
growing for their head were they were

3928
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:44,960
still out there but they were in the

3929
02:21:42,318 --> 02:21:47,920
minority so i prefer to breed stuff that

3930
02:21:44,959 --> 02:21:49,279
tasted fantastic or had a nice uplifting

3931
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:52,559
kick

3932
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:55,439
but most people really concerned about

3933
02:21:52,559 --> 02:21:57,439
yield and time and it's and bag appeal

3934
02:21:55,439 --> 02:22:00,720
because they're commercial growers so

3935
02:21:57,439 --> 02:22:04,159
any seed company at the time realized

3936
02:22:00,719 --> 02:22:06,559
that the market was for commercial seed

3937
02:22:04,159 --> 02:22:09,280
and shishka berry every year would

3938
02:22:06,559 --> 02:22:11,920
probably be 80 of the sales

3939
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:14,479
because it was the top yielding plan and

3940
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:15,280
people want the big heavy thing you know

3941
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:18,639
and

3942
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:21,359
it to me it was not my favorite flavor

3943
02:22:18,639 --> 02:22:24,239
of grass but it was one of my favorites

3944
02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:24,239
for making hash

3945
02:22:24,719 --> 02:22:28,959
it would yield maybe three times the

3946
02:22:26,478 --> 02:22:30,318
hash of the same amount of sweet tooth

3947
02:22:28,959 --> 02:22:31,919
trim

3948
02:22:30,318 --> 02:22:34,559
wow

3949
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:37,920
and the glands would stack up in higher

3950
02:22:34,559 --> 02:22:40,318
screens like you have a 220 work bag

3951
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:42,478
and then you got your 190 and 160 and

3952
02:22:40,318 --> 02:22:45,680
everything underneath it the 190 would

3953
02:22:42,478 --> 02:22:47,760
melt it would bubble big shiny bubbles

3954
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:50,559
like it was the resin glands were

3955
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:52,318
humongous on that i've never seen bigger

3956
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:55,199
resin glands than any other cannabis

3957
02:22:52,318 --> 02:22:57,279
actually so i did the red and yellow

3958
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:59,920
lines the f ones

3959
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:03,439
i kept them going and

3960
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:05,040
crossed them back together along the way

3961
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:06,800
and uh

3962
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:09,520
shishka berry three

3963
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:12,879
which was released from switzerland

3964
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:16,000
was a bit of a representation of

3965
02:23:12,879 --> 02:23:17,759
all three parents in one

3966
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:19,439
yeah okay so it's interesting you

3967
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:21,280
touched on that consumer point because

3968
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:23,359
when i was looking through the spice of

3969
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:25,520
life catalogue so to speak

3970
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:28,239
i like something that caught my eye was

3971
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:29,600
donk and the reason why was because of

3972
02:23:28,239 --> 02:23:31,520
the fact that like one of the parents

3973
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:33,680
was like kind of more of a cash cropper

3974
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:35,600
type of thing from the description was

3975
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:38,720
that your attempt to kind of offer a

3976
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:41,439
more commercial strain

3977
02:23:38,719 --> 02:23:43,279
yeah the you know what that was uh

3978
02:23:41,439 --> 02:23:45,439
there was a couple of spice releases

3979
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:47,359
over the years very few but a couple

3980
02:23:45,439 --> 02:23:50,079
that were done by a friend of mine you

3981
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:52,000
know or different friends so one early

3982
02:23:50,079 --> 02:23:52,909
on i had a friend

3983
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,478
that did one

3984
02:23:52,909 --> 02:23:56,719
[Music]

3985
02:23:54,478 --> 02:23:58,639
call it was a cross of mighty might and

3986
02:23:56,719 --> 02:24:00,799
heavy hammer and we called it heavy

3987
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:03,119
hummer so that was the first one that

3988
02:24:00,799 --> 02:24:05,599
was just lucida i hadn't grown but i

3989
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:07,200
left out under my catalog because it was

3990
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:08,800
from one of my best friends and i said

3991
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,000
yeah that's pretty cool let's put it out

3992
02:24:08,799 --> 02:24:12,559
there because he wasn't going to start a

3993
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:14,879
seed company or anything and then the

3994
02:24:12,559 --> 02:24:16,799
donk was sort of the same thing it was a

3995
02:24:14,879 --> 02:24:18,478
friend i had in the kootenais and i was

3996
02:24:16,799 --> 02:24:20,398
out visiting him and he was like hey i

3997
02:24:18,478 --> 02:24:22,398
just crossed this he's like what do you

3998
02:24:20,398 --> 02:24:26,159
think i was like i was like you know

3999
02:24:22,398 --> 02:24:28,398
what people love giant buds so let's say

4000
02:24:26,159 --> 02:24:31,840
we put it out let's do it so that was

4001
02:24:28,398 --> 02:24:34,000
one that i didn't read but i released

4002
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:36,079
okay cool do you ever did you ever

4003
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:38,079
consider trying to make a strain purely

4004
02:24:36,079 --> 02:24:39,359
to suit the consumer market or you're

4005
02:24:38,079 --> 02:24:42,318
just like look if something ends up

4006
02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:43,520
yielding big that's cool

4007
02:24:42,318 --> 02:24:45,039
well

4008
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:47,040
the consumer

4009
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:50,479
were the ones buying the big stuff from

4010
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:52,240
the growers so the the home growers that

4011
02:24:50,478 --> 02:24:54,559
cared a lot less

4012
02:24:52,239 --> 02:24:57,600
they might buy something like rosebud

4013
02:24:54,559 --> 02:24:59,920
now i put i don't remember exactly but i

4014
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:02,559
figure shishkaburi was listed and the

4015
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:04,239
grams per meter grams per watt kind of

4016
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:06,000
thing a little bit you know on the

4017
02:25:04,239 --> 02:25:08,398
higher side

4018
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:11,359
sweet tooth in the middle and most of

4019
02:25:08,398 --> 02:25:14,318
them in the middle whether it was the

4020
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:15,920
blue domino or blockhead or other things

4021
02:25:14,318 --> 02:25:17,840
the

4022
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:19,680
but the rosebud

4023
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:21,520
i think i put on a

4024
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:24,880
dismal for yield

4025
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:27,760
instead of you know heavy medium-heavy

4026
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:29,279
medium i put dismal beside yield on the

4027
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:30,800
description of it

4028
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:32,720
and people would say what does dismal

4029
02:25:30,799 --> 02:25:35,358
mean i say

4030
02:25:32,719 --> 02:25:36,879
maybe 50 grams of square meters 70 grams

4031
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:39,680
a square meter it's like oh my god

4032
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:41,679
that's nothing why would i grow that i

4033
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:43,280
taste it you know

4034
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:45,120
if you're lucky enough to smoke vagina

4035
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:46,880
but you're like oh [ __ ] i would grow

4036
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:49,920
that for the rest of my life just for

4037
02:25:46,879 --> 02:25:52,478
myself nobody's ever gonna become that

4038
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:55,040
to sell until it's wide open legal and

4039
02:25:52,478 --> 02:25:57,119
they can afford the economy of scale but

4040
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:58,960
a lot of the best tasting grass is the

4041
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:02,560
worst yielding grass

4042
02:25:58,959 --> 02:26:05,919
and that doesn't compute with the indoor

4043
02:26:02,559 --> 02:26:09,279
grower in a prohibition scenario because

4044
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:12,559
they don't have the luxury of finding

4045
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:14,560
the luxury buyers that will pay extra to

4046
02:26:12,559 --> 02:26:16,879
have something exotic

4047
02:26:14,559 --> 02:26:19,920
they have to have something

4048
02:26:16,879 --> 02:26:22,559
you know good looking generic bud it's

4049
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:24,639
got to be fat frosty and green that's

4050
02:26:22,559 --> 02:26:26,000
the basic parameters of what they need

4051
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:28,559
to sell

4052
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:31,040
they can't advertise it in

4053
02:26:28,559 --> 02:26:32,719
you know rich and famous magazines so

4054
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:34,960
that arnold schwarzenegger can buy a

4055
02:26:32,719 --> 02:26:37,599
thousand dollar grams of it

4056
02:26:34,959 --> 02:26:40,879
because it's that mark is not there yet

4057
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:43,680
when it's wide open legal and it can be

4058
02:26:40,879 --> 02:26:44,478
like an auction for domain roman econ

4059
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:46,398
tea

4060
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:49,599
like how many people get to drink a

4061
02:26:46,398 --> 02:26:51,760
bottle of romani domain romani conte not

4062
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:54,720
very many you know they don't make a lot

4063
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:56,719
of wine and as a result your supply and

4064
02:26:54,719 --> 02:26:59,438
demand dictates that that [ __ ] is

4065
02:26:56,719 --> 02:27:00,318
expensive and it's a luxury good you

4066
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:03,200
know

4067
02:27:00,318 --> 02:27:05,600
yep without a doubt like that too where

4068
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:07,600
you think geez there's only x amount of

4069
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:10,318
this bud now the people that think you

4070
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:11,760
can grow high quality bud

4071
02:27:10,318 --> 02:27:14,159
indoors

4072
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:16,000
are missing the point it's like they

4073
02:27:14,159 --> 02:27:17,439
think you can make high quality wine out

4074
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,520
of wine kits

4075
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:21,920
it's not high quality you you might be

4076
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:23,680
okay with it but that doesn't mean it's

4077
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:24,559
actually high quality

4078
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,239
you know

4079
02:27:24,559 --> 02:27:29,279
it's um

4080
02:27:26,239 --> 02:27:30,879
there's more to it than just

4081
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:34,239
consistency

4082
02:27:30,879 --> 02:27:36,159
the best tastiest things like that

4083
02:27:34,239 --> 02:27:38,159
have a year on it

4084
02:27:36,159 --> 02:27:39,039
because they're not consistent year to

4085
02:27:38,159 --> 02:27:41,280
year

4086
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:43,760
they're a product of that year

4087
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:46,479
and the year the

4088
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:49,200
the vintage of the harvest is

4089
02:27:46,478 --> 02:27:51,438
it's as important to outdoor

4090
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:54,079
you know as the variety you're growing

4091
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:55,359
let alone who was growing it or taking

4092
02:27:54,079 --> 02:27:57,600
care of it and

4093
02:27:55,359 --> 02:28:00,239
who was making sure it was cured well

4094
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:02,479
and dried well that year you know

4095
02:28:00,239 --> 02:28:04,879
like the same vineyard in france maybe

4096
02:28:02,478 --> 02:28:07,760
there for the last 200 years making

4097
02:28:04,879 --> 02:28:10,318
fantastic first growth in bordeaux that

4098
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:12,478
the winemakers changed every 20 years

4099
02:28:10,318 --> 02:28:14,799
over that time you know the vineyard's

4100
02:28:12,478 --> 02:28:17,920
still this famous thing it's not the

4101
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:19,279
winemaker at that point it's that land

4102
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:21,280
that land

4103
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:24,159
expresses

4104
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:26,640
the that variety the best

4105
02:28:24,159 --> 02:28:28,879
and that becomes

4106
02:28:26,639 --> 02:28:31,279
recognized with time

4107
02:28:28,879 --> 02:28:34,000
and some of that time

4108
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:36,239
is uh you know we're we're at a true

4109
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,559
renaissance in cannabis right now it

4110
02:28:36,239 --> 02:28:41,199
really is a mind-blowing time if you're

4111
02:28:38,559 --> 02:28:43,920
a cannabis lover to be alive like i've i

4112
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:46,159
can remember when i was sort of started

4113
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,600
campaigning for it as it were when i was

4114
02:28:46,159 --> 02:28:51,039
like 14

4115
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:53,040
15 in high school debates or whatnot and

4116
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:54,800
just talking to everybody well cannabis

4117
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:56,960
has to be legal it's just not fair it's

4118
02:28:54,799 --> 02:28:59,519
a verb it doesn't make sense it's part

4119
02:28:56,959 --> 02:29:01,919
of the planet like it just struck me as

4120
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:04,640
evil and wrong from a very young age and

4121
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:06,000
i never wasted a day not talking about

4122
02:29:04,639 --> 02:29:07,599
it with people

4123
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:10,079
but to think

4124
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:12,000
nowadays it blows my mind i was walking

4125
02:29:10,079 --> 02:29:14,559
into dispensaries

4126
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,959
like a year or two ago and i'd see

4127
02:29:14,559 --> 02:29:19,680
you know electric joints like pre-filled

4128
02:29:16,959 --> 02:29:21,279
disposable oil pens with sweet tooth in

4129
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:25,040
them and you just like

4130
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:26,960
if you had told me that in 96

4131
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:28,640
you know i would have believed i always

4132
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:30,799
believed cannabis would be legal but if

4133
02:29:28,639 --> 02:29:33,039
you had told me i'm gonna walk into

4134
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:35,199
stores one day and people that don't

4135
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:38,399
know me are gonna try selling me pen

4136
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:40,399
electric joints full of sweet tooth oil

4137
02:29:38,398 --> 02:29:42,639
i'm just gonna be tickled pink you know

4138
02:29:40,398 --> 02:29:45,439
i couldn't believe it it was just

4139
02:29:42,639 --> 02:29:47,599
like holy [ __ ] this is

4140
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:48,880
it's a whole new paradigm

4141
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:50,559
yeah totally

4142
02:29:48,879 --> 02:29:52,398
something that has come up in the last

4143
02:29:50,559 --> 02:29:53,119
few episodes which you just touched on

4144
02:29:52,398 --> 02:29:56,000
is

4145
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:58,720
the idea of terroir and more importantly

4146
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,959
how can we in this modern age establish

4147
02:29:58,719 --> 02:30:03,199
new appellations for cannabis what is

4148
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:05,279
your thoughts on that

4149
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:06,479
well they're gonna it's a excellent

4150
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:08,439
question and

4151
02:30:06,478 --> 02:30:11,438
i think it is certainly an

4152
02:30:08,439 --> 02:30:14,398
underappreciated aspect of is part of

4153
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:16,239
cannabis that seems obvious to me but i

4154
02:30:14,398 --> 02:30:17,358
know plenty of people you know they're

4155
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:19,119
still

4156
02:30:17,359 --> 02:30:21,040
learning their varieties and they would

4157
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:23,280
rather have that well leeched hydro and

4158
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:26,080
taste of pure varietal character

4159
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:28,800
absolutely got no problem with that the

4160
02:30:26,079 --> 02:30:30,959
but the thing that is

4161
02:30:28,799 --> 02:30:33,759
increased in the plant

4162
02:30:30,959 --> 02:30:35,839
is in the territory

4163
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,880
it really brings out

4164
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:39,280
more

4165
02:30:36,879 --> 02:30:42,559
and it adds something to it

4166
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:45,280
in a good way or a bad way you know so

4167
02:30:42,559 --> 02:30:47,680
some places don't have a great tarot

4168
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:49,840
wire for grass some places do and some

4169
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:52,880
they're just different

4170
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:55,120
and places with limestone and with a lot

4171
02:30:52,879 --> 02:30:58,799
of lime in the soil tend to give you

4172
02:30:55,120 --> 02:31:01,040
limier green buds that are sweeter

4173
02:30:58,799 --> 02:31:02,959
limestone sweetens grass is sweetened

4174
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:05,120
soil people that's how they describe it

4175
02:31:02,959 --> 02:31:07,839
sweetening soil limestone sweetened soil

4176
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:11,920
and you see it sweetens grass

4177
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:13,840
the different ph affects the grass

4178
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:16,318
a lot of people will turn it down at the

4179
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:18,398
end in the hydro system so the plant

4180
02:31:16,318 --> 02:31:20,879
shuts down and stops taking up so much

4181
02:31:18,398 --> 02:31:22,559
nutrient speech to their own there's

4182
02:31:20,879 --> 02:31:24,398
lots of ways to what you're trying to

4183
02:31:22,559 --> 02:31:25,039
whatever you're trying to do but

4184
02:31:24,398 --> 02:31:28,239
i

4185
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:30,240
i know between ontario and bc grass the

4186
02:31:28,239 --> 02:31:31,760
same varieties i can generally taste

4187
02:31:30,239 --> 02:31:33,199
which province it's from even if it's

4188
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:35,439
grown in rockwool

4189
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:36,399
and that's to do with the water not the

4190
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:37,920
soil

4191
02:31:36,398 --> 02:31:39,519
the um

4192
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:43,280
but you know if you think of a one

4193
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:45,280
design race is a good competition of

4194
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:47,760
the captain's skills or the skipper

4195
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:49,520
skills they're all racing the exact same

4196
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:50,398
little sailboat

4197
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:51,920
and

4198
02:31:50,398 --> 02:31:55,039
there's no

4199
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:57,040
technical advantage it's really just the

4200
02:31:55,040 --> 02:32:00,560
experience and skill

4201
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:03,280
of the captain and with a clone it i

4202
02:32:00,559 --> 02:32:04,478
would like to see competitions like this

4203
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:06,960
whereby

4204
02:32:04,478 --> 02:32:09,840
grower gets the same clone

4205
02:32:06,959 --> 02:32:11,599
and they might be in different scenarios

4206
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:13,600
but they're all going to bring you back

4207
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:16,318
a different bud as a result

4208
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:18,159
and if you take the same clone say you

4209
02:32:16,318 --> 02:32:21,279
took a clone of your favorite mullen

4210
02:32:18,159 --> 02:32:23,680
bimby madness and you planted that

4211
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:26,960
in one part of jamaica another part of

4212
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:29,439
jamaica another part of mexico

4213
02:32:26,959 --> 02:32:32,398
somewhere in california somewhere in

4214
02:32:29,439 --> 02:32:33,680
oregon somewhere in ontario i guarantee

4215
02:32:32,398 --> 02:32:35,519
you

4216
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:37,120
you're gonna be able to tell the

4217
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:38,399
difference you may not know where

4218
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:40,160
they're from but so you're going to be

4219
02:32:38,398 --> 02:32:41,599
able to say wow this one really tastes

4220
02:32:40,159 --> 02:32:44,318
different than this one

4221
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:46,318
often i find it is even clay like if

4222
02:32:44,318 --> 02:32:47,760
there's some clay in the soil you can

4223
02:32:46,318 --> 02:32:49,359
taste the clay

4224
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:52,079
in the herb

4225
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:53,520
and it is apparent and you know this

4226
02:32:52,079 --> 02:32:57,039
brings me back to

4227
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:59,200
uh another sesh with dj short early on

4228
02:32:57,040 --> 02:33:01,439
maybe the second or third time i met him

4229
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:03,840
and the first time i'd smoked his bud

4230
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:05,280
was that the milk veg at a cannabis cup

4231
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:08,000
in amsterdam

4232
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:10,399
and he'd brought or sent over

4233
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,600
a few a few of his buds from his

4234
02:33:10,398 --> 02:33:13,760
backyard

4235
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:15,840
and when we were smoking a joint of his

4236
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:17,840
flow and it was the first time i'd ever

4237
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:20,000
smoked a joint to flow

4238
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:21,439
and he rolled this joint up and passed

4239
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,680
it to me and

4240
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:25,680
i took one puff of it

4241
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:28,239
or maybe even on the dry tote maybe

4242
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:30,880
before i took a puff of it

4243
02:33:28,239 --> 02:33:32,000
um he might remember if somebody wants

4244
02:33:30,879 --> 02:33:34,639
to ask

4245
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,520
i had the profit whether it was dry or

4246
02:33:34,639 --> 02:33:37,358
lit

4247
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:39,280
and i said

4248
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:41,680
it tastes like beets

4249
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:44,880
and he just looked at me and smiled and

4250
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:46,479
he says i grew that in my beats

4251
02:33:44,879 --> 02:33:47,599
wow

4252
02:33:46,478 --> 02:33:49,840
you know

4253
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:53,359
it comes through whatever you're putting

4254
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:56,000
it in comes through so that flow had the

4255
02:33:53,359 --> 02:33:57,200
terroir of beets because it was touching

4256
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,520
beets it was

4257
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:02,240
coexisting with them and feeding off of

4258
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:03,680
them potentially you know it was wrapped

4259
02:34:02,239 --> 02:34:05,439
around the beets

4260
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:07,520
and it came through in the mud and it

4261
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:10,559
was the first tasting note i gave him

4262
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:13,040
was hey it tastes like beets and and

4263
02:34:10,559 --> 02:34:14,000
it did for a very good reason so he was

4264
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:17,040
quite

4265
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:19,520
um surprised but and he pulled out his

4266
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:20,880
flavor wheel had been developing and

4267
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,880
we realized

4268
02:34:20,879 --> 02:34:25,358
we were

4269
02:34:22,879 --> 02:34:28,000
both really into taste

4270
02:34:25,359 --> 02:34:30,800
we both we both loved good cannabis

4271
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,559
flavors and he's a really zen man and i

4272
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:34,559
always enjoyed his company i haven't

4273
02:34:32,559 --> 02:34:35,920
talked to him in a dog's age

4274
02:34:34,559 --> 02:34:38,559
it wouldn't hurt

4275
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:40,478
um yeah that's interesting i mean if

4276
02:34:38,559 --> 02:34:41,920
people haven't picked on it picked up on

4277
02:34:40,478 --> 02:34:44,398
it thus far

4278
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:46,799
clearly a bit of a wine connoisseur

4279
02:34:44,398 --> 02:34:50,000
what was it that uh inspired you to get

4280
02:34:46,799 --> 02:34:51,840
into wine and what's your favorite type

4281
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,000
well wine is a

4282
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:54,960
parallel universe to cannabis they're

4283
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,639
both

4284
02:34:54,959 --> 02:34:59,679
sort of mild flavorful intoxicants

4285
02:34:58,639 --> 02:35:02,639
and

4286
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:04,880
that enhance everyday life you know i i

4287
02:35:02,639 --> 02:35:07,279
enjoy wine as much as i enjoy cannabis

4288
02:35:04,879 --> 02:35:08,959
probably are damn close

4289
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:11,680
and i wouldn't really say i have a

4290
02:35:08,959 --> 02:35:14,879
favorite type but i like wine that's

4291
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:16,479
clean not dirty and i like it and some

4292
02:35:14,879 --> 02:35:18,318
people don't mind a little burner than

4293
02:35:16,478 --> 02:35:20,799
that in it i'm more

4294
02:35:18,318 --> 02:35:21,600
technical i like wine to be very clean

4295
02:35:20,799 --> 02:35:23,039
and

4296
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:26,079
i do like

4297
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:28,399
to try varietal wines i also love having

4298
02:35:26,079 --> 02:35:30,559
blended wines you know there's not a

4299
02:35:28,398 --> 02:35:33,119
right or wrong that way and it's not

4300
02:35:30,559 --> 02:35:35,199
even a red or white thing i appreciate

4301
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:38,240
every wine on its own merits whether

4302
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:40,880
it's a riesling or a chardonnay

4303
02:35:38,239 --> 02:35:43,039
or a pick pool or a column bird you know

4304
02:35:40,879 --> 02:35:44,719
my favorite white i had in australia was

4305
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:47,760
a column bird

4306
02:35:44,719 --> 02:35:49,279
from uh primo winery in mclaren bale i

4307
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:50,960
believe that was my favorite white i

4308
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:53,040
tried in australia and i was not

4309
02:35:50,959 --> 02:35:54,879
expecting that much fruit from colin

4310
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:56,319
bird i don't think anyone in canada

4311
02:35:54,879 --> 02:35:58,318
grows it i was actually thinking of

4312
02:35:56,318 --> 02:35:59,600
planting some

4313
02:35:58,318 --> 02:36:01,680
the uh

4314
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:04,159
but yeah i really enjoy wine and i

4315
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:05,680
really get off on learning about it from

4316
02:36:04,159 --> 02:36:06,559
people that have been doing it more than

4317
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:09,200
me and

4318
02:36:06,559 --> 02:36:12,159
i've been doing uh quite a while 15

4319
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:12,630
years i have made real wine

4320
02:36:12,159 --> 02:36:13,840
and

4321
02:36:12,629 --> 02:36:15,519
[Music]

4322
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:17,120
that's half as long as i've done

4323
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:19,359
cannabis but i've been doing it a lot

4324
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:20,800
more the last 15 than cannabis so i

4325
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:23,439
would say at this point they're fairly

4326
02:36:20,799 --> 02:36:25,519
even as far as terms of appreciation go

4327
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:26,880
and understanding

4328
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:28,479
the

4329
02:36:26,879 --> 02:36:30,239
the thing is i've got one friend who's

4330
02:36:28,478 --> 02:36:33,199
got a vineyard of different clones of

4331
02:36:30,239 --> 02:36:34,959
pinot noir and he'll make a matrix of

4332
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:37,439
barrels with really high-end french

4333
02:36:34,959 --> 02:36:39,839
barrels but you'll maybe use

4334
02:36:37,439 --> 02:36:41,840
four different forests with a couple

4335
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:43,840
different toast levels

4336
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:44,799
and you'll have like say three sets of

4337
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:47,120
those

4338
02:36:44,799 --> 02:36:48,639
of so there's three sets of the same

4339
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:50,640
barrels

4340
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:53,599
and then he'll take the three different

4341
02:36:50,639 --> 02:36:55,680
clones of pinot noir and put one into

4342
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:58,239
one set of barrels one into the other

4343
02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:00,639
set of barrels and one into the last set

4344
02:36:58,239 --> 02:37:01,600
so you might have clone five five five

4345
02:37:00,639 --> 02:37:03,840
and

4346
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:05,040
702 right there remember the numbers of

4347
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:06,559
the clones for

4348
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:08,960
the pinot but the

4349
02:37:06,559 --> 02:37:11,760
but the difference between each of those

4350
02:37:08,959 --> 02:37:14,079
pinots is apparent but when you frame it

4351
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:16,239
in the different oaks it gives you a

4352
02:37:14,079 --> 02:37:19,359
different perception of them too but

4353
02:37:16,239 --> 02:37:22,079
after you've tried them in all the sets

4354
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:24,318
then against this matrix of them that

4355
02:37:22,079 --> 02:37:26,239
it's really a lot of fun tasting and we

4356
02:37:24,318 --> 02:37:28,079
end up taking breaks to smoke a joint

4357
02:37:26,239 --> 02:37:30,478
and we end up blasted at the end of it

4358
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:32,398
we listen to music and it's all fun and

4359
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:34,799
we really have too much fun in our wine

4360
02:37:32,398 --> 02:37:36,799
cellars but the uh

4361
02:37:34,799 --> 02:37:39,519
but the flavors is what it's all about

4362
02:37:36,799 --> 02:37:40,879
to us and we both love the nose and the

4363
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:43,200
taste and

4364
02:37:40,879 --> 02:37:45,358
as you get to do it you can

4365
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:47,040
once you've done it enough blindfolded

4366
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:50,079
you could recognize those different

4367
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:52,720
pinot noirs now most somalias which

4368
02:37:50,079 --> 02:37:54,478
people think of as real wine experts

4369
02:37:52,719 --> 02:37:56,159
they couldn't tell you what clone is in

4370
02:37:54,478 --> 02:37:57,840
that pinot noir

4371
02:37:56,159 --> 02:37:59,760
you know it's a next level of

4372
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:01,600
appreciation you know

4373
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:03,520
they can tell you it's pinot noir they

4374
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:05,120
can probably tell you the producer the

4375
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:07,040
country the vintage

4376
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:08,319
but can they break down what clones are

4377
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:09,359
in it

4378
02:38:08,318 --> 02:38:11,119
you know

4379
02:38:09,359 --> 02:38:13,280
there's always somebody that knows more

4380
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:14,720
than you you know so it's really good

4381
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:17,120
when you can

4382
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:17,920
when you're humble enough to accept that

4383
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:19,200
and

4384
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:22,318
lucky enough

4385
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:24,399
to learn from those people you know

4386
02:38:22,318 --> 02:38:25,680
it's no point come out thinking you know

4387
02:38:24,398 --> 02:38:28,239
everything because you never learn

4388
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:31,120
anything after that you always keep

4389
02:38:28,239 --> 02:38:33,280
learning and if you enjoy stuff

4390
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:35,359
you know it's hard not to because you're

4391
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:37,760
obsessed with it

4392
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:39,520
yeah certainly certainly

4393
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:41,040
so just out of a little personal

4394
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,960
curiosity what's your favorite red

4395
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:44,960
that's what i'm into

4396
02:38:42,959 --> 02:38:48,000
oh you know i don't have one favorite i

4397
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:49,039
i rotate between between them like crazy

4398
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:52,239
like i

4399
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:54,160
i get uh i don't not like shiraz but i

4400
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:56,478
get tired of it quick

4401
02:38:54,159 --> 02:38:59,520
and really good you know i never get

4402
02:38:56,478 --> 02:39:00,559
tired of lackluster pinot can't take it

4403
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:01,760
you know

4404
02:39:00,559 --> 02:39:02,719
the uh

4405
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:04,559
but

4406
02:39:02,719 --> 02:39:06,239
i've been drinking

4407
02:39:04,559 --> 02:39:08,079
more south american one lady because

4408
02:39:06,239 --> 02:39:10,559
when i go down i take some wine with me

4409
02:39:08,079 --> 02:39:12,559
as gifts usually but i like to drink

4410
02:39:10,559 --> 02:39:14,239
some south american stuff when i go out

4411
02:39:12,559 --> 02:39:16,559
in the restaurant so i'm always ordering

4412
02:39:14,239 --> 02:39:18,239
carmenere or something like that i do

4413
02:39:16,559 --> 02:39:21,439
like carmen year

4414
02:39:18,239 --> 02:39:23,520
and i really love

4415
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:26,079
like if i had to pick

4416
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:28,159
one fine wine

4417
02:39:26,079 --> 02:39:30,159
which is kind of what you're asking

4418
02:39:28,159 --> 02:39:31,680
i think i would take brunello to

4419
02:39:30,159 --> 02:39:34,639
montalcino

4420
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:36,479
which is typically fantastic examples of

4421
02:39:34,639 --> 02:39:38,318
san jose

4422
02:39:36,478 --> 02:39:40,159
and it gets one of my favorite

4423
02:39:38,318 --> 02:39:43,359
characteristics

4424
02:39:40,159 --> 02:39:45,039
is red licorice when they smell like red

4425
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:47,040
licorice

4426
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:48,720
and some of my best merlots even they'll

4427
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:50,080
smell like blackberry licorice like the

4428
02:39:48,719 --> 02:39:51,920
purple licorice

4429
02:39:50,079 --> 02:39:53,439
oh my god if they smell like red or

4430
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:56,079
purple licorice

4431
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:59,280
i'm in love i have roses too and

4432
02:39:56,079 --> 02:40:02,559
brunello's one i often get red licorice

4433
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:04,640
and roses those are the noses i want

4434
02:40:02,559 --> 02:40:06,639
from red wine most of the time you know

4435
02:40:04,639 --> 02:40:08,799
i'm open to black cherry and you name it

4436
02:40:06,639 --> 02:40:10,478
but but overall

4437
02:40:08,799 --> 02:40:12,318
if i had to pick one like if you're

4438
02:40:10,478 --> 02:40:14,639
saying what's your favorite say if i was

4439
02:40:12,318 --> 02:40:18,478
stuck on the desert island i would want

4440
02:40:14,639 --> 02:40:20,559
a seller full of 97 brunellos

4441
02:40:18,478 --> 02:40:22,398
i was in switzerland when they came out

4442
02:40:20,559 --> 02:40:24,639
in 2002

4443
02:40:22,398 --> 02:40:26,639
and they were divine and i was supposed

4444
02:40:24,639 --> 02:40:28,719
to stockpile a bunch and save it for a

4445
02:40:26,639 --> 02:40:31,199
long time and or sell it back to my

4446
02:40:28,719 --> 02:40:32,840
local wine merchant and i drank them all

4447
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:35,520
way too

4448
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:39,760
young i could have anything back give me

4449
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:42,399
a seller full of 97 montalcinos

4450
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:44,239
there you go well i mean on a similar

4451
02:40:42,398 --> 02:40:46,478
point of you know high-end qantas

4452
02:40:44,239 --> 02:40:48,639
products i wanted to know your thoughts

4453
02:40:46,478 --> 02:40:50,239
on recently we've seen a small amount or

4454
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:52,318
maybe you might say a little more than

4455
02:40:50,239 --> 02:40:55,359
small but an amount of controversy

4456
02:40:52,318 --> 02:40:58,079
surrounding the recent sale of 100

4457
02:40:55,359 --> 02:41:00,640
eighths in the states do you feel like

4458
02:40:58,079 --> 02:41:02,159
there's room for the extremely high-end

4459
02:41:00,639 --> 02:41:03,599
cannabis market or do you feel like

4460
02:41:02,159 --> 02:41:05,680
we're forever better

4461
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:08,000
i think i think it's not even the tip of

4462
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:09,520
the iceberg yet because the very best

4463
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:11,120
producers

4464
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:13,439
historically

4465
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:15,279
could not make themselves known to the

4466
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:16,880
wider market people saw something

4467
02:41:15,279 --> 02:41:17,920
where'd you get that i can't tell you

4468
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:20,239
you know

4469
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:23,040
but once everybody's able to know

4470
02:41:20,239 --> 02:41:25,279
then the forces of supply and demand are

4471
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:28,640
going to drive the price of the best

4472
02:41:25,279 --> 02:41:30,560
stuff up and 100 each is the tip of the

4473
02:41:28,639 --> 02:41:33,199
iceberg man for sure

4474
02:41:30,559 --> 02:41:35,840
and i've got nothing against that if it

4475
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:37,520
was the only price for cannabis i have

4476
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:40,239
something against that

4477
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:42,640
but if you can go and buy a 20.8 beside

4478
02:41:40,239 --> 02:41:44,799
it if something's still decent

4479
02:41:42,639 --> 02:41:47,439
i think that's fair that's okay there's

4480
02:41:44,799 --> 02:41:49,599
only so much you know let the

4481
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:52,079
let the consumers decide if nobody will

4482
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:52,960
pay a hundred dollar eight it'll go away

4483
02:41:52,079 --> 02:41:54,799
you know

4484
02:41:52,959 --> 02:41:56,959
yeah well that's exactly what i've kind

4485
02:41:54,799 --> 02:41:58,719
of been thinking and the underlying

4486
02:41:56,959 --> 02:42:00,559
point of the discussion that i think

4487
02:41:58,719 --> 02:42:02,799
gets missed is that no one who bought

4488
02:42:00,559 --> 02:42:04,000
these eights was forced to

4489
02:42:02,799 --> 02:42:06,000
that's right

4490
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,478
that's a free it's free market and free

4491
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:10,959
will whatever you want

4492
02:42:08,478 --> 02:42:14,000
but maybe one day i'll sell 100.8 but

4493
02:42:10,959 --> 02:42:16,000
before i do i want to sell 10 ounces

4494
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,840
there you go well something which i

4495
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,439
think is an interesting aspect of the

4496
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:21,200
whole discussion is that there are some

4497
02:42:19,439 --> 02:42:23,600
people who say that

4498
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:25,600
we're forever as a market so to speak

4499
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:27,600
gonna be bound or we should bound

4500
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:29,520
ourselves by the fact that to certain

4501
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:31,520
people this is medicine do you think

4502
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:33,120
that that argument is going to be able

4503
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:34,960
to stand the test of time or it's a

4504
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:36,720
little faulty

4505
02:42:34,959 --> 02:42:38,559
i'm all for producing dirt cheap

4506
02:42:36,719 --> 02:42:40,959
medicine and i'm putting my money where

4507
02:42:38,559 --> 02:42:43,920
my mouth isn't doing it the

4508
02:42:40,959 --> 02:42:45,839
i'm there's a big difference

4509
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:48,639
between

4510
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:49,680
people that need the molecule as

4511
02:42:48,639 --> 02:42:52,799
medicine

4512
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:56,398
and people that want the sexiest bud

4513
02:42:52,799 --> 02:42:59,278
you know you can have medicine in a

4514
02:42:56,398 --> 02:43:01,199
you know a non-descript jar

4515
02:42:59,279 --> 02:43:03,439
it doesn't have to be

4516
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:06,000
the sexiest bud it can be a dropper it

4517
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:07,680
can be a pill it can be a potion

4518
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:09,600
you know a cream that you rub on your

4519
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:11,120
hands

4520
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:13,600
people want to buy

4521
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:16,240
boutique bud that's different than the

4522
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:18,960
medical market do medical people deserve

4523
02:43:16,239 --> 02:43:20,318
boutique buds absolutely but

4524
02:43:18,959 --> 02:43:22,079
if they don't learn to grow them

4525
02:43:20,318 --> 02:43:23,680
themselves they're going to have to

4526
02:43:22,079 --> 02:43:25,760
learn to pay for them

4527
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:28,479
and if if they're not happy with just

4528
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:30,478
the raw ingredient because mass-produced

4529
02:43:28,478 --> 02:43:34,159
field grown will make the medical

4530
02:43:30,478 --> 02:43:36,478
compounds very very affordable so if

4531
02:43:34,159 --> 02:43:39,359
medical is your thing

4532
02:43:36,478 --> 02:43:40,318
probably a tincture works for you

4533
02:43:39,359 --> 02:43:41,520
right

4534
02:43:40,318 --> 02:43:43,920
yeah

4535
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:47,600
so if tinctures can

4536
02:43:43,920 --> 02:43:50,478
my plan for first world pricing is

4537
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:52,239
i can keep somebody medicated on field

4538
02:43:50,478 --> 02:43:53,840
grown tinctures

4539
02:43:52,239 --> 02:43:54,959
for a dollar a day

4540
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:57,200
retail

4541
02:43:54,959 --> 02:43:59,759
so if all the patients

4542
02:43:57,200 --> 02:44:01,920
can be covered for a dollar a day

4543
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:05,120
that's gonna work for all but the

4544
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:07,279
absolute poorest humans you know

4545
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:09,600
it's going to work for most of the

4546
02:44:07,279 --> 02:44:11,040
humans that have access to any sort of

4547
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:12,559
pharmaceutical

4548
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:15,200
you know

4549
02:44:12,559 --> 02:44:17,119
yeah definitely if you can buy it

4550
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:19,439
you should be able to buy cannabis and

4551
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:21,840
it shouldn't be reserved for the rich

4552
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:24,239
but that's not to say that boutique bud

4553
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:27,040
can't be for the rich that absolutely

4554
02:44:24,239 --> 02:44:28,799
can be and it always has been

4555
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:31,040
yeah definitely

4556
02:44:28,799 --> 02:44:32,959
so just to wrap up our kind of little

4557
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:35,200
discussion of talking around the world

4558
02:44:32,959 --> 02:44:37,039
the different terroirs and whatnot

4559
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:38,720
as we've referenced a few times already

4560
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:40,880
recently you were down under and you're

4561
02:44:38,719 --> 02:44:42,639
also in a few other places what was your

4562
02:44:40,879 --> 02:44:47,278
impression of the various cannabis

4563
02:44:42,639 --> 02:44:49,439
scenes and places where you stopped in

4564
02:44:47,279 --> 02:44:51,120
well i can tell that there's an

4565
02:44:49,439 --> 02:44:55,040
appreciation

4566
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:58,000
amongst many aussies for cannabis

4567
02:44:55,040 --> 02:45:02,080
and there is an absolute ignorance about

4568
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:04,318
it by the majority so democracy is greek

4569
02:45:02,079 --> 02:45:06,639
for oppressing minorities i believe it's

4570
02:45:04,318 --> 02:45:09,760
the translation but that like

4571
02:45:06,639 --> 02:45:11,680
but the but as a minority cannabis

4572
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:14,239
lovers in australia face an uphill

4573
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:17,359
battle because they have a

4574
02:45:14,239 --> 02:45:18,799
very authoritarian regime descended from

4575
02:45:17,359 --> 02:45:20,239
the queen

4576
02:45:18,799 --> 02:45:21,039
and

4577
02:45:20,239 --> 02:45:23,760
they

4578
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:25,439
really are not nice about cannabis in

4579
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:28,000
australia overall

4580
02:45:25,439 --> 02:45:30,079
and you and many others recommended i

4581
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,920
don't travel with any even domestically

4582
02:45:30,079 --> 02:45:33,439
which i never even think about in canada

4583
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:35,279
i just threw it in my bag and the way i

4584
02:45:33,439 --> 02:45:36,960
go but um

4585
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:39,120
down there you guys told me not to

4586
02:45:36,959 --> 02:45:40,559
travel domestically with it and i didn't

4587
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:42,160
and i'm glad i didn't because everywhere

4588
02:45:40,559 --> 02:45:44,079
i went i heard the same thing say oh

4589
02:45:42,159 --> 02:45:45,279
don't bring it in your bag you won't get

4590
02:45:44,079 --> 02:45:48,159
there with it

4591
02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:49,840
so it was uh it was kind of hard for me

4592
02:45:48,159 --> 02:45:51,439
and a little bit sad to go back to

4593
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:53,840
seeing it

4594
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:55,840
um where people were

4595
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:58,398
had to be a lot more covert about it

4596
02:45:55,840 --> 02:46:01,040
still and it took me back in in a way it

4597
02:45:58,398 --> 02:46:02,879
was kind of a an amusing nostalgia but

4598
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:04,319
it was disappointing at the same time

4599
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:07,119
because i know there's

4600
02:46:04,318 --> 02:46:08,879
solid people keeping it real

4601
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:10,640
case and point yourself

4602
02:46:08,879 --> 02:46:13,519
but you know you still gotta mind your

4603
02:46:10,639 --> 02:46:15,358
p's and q's to not have the neighbor

4604
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:17,600
turn you in you know

4605
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:19,520
it's all uh

4606
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:21,200
it's hard you know in the world you

4607
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:24,239
think of people getting death penalties

4608
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:26,640
for cannabis and stuff it's just too

4609
02:46:24,239 --> 02:46:28,879
much you know why do people feel that

4610
02:46:26,639 --> 02:46:31,439
entitled to rule us i don't get it i

4611
02:46:28,879 --> 02:46:33,759
don't uh i don't consent to be ruled and

4612
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:34,800
happy

4613
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:35,600
definitely

4614
02:46:34,799 --> 02:46:37,119
so

4615
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:38,318
one thing i wanted to quickly ask you

4616
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:40,079
because i should have said it earlier

4617
02:46:38,318 --> 02:46:41,760
but it slipped my mind you mentioned

4618
02:46:40,079 --> 02:46:43,200
blockhead and i think you you know kind

4619
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:44,960
of talking about boating how he was

4620
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:46,319
using the stuff

4621
02:46:44,959 --> 02:46:48,159
one of the things i found interesting

4622
02:46:46,318 --> 02:46:50,559
about that was i think a lot of people

4623
02:46:48,159 --> 02:46:52,559
would have got exposure to blockhead

4624
02:46:50,559 --> 02:46:54,959
through snow lotus because i think that

4625
02:46:52,559 --> 02:46:57,119
you know got a lot of traction

4626
02:46:54,959 --> 02:46:59,199
so yeah how did you feel about that when

4627
02:46:57,120 --> 02:47:01,040
you realized that there was that was

4628
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:02,720
incorporated and then it was taking off

4629
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:03,760
in its own right the snow lotus so to

4630
02:47:02,719 --> 02:47:06,159
speak

4631
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:07,920
that that i loved that i love i want

4632
02:47:06,159 --> 02:47:09,279
people to use them in their own stuff

4633
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:10,879
that's what it's for

4634
02:47:09,279 --> 02:47:12,159
and i want and i love to see their

4635
02:47:10,879 --> 02:47:13,599
recognition when they say hey i mean

4636
02:47:12,159 --> 02:47:15,039
there's snow lotus it's half blockhead

4637
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:16,880
and a half whatever else

4638
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:18,319
that's cool that's cool this [ __ ] i got

4639
02:47:16,879 --> 02:47:21,278
no problem with that even if you want to

4640
02:47:18,318 --> 02:47:23,760
make straight up lock off knock heads if

4641
02:47:21,279 --> 02:47:25,680
you call them square dome

4642
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:27,279
and put block head in brackets say i

4643
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:29,200
made this from a block head back

4644
02:47:27,279 --> 02:47:31,920
crossbar that's cool too i have no

4645
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:34,880
problem with that it's just when if i if

4646
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:36,639
there's a potential for customers to be

4647
02:47:34,879 --> 02:47:38,159
confused down the road

4648
02:47:36,639 --> 02:47:40,318
which they have if they have the

4649
02:47:38,159 --> 02:47:42,398
authentic one or they've got this next

4650
02:47:40,318 --> 02:47:43,760
version of it you know

4651
02:47:42,398 --> 02:47:46,879
that that can

4652
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:49,760
that leads to confusion that bothers me

4653
02:47:46,879 --> 02:47:50,879
i've got absolutely no problem and i do

4654
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:52,719
wish the

4655
02:47:50,879 --> 02:47:55,358
guy all the best because i know when i

4656
02:47:52,719 --> 02:47:57,358
didn't talk to him ever directly but i

4657
02:47:55,359 --> 02:47:58,960
know his uh

4658
02:47:57,359 --> 02:48:00,479
his friends

4659
02:47:58,959 --> 02:48:02,799
were speaking for him and were

4660
02:48:00,478 --> 02:48:04,719
apologetic and and said uh

4661
02:48:02,799 --> 02:48:06,639
don't worry the guy's gonna discontinue

4662
02:48:04,719 --> 02:48:08,398
that he'd give you the rest of the cs

4663
02:48:06,639 --> 02:48:10,000
but i don't want anything from him

4664
02:48:08,398 --> 02:48:11,599
i'm happy he doesn't have to stop

4665
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:13,680
selling them i'd rather you just change

4666
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:16,479
the name and you can still call it

4667
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:18,239
blockhead back cross in brackets it's

4668
02:48:16,478 --> 02:48:20,398
what it is that's fine

4669
02:48:18,239 --> 02:48:22,318
but call it something that identifies it

4670
02:48:20,398 --> 02:48:23,039
as yours so that when other people get

4671
02:48:22,318 --> 02:48:24,799
it

4672
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:26,399
they don't see

4673
02:48:24,799 --> 02:48:27,920
oh well this isn't the same as the

4674
02:48:26,398 --> 02:48:30,959
blockhead i had the first time or

4675
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:32,398
whatever you know i'm not trying i'm

4676
02:48:30,959 --> 02:48:34,239
really not trying to be a dick about it

4677
02:48:32,398 --> 02:48:35,920
i just want people to you know it's

4678
02:48:34,239 --> 02:48:37,600
really cool when they respect the

4679
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:40,000
origins of what they're using i always

4680
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:42,399
tried to do that myself but i always

4681
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:46,478
gave stuff an original name too

4682
02:48:42,398 --> 02:48:48,879
because what you release is yours

4683
02:48:46,478 --> 02:48:51,039
yeah not mine you know

4684
02:48:48,879 --> 02:48:53,039
so i mean on the topic of blockhead i

4685
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:55,040
did want to ask it's one of those ones

4686
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:57,279
which also has or at least online it

4687
02:48:55,040 --> 02:48:58,880
commonly says that it uses an unknown

4688
02:48:57,279 --> 02:49:01,439
strain as one of the parents are you

4689
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:04,000
ever tell us a little bit about that one

4690
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:07,200
it was the same father as the sweet two

4691
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:08,959
three dx2p1 which is the most stable

4692
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:11,920
male i had for

4693
02:49:08,959 --> 02:49:14,559
hitting anything and really a vigorous

4694
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:17,520
specimen it had very thick dark green

4695
02:49:14,559 --> 02:49:20,879
leaves it was pretty much impervious to

4696
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:23,920
mildew it was just a real champion of a

4697
02:49:20,879 --> 02:49:27,438
dad that one but i used that one on a

4698
02:49:23,920 --> 02:49:28,478
product 19 which came from a american

4699
02:49:27,439 --> 02:49:30,239
grower

4700
02:49:28,478 --> 02:49:33,039
named seuss

4701
02:49:30,239 --> 02:49:35,600
and he was in vancouver for a while he

4702
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:37,600
came up from oregon and he had

4703
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:40,559
a couple of his own strains and he kept

4704
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:42,800
them close to himself and he sold the

4705
02:49:40,559 --> 02:49:45,039
bud downtown once in a while and some

4706
02:49:42,799 --> 02:49:46,799
people would get a seat or whatnot

4707
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:48,880
and um

4708
02:49:46,799 --> 02:49:51,039
this one guy that claimed to have done

4709
02:49:48,879 --> 02:49:53,519
some trimming for him

4710
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:55,439
owed me some money and he

4711
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:57,600
came by and said well i don't have that

4712
02:49:55,439 --> 02:49:59,520
money i owe you but i got paid in seeds

4713
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:01,520
from trimming for seuss so he says if

4714
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:03,279
you want i would uh

4715
02:50:01,520 --> 02:50:05,120
i could pay you back in seeds and he'd

4716
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:06,800
owe me money for a long time i didn't

4717
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:07,920
even know if the seeds were really from

4718
02:50:06,799 --> 02:50:09,840
caesar

4719
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:11,840
i just said you know what let's see what

4720
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:14,079
have you got but so i just took the

4721
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:16,478
seeds in lieu of the dead

4722
02:50:14,079 --> 02:50:18,719
and i didn't grow them out in canada but

4723
02:50:16,478 --> 02:50:22,000
i took them with me to switzerland

4724
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:24,559
and there was two kinds there was a bks

4725
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:26,478
which was like big korean skunk

4726
02:50:24,559 --> 02:50:29,519
and i never actually did anything with

4727
02:50:26,478 --> 02:50:31,119
that i think the seeds got stolen even

4728
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:34,560
the um

4729
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:37,200
and the other one was product 19 or p19

4730
02:50:34,559 --> 02:50:39,840
for short that was the unknown mother if

4731
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:43,359
anywhere says it was unknown

4732
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:44,880
it was the p19 product 19 or project 19.

4733
02:50:43,359 --> 02:50:47,520
i was never clear on it you just always

4734
02:50:44,879 --> 02:50:49,679
called it p19 whether it was project or

4735
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:52,239
product i wasn't clear on

4736
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:54,159
but it was really weird dude the guy was

4737
02:50:52,239 --> 02:50:56,398
a super weird dude

4738
02:50:54,159 --> 02:50:58,959
and i was always under

4739
02:50:56,398 --> 02:51:02,079
you know i was always wondering

4740
02:50:58,959 --> 02:51:04,799
if it was the grass that made him weird

4741
02:51:02,079 --> 02:51:07,520
or if he made his grass weird because

4742
02:51:04,799 --> 02:51:09,840
his vibe because he had a weird vibe to

4743
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:11,200
him but his grass did too so you smoke

4744
02:51:09,840 --> 02:51:13,120
his grass and

4745
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:15,600
it was really

4746
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:17,520
strong but almost off-putting for a lot

4747
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:19,520
of people and i know people would say i

4748
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:22,239
smoked that i was looking out the

4749
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:25,520
curtains like paranoid and winging out

4750
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:27,760
like some people really got a wig out on

4751
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:29,520
some of the streams so it was really

4752
02:51:27,760 --> 02:51:31,200
unusual stuff and it was totally

4753
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:33,680
unrelated to everything else in my

4754
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:36,560
stable and so i planted those and i

4755
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:38,800
found one really sharp mother out of it

4756
02:51:36,559 --> 02:51:39,760
that i liked better than the rest

4757
02:51:38,799 --> 02:51:42,318
and

4758
02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:45,200
she was a big chunky frosty thing and it

4759
02:51:42,318 --> 02:51:47,680
had a very unusual aroma

4760
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:50,479
almost uh vinyl

4761
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:53,040
like you know sometimes a reasoning has

4762
02:51:50,478 --> 02:51:55,278
a vinyl smell it was very similar to

4763
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:58,160
that it had this uh

4764
02:51:55,279 --> 02:51:59,439
you know kind of an artificial

4765
02:51:58,159 --> 02:52:01,680
and the

4766
02:51:59,439 --> 02:52:04,960
and the quality of the resin was very

4767
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:07,840
unusual too it was extremely greasy

4768
02:52:04,959 --> 02:52:09,599
and when you made bubble hash from it

4769
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:11,680
it actually

4770
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:13,279
would when you put the hash on the

4771
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:15,439
drying screens

4772
02:52:13,279 --> 02:52:18,159
it would melt through the drying screens

4773
02:52:15,439 --> 02:52:20,239
even if you put it on like a 15 when you

4774
02:52:18,159 --> 02:52:22,079
went to pick it up it was stuck to

4775
02:52:20,239 --> 02:52:23,840
whatever was underneath it

4776
02:52:22,079 --> 02:52:27,200
and you just couldn't handle it unless

4777
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:29,680
it was frozen it was really the

4778
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:32,079
greasiest resin i've ever seen

4779
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:34,398
it was really unusual

4780
02:52:32,079 --> 02:52:36,000
and it was always a certain color like

4781
02:52:34,398 --> 02:52:38,719
um

4782
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:40,159
yeah bizarre but it was strong and it

4783
02:52:38,719 --> 02:52:42,000
definitely uh

4784
02:52:40,159 --> 02:52:43,439
it put the wig out on a lot of people i

4785
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:45,600
think

4786
02:52:43,439 --> 02:52:47,520
it routinely i've never had

4787
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:49,600
tested in the lab but i would see

4788
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:50,560
growers in the states that had access to

4789
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:52,479
testing

4790
02:52:50,559 --> 02:52:54,318
and they would post results of it

4791
02:52:52,478 --> 02:52:57,119
cracking 30

4792
02:52:54,318 --> 02:52:58,000
every time basically every time i saw

4793
02:52:57,120 --> 02:53:02,479
uh

4794
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:05,600
a block heads analysis it was over 30

4795
02:53:02,478 --> 02:53:09,039
so that's you know not extremely common

4796
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:11,439
and it particularly wasn't 20 years ago

4797
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:13,840
yeah okay i just wanted to bring up a

4798
02:53:11,439 --> 02:53:16,479
comment made by one of our past guests

4799
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:18,318
char bud of 707 seed bank i think i've

4800
02:53:16,478 --> 02:53:19,679
seen you even you know kind of briefly

4801
02:53:18,318 --> 02:53:20,719
interacting with him in the comments but

4802
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:22,639
he's

4803
02:53:20,719 --> 02:53:24,719
um played with the block head a little

4804
02:53:22,639 --> 02:53:26,478
bit doing some various filial projects

4805
02:53:24,719 --> 02:53:28,719
and whatnot and a comment he made which

4806
02:53:26,478 --> 02:53:30,799
really grabbed my attention was he said

4807
02:53:28,719 --> 02:53:32,879
all of breda steve's stuff

4808
02:53:30,799 --> 02:53:34,879
you grow it outdoors but it looks like

4809
02:53:32,879 --> 02:53:36,318
it's indoors and he said it's like all

4810
02:53:34,879 --> 02:53:37,759
these strains are like that and you just

4811
02:53:36,318 --> 02:53:39,920
you never see that across a lot of

4812
02:53:37,760 --> 02:53:41,520
breeders have you heard that comment

4813
02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:43,040
yourself and if so like why do you think

4814
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:44,560
that's all the time

4815
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:47,600
and i know why that's the case and i

4816
02:53:44,559 --> 02:53:49,920
told you earlier was uh i always do a

4817
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:51,600
selection round outside every year and

4818
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:54,000
then two inside

4819
02:53:51,600 --> 02:53:56,159
so there was always

4820
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:58,398
every year every strain was being

4821
02:53:56,159 --> 02:54:00,719
selected to work outside

4822
02:53:58,398 --> 02:54:02,159
but it was also selected twice more to

4823
02:54:00,719 --> 02:54:02,879
work inside

4824
02:54:02,159 --> 02:54:05,600
so

4825
02:54:02,879 --> 02:54:07,759
most breeders don't take the effort to

4826
02:54:05,600 --> 02:54:11,600
do selections outside

4827
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:13,520
and that their plants don't work outside

4828
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:16,479
yeah okay that's interesting because he

4829
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:17,760
said that it was such a benefit because

4830
02:54:16,478 --> 02:54:19,039
you know like he said a bit

4831
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:21,040
tongue-in-cheek but he said you know

4832
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:22,479
like he could pass it off for like much

4833
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:24,399
more at dispensaries because they

4834
02:54:22,478 --> 02:54:26,239
thought it was indoor

4835
02:54:24,398 --> 02:54:28,239
constantly you know what i've seen this

4836
02:54:26,239 --> 02:54:29,520
so many times and i hear all these

4837
02:54:28,239 --> 02:54:31,760
people

4838
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:33,520
especially today too now that canada is

4839
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:35,600
going to allow outdoor and all these

4840
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:37,279
people saying yeah but outdoor socks you

4841
02:54:35,600 --> 02:54:39,120
i was like [ __ ] you couldn't even tell

4842
02:54:37,279 --> 02:54:41,760
the difference if i gave you some proper

4843
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:44,319
outdoors you wouldn't have a clue

4844
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:46,719
because it looks just as good and it may

4845
02:54:44,318 --> 02:54:49,519
taste even better you know so

4846
02:54:46,719 --> 02:54:51,278
outdoor bud can be hey bud is but if the

4847
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:53,760
plant is healthy and reaching its full

4848
02:54:51,279 --> 02:54:56,319
potential there's literally no

4849
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:58,559
telling if it was indoor or outdoor if

4850
02:54:56,318 --> 02:55:00,398
it was abused outdoor it looks like

4851
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:02,398
outdoor if it was grown somewhere where

4852
02:55:00,398 --> 02:55:04,719
it doesn't really work it looks like bad

4853
02:55:02,398 --> 02:55:06,318
outdoor but if it's somewhere where it's

4854
02:55:04,719 --> 02:55:08,079
happy and

4855
02:55:06,318 --> 02:55:09,920
and acclimatized

4856
02:55:08,079 --> 02:55:11,920
there's no reason you would ever know

4857
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:13,520
what's indoor outdoor and the people

4858
02:55:11,920 --> 02:55:15,439
that tell you that or simply haven't

4859
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:17,120
experienced that

4860
02:55:15,439 --> 02:55:18,880
yeah totally

4861
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:20,079
all righty well that brings us to the

4862
02:55:18,879 --> 02:55:22,799
tail end of the interview where we've

4863
02:55:20,079 --> 02:55:24,559
got our little quick fire questions so

4864
02:55:22,799 --> 02:55:27,199
first one i wanted to shoot you away

4865
02:55:24,559 --> 02:55:28,879
what's the most memorable weed or hash

4866
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:30,800
or concentrate you know anything

4867
02:55:28,879 --> 02:55:32,239
anything with cannabis so to speak most

4868
02:55:30,799 --> 02:55:34,559
memorable experience you've ever had

4869
02:55:32,239 --> 02:55:34,559
with it

4870
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:40,319
that's a tough one man

4871
02:55:38,159 --> 02:55:42,398
that's a tough one i think i can break

4872
02:55:40,318 --> 02:55:45,359
it down a bit i'll say the most

4873
02:55:42,398 --> 02:55:48,478
memorable weed was the second year i

4874
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:51,680
grew at northern lights that stuck in my

4875
02:55:48,478 --> 02:55:54,478
head and calibrates my bud forever

4876
02:55:51,680 --> 02:55:56,840
the nicest hash the most spectacular

4877
02:55:54,478 --> 02:55:58,559
hash i ever had that i made

4878
02:55:56,840 --> 02:56:01,600
was

4879
02:55:58,559 --> 02:56:04,559
incredible blue satellite the blueberry

4880
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:06,640
sativa mother the full melt i pulled off

4881
02:56:04,559 --> 02:56:09,600
of her

4882
02:56:06,639 --> 02:56:12,398
looked like tiger's eye that gem

4883
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:14,800
you could see into it like rays of gold

4884
02:56:12,398 --> 02:56:17,439
into this amber chunk it was so

4885
02:56:14,799 --> 02:56:20,318
spectacular i did have pictures of that

4886
02:56:17,439 --> 02:56:22,318
a long time ago this tin i had it in it

4887
02:56:20,318 --> 02:56:24,559
was really something i've never seen

4888
02:56:22,318 --> 02:56:25,439
hash that looked like that before or

4889
02:56:24,559 --> 02:56:27,119
since

4890
02:56:25,439 --> 02:56:31,279
that blew me away

4891
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:32,240
the biggest the best hit i ever had

4892
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:34,960
was

4893
02:56:32,239 --> 02:56:38,079
at the legends of hashish at the

4894
02:56:34,959 --> 02:56:41,199
lebanese restaurant in amsterdam

4895
02:56:38,079 --> 02:56:44,398
and dave pulled out his uh

4896
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:46,399
old afghan hookah like a traditional one

4897
02:56:44,398 --> 02:56:48,639
that was really like a family keepsake

4898
02:56:46,398 --> 02:56:50,559
it was maybe 200 years old or something

4899
02:56:48,639 --> 02:56:52,159
like this it was a very uh

4900
02:56:50,559 --> 02:56:55,519
very ornate

4901
02:56:52,159 --> 02:56:58,799
beautiful hookah with a solid wood

4902
02:56:55,520 --> 02:57:01,040
pipe stem on it and the bowl

4903
02:56:58,799 --> 02:57:02,318
he loaded up the bowl

4904
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:04,080
as he does

4905
02:57:02,318 --> 02:57:06,959
with a

4906
02:57:04,079 --> 02:57:09,200
full full melt dry shift and it was like

4907
02:57:06,959 --> 02:57:12,478
seven-year-old hayes resin or something

4908
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:14,560
like this an absolute full melt

4909
02:57:12,478 --> 02:57:17,438
and he literally packed

4910
02:57:14,559 --> 02:57:19,920
cramps of it into this pool and it's a

4911
02:57:17,439 --> 02:57:22,318
room full of hashmakers and hash dealers

4912
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:23,760
and hash lovers and we've taken over

4913
02:57:22,318 --> 02:57:25,600
this restaurant

4914
02:57:23,760 --> 02:57:26,639
and he goes sets up the thing and he

4915
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:29,840
says

4916
02:57:26,639 --> 02:57:31,358
who's gonna help me like this and nobody

4917
02:57:29,840 --> 02:57:33,680
in the room

4918
02:57:31,359 --> 02:57:35,840
wanted to stand up and go over and hit

4919
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:38,079
it and he said come on guys who's the

4920
02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:39,520
[ __ ] stoner here who's hardcore come

4921
02:57:38,079 --> 02:57:42,000
on who's gonna help me light this so

4922
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:45,439
he's ready with his wooden matches

4923
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:48,079
to light this big stinky bowl of

4924
02:57:45,439 --> 02:57:48,079
haze melt

4925
02:57:48,318 --> 02:57:51,680
i remember going i was embarrassed

4926
02:57:50,318 --> 02:57:53,600
because nobody would get up there all

4927
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:55,920
looking around like no way i'm not going

4928
02:57:53,600 --> 02:57:57,920
to light that thing they were all you

4929
02:57:55,920 --> 02:57:59,120
know happy to smoke little pipes of it

4930
02:57:57,920 --> 02:58:01,439
and of course it was a really

4931
02:57:59,120 --> 02:58:04,240
extravagant hit and everybody knew it

4932
02:58:01,439 --> 02:58:05,840
was going to be a lung buster you know

4933
02:58:04,239 --> 02:58:07,840
and gonna drop them

4934
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:09,920
and that was one of

4935
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:12,559
one of two times in my life i had

4936
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:14,879
temporary amnesia from cannabis and i

4937
02:58:12,559 --> 02:58:16,959
went and i said i [ __ ] it i got up went

4938
02:58:14,879 --> 02:58:19,278
over to the middle of the room

4939
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:20,318
crouched down took the wooden stem in my

4940
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:21,120
hand

4941
02:58:20,318 --> 02:58:23,920
and

4942
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:25,840
he he's like okay give it a big big hug

4943
02:58:23,920 --> 02:58:27,680
get a couple of big hops to get the

4944
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:30,000
thing going

4945
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:30,000
okay

4946
02:58:30,478 --> 02:58:34,398
i take a big lung busting blast off of

4947
02:58:33,120 --> 02:58:35,920
this thing

4948
02:58:34,398 --> 02:58:37,840
and

4949
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:40,478
stand up and

4950
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:42,960
bust along for a second and go back to

4951
02:58:40,478 --> 02:58:45,039
my table and sit down by the window at

4952
02:58:42,959 --> 02:58:46,879
my table and i'm looking out the window

4953
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:48,960
at the sort of amsterdam street scene

4954
02:58:46,879 --> 02:58:51,358
outside going by

4955
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:53,519
and a minute later or so

4956
02:58:51,359 --> 02:58:55,439
i look at the people at my table and i'm

4957
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:56,800
like i don't know who any of these

4958
02:58:55,439 --> 02:58:58,800
people are

4959
02:58:56,799 --> 02:59:00,879
looking around the room but i don't know

4960
02:58:58,799 --> 02:59:02,799
who any of these people are and i was

4961
02:59:00,879 --> 02:59:06,079
looking out the window

4962
02:59:02,799 --> 02:59:07,920
going [ __ ] i don't even know where i am

4963
02:59:06,079 --> 02:59:10,079
and then i was like

4964
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:12,159
what's my name and i couldn't remember

4965
02:59:10,079 --> 02:59:13,920
my name you know like i literally

4966
02:59:12,159 --> 02:59:15,600
couldn't remember my name and i knew it

4967
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:16,960
was that i was just really stoned and it

4968
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:20,239
was going to pass

4969
02:59:16,959 --> 02:59:22,879
but it was weird because i really had

4970
02:59:20,239 --> 02:59:25,920
this genuine temporary amnesia from that

4971
02:59:22,879 --> 02:59:29,039
one blast of light in that damn hookah

4972
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:31,200
that was a legendary hit i will never

4973
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:33,600
forget that that was i'll be eternally

4974
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:36,000
grateful to dave for that bloody hit

4975
02:59:33,600 --> 02:59:38,399
because it stoned me to the bone

4976
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:40,159
and it was great but i mean after five

4977
02:59:38,398 --> 02:59:42,000
minutes or something you know i just sat

4978
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:44,079
there quietly nobody realized i was kind

4979
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:46,318
of tripping out they must have assumed i

4980
02:59:44,079 --> 02:59:48,000
was tripping out but you know once i got

4981
02:59:46,318 --> 02:59:50,398
going a few people went over and took a

4982
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:51,680
puff off it dave was puffing away on it

4983
02:59:50,398 --> 02:59:54,719
he's hardcore

4984
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:56,398
but man oh man i was lit from that and

4985
02:59:54,719 --> 02:59:58,318
after you know a couple minutes i

4986
02:59:56,398 --> 03:00:00,478
started like okay i know where i am now

4987
02:59:58,318 --> 03:00:02,799
i can drink the beer

4988
03:00:00,478 --> 03:00:04,398
chill out you're good but that was a

4989
03:00:02,799 --> 03:00:06,559
blast man

4990
03:00:04,398 --> 03:00:09,358
so for the grass

4991
03:00:06,559 --> 03:00:12,159
um hash and best hit

4992
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:14,720
was there another question

4993
03:00:12,159 --> 03:00:17,039
yeah it's it's a follow-up is dave a cia

4994
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:17,039
agent

4995
03:00:18,079 --> 03:00:22,159
well he probably puff toughest of all of

4996
03:00:20,719 --> 03:00:24,478
them if he is

4997
03:00:22,159 --> 03:00:27,680
i would uh

4998
03:00:24,478 --> 03:00:29,199
i would not say he's a cia agent i can

4999
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:31,760
understand

5000
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:34,319
why some people are suspicious of

5001
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:36,318
americans that get off lightly and

5002
03:00:34,318 --> 03:00:38,239
disappear into foreign

5003
03:00:36,318 --> 03:00:41,278
scenes

5004
03:00:38,239 --> 03:00:43,359
i can see the issue and i think many

5005
03:00:41,279 --> 03:00:45,040
people facing what uh

5006
03:00:43,359 --> 03:00:47,120
these people are facing in those

5007
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:48,960
scenarios

5008
03:00:47,120 --> 03:00:50,640
would probably

5009
03:00:48,959 --> 03:00:52,719
do what they had to

5010
03:00:50,639 --> 03:00:55,760
to not die in prison

5011
03:00:52,719 --> 03:00:57,039
but i really don't think the guy's a ca

5012
03:00:55,760 --> 03:00:58,559
agent

5013
03:00:57,040 --> 03:01:00,640
well there you go that answers the

5014
03:00:58,559 --> 03:01:02,959
question so next one

5015
03:01:00,639 --> 03:01:04,639
the opposite end of the spectrum instead

5016
03:01:02,959 --> 03:01:06,000
of the most memorable experience well

5017
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:07,439
maybe it's the same question in a

5018
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:11,279
different way what was the most

5019
03:01:07,439 --> 03:01:13,040
memorable worst experience

5020
03:01:11,279 --> 03:01:16,720
so i'll tell you one that

5021
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:17,760
one that pissed me off was when i was

5022
03:01:16,719 --> 03:01:19,199
younger

5023
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:22,159
and i was

5024
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:24,560
18 or 19 and i was traveling around

5025
03:01:22,159 --> 03:01:25,600
central america for winter

5026
03:01:24,559 --> 03:01:29,039
and

5027
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:31,520
i was on an island keycocker in belize

5028
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:33,520
and there was a rasta about my age named

5029
03:01:31,520 --> 03:01:34,720
jimmy the lion

5030
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:37,920
and he

5031
03:01:34,719 --> 03:01:40,959
had some nice bud from orange walk in

5032
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:42,318
corazon northern belize he was out at

5033
03:01:40,959 --> 03:01:44,000
the island and

5034
03:01:42,318 --> 03:01:45,439
i said hey man i'll buy some of that

5035
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,719
butt off and we can all smoke it

5036
03:01:45,439 --> 03:01:49,439
together because

5037
03:01:46,719 --> 03:01:51,840
i was visiting backpacking first with a

5038
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:53,680
few bucks and they were poor locals

5039
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:54,960
i said let me buy some that butt off

5040
03:01:53,680 --> 03:01:56,720
yeah and we'll just smoke it together

5041
03:01:54,959 --> 03:01:58,879
because that's nicer than a lot of the

5042
03:01:56,719 --> 03:01:59,679
bohesian but i'd seen

5043
03:01:58,879 --> 03:02:01,839
so

5044
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:03,760
i told them i said listen because it's a

5045
03:02:01,840 --> 03:02:05,920
small island and there's a cop riding in

5046
03:02:03,760 --> 03:02:07,920
circles around on a bike checking us out

5047
03:02:05,920 --> 03:02:09,279
suspiciously wherever you went

5048
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:11,200
and i said

5049
03:02:09,279 --> 03:02:13,279
let's go to there was a palapa at the

5050
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:15,520
end of this dock it was a private dock

5051
03:02:13,279 --> 03:02:17,840
that was on ours we just went out there

5052
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:20,000
we sat in the rafters with his radio and

5053
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:22,000
i said let's put all the weed into one

5054
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:24,719
big joint we'll smoke it then we're

5055
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:27,359
going into the beach to do some fishing

5056
03:02:24,719 --> 03:02:29,599
and then we barbecue fish over coconut

5057
03:02:27,359 --> 03:02:31,760
husks with a grill popped up on four

5058
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:33,439
coconuts and the lime tree behind us to

5059
03:02:31,760 --> 03:02:35,359
squeeze lime on the fish

5060
03:02:33,439 --> 03:02:38,159
and i'd give another rest a few bucks to

5061
03:02:35,359 --> 03:02:40,318
go get some rice and eat grape coconut

5062
03:02:38,159 --> 03:02:42,239
and we'd boil the rice so we'd have like

5063
03:02:40,318 --> 03:02:43,119
this rasta cookout going on the beach

5064
03:02:42,239 --> 03:02:45,439
and

5065
03:02:43,120 --> 03:02:47,520
we were smoking a joint

5066
03:02:45,439 --> 03:02:51,040
and i said put all the weed in that

5067
03:02:47,520 --> 03:02:53,279
joint so that if the cop comes by we can

5068
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:54,720
ditch the joint and nobody has anything

5069
03:02:53,279 --> 03:02:55,840
on them you know

5070
03:02:54,719 --> 03:02:58,398
and

5071
03:02:55,840 --> 03:03:00,239
he he told me okay i put it all in this

5072
03:02:58,398 --> 03:03:01,840
big fat joint we would roll it in banana

5073
03:03:00,239 --> 03:03:03,359
leaves because you couldn't get papers

5074
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:05,120
and the banana leaves or almond leaves

5075
03:03:03,359 --> 03:03:06,880
weren't too bad even if you got them the

5076
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:08,160
right to age

5077
03:03:06,879 --> 03:03:10,318
but

5078
03:03:08,159 --> 03:03:13,119
the this cop drive by it looked like a

5079
03:03:10,318 --> 03:03:14,318
kid on a bike he must have been like 18

5080
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:16,399
or something

5081
03:03:14,318 --> 03:03:17,920
and he had his shorts and a camo t-shirt

5082
03:03:16,398 --> 03:03:20,079
and a black beret and i was like was

5083
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:22,239
that that one of the cops and he's like

5084
03:03:20,079 --> 03:03:23,680
yeah then i'm like swat the joint out of

5085
03:03:22,239 --> 03:03:25,520
their hand because there's about five or

5086
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:27,359
six of us there was a few hippies from

5087
03:03:25,520 --> 03:03:28,880
california in that circle and a few

5088
03:03:27,359 --> 03:03:31,520
locals

5089
03:03:28,879 --> 03:03:33,920
and as the cop drove by he was looking

5090
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:35,279
at the joint and then looking at me and

5091
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:36,639
just staring me straight in the eye

5092
03:03:35,279 --> 03:03:38,800
because somebody was trying the

5093
03:03:36,639 --> 03:03:40,799
californian dread was trying to pass me

5094
03:03:38,799 --> 03:03:42,559
the joint and he was talking to people

5095
03:03:40,799 --> 03:03:45,278
on the other side of him and he was

5096
03:03:42,559 --> 03:03:47,600
totally oblivious to this little kid cop

5097
03:03:45,279 --> 03:03:50,159
on the bike riding by us on the beach

5098
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:51,920
and i and so as soon as the guy got past

5099
03:03:50,159 --> 03:03:53,680
a bush i was like he's gonna come back

5100
03:03:51,920 --> 03:03:54,478
so i swat the joint out of the guy's

5101
03:03:53,680 --> 03:03:56,639
hand

5102
03:03:54,478 --> 03:03:59,199
and with my left toe i pushed it into

5103
03:03:56,639 --> 03:04:02,079
the sand and that cop was running right

5104
03:03:59,200 --> 03:04:03,520
back over with his gun out

5105
03:04:02,079 --> 03:04:05,520
you know he didn't have his kind of he

5106
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:07,600
can't run him back over yelling he's

5107
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:08,800
like hey you need me to go get the gun

5108
03:04:07,600 --> 03:04:10,640
because he was saying something about

5109
03:04:08,799 --> 03:04:12,239
him you know go get the gun if he didn't

5110
03:04:10,639 --> 03:04:13,439
cooperate because we're all bigger than

5111
03:04:12,239 --> 03:04:14,719
him and he's like you all got to

5112
03:04:13,439 --> 03:04:16,720
cooperate with me

5113
03:04:14,719 --> 03:04:18,239
he's going off to us

5114
03:04:16,719 --> 03:04:19,920
so he goes around

5115
03:04:18,239 --> 03:04:22,719
and he comes straight to me and searches

5116
03:04:19,920 --> 03:04:25,520
me first and the only thing i have on is

5117
03:04:22,719 --> 03:04:27,278
a bathing suit with my room key in it

5118
03:04:25,520 --> 03:04:29,680
nothing else and i'm standing on the

5119
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:31,279
joint and so he's checking my pockets

5120
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:32,479
and he goes okay so what did you do with

5121
03:04:31,279 --> 03:04:34,880
the joint i saw you were going to have

5122
03:04:32,478 --> 03:04:36,398
it i was like i don't have a joint and

5123
03:04:34,879 --> 03:04:38,159
so then he went around the circle and

5124
03:04:36,398 --> 03:04:40,879
checked everybody

5125
03:04:38,159 --> 03:04:42,398
and jimmy the lion still had a bud in

5126
03:04:40,879 --> 03:04:44,159
his pocket that he didn't put in the

5127
03:04:42,398 --> 03:04:45,920
joint and uh

5128
03:04:44,159 --> 03:04:49,039
so they busted him

5129
03:04:45,920 --> 03:04:51,680
and dragged him into their little shitty

5130
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:53,600
one-room uh police station kind of with

5131
03:04:51,680 --> 03:04:54,800
the cell underneath it

5132
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:55,600
and

5133
03:04:54,799 --> 03:04:57,759
he

5134
03:04:55,600 --> 03:04:58,720
i i was a couple doors down at that

5135
03:04:57,760 --> 03:05:01,279
little

5136
03:04:58,719 --> 03:05:04,239
hotel i was staying or hospital whatever

5137
03:05:01,279 --> 03:05:05,920
and all night that guy sang bob marley

5138
03:05:04,239 --> 03:05:07,760
songs through the bars

5139
03:05:05,920 --> 03:05:10,000
and it kept the whole island awake it

5140
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:13,120
was but i was i just stayed there the

5141
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:15,680
whole night just feeling like so bad

5142
03:05:13,120 --> 03:05:17,439
that this poor bastard is hauled in and

5143
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:19,920
now you know they may take him to the

5144
03:05:17,439 --> 03:05:22,079
jail in in belize city which is a real

5145
03:05:19,920 --> 03:05:24,879
shitty shitty jail

5146
03:05:22,079 --> 03:05:27,760
and i thought this nice young rasta guy

5147
03:05:24,879 --> 03:05:29,119
for one [ __ ] herb stock you know

5148
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:31,680
and i just

5149
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:34,319
i've that has always been the worst buzz

5150
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:36,479
kill is when you're enjoying a beautiful

5151
03:05:34,318 --> 03:05:39,119
buzz with wonderful people and really

5152
03:05:36,478 --> 03:05:41,679
having a good environment and then the

5153
03:05:39,120 --> 03:05:44,240
man comes in and kicks sand in your face

5154
03:05:41,680 --> 03:05:46,398
you know and it's like [ __ ] you guys i

5155
03:05:44,239 --> 03:05:47,359
really have no respect for the law

5156
03:05:46,398 --> 03:05:50,000
and it's

5157
03:05:47,359 --> 03:05:52,318
just because of pot laws

5158
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:55,439
yeah totally

5159
03:05:52,318 --> 03:05:57,760
okie dokie so next one if you're on a

5160
03:05:55,439 --> 03:06:01,520
desert island you can only have two or

5161
03:05:57,760 --> 03:06:02,960
three strains what would you pick

5162
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:07,279
um

5163
03:06:02,959 --> 03:06:10,559
yeah real original colombian gold

5164
03:06:07,279 --> 03:06:10,560
maybe that rosebud

5165
03:06:10,799 --> 03:06:16,159
and uh

5166
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:18,719
the sweetest of the sweet tooth

5167
03:06:16,159 --> 03:06:20,959
the the real sweet sweet tooth had a

5168
03:06:18,719 --> 03:06:22,639
real grape candy taste like grape

5169
03:06:20,959 --> 03:06:23,919
lollipops almost

5170
03:06:22,639 --> 03:06:25,840
you see it they

5171
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:27,279
i had friends from california that

5172
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:28,478
thought it was great bait when they came

5173
03:06:27,279 --> 03:06:29,920
to visit me one time they're spoken and

5174
03:06:28,478 --> 03:06:31,199
they're like this is just like grape ape

5175
03:06:29,920 --> 03:06:32,799
it's been around a long time and i was

5176
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:34,800
like well this is a new cross but i can

5177
03:06:32,799 --> 03:06:35,759
see if maybe he has similar parents or

5178
03:06:34,799 --> 03:06:37,199
something

5179
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:39,279
and uh

5180
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:40,960
my favorite sweet tooth is actually some

5181
03:06:39,279 --> 03:06:43,040
of my favorite herbs of all time there's

5182
03:06:40,959 --> 03:06:46,398
a real sweet tooth there's nothing

5183
03:06:43,040 --> 03:06:49,120
sweeter like just for straight up

5184
03:06:46,398 --> 03:06:52,559
brought your teeth sweet flavor that's

5185
03:06:49,120 --> 03:06:54,319
it and it didn't have any

5186
03:06:52,559 --> 03:06:55,760
other characters that i didn't like some

5187
03:06:54,318 --> 03:06:57,359
herb that's a little bit sweet might

5188
03:06:55,760 --> 03:06:58,159
have some kind of rot

5189
03:06:57,359 --> 03:07:00,079
or

5190
03:06:58,159 --> 03:07:02,000
other smells too that i don't like as

5191
03:07:00,079 --> 03:07:04,559
much but the best meat juice were my

5192
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:07,200
favorite for the candy flavored herb the

5193
03:07:04,559 --> 03:07:08,799
original colombian gold is my favorite

5194
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:10,800
for a real

5195
03:07:08,799 --> 03:07:15,519
high cherry note

5196
03:07:10,799 --> 03:07:17,679
and like an absolute succulent perfume

5197
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:19,760
totally love it but if i had to take a

5198
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:22,318
third herb i think the mother of that

5199
03:07:19,760 --> 03:07:24,800
rosebud that little popcorn flow

5200
03:07:22,318 --> 03:07:25,680
it just was like chocolate and you never

5201
03:07:24,799 --> 03:07:28,398
have

5202
03:07:25,680 --> 03:07:30,398
grass i had a couple of chocolate herbs

5203
03:07:28,398 --> 03:07:33,039
but nothing that chocolate it was real

5204
03:07:30,398 --> 03:07:35,358
hashy chocolate taste it really reminded

5205
03:07:33,040 --> 03:07:38,319
me in the police temple bowl the real

5206
03:07:35,359 --> 03:07:41,680
stuff so i think those three would be

5207
03:07:38,318 --> 03:07:44,079
diverse enough to satisfy my palette if

5208
03:07:41,680 --> 03:07:47,120
i could only have three

5209
03:07:44,079 --> 03:07:49,680
in okie dokie it's a good selection so

5210
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:51,279
if you could have one strain back that

5211
03:07:49,680 --> 03:07:53,840
you'd lost over the years which one

5212
03:07:51,279 --> 03:07:53,840
would you get back

5213
03:07:54,159 --> 03:07:56,478
oh

5214
03:07:56,559 --> 03:07:59,680
that's a good question there's been a

5215
03:07:58,398 --> 03:08:02,799
few

5216
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:06,079
but i think it wouldn't be

5217
03:08:02,799 --> 03:08:08,959
a strain per se but a selections i've

5218
03:08:06,079 --> 03:08:11,680
had of a stream that were

5219
03:08:08,959 --> 03:08:13,278
the only time i've seen true sterile

5220
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:17,040
females

5221
03:08:13,279 --> 03:08:19,760
i really regret losing those cuttings

5222
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:21,040
those i had

5223
03:08:19,760 --> 03:08:23,040
seeds

5224
03:08:21,040 --> 03:08:25,439
there was a release i had called tight

5225
03:08:23,040 --> 03:08:27,520
skunk that was a

5226
03:08:25,439 --> 03:08:29,520
ryan's killer

5227
03:08:27,520 --> 03:08:30,960
was the bag seed mother we call it

5228
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:31,920
ryan's killer

5229
03:08:30,959 --> 03:08:34,239
um

5230
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:36,478
and when i grew out the ryan's killer

5231
03:08:34,239 --> 03:08:39,119

5233

5234
03:08:40,879 --> 03:08:43,920
friend of a friend

5235
03:08:42,159 --> 03:08:46,959

5236
03:08:43,920 --> 03:08:49,680

5237
03:08:46,959 --> 03:08:51,119

5250
03:09:11,520 --> 03:09:16,880
and i got six plants up all three were

5251
03:09:14,079 --> 03:09:19,120
females three of them had pistols and

5252
03:09:16,879 --> 03:09:21,679
three of them had no pistols

5253
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:23,439
and the ones with no pistols would not

5254
03:09:21,680 --> 03:09:26,398
take a seed

5255
03:09:23,439 --> 03:09:27,439
covered in pollen with males right all

5256
03:09:26,398 --> 03:09:30,639
over them

5257
03:09:27,439 --> 03:09:32,960
they would not make a seed so i actually

5258
03:09:30,639 --> 03:09:36,559
had the perfect example of sterile

5259
03:09:32,959 --> 03:09:38,879
females now i've heard of a number of

5260
03:09:36,559 --> 03:09:40,159
people have messed around trying to make

5261
03:09:38,879 --> 03:09:42,318
them

5262
03:09:40,159 --> 03:09:44,318
through various techniques

5263
03:09:42,318 --> 03:09:46,000
and they're generally trying to induce

5264
03:09:44,318 --> 03:09:47,680
polyploidy

5265
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:50,879
and

5266
03:09:47,680 --> 03:09:52,880
i've gone back in my mind a million

5267
03:09:50,879 --> 03:09:53,759
times about what people were doing back

5268
03:09:52,879 --> 03:09:55,920
then

5269
03:09:53,760 --> 03:09:57,920
and i've got a pretty good idea how to

5270
03:09:55,920 --> 03:09:59,520
get back to it and it's a little

5271
03:09:57,920 --> 03:10:00,478
different than what most people are

5272
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:02,399
trying

5273
03:10:00,478 --> 03:10:04,318
so i don't want to say much more about

5274
03:10:02,398 --> 03:10:06,238
it because i feel like it's like a great

5275
03:10:04,318 --> 03:10:08,639
arms race right now that whoever comes

5276
03:10:06,238 --> 03:10:10,478
out with the sterile female first wins

5277
03:10:08,639 --> 03:10:13,760
because what that does for outdoor

5278
03:10:10,478 --> 03:10:15,519
cultivation is nothing short of

5279
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:16,559
evolutionary

5280
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:18,720
is

5281
03:10:16,559 --> 03:10:20,639
if you've got a problem with hemp in

5282
03:10:18,719 --> 03:10:22,799
your neighborhood which many canadians

5283
03:10:20,639 --> 03:10:24,559
do they can't grow outdoors there's too

5284
03:10:22,799 --> 03:10:26,799
much hemp around them

5285
03:10:24,559 --> 03:10:28,318
if they had if we could uh induce

5286
03:10:26,799 --> 03:10:29,920
sterility

5287
03:10:28,318 --> 03:10:33,600
into their plants

5288
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:35,840
without otherwise making them different

5289
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:38,318
it would be a huge game changer and even

5290
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:39,600
indoors producers will have a hermione

5291
03:10:38,318 --> 03:10:41,760
i've seen

5292
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:43,520
you know customers of the biggest lps in

5293
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:45,120
canada complain about getting seeds in

5294
03:10:43,520 --> 03:10:47,680
their bud

5295
03:10:45,120 --> 03:10:49,840
come on people you shouldn't still be

5296
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:51,200
selling cd bud if you're not trying to

5297
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:53,439
sell cd bud

5298
03:10:51,200 --> 03:10:55,359
so it would be really easy to correct

5299
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:57,200
that for all of them i could take a

5300
03:10:55,359 --> 03:10:59,520
cutting from anybody and send it back to

5301
03:10:57,200 --> 03:11:01,120
them sterilized in a few months the only

5302
03:10:59,520 --> 03:11:03,200
difference in the bud would be that it

5303
03:11:01,120 --> 03:11:05,840
didn't have any pistols

5304
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:06,880
so that was really an amazing plant to

5305
03:11:05,840 --> 03:11:09,279
find

5306
03:11:06,879 --> 03:11:11,679
nobody i've ever talked who's ever seen

5307
03:11:09,279 --> 03:11:13,680
a similar one obviously whoever else

5308
03:11:11,680 --> 03:11:15,680
grew those seed saw it but probably

5309
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:18,159
didn't realize the significance of it at

5310
03:11:15,680 --> 03:11:19,040
the time as i didn't because i had only

5311
03:11:18,159 --> 03:11:21,039
been

5312
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:22,319
growing for less than 10 years at that

5313
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:23,920
point and i just thought hey i've just

5314
03:11:22,318 --> 03:11:26,879
never seen this before but i'm sure i'll

5315
03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:30,559
see it again and i never saw it again so

5316
03:11:26,879 --> 03:11:32,079
i really really really regret

5317
03:11:30,559 --> 03:11:34,478
letting those go

5318
03:11:32,079 --> 03:11:35,359
but i'd left that the house where i had

5319
03:11:34,478 --> 03:11:38,079
them

5320
03:11:35,359 --> 03:11:40,000
i sold the leash to a friend and i

5321
03:11:38,079 --> 03:11:42,719
wanted to move to another house out on

5322
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:44,238
the ocean which was gorgeous but when i

5323
03:11:42,719 --> 03:11:46,000
said listen i'm going to move out there

5324
03:11:44,238 --> 03:11:47,680
i'll sell you the lease on my place the

5325
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:49,760
grow room set up all the plants are

5326
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:52,159
there equipment it's all yours

5327
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:54,559
so i told him the place that i left

5328
03:11:52,159 --> 03:11:56,079
and i said i'm going to come back in a

5329
03:11:54,559 --> 03:11:57,680
couple months when i get something else

5330
03:11:56,079 --> 03:12:00,000
set up i'll come back and get cuttings

5331
03:11:57,680 --> 03:12:02,318
and everything and when i came back he

5332
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:04,478
cleaned out like half the stuff

5333
03:12:02,318 --> 03:12:06,398
like and he lost them he's like oh i

5334
03:12:04,478 --> 03:12:07,438
lost this and i lost that one two years

5335
03:12:06,398 --> 03:12:10,559
like

5336
03:12:07,439 --> 03:12:12,720
oh no i said [ __ ] i was just killing

5337
03:12:10,559 --> 03:12:14,079
myself that i didn't spread it around a

5338
03:12:12,719 --> 03:12:15,920
little bit more

5339
03:12:14,079 --> 03:12:18,159
because the streams that i was so proud

5340
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:20,960
of early on and shared far and wide

5341
03:12:18,159 --> 03:12:22,959
they're still they're still around

5342
03:12:20,959 --> 03:12:25,119
they're more far and wide than they ever

5343
03:12:22,959 --> 03:12:26,959
were because people have shared them in

5344
03:12:25,120 --> 03:12:28,800
an ongoing way

5345
03:12:26,959 --> 03:12:30,799
so like this sweet skunk

5346
03:12:28,799 --> 03:12:33,119
you know there's so much sweet skunk or

5347
03:12:30,799 --> 03:12:35,920
grapefruit in bc

5348
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:38,239
let alone in the west coast

5349
03:12:35,920 --> 03:12:39,439
it'll never be gone because it's out

5350
03:12:38,238 --> 03:12:41,359
there

5351
03:12:39,439 --> 03:12:43,040
you know it would be like trying to get

5352
03:12:41,359 --> 03:12:45,040
rid of oxygen at this point there's so

5353
03:12:43,040 --> 03:12:49,600
much of that you're just never gonna get

5354
03:12:45,040 --> 03:12:52,080
rid of it yeah no totally okay so on to

5355
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:54,399
our lucky last question if you could go

5356
03:12:52,079 --> 03:12:56,959
back in time to one place to collect

5357
03:12:54,398 --> 03:12:58,398
land race seeds any place any point in

5358
03:12:56,959 --> 03:13:01,398
time where would you go what would you

5359
03:12:58,398 --> 03:13:01,398
get

5360
03:13:04,989 --> 03:13:11,039
[Music]

5361
03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:14,960
i think

5362
03:13:11,040 --> 03:13:17,200
i would go to equatorial africa

5363
03:13:14,959 --> 03:13:19,199
2019

5364
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:22,880
i love the good african equatorial

5365
03:13:19,200 --> 03:13:24,960
strains there's congo nigerians and

5366
03:13:22,879 --> 03:13:27,199
angolans and i don't think they've

5367
03:13:24,959 --> 03:13:28,879
changed that much

5368
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:31,760
in the last thousand years you know

5369
03:13:28,879 --> 03:13:33,199
maybe they have but i don't know they

5370
03:13:31,760 --> 03:13:35,920
they uh

5371
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:37,520
they really have uh some amazing aromas

5372
03:13:35,920 --> 03:13:39,920
and a little different effect being that

5373
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:41,439
they're a little higher in thc than many

5374
03:13:39,920 --> 03:13:43,760
other places

5375
03:13:41,439 --> 03:13:46,318
uh i yeah it's not that i need to go

5376
03:13:43,760 --> 03:13:49,760
back in time i just need to go

5377
03:13:46,318 --> 03:13:53,039
and travel through some of these areas

5378
03:13:49,760 --> 03:13:55,279
that i think still hold amazing land ray

5379
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:57,680
stuff you know

5380
03:13:55,279 --> 03:14:00,640
like if you go to angola the chances of

5381
03:13:57,680 --> 03:14:03,359
everything being polluted with blue kush

5382
03:14:00,639 --> 03:14:03,358
are pretty low

5383
03:14:03,439 --> 03:14:08,079
but if you smoke angle and i know

5384
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:11,760
friends in bc that grow angolan it's

5385
03:14:08,079 --> 03:14:13,359
fabulously delicious it really is and is

5386
03:14:11,760 --> 03:14:15,359
up there with some of the asian ones but

5387
03:14:13,359 --> 03:14:17,120
i get a little bit better even than like

5388
03:14:15,359 --> 03:14:19,040
burmese and vietnamese and that i tend

5389
03:14:17,120 --> 03:14:21,600
to like the africans

5390
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:25,200
just a hair better than the asians and i

5391
03:14:21,600 --> 03:14:27,120
like the asians but i love the africans

5392
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:29,200
so that's where i would for land race

5393
03:14:27,120 --> 03:14:32,000
collection that's where i would want

5394
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:34,239
anything from equatorial africa

5395
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:36,719
yeah what a fantastic answer

5396
03:14:34,238 --> 03:14:38,159
so with that being said did you have any

5397
03:14:36,719 --> 03:14:39,358
comments or shout outs you wanted to

5398
03:14:38,159 --> 03:14:41,520
make

5399
03:14:39,359 --> 03:14:43,920
well shout out to everybody that ever

5400
03:14:41,520 --> 03:14:46,319
supported me in this endeavor and uh

5401
03:14:43,920 --> 03:14:48,079
your encouragement's always meant a lot

5402
03:14:46,318 --> 03:14:51,119
i would have done it for my own selfish

5403
03:14:48,079 --> 03:14:52,238
pleasure as i said i love to do it but

5404
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:54,160
you know

5405
03:14:52,238 --> 03:14:56,159
the vindication i felt from all the

5406
03:14:54,159 --> 03:14:57,920
people that ever helped me along the way

5407
03:14:56,159 --> 03:15:01,279
my gurus

5408
03:14:57,920 --> 03:15:02,960
that mentored me and took me in

5409
03:15:01,279 --> 03:15:04,880
to a degree like it wasn't like they

5410
03:15:02,959 --> 03:15:06,478
became my parents or anything but you

5411
03:15:04,879 --> 03:15:08,398
know i got a lot of good advice from

5412
03:15:06,478 --> 03:15:09,760
some really good people over the years

5413
03:15:08,398 --> 03:15:12,238
and uh

5414
03:15:09,760 --> 03:15:14,238
i think you know as one out of the blue

5415
03:15:12,238 --> 03:15:16,238
i would take that tom alexander from

5416
03:15:14,238 --> 03:15:18,079
since emilia tips i brought up earlier

5417
03:15:16,238 --> 03:15:20,318
because i never made the point out of

5418
03:15:18,079 --> 03:15:23,039
that when i wanted to make was they had

5419
03:15:20,318 --> 03:15:25,600
a study following sensamelia tips he had

5420
03:15:23,040 --> 03:15:27,120
growing edge and they had the study i

5421
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:29,439
remember reading

5422
03:15:27,120 --> 03:15:32,319
that showed that organic produce i think

5423
03:15:29,439 --> 03:15:35,439
they did it on tomatoes the study

5424
03:15:32,318 --> 03:15:37,600
that it provided they had an organic one

5425
03:15:35,439 --> 03:15:38,720
and a non-organic tomato

5426
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:41,520
and

5427
03:15:38,719 --> 03:15:43,920
the non-organic tomato had the primary

5428
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:46,720
flavonoids of a tomato you could tell it

5429
03:15:43,920 --> 03:15:49,279
tasted like a tomato it was a tomato but

5430
03:15:46,719 --> 03:15:51,519
the organic stuff grown in compost and

5431
03:15:49,279 --> 03:15:54,319
whatnot had developed secondary

5432
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:55,200
flavonoids so they were able to quantify

5433
03:15:54,318 --> 03:15:58,238
the

5434
03:15:55,200 --> 03:16:00,560
improved flavor in the organic produce

5435
03:15:58,238 --> 03:16:02,559
through the appearance of primary and

5436
03:16:00,559 --> 03:16:04,079
secondary flavonoids

5437
03:16:02,559 --> 03:16:06,559
that study

5438
03:16:04,079 --> 03:16:08,799
confirmed what i felt that the organic

5439
03:16:06,559 --> 03:16:09,840
pot tasted better and i always thought

5440
03:16:08,799 --> 03:16:11,840
organic

5441
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:13,200
you know your backyard tomatoes taste

5442
03:16:11,840 --> 03:16:14,639
better than those pink ones at the

5443
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:16,560
supermarket

5444
03:16:14,639 --> 03:16:18,639
and really

5445
03:16:16,559 --> 03:16:20,879
you know shout out to tom alexander for

5446
03:16:18,639 --> 03:16:23,199
sense amelia tips and then onwards and

5447
03:16:20,879 --> 03:16:25,039
growing edge and the science of people

5448
03:16:23,200 --> 03:16:27,680
growing kind but

5449
03:16:25,040 --> 03:16:29,760
and especially you know i've gotta thank

5450
03:16:27,680 --> 03:16:32,398
anybody that ever bred seed in this

5451
03:16:29,760 --> 03:16:35,520
planet before me because we all stand on

5452
03:16:32,398 --> 03:16:36,719
the shoulders of giants you know and

5453
03:16:35,520 --> 03:16:38,399
i really

5454
03:16:36,719 --> 03:16:40,559
you know have nothing but respect for

5455
03:16:38,398 --> 03:16:41,680
guys like dj short

5456
03:16:40,559 --> 03:16:44,559
and even

5457
03:16:41,680 --> 03:16:46,479
um watson what he's done with skunk and

5458
03:16:44,559 --> 03:16:48,559
robert connell clark you know without

5459
03:16:46,478 --> 03:16:50,079
his book marijuana botany i'm sure i

5460
03:16:48,559 --> 03:16:52,000
would have been off to a much slower

5461
03:16:50,079 --> 03:16:53,279
start but that was the second grow book

5462
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:55,040
i ever read

5463
03:16:53,279 --> 03:16:57,120
and that uh

5464
03:16:55,040 --> 03:16:59,680
really blew it up for me and brought it

5465
03:16:57,120 --> 03:17:00,720
into perspective and i'd read it after

5466
03:16:59,680 --> 03:17:03,040
you know

5467
03:17:00,719 --> 03:17:04,719
the first year i grew then i got some

5468
03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:06,479
books and that was one of the very first

5469
03:17:04,719 --> 03:17:08,639
books i got and

5470
03:17:06,478 --> 03:17:11,119
i read it and look at the drawings of

5471
03:17:08,639 --> 03:17:13,199
the different lines and think

5472
03:17:11,120 --> 03:17:15,439
wow there's so much cannabis to

5473
03:17:13,200 --> 03:17:18,319
experience beyond

5474
03:17:15,439 --> 03:17:20,720
you know the scentsy catalog

5475
03:17:18,318 --> 03:17:22,238
so it was really a treat

5476
03:17:20,719 --> 03:17:24,719

5477
03:17:22,238 --> 03:17:27,920
