Cleveland and uh

41
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,640
like 10 years ago 2009 uh my

42
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,799
managed to get some samples out to

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,520
Denver and then they were like holy wow

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,920
so I went around and you know I got

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,140
strands from all my friends and

46
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,579

47
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,639

49
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,899
um

50
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,519

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,699
Buddha that actually gave all the CBD to

100
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,418
the web

101
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:39,120

102
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,758
plant uh

103
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,199
and then so I was uh that's when I

104
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,900
started drinking a lot you know that's

105
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,060
when I decided yeah I got really mad you

106
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,859

107
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,079
stole my [ __ ] and you know what I mean

108
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,680
now they're now they've got a TV show

109
00:04:52,079 --> 00:05:00,240
coming out with Sanjay Gupta on CNN I

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,680
was like [ __ ] that right uh and uh I was

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,540
so I was just I was kind of ruining

112
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,500
myself at that point because I realized

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,379
you know

114
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,519
like that that one plant was like the

115
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:11,339
key to

116
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,039
you know that that was my millions of

117
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:16,439
dollars that I thought I was gonna make

118
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,199
when I came to Colorado to be a weed

119
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,360
millionaire and uh

120
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,160
so I was upset for a while man and then

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,720

122

dudes I know they got my plant and he's

124
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:32,038
like just watch it so I watched it and I

125
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,800
realized that

126
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,319
you know uh

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,418
what I brought was helping people like

128
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,279
helping somebody who couldn't get any

129
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,918
other hell man that poor girl Charlotte

130
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,918
feed piggy uh was having like 100

131
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,659
seizures a day man she was a twin and

132
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,698
her twin sister didn't have any kind of

133
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,639
problems you could see like the

134
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,379
difference in like the um how she was

135
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,319
growing and developing as a human being

136
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:01,500
you know it was uh not to use this word

137
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,079
in any way derogatory but she was the

138
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,939
she was [ __ ] literally and that she

139
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,560
couldn't learn and grow do you know what

140
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,259
I mean

141
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,240
yeah yeah like it's in the medical sense

142
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,620
and you know I realized that like you

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,360
know no matter what man I'm helping

144

146
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,000
meet her before she had actually passed

147
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,259
away too because she kind of saved me

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,079
like I was

149
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:28,139

00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:12,839
back and we intended to use that

168
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:15,839
structure of the Afghan to strengthen up

169
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:18,359
the Cherry which was and and the Cherry

170
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:21,538
was amazing like the extract from it

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,000
tasted like I mean cherries like

172
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:24,978
like

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
uncontrollably you know like a medicine

174
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,740

00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,240
of different uh heart you know some

191
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:12,300
Harley Harlequin stuff and I put it all

192
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,060
out with the mail

193
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:19,379
uh

194
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,478
the male Cherry pandahar that we had and

195
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,180
there was like uh I don't know like

196
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:27,418
eight other plants out there pollinate

197
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,418
them all and then that's when

198
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:32,879
like I I I I'd had them all and I sat on

199
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:36,240
them for a while and then James from the

200
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,338
seed uh from seeds here now hit me up

201
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,839
and was like Yo dude you wanna

202
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,060
sell those things and I was like yeah

203
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,800
that'd be cool so we started packing

204
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,239
them up I gave a ton of weight Joe I

205
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,159
probably gave away

206
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,959
like uh

207
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,860
at least a third of what I started with

208
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,859
like

209
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,899
Cana moms and who aren't nice people and

210
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,259
like just just like you know trying to

211
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:01,519
be the Johnny Appleseed of sorts

212
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,519
and then um

213
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:07,139
went ended up going to the emerald cup I

214
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,660
assume that's I've only been to two of

215
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:11,519
them so I assume uh that was the first

216
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:14,219
one and then does when James only had

217
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,120
like 12 breeders on the it was like me

218
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:23,040
and sunny and Odie and uh

219
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:26,639
Mike from exotic you know and uh

220
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:29,039
actually yeah so he ended up selling

221
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,559
like uh you know that was the first year

222
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:35,458
and then the next year when we went back

223
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:37,079
like people like Duke over here actually

224
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,719
kept people were like do you have any

225
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,278
CBD stuff and he just kept sending

226
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,278
people to me

227
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,778
like uh consistently so like he was

228
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,059
rocking the table

229
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:50,100
it's a busy weekend man we just raged

230
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,559
out and I sold out a people were coming

231
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,700
up they're like I need CBD and I'm like

232
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,018
yeah here are seeds and they're like

233
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,320
we're gonna breed with these and I was

234
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:01,620
like that's the point and then

235
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,860
from that and some stuff that James did

236
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,600
like basically almost 95 percent of the

237
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,759
CBD hemp genetics in America were born

238
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,580
like uh from stuff that I had made you

239
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,799
know like uh all that cherry wine and

240
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,379
all that stuff has got my cherry

241
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,379
condohar and like just it's crazy to

242
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,278
think the scope but I'm proud of that

243
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,539
um

244
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,740
but yeah

245
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:30,480
that's that's all that

246
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,060
what a great recount I mean so many

247
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,420
different angles we can follow up on I

248
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:38,338
guess the first one just as a sort of

249
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:42,000
nomenclature thing would you prefer that

250
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,380
both I and the community cause it wu4 R4

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,740
or are you comfortable with the name

252
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:49,139
Charlotte's Web well I like woo because

253
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,419
it gives uh honor to the guy that made

254
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,919
it you know you know one of the coolest

255
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,219
things that uh

256
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:58,679
I got to do was I got to call him after

257
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,600
you know all this popped off and I was

258
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,179
like hey dude guess what because of you

259
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,100
like

260
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:07,019
hundreds of people and children and

261
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,759
everything or finding

262
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,339
and now it's like Millions you know what

263
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,679
I mean like CBD I you know what I told

264
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,660
my mom before she passed away I told her

265
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,219
and this is you know obviously I

266
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:18,899
stretched it through a little but I told

267
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,600
her I invented CBD

268
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,159
you know

269
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,320
and then everywhere that she goes and

270
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:28,259
when she sees CBD that was me and she

271
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,480
was like she was stoked so

272
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,399
um but in a way like

273
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,339
we brought it to the thing you know so

274
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,039
the woo would be great because that

275
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,959
gives him the you know what I mean like

276
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,578
it it was an honor to call him and tell

277
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,018
him that he because of him like people

278
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:45,899
were finding relief and not having

279
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:49,620
seizures and little kids were like we

280
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:52,440
were the my buddy Todd uh the Ravens and

281
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,980
I uh were the first people ever allowed

282
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,920
us to give kids cannabis in a hospital

283
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,959
ever like in in Colorado at least I know

284
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,879
but like uh we made a roll on like I

285
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,739
grew it and he formulated it and these

286
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,939
kids would have a seizure and maybe you

287
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,860
saw it it was all over the Internet and

288
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,839
like you take this roll on and like hit

289
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,339
their feet and within like 20 seconds

290
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,440
they weren't having a seizure anymore

291
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,700
wow

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
like

293
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,660
yeah that was cool and fulfilling so

294
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,939
we'll call it the woo

295
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:22,860
I get all messed up too man because so

296
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,660
what happened it became the r because I

297
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,000
had horrible handwriting like

298
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:29,039
like I don't even type legibly you know

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
what I mean like it's horrible

300
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,059
um

301
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,620
so they misread it and re-labeled it

302
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,719
which is probably you know that's just

303
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,060
something [ __ ] do anyway so

304
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
are we able to loop back on that how how

305
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:45,659
was it that um the Stanley Brothers came

306
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,700
to sort of enter that facility like what

307
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:50,578
was the series of events that led to

308
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,079
them sort of getting access to it oh we

309
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,659
harvested

310
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,239
we harvested the first round they sent

311
00:12:54,659 --> 00:13:00,120
it to the lab Lab says came back with

312
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,360
high CBD then I was kicked out of the

313
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,100
the uh thing I had a I wasn't

314
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,740
see I'm not upset that I was kicked out

315
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,019
I had a felony that a drug felony from

316
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,180
like a while ago and I hadn't quite got

317
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,139
after that 10-year Mark do you know what

318
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,659
I mean

319
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,159
yeah but I was pretty upset that they

320
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:19,078
wouldn't give me my gear back which is

321
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,059
just some [ __ ] so the guy I came out

322
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,399
with was supposed to be like my

323
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,679
like my homie you know we started yeah

324
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,000
the actually yeah the statue of

325
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,979
limitations is up man we started

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,200
hustling ecstasy and I was like 17 going

327
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,000
to Raves like all over the United States

328
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,980
like all over well the Midwest at least

329
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,320
you know I made that dude a ton of money

330
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,440
you think he'd be like a little more

331
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,278
you know not piece of [ __ ] but so they

332
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,560
kept that and then I suppose uh this one

333
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,620
isn't I'm not sure I assumed the

334
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,778
Stanley's or at least Josh went to

335
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,980
you know saw the test results and went

336
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:55,139
over there

337
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,778
and asked him for it or something you

338
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,879
know okay so it's sounding like it was

339
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:01,620
all sort of quite opportunistic on their

340
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:03,539
part

341
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,700
yeah

342
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:09,059
I mean they they asked they made claw

343
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,700
they made S1 my stuff like that's like a

344
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,500
sin in the uh breeding community so it

345
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,879
takes somebody's especially like that

346
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,799
you know it's gonna take somebody's gear

347
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,019
S1 and so

348
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,639
you know make thousands and thousands

349
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,419
and thousands of dollars off of it that

350
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,879
seems like a pretty shitty thing to do

351
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:29,159
so uh the the listeners will will give

352
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,259
me grief if I don't try to follow up on

353
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:34,379
it why why was it you were kicked out of

354
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:38,480
the facility a little felony that was uh

355
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:42,899
from a drug felony like uh from like

356
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,699
2001 and then three so I wasn't off they

357
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,220
have a 10-year

358
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:48,719
uh minimum like when I got here it had

359
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,399
just been implemented like I was allowed

360
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,259
in the facility and then all of a sudden

361
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,320
they were like well if you've had a

362
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,000
felony or we're still on uh paper

363
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,940
in the last 10 years you got to wait

364
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,639
till that's over to work in the industry

365
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,500
so do you think that it that was like

366
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,659
the actual truth that they just found

367
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,759
out more like oh sorry policies policy

368
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:11,219
or do you think it was like their way of

369
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,759
being able to get rid of you

370
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,800
yeah actually a hundred percent uh

371
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,240
literally the guys that rip me off the

372
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,240
main guy's name was Chad

373
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,679
oh wow okay because I'd just like to

374
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,778
clarify because one of the stories you

375
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,919
sometimes hear around the community is

376
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:30,600
that

377
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,338
um the the Stanley Brothers had this

378
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,639
plan and they grew it thinking it was

379
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:38,220
THC only to find it with CBD and then

380
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,320
like they sort of like quote swindled

381
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,000
Charlotte's parents being like yeah buy

382
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,860
this weed like just trying to sell it to

383
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,240
anyone who would buy it

384
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,980
um do you think that that probably

385
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,419
wasn't actually the case and they sort

386
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,399
of had more of an idea of what they were

387
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:52,679
doing the whole time they went

388
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,139
specifically to those guys after the

389
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,359
tests were published in a local uh weed

390
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,919
magazine I still have it around here on

391
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,560
the bookshelf it was the first time I've

392
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:04,319
ever seen my strains in print so I kept

393
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:07,259
it but uh yeah man they knew exactly

394
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,660
what they were doing and uh I know it's

395
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,240
mine because it was a variegated plant

396
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,439
and you can see that in that video where

397
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,259
they showed all the plants like oh

398
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,480
that's my [ __ ] gear but then I also

399
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,100
heard that like they had uh

400
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,100
they had a Tennessee farmer a Kentucky

401
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,680
farm there Rocky whatever and uh there's

402
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,300
like bottles of Eagle laying around and

403
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,979
[ __ ]

404
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:31,679
like they had sprayed it with like

405
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,539
horrible fungicides like and they were

406
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,338
gonna give this to children

407
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,899
you know what I mean if that's and they

408
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,860
probably did actually because that was

409
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:42,419
before we established a you know

410
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,459
thresholds for pesticides and all that

411
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,078
kind of like you know yeah yeah yeah

412
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:49,018
yeah okay

413
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,399
but yeah that was all intentional I'm

414
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,560
not sure about me

415
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,940
getting you know I know the felony had

416
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,899
something to do with that but yeah that

417
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,699
whole

418
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,720
that yeah that wasn't an accident on

419
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:01,559
their part

420
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,060
so what did you sort of do in uh the

421
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,798
aftermath of all this you know you sort

422
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,359
of mentioned that you were feeling a bit

423
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,459
down in the dumps

424
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,219
lots of drugs and alcohol that's what I

425
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,199
did for a while while I was really upset

426
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,240
yeah look I think that's pretty

427
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,400
understandable was there anything in

428
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,859
particular that sort of helped you see

429
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,620
the light at the end of that tunnel yeah

430
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:25,619
that video man with the weed with Sanjay

431
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,719
Gupta was on CNN and seeing that girl

432
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,159
Charlotte

433
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,679
um

434
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,140
seeing the Met something that I did like

435
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,740
help anybody is cool but like to see

436
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,840
somebody in such a horrible spot

437
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,400
where even the worst of uh

438
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,019
pharmaceutical drugs that they give to

439
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Children won't work like I don't know if

440
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,220
you ever see what they give to kids with

441
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,559
seizures it's disgusting like it's uh

442
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,240
like Valium and Keppra and like

443
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,259
basically you're just [ __ ] your kid

444
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,779
all up

445
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,099
you know after watching that I realized

446
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:57,779
like uh

447
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,939
you know hey I did this already might as

448
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,339
well get back to work and that you know

449
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,179
that what I did was kind of important if

450
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,399
uh

451
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:08,220
even if I don't get you know like I saw

452
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,538
the other day that that uh Charlotte's

453
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:15,600
Web the company is now worth millions

454
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:18,779
do you have any ambition or want to try

455
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,918
to have some of the credit attributed to

456
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:21,058
or are you just at the point where

457
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,220
you've moved on and you're just doing

458
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,079
other stuff no man what are you

459
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,179
like how do you

460
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,519
like what do you like I can't afford a

461
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:31,740
good lawyer and I'm sure they can like

462
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,418
more than anything then how do you prove

463
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,240
all that like

464
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,640
yeah like

465
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,519
you know that seems like a I could a lot

466
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,860
of money to lose the battle you know

467
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,839
yeah if nothing else I think it should

468
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,879
be a goal that the uh the community

469
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,159
knows what you've contributed but like

470
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,320
thankfully in the sort of intro you gave

471
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,900
us there's a there's a whole range of

472
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,298
other avenues I'd love to follow up on

473
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,120
but I guess the first question is you

474
00:18:57,298 --> 00:19:03,900
know given you do have such you know um

475
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,639
a focal tying in to the woo do you do

476
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,019
you still like to work with it or are

477
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,520
you at the point where you've done a lot

478
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,400
of crosses you've got stuff to give to

479
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:14,400
people and you're doing other stuff now

480
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,798
you know man uh there's not a lot much

481
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,798
left to do with CBD or

482
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:22,139
um my homie Adam jacks up in Oregon is

483
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:25,139
making like uh

484
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,419
taking like you know uh OG Kush wouldn't

485
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,759
see any he can back it up and make OG

486
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,759
Kush hemp that's like the only way that

487
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:36,660
I see CBD hemp being like uh

488
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,579
uh yeah like okay so here for instance I

489
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,298
make a product called heaven and it's uh

490
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:44,279
CBD tinctures and stuff and uh when we

491
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:48,240
first start when I first started

492
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:51,240
kilos of CBD just the crude were like 3

493
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,339
500 bucks distill it was like seven or

494
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,220
eight or yeah yeah seven or eight

495
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,199
thousand dollars in that that uh I don't

496
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,200
use the isolate but that [ __ ] was like

497
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:05,038
10 20 I don't know it was high and now

498
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,798
like kilos and CBD are like 200 bucks

499
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,720
so like to be able to farm all that

500
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,660
you know what I mean it

501
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,519
at this point like I think CBD is unless

502
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,160
you're gonna do those Boutique kind of

503
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,918
things with it uh you know it's just

504
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,538
available I mean lots of seeds out there

505
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,640
you know that have

506
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:25,679
you know I think that one's done I don't

507
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,320
I I I'm gonna try and do some

508
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,140
one-to-ones here with uh

509
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,119
with Duke here I got I got a nice one of

510
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,919
my projects when you take a THC plan and

511
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,058
a CBD plant like on ends of the

512
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,140
spectrums you end up with like 50

513
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:40,079
percent

514
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,480
uh one to one and two to ones and like

515
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,178
25 High CBD and 25

516
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,980
and like those one to ones like the I

517
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:50,460
did the Tiger Beat and that was testing

518
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,140
out at 16 and a half THC with 17 and a

519
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,480
half CBD on it

520
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,400
I like that kind of thing that's quite

521
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,620
impressive in terms of the numbers like

522
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,140
normally I'd feel like you rarely see

523
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,159
one-to-one strains go above like 10 and

524
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,500
10.

525
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,360
I know right that was like it was

526
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
beautiful and then I had some that were

527
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,959
like the

528
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:14,640
at a strain called the bird I set it up

529
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,980
to uh Alaska and that he's got a zero

530
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,780
THC like it's maybe

531
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,640
the machines don't really pick it up if

532
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,019
there is any

533
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,700
so

534
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,200
that's a pretty cool

535
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,660
like uh

536
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,460
you know like if you could have a so the

537
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,960
THC Gene is responsible for like the

538
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,019
plant's immune system and stuff like

539
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,279
that so A pure CBD plant that doesn't

540
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,158
have that

541
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,259
Gene capable like at least being there

542
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,400
doesn't isn't as good because it doesn't

543
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:45,240
have that

544
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,640
you know uh the immune response thing

545
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,558
yeah certainly that's interesting do you

546
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,000
do you find that like you know as an

547
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,038
extension of that they're like they're

548
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,619
more prone to pests and mold and

549
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,200
botritis or not necessarily

550
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,759
yeah yeah uh the woman that owns the lab

551
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,919
who is a good friend of mine she

552
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,079
actually went through some stuff and has

553
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,679
uh

554
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,658
a non-detectable but the THC Gene is

555
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,940
switched on it just isn't working and

556
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:15,240
that she had uh

557
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,279
not patented but uh you know got some

558
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,538
legal paperwork over because that's a

559
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,359
cool

560
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:24,900
uh trait you know what I mean

561
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,939
yeah yeah yeah certainly okay so they

562
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,280
sort of do need a little bit more um

563
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,480
mothering so to speak

564
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,940
I mean

565
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,798
there's like uh like weird stuff like

566
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,240
that like genetic abnormalities that

567
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,379
would be fun to Surf through you know

568
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,279
what I mean

569
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,900
and find like uh polyploids or like

570
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:44,220
there's some weird autoflowering genics

571
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,038
that kind of come and hemp too that's

572
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,659
nice I'm growing CBG this year outside

573
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,419
because

574
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,100
it doesn't run hot

575
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,840
and I just wanted to grow some plants

576
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,480
outside you know

577
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,178
okay so do you feel like maybe like the

578
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,579
CBG is like a the gene is like a bit

579
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,919
further located away so you don't you

580
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:06,538
like you rarely get THC being made in

581
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,179
conjunction with it

582
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:12,900
yeah like when you see a full like a 20

583
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:15,960
CBG plant there's rarely any any THC in

584
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,480
there well CBG is the precursor too all

585
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,038
the other ones so by bottlenecking it

586
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,659
right there it's not really able to

587
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:24,000
produce

588
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:27,059
you know other things

589
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,579
and why is it do you think that CBG has

590
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:31,798
only in the past few years got a

591
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,779
limelight sort of shined onto it whereas

592
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:35,400
CBD has you know sort of being touted

593
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:38,359
for a lot longer

594
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,860
you know man we didn't even know like

595
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:43,259
scientists had no idea there wasn't even

596
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,319
even an endocannabinoid system in your

597
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:49,740
body until like the mid 90s they

598
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,960
discovered it and um you know we're

599
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,900
still we're still

600
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,380
uh as a you know a community and stuff

601
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,000
discovering like all kinds of new

602
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,340
kind of you know like stuff in the

603
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,159
plants cannabinoids like just you know

604
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:07,558
terpenes like they're still like cbg's

605
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,780
been around for a little while it's just

606
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:12,000
uh you know as people

607
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,379
okay so we didn't have uh testing

608
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
equipment back in the day you know you

609
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,580
couldn't just take in Ohio especially

610
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,859
you just can't take your uh weed to a

611
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,000
lab and have them test it so that's why

612
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,918
you know that that wasn't really

613
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,079
available until everybody started to go

614
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,480
online with medical so now

615
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,980
like uh I like to have a lot of stuff

616
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,019
tested and that gives me a good idea of

617
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,000
what's going on in the plant and like

618
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,400
you could find those anomalies like I'm

619
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,460
sure through the CBD breeding uh

620
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,759
somebody found them G or high CBG plants

621
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,860
they're very prevalent in um

622
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,798
in Europe actually

623
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,058
like uh a lot of that the hemp that they

624
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,879
grow

625
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:53,099
is actually High cpg

626
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,500
and what sort of benefits do you think

627
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,439
CBG can bring to the table that maybe

628
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,058
CBD doesn't quite do as well

629
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,759
you know I know it's really good for

630
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:05,279
your brain and uh your bone structure

631
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,379
it's like a bone but at the same time

632
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,259
man CBG

633
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,120
uh has like I don't know what hair I

634
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,879
have growing and my fingernails grow

635
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:17,459
super fast and uh so I assume it's like

636
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,740
the same I like the the

637
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,620
I guess it's really

638
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,940
I haven't yet got to um really get in on

639
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,459
it I've just been

640
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,700
I just had it I've been growing it just

641
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,079
caused the last couple years and I kind

642
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,940
of Set It Off to the side after we

643
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,500
harvested it and I gave it to my dude to

644
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,480
make some suppositories for some cancer

645
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,579
patients so

646
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,460
um I guess technically I did try it but

647
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,658
I don't know

648
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,159
hey it's brilliant you bring that up

649
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,740
because I was gonna say you know I saw

650
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,960
on your Instagram you had those uh full

651
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,298
spectrum suppositories by the looks of

652
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,579
it I just wanted to ask you know do you

653
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:55,440
feel that um like suppository based

654
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:56,759
cannabinoids work pretty well I hadn't

655
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,778
heard much about that but I'd love to

656
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,460
hear more

657
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:01,380
here I can break this down this makes

658
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,960
perfect sense okay um

659
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,880
so you eat some weed right you eat let's

660
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,700
just say some oil it gets to your

661
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,120
stomach it gets subjected to a very low

662
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,980
PH from your stomach acid which does

663
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:16,678
things to it converts it does you know

664
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,500
then it gets shot over to your liver

665
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,538
and then that changes it into a whole

666
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,419
different chemical and then it gets into

667
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:27,480
your bloodstream right yep all right

668
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,460
ma'am so when you when you boof it

669
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,140
like it literally goes all the

670
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,700
cannabinoids without being converted

671
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,380
without being you know I mean go right

672
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,419
into your bloodstream via your

673
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,520
intestines you know that's like the most

674
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,799
absorbent thing ever

675
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,480
so and it doesn't get converted in any

676
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,819
way or like be subjected to chemical

677
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,460
changes or anything like uh literally

678
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:49,139
like the THD goes right into your blood

679
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,659
and like all that stuff just goes

680
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,220
straight up in there

681
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:54,539
ah fantastic you avoid first pass

682
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,659
metabolism

683
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:58,980
yeah right interesting interesting okay

684
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:02,520
and then what do you what's like the

685
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,960
onset time you know what man uh

686
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,579
all right

687
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,079
I decided

688
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:09,319
um because I gave my medicine to a

689
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:12,899
couple people I decided to try it myself

690
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:14,220
and uh I would just I would do it and go

691
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,980
to bed

692
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,079
you know what I mean I wasn't like uh

693
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,579
I I wasn't like doing it and like you

694
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,619
know running a marathon or trying to

695
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:26,879
stay up I just it would be like you know

696
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:29,339
take a shower do that go to bed wake up

697
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,340
now sometimes in the beginning I woke up

698
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:34,558
you know when you eat too much weed

699
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,959
that that hangover feeling I kind of had

700
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,879
that a couple times but nothing major I

701
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,960
don't really know what to say about my

702
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,179
personal

703
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,538
you know like I feel great in life in

704
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:48,960
general but I gave some to this um

705
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:51,720
one of my uh neighbor landlord uh his

706
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,480
friend who had just gotten stage one

707
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,919
rectal cancer and he's down to try it so

708
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,380
I gave some to him and he got his blood

709
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,940
test back and it didn't get any worse

710
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,700
but I think any better

711
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,500
so I think the next round that we make

712
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,100
for him there'll be a

713
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,960
more THC instead of a rounded Out full

714
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:12,839
spectrum you know

715
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,519
so so that's that's promising and I

716
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:17,399
think those will get you high like I've

717
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,639
heard stories about people uh you know

718
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,278
doing high high THC suppositories and

719
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,860
getting a buzz so we'll find out yeah it

720
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,319
makes sense I'll keep you posted cool

721
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:31,379
cool cool well look I would love to hear

722
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:34,259
from you know the horse's mouth what do

723
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,880
you think is the future of CBD lines

724
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:38,640
like as you mentioned in a prior answer

725
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,320
you can get it really quite cheap so

726
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,259
there may not even be much of an

727
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,200
argument to grow it yourself anymore

728
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:47,460
pillows and uh firewood

729
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,980
so you you think it's just going to

730
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,419
become so ubiquitously available that

731
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,819
like no one will really grow it anymore

732
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:56,278
and you just buy it if you need it I

733
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:58,798
mean I assume people still grow it like

734
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,700
but it's like big farms

735
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,798
um

736
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,840
I mean I saw they were getting down to

737
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:05,940
like uh

738
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,579
like two bucks a pound

739
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,200
and if you were buying like you know a

740
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:13,019
considerable amount

741
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,000
I mean if you're really pushing it out

742
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,558
I think you know

743
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,440
I mean I don't think people are gonna

744
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,379
stop growing it especially like as new

745
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,740
state you know now that okay so

746
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:29,100
this year is the first year that I have

747
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,019
been like federally legal to grow hemp

748
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:32,519
thanks to oddly enough Mitch McConnell

749
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,599
I'm not trying to give that dude a shout

750
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,079
out

751
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:39,298
and and even even a trump like not my

752
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:42,178
favorite people but they actually signed

753
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:44,158
the the farm bill that included the the

754
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,559
hemp thing and so I had to like go

755
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,679
through extra Hoops like register with

756
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,418
the USDA and go get fingerprinted for a

757
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,980
federal background check and all kinds

758
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,140
of stuff

759
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,200
so I assume there's like you know hemp

760
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,419
farms in every state now yeah

761
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,419
I just think we scale back from a few

762
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:07,020
years ago a few years ago it was like a

763
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:08,340
Monumental huge amount of people growing

764
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:10,319
like there was

765
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,359
acreage you know like

766
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:15,418
and now I think it's scaled back

767
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:16,259
considerably because of the you know a

768
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,960
lot of people don't want to grow

769
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:22,319
something they can't sell yeah certainly

770
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,140
certainly so I mean in terms of some of

771
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,178
the CBD lines you offer do you think

772
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,100
that like a reason someone might grab

773
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,840
one of those is because like they might

774
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:33,240
be able to find something that really

775
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,158
specifically works for their medical

776
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,558
issues or do you think that in general

777
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,600
like just getting any old CBD is

778
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,759
probably going to be about right if

779
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,298
you're talking about

780
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,558
any old CBD strain and I don't think no

781
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:48,359
I think they're all different you know

782
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:52,038
what I mean like uh

783
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,038
you know a lot of the stuff outside

784
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,580
you know there's different Terps like uh

785
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,558
and I think that comes along with a lot

786
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:00,359
of the same genetic makeup you get a lot

787
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,819
of nursing a lot of

788
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,500
berries cherries you know but now things

789
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,298
are starting to now we're getting lemon

790
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,919
limes and all that stuff and with those

791
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,179
come different effects you know what I

792
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,880
mean like uh

793
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,380
in a medicinal way like the way your

794
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,419
brain wants

795
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,220
you know like some people love smoking

796
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,620
this strain because it makes them feel

797
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,960
terrific and then some people they're

798
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,219
just not getting it and they like that

799
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,500
you know what I mean

800
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,200
because that's their body telling them

801
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,919
what medicine they like does that make

802
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,640
sense

803
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,159
yeah yeah certainly certainly so I

804
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,460
noticed on your Instagram page that you

805
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,899
mentioned cbdv and I have to admit I

806
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,819
really don't hear a lot about this at

807
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,579
all can you give us a little bit of info

808
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:46,019
about like what it might be used for and

809
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:47,158
do you plan to do anything with it in

810
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,278
the future

811
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:53,039
so I have a plant I call it four-way not

812
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:54,000
to be confused with the four-way THC

813
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,158
plant

814
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,880
um it's a pain in the ass

815
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:03,299
but it sits at one quarter THC one

816
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,399
quarter thcv one quarter CBD and one

817
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:07,980
quarter cbdv

818
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:10,739
and I the only option to do anything

819
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,419
with this is uh I'm gonna try and

820
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,500
feminize it on itself I think that would

821
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:16,080
be

822
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,519
yeah the best way to express you know

823
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,278
because I tried to put it on some THC

824
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,038
and it basically erased

825
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:24,538
like uh you know the majority of

826
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,579
everything in there and the THC

827
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:29,398
dominated it out so it's kind of Highly

828
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:31,859
unstable I'm not even sure what C uh

829
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,619
what cbdv would

830
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:37,199
I know the variant is like uh you know

831
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:41,339
and THC is like a appetite suppressant

832
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,620
and like a more Speedy or you know alert

833
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:46,859
high

834
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:50,158
I don't know what cbdb does we're uh

835
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:54,359
venturing out into the unknown I love it

836
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,940
it it's cool to see like uh I met this

837
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:59,158
guy was it a seed swap uh Duke and I

838
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,679
were up to his seed Swap and this dude

839
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,480
came up and he had like jars of uh

840
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,460
extract beautiful stuff smelled great

841
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,159
they didn't really get into it then I

842
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,919
ran into him on 420 and we were talking

843
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,019
and he went and learned like oil

844
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,820
extraction like how they do petroleum

845
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,679
and then they applied that to cannabis

846
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:20,639
and now they're going through

847
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:22,980
uh like fractionally and taking you know

848
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,120
cataloging every single substance that

849
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,220
comes over

850
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:28,199
and then he was like um

851
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,940
this one would get stuck in the top of

852
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,620
the distillate you know in the

853
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:35,340
or they call that the head you know

854
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:36,058
where it's hard as a rock so they took

855
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:40,918
that

856
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:43,379
and they call it uh cbdt as in trash

857
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,080
and he said it would harden up like a

858
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,659
Lego so they started selling it to the

859
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:51,778
road crews up there to mix with gravel

860
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:53,880
and fill in potholes

861
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:56,339
reflects my brain I was like so

862
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,860
impressed like with you know like the

863
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:02,819
sauce you're filling in potholes with

864
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:03,959
pot oh my God you know he found a peanut

865
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,538
butter strain

866
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,699
that like when he cracked the his

867
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:11,219
brother cracked the seeds it smelled

868
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,138
like peanut butter in the air like and

869
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,878
he he I was like come on man and he's

870
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,820
like no I'm serious I'm like really

871
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:20,279
so he's working on like if he can make

872
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,320
seeds you know take the hearts out or do

873
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,879
whatever it takes to emulsify that into

874
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,659
like a peanut butter for people who

875
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:26,659
can't eat peanut butter

876
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:32,939
and I'm just like

877
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:35,940
cannabis winning like new [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

878
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,599
my friend Erica her dad Tom is redoing a

879
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:41,760
house and purchased Stateside grown

880
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,338
insulation to do his house that has

881
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,839
rated better with the R value than the

882
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:48,599
pink stock

883
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,460
so it's I'm I'm excited I like you know

884
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,899
I've been I've been about this plant for

885
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,760
a long time it's nice to see it's

886
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:55,440
starting to finally get recognized for

887
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,540
Stuff

888
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,700
you mentioned earlier the Cherry candy

889
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,858
heart and before we dive into all of

890
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:04,439
that stuff I just wanted to ask one of

891
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:06,059
the comments I've heard a lot about CBD

892
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,858
in general is that a lot of the

893
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,380
varieties all have this common

894
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:12,059
denominated cherry smell do you think

895
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,140
that all comes from that cherry candy

896
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:15,139
how you referenced

897
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,639
well I can't say Arlo because panatonic

898
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,280
uh you know have you ever heard of Ringo

899
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:26,639
he he's passed he's like so he brought

900
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,760
out that uh a lot of good CBD too and it

901
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:32,460
wasn't so his his uh he did the

902
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,800
canatonic so that was where the Cherry

903
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,740
came from and I'm not really sure where

904
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,839
he had sourced his original CBD gear

905
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,779
from

906
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:43,858
so Ringo he he did the sour tsunami

907
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,960
right

908
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:48,659
I think so yeah

909
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,460
I I wanted to ask you because I I can

910
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:52,199
see you've worked with probably the

911
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,940
majority of the lines I'm about to

912
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:56,879
mention but if you look at sort of the

913
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,440
common CBD strains you see around you've

914
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,039
got as you mentioned the cannatonic

915
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,220
South tsunami Harlequin AC DC the Woo

916
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,539
which of them do you like the most or do

917
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:08,000
you think that they're all sort of a bit

918
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,199
different and offer different things

919
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,219
while I'm proud of the woo and

920
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,779
everything

921
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:19,098
that has horrible Terps and it's just uh

922
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:22,800
yeah it kind of has like a metallic

923
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:25,380
terpy kind of thing going on AC DC is an

924
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,320
awesome plant man I'm like uh

925
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,660
cantonics hours the sour tsunami was

926
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,440
kind of floppy you know like had more of

927
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:37,618
a like a a weak sativa kind of thing but

928
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,280
like the AC DC is a solid solid awesome

929
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,480
CBD plant like it grew fat It Made

930
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,920
Beautiful

931
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,719
like washes Bud that smelled of cherries

932
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,579
it's so weird like almost like a fruit

933
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,239
bowl like not even cherries like pear

934
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:56,280
and Cherry and like uh

935
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,919
peaches and like oh they're like that

936
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,079
all those fruits sit inside those kind

937
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,539
of those strains

938
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,420
and then berries like uh

939
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:08,940
they went and they did that cherry wine

940
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,579
and then through that they found some

941
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,220
Berry flavor and now that people are

942
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,380
like I said working to get more

943
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:18,179
of a flavor

944
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,099
uh

945
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:22,679
you know like like I said the boutique

946
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:24,900
stuff where they mix it with like wheat

947
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,059
and then bring it back to him

948
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:30,240
but uh in that original batch I gotta

949
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:33,659
say that AC DC was uh

950
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,338
that was a just a great pleasure to grow

951
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:36,539
you know I mean like some stuff's a

952
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:38,338
little more tricky

953
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:40,619
but

954
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:43,320
so that was my favorite but they all

955
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:47,220
kind of were like except for the woo uh

956
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,859
they all kind of were that same vibe

957
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:51,838
well once I did the Cherry things they

958
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:54,358
like that helped bring that out too I

959
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,980
assume like the because the Cherry back

960
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,380
on like all the other ones that were

961
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,780
similar cherry

962
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:06,079
were it's crazy though it was like

963
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:06,079
legitimate like cops are up tasting

964
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:12,480
brilliant yeah really intense cherry

965
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,640
flavor by the sounds of it just to loop

966
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,400
back on that cherry candaha do you think

967
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:20,279
that it is the case that a decent amount

968
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,660
of um afghanis probably has some CBD in

969
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,640
them or do you think that the one you

970
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,019
used was really like a diamond in the

971
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,059
rough

972
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:29,579
um you know what I don't

973
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,380
I don't think the Kandahar had any CBD

974
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:33,359
in it we were trying to use it for

975
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:38,160
structure because the original Cherry

976
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:40,980
was like a floppy thin plant that grew

977
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,440
you know it just wasn't

978
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,179
you know like a good Afghan is super

979
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,740
thick and hearty

980
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:49,199
you know what I mean so we were trying

981
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:50,338
to impart that kind of shape and

982
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,539
structure

983
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:56,279
into the the CBD plant because it wasn't

984
00:38:53,539 --> 00:39:00,059
the Cherry would not have survived like

985
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,220
in a field or you know

986
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:04,139
it just was a floppy like it would have

987
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:07,919
been destroyed by wind the whole deal so

988
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:09,719
to put the Afghan on it was strictly for

989
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,079
structure

990
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:16,139
what at the same time if you follow on

991
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,599
Instagram all those like uh the land

992
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:20,519
race guys and um

993
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,579
all those guys over there

994
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:25,139
like they go into Afghanistan they're

995
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,880
like doing all the

996
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:28,139
The

997
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,579
Strain reconnaissance kind of thing you

998
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:32,519
know what I mean like the collectors

999
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:34,859
Izzy and those guys uh

1000
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,079
like they they're finding uh like

1001
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:39,059
one-to-ones and stuff in some of the

1002
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,619
gear that they find in different regions

1003
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:44,940
you know

1004
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:46,559
in afghanis so I mean it's there

1005
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,880
I don't remember what the strain was but

1006
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:50,940
it was like you were saying it was only

1007
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,640
like at nine to ten

1008
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,679
yeah okay that's really interesting and

1009
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:58,259
I guess maybe sort of one of the final

1010
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,659
questions to round out some of the CBD

1011
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,420
topics we've covered is are there any

1012
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:05,159
particular CBD ratios that you're fond

1013
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,720
of for certain conditions or do you

1014
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:09,420
think it's all just a matter of personal

1015
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,459
body chemistry first off I don't I try

1016
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,659
to get medical advice or and I'm not a

1017
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,460
doctor but

1018
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:16,980
if I'm trying to treat somebody as

1019
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,139
cancer I would wreck well I would give

1020
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,460
them a one-to-one

1021
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:21,299
you know what I mean I don't recommend

1022
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,159
that I can't make medical

1023
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,000
recommendations but I think like you

1024
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:26,460
know

1025
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,599
I think ratios are important and then I

1026
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:33,300
think that like once say like a kid with

1027
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,400
epilepsy gets used to one ratio

1028
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,099
like that a different one helps I've

1029
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,139
seen that happen you know what I mean

1030
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:43,740
but basically like I like to give I

1031
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:46,139
think CBD is an important to like take I

1032
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:48,779
feed it to my dogs I felt like [ __ ] when

1033
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:51,179
I woke up this morning and uh like my

1034
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,160
back hurt and I went and ate some and I

1035
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:57,358
felt like a champion

1036
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:58,739
um that's just my personal you know

1037
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,598
uh

1038
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:04,379
but I mean yes I think certain people

1039
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,359
find better relief from different ratios

1040
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,300
definitely you know I don't think just

1041
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:11,639
CBD helps out anybody like the isolate

1042
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,740
stuff I think that's garbage I think I

1043
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,960
think even like taking a THC out like

1044
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:18,539
when I make these bottles I try and

1045
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,139
uh get my THC up as high as I can well

1046
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:23,579
I'll still be legal you know uh at point

1047
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:25,139
three percent

1048
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,060
I think that's important I think you

1049
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:29,279
need that whole Entourage you need all

1050
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:32,039
your all your cannabinoids

1051
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,680
like together to help you know we don't

1052
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,779
really know a ton ton about that like

1053
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:37,858
about the endocannabinoid system yet we

1054
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,500
got it all you know we don't know how

1055
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:43,980
certain things are it's hard you know

1056
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,119
different thing to be studying like

1057
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,880
so

1058
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,280
well yeah I I honestly without trying to

1059
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,440
give I'm not like a I'm not a doctor I'm

1060
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,980
just a guy who grows plants uh

1061
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,019
uh I do think that it that ratios are

1062
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,280
important and like like anything else

1063
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:01,500
man whatever

1064
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,780
like your body will let you know if

1065
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,940
you're doing good

1066
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:08,579
right like it'll tell you if that's what

1067
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,019
it wants like oh man I really and I

1068
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:12,780
smoked that

1069
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:14,940
OG cushers up it and it really like

1070
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:18,420
calmed my ass down and made my back stop

1071
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,820
hurting or that AC DC really like you

1072
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,858
know increased my appetite or you know

1073
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,900
stuff like that or like that [ __ ] Stone

1074
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:27,239
me out so much man I couldn't feel my

1075
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,740
body that was great you know all those

1076
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,078
things come from different definitely

1077
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,299
different ratios and you know different

1078
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:36,599
amounts of cannabinoids Within

1079
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,579
that you know it's I mean

1080
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,500
I mean we're still discovering new stuff

1081
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:43,560
but like there's so many out there that

1082
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:47,480
could be in the makeup of stuff that

1083
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,480
it's just amazing so

1084
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:52,320
I guess yeah I'm yeah I'm uh I'm

1085
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:55,079
dwindling here um I just don't want to

1086
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,760
be trying to make uh medical claims on

1087
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,519
the stuff you know like I'm trying to

1088
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,680
help people if it works but like I don't

1089
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,960
guarantee any of this because it's not

1090
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:07,219
legal here either they don't like you

1091
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,358
doing that yeah so true pardon my

1092
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:11,879
aversion to

1093
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:13,679
I think everybody needs cannabis and you

1094
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,019
know what works for you

1095
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,358
uh is definitely not what's going to

1096
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:21,179
work for the next guy

1097
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:23,039
yeah certainly I can I can appreciate

1098
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:24,659
the sentiment there

1099
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,219
um just one of the listener submitted

1100
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:28,858
questions that would slow in perfectly

1101
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:30,659
right here is someone said out of the

1102
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:34,500
strains you've made what would you

1103
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:38,039
recommend as the terpiest one to one you

1104
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:42,119
offer oh man uh I've only done one one

1105
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:43,380
to one like in all honesty that was but

1106
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,800
um

1107
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,180
I'm going to do one with my lemon G

1108
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,300
which

1109
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:50,299
um

1110
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:55,079
I don't know I I took it to Amsterdam

1111
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:58,380
and uh

1112
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,560
in 2011 and we got second

1113
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,079
uh it's one of the most Derpy lemony

1114
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,960
things ever so here in a minute I'm

1115
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,240
gonna do my one-to-ones that I have back

1116
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,579
on that and that should yield something

1117
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:13,379
good but technically the I don't even

1118
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,599
know if you can find them now because it

1119
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,940
was so long ago that I did that uh our

1120
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,220
initial CBD breeding you know like most

1121
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,559
of the strains have sold out and I mean

1122
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:25,618
I still have a bit of seed but they're

1123
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,880
probably getting aged you know so I

1124
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,980
guess the answer to that question would

1125
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,318
be uh wait and see because there's new

1126
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,480
ones coming I suppose

1127
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:36,179
brilliant something to look forward to

1128
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,440
and and uh just as sort of the same

1129
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:39,659
question but on the other end of the

1130
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,338
spectrum we had a listener asked

1131
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:43,338
um if I wanted to give something to a

1132
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:45,900
child that was going to hopefully be

1133
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:47,279
non-psychoactive but still high in CBD

1134
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,380
is there anything in particular you'd

1135
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,660
recommend

1136
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,720
well again

1137
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:53,719
um

1138
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,980
if you don't want to like you'd have to

1139
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,660
get an isolate

1140
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,980
um

1141
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:03,779
like if you don't want to get like

1142
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,179
there's going to be

1143
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,579
like do you mean by CBD like extract or

1144
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:11,519
like CBD strain

1145
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:13,680
uh just a strain I guess so they can

1146
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,059
sort of do what they need to with it I

1147
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,598
would probably want to find something

1148
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:18,599
real low uh

1149
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,040
you know if I was you know you don't

1150
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:26,420
want to be uh I can't Advocate getting

1151
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:29,759
children high as much as I'd like to

1152
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,818
and calm their little asses down

1153
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,740
um but you know uh most of the stuff

1154
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:37,318
that was given to children when we

1155
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:39,419
started doing that was real

1156
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,219
like low because you couldn't like I

1157
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,960
said you didn't want to be heat uh you

1158
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:45,598
know last thing you want is a stone kid

1159
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,880
with epilepsy I don't think that's a

1160
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,818
good thing so nowadays you can go get

1161
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,280
CBD oil I mean I you know I make it and

1162
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:55,199
then other people make it I mean so like

1163
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,720
I said you don't like to grow it and

1164
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:00,960
then to extract it and then uh it's just

1165
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:03,000
easier to find like a good source of

1166
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,039
like I personally Source all my stuff

1167
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,719
organically including my carrier oil and

1168
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,579
the flavors

1169
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,439
um

1170
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:12,000
but like yeah I would want something

1171
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,700
that would

1172
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,440
be the hemp there you go if you want to

1173
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:18,659
feed your kids some CBD make sure it's

1174
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,480
made from hemp that's a that's a

1175
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:24,118
reasonable sort of sentiment and full

1176
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,800
spectrum though I think is important in

1177
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,780
my opinion yeah

1178
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,660
in anybody eating it you know what I

1179
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:33,180
mean isolates and stuff or they have a

1180
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:35,098
ceiling where you know they work to an

1181
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:36,779
extent and then it stops working and

1182
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,700
then when you add in all those other

1183
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,400
cannabinoids you get the Entourage which

1184
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:44,519
helps carry it past that point

1185
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,960
yeah definitely definitely some uh some

1186
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:48,539
sensors I can get behind with the full

1187
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,400
spectrum stuff for sure so let's

1188
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,838
actually take it back now to the

1189
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,338
question we normally start off the

1190
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:54,960
interview with what have you been

1191
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:58,380
smoking on recently

1192
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,460
man uh JJ

1193
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:04,500
uh take me a pack of this

1194
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:06,300
dirty uh Taxi

1195
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,119
and then

1196
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,640
Duke here again like I

1197
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,858
there was I came home from uh uh read

1198
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,318
show and I had like ten thousand dollars

1199
00:47:13,858 --> 00:47:19,139
worth of seeds from every breeder like

1200
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,960
you know I traded them all CBD stuff and

1201
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:24,960
they all and um I started every

1202
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,519
basically almost all of them and I I

1203
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,880
ended up with two plants that kicked

1204
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:32,119
asses dirty taxi and uh one of Tommy's

1205
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,539
they're uh Duke skunk band

1206
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,539
V2s I do believe

1207
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,659
so um I've been smoking on that Taxi and

1208
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:43,739
I took and I I I crossed it with some

1209
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,559
stuff

1210
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:48,118
uh that was the last seed run that I did

1211
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:52,078
uh

1212
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:55,019
it's it's dank and so

1213
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,240
yeah I just it it fit it fits for what I

1214
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:59,039
like you know it's like a daytime a good

1215
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:03,118
day timer

1216
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:05,279
and I just now we're about to be

1217
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,780
we'll have all those seeds flowers

1218
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,660
coming up here by the end of summer

1219
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:13,980
seeing you know for some Fino selection

1220
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:17,539
but yeah basically the dirty taxi it's

1221
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:20,940
uh the GMO times that chem dog

1222
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:22,619
I-95 which has a couple OG's in there I

1223
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,780
do believe

1224
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:26,880
what a brilliant answer because I wanted

1225
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,859
to ask you I was looking specifically at

1226
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,440
some of the crosses you'd done and the

1227
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:33,059
uh the

1228
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:37,139
slv-o-g is a cool one and I wanted to

1229
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:39,179
ask do you in general prefer the sfv OG

1230
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:40,618
over the triangle and that's why I did

1231
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:42,779
it that way or is it just because the

1232
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:44,400
dirty taxi already had a bit of TK in it

1233
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,540
you were like you know I'll switch it up

1234
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,519
a bit

1235
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:49,980
actually the reason that I needed that

1236
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,539
and I worked so I live in a valley

1237
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,240
it's dirty

1238
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:55,380
and you know the next the next round

1239
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:57,479
will have the triangle in it because

1240
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,099
it's actually shaped like a triangle so

1241
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,980
I wanted to make like something that

1242
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:05,880
would uh work down here but

1243
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:09,358
you know I like to I love that sfe it

1244
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,940
it smells like weird like some cologne I

1245
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:14,818
wore is like a 21 year old trying to

1246
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,780
pick up chicks and like tennis balls and

1247
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:19,139
uh

1248
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:20,760
yeah it just it smokes and I I wanted to

1249
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:22,679
keep it I wanted to pull a little more

1250
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,000
OG out of that taxi because it's in

1251
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:28,980
there you know and um

1252
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,880
I find OG's like you know I want to grow

1253
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,619
them

1254
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,059
I would run a bunch of them if I could

1255
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,280
but they're always they're going to

1256
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:38,159
yield the greatest and they're kind of a

1257
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,960
finicky so you know maybe find something

1258
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,519
that's going to be a little more uh

1259
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,179
conducive to

1260
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:47,099
just being a nice plant to grow

1261
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:49,019
but the version two is going to have the

1262
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:52,440
uh the triangle up on there and then

1263
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:55,980
I'll work it back into like a solid

1264
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,838
you know not you know start effing it

1265
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,179
back a little

1266
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,279
yeah beautiful

1267
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:05,338
I did want to ask you because we we

1268
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,980
spoke about the um the the dirty taxi

1269
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:10,679
hybrids you did and I wanted to ask did

1270
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,119
you find a male in that same pack that

1271
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:13,618
you got the female or did you find the

1272
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:15,119
female and impressed you so much you

1273
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:17,900
were like I got to get some more go back

1274
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,900
and find a male

1275
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,900
um smoking the taxi now the last joint I

1276
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,579
got

1277
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,980
uh I've been saving it and there's a

1278
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:27,720
good re you know uh you know what the

1279
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:31,199
mail out of there

1280
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:32,879
uh I we had just my my buddy and I given

1281
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,858
it to him and he was like dude you gave

1282
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,260
me a mail and then he's like but I used

1283
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:40,679
it to make uh and we cross on something

1284
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:43,800
and it brought forth it really was you

1285
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:46,440
know a good representation of what the

1286
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:49,318
thing and you know what JJ

1287
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,338
uh is one of my favorite breeders the

1288
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:52,739
guy

1289
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:55,259
like really hits what I like to smoke

1290
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:57,259
and he's he's honest and he's good so I

1291
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,940
asked him like basically manless

1292
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:03,059
everybody I've seen that started one

1293
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,220
pack has gotten a winner in One

1294
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,680
Direction or the other

1295
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:10,679
you know I I got two that I really liked

1296
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,759
the female that I kept was more

1297
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:14,759
conducive

1298
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,980
like uh growth wise and I like the herb

1299
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,300
on the it's got a little more GMO in

1300
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,240
there uh

1301
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:24,059
and it bangs out like the weight so I

1302
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:26,578
kept that one as my female and then the

1303
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:28,200
the other one the the males kind of got

1304
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:31,920
a

1305
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:36,239
like a pissier smell to him like uh but

1306
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,220
he he came correct with the the the

1307
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:41,039
dirty jeans you know what I mean

1308
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:44,578
everybody that has started them is you

1309
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:47,639
know I'm seeing all the nice uh

1310
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:49,740
I guess a phenotypical expression you

1311
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:52,618
know that I would expect and then I

1312
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:54,299
wanna I made some dirty dirties but you

1313
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:56,880
know that's not my gear but I want to

1314
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,980
see if I can even work it back a little

1315
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,440
bit just so I can have one that is very

1316
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,579
represent representing the one that I

1317
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,740
like a lot

1318
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:07,380
you know like it's a little stretchier

1319
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:09,719
with nice big and that's what I'm seeing

1320
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,760
uh in in

1321
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:15,118
like it's pretty dominant in a lot of

1322
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:20,040
stuff when it see what it seems but

1323
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:22,680
uh I did find I found a great plant in

1324
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,480
two three great plants in one pack of I

1325
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:28,199
think what 12.

1326
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,358
hell yeah that's beautiful and another

1327
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:33,000
strand from that line the trash eclair

1328
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:34,500
it looked great because it sort of

1329
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,358
seemed like it's aimed for the general

1330
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,858
grower you know like it's THC dominant

1331
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:40,019
there's some pretty recognizable names

1332
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:43,078
in terms of the parents got like the

1333
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:44,880
forearm cut in there you've also got

1334
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,460
another cross you know the super silver

1335
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,440
haze with the the diaper I guess I

1336
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:52,199
wanted to ask what stimulated you to

1337
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,940
move to these more THC dominant crosses

1338
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:55,939
compared to the prior work you've done

1339
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:03,300
well I mean so the last project that I

1340
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:07,140
did before the dirty taxi was a ton of

1341
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:08,220
like hand collected land races from like

1342
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:10,739
uh

1343
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:14,338
wow we had

1344
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:18,419
some like Siri and stuff we had some

1345
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:20,578
African we had like a like uh

1346
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,260
a lot of hash producing so man I'm

1347
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:24,119
trying to remember this a while ago the

1348
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,800
last car guy which is like actually one

1349
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:29,099
of my favorite

1350
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:31,380
plants it's like a pre-bubba Bubba

1351
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:34,500
and it's got um

1352
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:38,400
like heavy coffee and like tobacco and

1353
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:40,800
leather and stuff like that and then

1354
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,480
like I knew that uh Duke and I were

1355
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,980
gonna start working together

1356
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,800
and I wanted to put something together

1357
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,960
where you know I want to work the I want

1358
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,940
to work more dirty stuff out

1359
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,519
so I took what I you know I had and I

1360
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,200
thought I would work with it because I I

1361
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,019
have some stuff like that I didn't think

1362
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:01,799
would pair well but uh

1363
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:03,539
just and and as time goes on you'll see

1364
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,220
a lot of those show up and a lot of

1365
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:08,039
stuff that I'm like I said we're looking

1366
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:11,338
for that sour lemon male it's gonna be

1367
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:12,900
you know and like so some of these

1368
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:14,699
and like I'm gonna work back that

1369
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,818
slv-o-g

1370
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:20,578
and I just think it's

1371
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:22,558
I don't know I like that not only do I

1372
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:27,240
like to really like the flower it's

1373
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:29,220
beautiful and just nasty but this the I

1374
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:30,439
like a big plant you know like I like a

1375
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:34,618
big

1376
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:36,900
like the the G13 cross should

1377
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:38,880
that's a small plant you know like that

1378
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,700
it'll be

1379
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,338
just amazing to have a lot bigger

1380
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:47,460
heavier yielding of some of you know

1381
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:49,259
like and it's gross

1382
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,599
so I was like you know what I want to

1383
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,300
breed this together I think you know and

1384
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,940
I had all this stuff that I really like

1385
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,079
so I it actually was more of a

1386
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,838
like I knew we were going to move into

1387
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,599
more THC lines but I really

1388
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:06,239
like was like like I found this plant

1389
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,559
and it was so awesome that I basically

1390
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,858
just

1391
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:14,700
like uh I don't smoke anything else if I

1392
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:16,199
don't have to like uh I I it's just you

1393
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:17,399
know when you find and so I wanted to

1394
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:19,618
make sure

1395
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,240
you know put it on my favorite stuff and

1396
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:22,680
then I thought you know that's kind of

1397
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:24,539
why I did that

1398
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:28,679
and then a lot of those are like I said

1399
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:30,779
will be used in further down the line

1400
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:32,578
that's brilliant and I love that you

1401
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,319
mentioned that like you know having that

1402
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,900
bigger yield was important because

1403
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,239
something that has been talked about for

1404
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,160
a while admittedly but is coming up more

1405
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:43,379
and more when I talk to different guests

1406
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:45,118
is that a lot of people have this

1407
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,119
growing feeling that we're sort of

1408
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,880
backing ourselves up against the wall

1409
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:53,280
with forever decreasing yields sort of

1410
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,599
seems like as the years go by things are

1411
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,559
just getting smaller and smaller

1412
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,660
yielding

1413
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:58,800
what's your thoughts on this do you is

1414
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:00,000
it something you're consciously trying

1415
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,940
to battle

1416
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,619
yeah it's like that man like the most of

1417
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,940
it like it's always like damn if only

1418
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:08,160
that one was a little bigger and it

1419
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,720
seems you know as uh

1420
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,858
so then you take those small plants and

1421
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:13,139
they breed those small plants and you

1422
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:15,000
get progressively smaller plants you

1423
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:18,299
know like the biggest yielders are never

1424
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,039
the most amazing like you know you're

1425
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,380
not they're not the Super fro you know

1426
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:25,440
and what you know it seems that the the

1427
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:27,240
most bangers are just that's like the

1428
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,599
cruel joke from

1429
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:33,539
uh you know from the plant itself like

1430
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:38,220
yeah man wouldn't you love a giant like

1431
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:39,779
super yielding but yet like Banger and I

1432
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:41,818
think that's that you know I did find

1433
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,160
that I found that in the taxi and I

1434
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:48,239
found that in uh that skunk band beat

1435
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:49,318
too like uh I pulled down all these if I

1436
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,439
had some outdoor plants that I had

1437
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:55,800
pollinated just for fun and uh we were

1438
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,480
breaking it up and like you know uh

1439
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,460
like doing

1440
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,440
like and there was like a bunch of hash

1441
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,699
like I had her breaking them up with

1442
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,519
gloves and the hatches falling through

1443
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:07,379
the trim tray and uh we did like three

1444
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,780
plants before that and ended up with

1445
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,059
like I don't know let's call it like an

1446
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,740
ounce of Keith she got on that plant and

1447
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,720
it yielded like three

1448
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:18,358
like one plant yield as much as the

1449
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:19,679
other three plants times three on that

1450
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:22,679
skunk band

1451
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:24,779
and it was it was like the I don't know

1452
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:27,719
and we called it the what the [ __ ] me

1453
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:29,099
and my buddy because like I he kept

1454
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:32,279
breaking he would break it up I gave him

1455
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:34,079
uh uh some and he would

1456
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,400
he would be breaking it up and I would

1457
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,200
catch it out of nowhere and I'd be like

1458
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:41,519
what the hell so

1459
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:43,439
like I I think I found two very good

1460
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,199
you know representations of something

1461
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,220
that that's gonna yield a bit and have

1462
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,939
like

1463
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:53,219
uh quite a you know especially that

1464
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,900
skunk band I think I got some seeds I

1465
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,219
made of it around here I think I made

1466
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,358
some dirty ones

1467
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:00,000
uh

1468
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,279
hopefully they will uh

1469
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,780
you know that if you could find a middle

1470
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,500
of the road down that it's going to be

1471
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,500
great

1472
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:11,039
that's some interesting news I I guess I

1473
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:13,739
would love to sort of like follow that

1474
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,558
logic through and then say would then

1475
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:19,019
you sort of agree that by that logic we

1476
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,780
would say that like cookies is better

1477
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:24,119
than TK or chemdog because it yields

1478
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,740
less and like as things get better they

1479
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,220
yield less

1480
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:32,879
nah man I wouldn't do that uh

1481
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:34,679
as much as uh it's kind of custied out a

1482
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,599
little bit it's a really easy plant to

1483
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:39,358
grow you know what I mean like it yields

1484
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:41,519
well this it smokes really well and it

1485
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:44,039
grows phenomenally like easy like

1486
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,960
whereas other things are a little more

1487
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:47,940
finicky and

1488
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,699
I just think uh

1489
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,260
I mean I get good yields I grew uh some

1490
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:54,659
of that form about a while ago I like

1491
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:57,059
that I enjoyed smoking it and it it

1492
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:59,098
wasn't like a depressing yield or you

1493
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:00,298
know

1494
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,640
yeah

1495
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:05,280
definitely I feel like cookies does get

1496
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:07,739
quite a bad rap and I think it was CSI

1497
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,540
who said that um you know if I'd never

1498
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:11,939
seen cookies on Instagram or heard about

1499
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:12,838
it and you just gave me a bud to try I'd

1500
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,940
probably tell you that's some of the

1501
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:17,519
best weight I've ever had what's your

1502
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:20,519
thoughts on that

1503
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:23,639
I enjoy smoking it I don't think cookies

1504
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:25,798
is like the best at anything uh

1505
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:27,719
it's you know there obviously there is a

1506
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:30,900
reason that um

1507
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:34,139
it's been you know recently seems to be

1508
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:36,720
the bottom [ __ ] in everything you know

1509
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:38,940
like it and that's cool like it went

1510
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,679
that way but like uh

1511
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:42,119
I'm looking forward to smoking this

1512
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:43,379
Durban tie

1513
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:45,119
you know what I mean I'm looking forward

1514
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,119
to smoking the skunk I'm looking forward

1515
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,579
to like that's all good I don't I like

1516
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:51,780
my herb dank and funky as opposed to

1517
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,700
like

1518
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,740
sweet and

1519
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:58,139
I don't know it's weird now or there's

1520
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:00,479
new strains out that I don't think they

1521
00:59:58,139 --> 01:00:02,298
really have much Terps going on they're

1522
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:07,139
just you know people name them weird

1523
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:09,420
cookie [ __ ] you know the trash eclair

1524
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:12,000
that was because there was already you

1525
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:13,380
know the GMO is cookies in a way so I

1526
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,519
figured you know reinforce that it's

1527
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:18,180
kind of like some

1528
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:19,380
what would you call that outcross BX is

1529
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:21,679
there a name for that what do you think

1530
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:25,500
like so it's cookies in there it's still

1531
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:27,358
back in there like but it's a few out

1532
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,900
you could say it's it's like an increase

1533
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,880
of sorts so but that was uh I named that

1534
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,619
uh you ever watched Seinfeld yeah yeah

1535
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,720
George

1536
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:38,880
I named that trash eclair that's where

1537
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:41,519
George was like ew that woman caught him

1538
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,460
eating that yeah that's yeah good stuff

1539
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:45,659
uh but I mean I thought that that would

1540
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,280
be a good

1541
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:51,179
like I like the structure of the cookies

1542
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,559
and you know it it is good I don't think

1543
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:53,759
it's the best weed I've ever smoked

1544
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,000
though

1545
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,799
yeah Fair call so

1546
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,260
um I would be interested to hear I was

1547
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,818
cruising on your Instagram and I saw you

1548
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:06,540

1549

1557
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:28,019
but that's the one that we crossed the

1558
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,980
dirty with that first time and uh

1559
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:34,619

1561
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:39,298
Jim Leahy

1562
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:41,818
I mean as a very uh

1563
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:45,239
I was a very dedicated Trailer Park Boys

1564

1566
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:52,519
puck in there what are their pucks doing

1567
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:52,519
that's hockey all day so

1568
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:56,459
gotta have some kind of Canadian

1569
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:59,399
reference right

1570
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:01,500
oh dude I'm such a massive fan of

1571
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,420
trailer park boys and I cannot for the

1572
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,880
life of me get my lady to watch it with

1573
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:08,099
me she won't have a bar but

1574
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,980
my ex girl girlfriend might be the one

1575
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:14,220
that got away her name is Corey she got

1576
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:15,960
a dog and named him Trevor

1577
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:17,578
like she might be the one that escaped

1578
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,159
you know what I mean like ah

1579
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:21,480
that's pretty cool that's awesome that's

1580
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,920
awesome

1581
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,960
um you mentioned a little earlier that

1582
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,338
one of your projects not long ago was

1583
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,838
that you were working with some land

1584
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:30,900
races and I did notice on your Instagram

1585
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:32,880
you'd posted the the Durban the swazi

1586
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,460
and the Moroccan like the little labels

1587
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,380
what would they like to work with and do

1588
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,599
you think that sort of the Nostalgia

1589
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,579
people have around land races is like

1590
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,160
worth the hype or like it is a bit of

1591
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:46,920
nostalgia

1592
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:48,298
okay that's an awesome question actually

1593
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,900
um

1594
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:53,818
in all honesty like uh Duke and I agree

1595
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,559
on this heavily like there's something

1596
01:02:53,818 --> 01:02:58,920
to be said about going back you know

1597
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:01,079
like I I got this beautiful lash car uh

1598
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,818
pck Outback we're gonna do some work

1599
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:05,099
with that

1600
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:06,420
so the Durban let's start there

1601
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:08,960
um you know a lot of Durban that you get

1602
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:12,119
here like the one that is in the cookies

1603
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,579
uh that oddly enough that extract guy

1604
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:17,579
that fills the potholes with the pot he

1605
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:21,420
gave the Durban to Berner

1606
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:24,660
uh now that's an old like that comes

1607
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:26,280
from the uh Holland and that's crossed

1608
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:28,199
with an unknown indica

1609
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,559
so that's not why you get those big

1610
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:34,980
dumpy Derby buds over here whereas the

1611
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:38,940
seeds that I started my buddy uh

1612
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:40,920
how from Israel he went and I guess he

1613
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,960
was on uh

1614
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,940
I guess he was on vacation but he went

1615
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,920
all everywhere that those seats that are

1616
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:51,798
from he was there like collecting seeds

1617
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,798
and so Durbin in the wild is a much more

1618
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:58,920
yeah scraggly uh but I mean the Terps

1619
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,659
were there so

1620
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,539
it was I mean

1621
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:05,519
it was

1622
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:07,739
a lot of those that you you know it's

1623
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:10,079
hard to work with a lot of stuff like

1624
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:11,699
that because it doesn't you know you

1625
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,579
want to see

1626
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:17,879
like amazing flower but it does have

1627
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:21,420
that like Crow magnet kind of

1628
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:23,640
you know uh older school but when you

1629
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:26,639
smoke it it's phenomenal

1630
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:28,858
the Moroccan man that was oh that was

1631
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:31,379
great it was like legitimate hash like

1632
01:04:28,858 --> 01:04:33,000
you like it was just a big old well not

1633
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:36,059
even a big old like a just a hash plant

1634
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,619
it was beautiful and it smoked well and

1635
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:39,900
this you know the

1636
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:40,798
working with those was great

1637
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:44,338
um

1638
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:48,119
because we seeded them it I it was uh I

1639
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:50,699
smoked a lot of you know the it was

1640
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:52,858
awesome man actually uh but I don't

1641
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:54,058
recommend unless you want to do

1642
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:58,980
something like that like there's there's

1643
01:04:54,059 --> 01:05:01,859
good afghanis that are are wonderful you

1644
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:04,559
know uh that those guys they actually

1645
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:06,779
sell but like if you know

1646
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,460
it's not commercially viable to start

1647
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:10,079
like these Thai seeds that I have

1648
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,059
because you know they have a propensity

1649
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,460
for hermaphroditism and all that and

1650
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:16,859
then they don't produce these buds but

1651
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:19,500
if you're into like really weird

1652
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:21,239
right good Buzz is like a lot of African

1653
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:24,480
stuff you know what I mean you get that

1654
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:27,598
thcv because it's on the equator

1655
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,000
and I mean I do think that like I bet

1656
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:33,900
now that you get to see those guys in in

1657
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,099
Afghanistan and in uh all those little

1658
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,500
places where they're collecting those

1659
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:39,539
seeds and they're showing like the you

1660
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,920
know the the selections that the farmers

1661
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:43,019
have selected

1662
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,059
in that region you know they're doing

1663
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:47,579
their own breeding technically you know

1664
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:50,460
as they grow like the the more the

1665
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:52,798
farmers in Afghanistan that are you know

1666
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:55,139
have been growing for Generations like

1667
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:56,639
they're doing their own selections you

1668
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:58,078
know they're not

1669
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,358
does that make sense

1670
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,460
yeah

1671
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:04,199
I think it's it's great I think that

1672
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,358
there's a lot of great things that you

1673
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:08,879
could like

1674
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:11,699
I don't think inbreeding all like the

1675
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,760
your cookie strains is a great

1676
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:15,719
you know way to get anything but you

1677
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,180
know you're not going to get a lot of

1678
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:22,519
diversity out of that

1679
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:22,519
yeah had the combos in the fridge

1680
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:28,920
um

1681
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:31,798
yeah I mean I love land-based work uh

1682
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:34,019
my lime tar that I just bred with that

1683
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:35,579
dirty is like the limest thing ever it

1684
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:38,639
smells like

1685
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,619
fresh like fresh limes like just

1686
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,538
squeezed and then

1687
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:45,000
like a weird

1688
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:46,799
Turkish Bazaar over the top with like

1689
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,920
flowers and like

1690
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:53,280
goofy stuff and then on the other Fino

1691
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,720
it's got like chocolate and mint and

1692
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,059
like

1693
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,818
so and that all came from Land rate

1694
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:03,180
stuff you know what I mean like uh

1695
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:05,460
so I I gotta say like I think that it's

1696
01:07:03,179 --> 01:07:08,338
gonna be you know I think that we're

1697
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:10,380
gonna find a lot more awesome derps and

1698
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:12,358
stuff like that in that then we're going

1699
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:15,298
to like in uh

1700
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:16,380
you know whatever the next cookie strain

1701
01:07:15,298 --> 01:07:19,380
is

1702
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:21,960
I think he was releasing a fish scale or

1703
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:24,838
some along those lines which is not

1704
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:27,659
something you should name cannabis

1705
01:07:24,838 --> 01:07:29,460
yeah right there's been a lot of uh

1706
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:32,818
discussion around that one and I think

1707
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:34,260
it might even be a rename strain but

1708
01:07:32,818 --> 01:07:35,699
we'll uh we'll hear more about that

1709
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:38,160
later but I wanted to follow up because

1710
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:41,399
those land races you just spoke about

1711
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:43,980
you cross them to the lgk which I

1712
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,280
believe is an Afghani can you tell us a

1713
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:52,318
bit about that and was it a CBD Rich one

1714
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:55,740
no pcq oh it was pck so pck is the

1715
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:59,579
Pakistani citroli Kush that I got from

1716
01:07:55,739 --> 01:08:00,618
boating he at the emerald cup he was

1717
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:03,119
just like

1718
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:07,200
like some kind of little

1719
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:10,079
like I don't know that he just kicked me

1720
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:13,078
like uh 50 or 100 and we went through

1721
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,298
them and picked out like that stuff just

1722
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:17,759
turns real purple and that's where that

1723
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:20,399
perfumey

1724
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,899
top end of the chirps comes like that

1725
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,159
turkishy weird

1726
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:25,559
because that you know it smells like

1727
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:28,139
incense and uh

1728
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,960
what is the blood structure on that is

1729
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:33,539
just uh not awesome you know what I mean

1730
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,838
it was Fluffy but it brought like this

1731
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:39,719
whole bunch of amazing

1732
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:41,159
chirps that you just don't really get

1733
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:43,079
so

1734
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:45,659
and then

1735
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:49,198
like that we were trying to breed stuff

1736
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:51,420
that because I I'm up at 8080 feet

1737
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,818
which is about where all those High

1738
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,560
regions and mountains are you know

1739
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:58,460
so we were trying to go you know

1740
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:01,560
intentionally like the season here is

1741
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:03,359
ridiculously short like uh I've been

1742
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,279
I've grown outdoor and I got my hemp

1743
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,900
side you know I grew up my CBG on that

1744
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,259
side and that luckily that stuff

1745
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:13,019
finishes up but like uh

1746
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:16,380
trying to grow outdoor out here is such

1747
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:18,839
a a pain like I grow these beautiful

1748
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:20,759
plants all the way up and then

1749
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:22,140
like right at the beginning of October

1750
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:25,738
you get this

1751
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:28,739
like horrible week a torrential hail and

1752
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:30,119
like shitty wind and you know what I

1753
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:31,919
mean so

1754
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:34,019
unless you're covered in a greenhouse

1755
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,119
you really not gonna be able to pull

1756
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:38,819
anything off because it's all gonna get

1757
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:41,640
messed up so we were trying to breed

1758
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:44,940
you know for the

1759
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:46,980
altitude and stuff like in the time so

1760
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:48,979
the it's nice because all those

1761
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:51,419
like a lot of those Afghans finish off

1762
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:55,019
relatively shortly and are used to like

1763
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:57,779
this kind of same altitude so

1764
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:58,980
you know might as well mimic

1765
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:02,460
like

1766
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:04,198
you know the same kind of environment

1767
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:06,239
right I mean it's that's we're kind of

1768
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:09,000
like Afghanistan temperatures like cold

1769
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:12,479
snow you know all that [ __ ]

1770
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,520
so that was the thought process on using

1771
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,678
that plus I wanted to keep it real

1772
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,960
still land racy you know like I didn't

1773
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:23,000
want to like it didn't need to be like

1774
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,920
uh pck times cookies you know

1775
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,500
yeah certainly that makes sense I uh

1776
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,940
I've been LED down the wrong path by

1777
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,679
seed finder on that that's interesting

1778
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:33,839
pck and that makes sense because I saw

1779
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,539
you had worked with that one of the

1780
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,420
listener questions we got is are there

1781
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:41,219
any other land races that you've got

1782
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:43,679
your site set on working with in the

1783
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:46,800
future and what uh land race in general

1784
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:50,940
do you think is the most interesting

1785
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:53,760
uh I got a pack so my buddy a good

1786
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:55,139
friend of mine Went Down To Jamaica and

1787
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,039
was hanging out down there for a couple

1788
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:58,380
weeks

1789
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:01,019
and he was trying to find seeds and then

1790
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:03,119
on the last day this old head you know

1791
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:06,420
what I mean like that really old head

1792
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:08,460
that old dude with the dreadlocks that

1793
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:11,219
just you know what I mean like rolls up

1794
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:12,840
on him and it's like uh hey man I heard

1795
01:11:11,219 --> 01:11:14,340
you were looking for the Lamb's bread

1796
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:17,279
and your hands in this bag and he's like

1797
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,960
this is my family's genetics and it's

1798
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:20,698
been worked for like three to four

1799
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,020
generations

1800
01:11:20,698 --> 01:11:24,960
uh

1801
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:27,360
uh so I have legitimate Jamaican lamb

1802
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,100
bread and I don't know of anyone else

1803
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,079
with that

1804
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,000
um

1805
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:35,279
you know so I'm gonna try and

1806
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,899
make more obviously out of that start

1807
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:39,479
them up we'll see how it is you know

1808
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:41,460
what if it's just cookies

1809
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:44,819
you never know he might have just

1810
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:46,800
selected some you know

1811
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:49,559
but hopefully hopefully it's legitimate

1812
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,860
and then uh

1813
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:55,140
you know I I like a good weird wild

1814
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:57,299
sativa

1815
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,579
but I don't like it to

1816
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,560
you know I don't want to grow like 20

1817
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:03,479
week cases

1818
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,420
so I mean it's nice to see things like

1819
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:07,859
Ty popping up now we're gonna work with

1820
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:09,420
some of that I guess

1821
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:11,759
Maybe

1822
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,219
uh

1823
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,480
yeah and like I am going to continue

1824
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:19,319
we're going to work I think we're gonna

1825
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:21,479
do some youth work the U is by pck lash

1826
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:23,519
guard guy which like I said is the last

1827
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:25,079
place they actually smoke flour in

1828
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,600
Afghanistan maybe I didn't mention that

1829
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:28,920
uh as opposed to making it a hash

1830
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,020
you know

1831
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,940
and that's the one that has that like

1832
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:35,760
pre-bubba Bubba feel

1833
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:37,198
and then the U is like the limey one and

1834
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,460
then it's the chocolate one too so we're

1835
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:42,059
gonna put some stuff into that and I

1836
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:44,219
have a the Lash car just pck lash guard

1837
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:48,000
that looks beautiful that will probably

1838
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:49,859
work do some work with

1839
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,079
um

1840
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:54,000
yeah I'm super stoked about that

1841
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:58,738
actually

1842
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,760
I mean in a world of poly hybrid you

1843
01:12:58,738 --> 01:13:02,218
know

1844
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,640
is like just some

1845
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:09,239
basically not basic but like

1846
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,920
not yeah like not bread to death

1847
01:13:09,238 --> 01:13:14,399
you know a little diversity you know

1848
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:17,340
it's nice like different stuff like

1849
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:20,279
yeah right

1850
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:22,319
yeah it sounds nice man an injection of

1851
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:25,198
some fresh blood is always welcome in my

1852
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:27,238
opinion and you sort of touched on

1853
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:29,219
um you know it ties and I think you

1854
01:13:27,238 --> 01:13:30,779
mentioned Haze in there and I've noticed

1855
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:32,880
that in the past

1856
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:35,099
maybe a year or so like more or less

1857
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,380
since Neville's passing Hayes has sort

1858
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:39,780
of become a bit more popular in the uh

1859
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:41,279
the community dialogue and I wanted to

1860
01:13:39,779 --> 01:13:43,619
know what's your thoughts on this do you

1861
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:46,880
ever want to work with some hazes and do

1862
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,880
you do you see it taken off

1863
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:50,819
well

1864
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:53,939
um I love my super silver haze and we

1865
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:55,679
have another Super Silver Haze here uh

1866
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:59,039
I'm looking forward to doing some work

1867
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:02,399
with those I really like that uh now as

1868
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:03,300
far as giant hazes go like those big

1869
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:06,420
um

1870
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:09,060
Tony from Boneyard great guy uh he had

1871
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:10,920
sent me some of his Haze on Hayes so

1872
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:13,620
it's basically he like had these giant

1873
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:16,679
vials of them so

1874
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:19,679
and then a friend just uh went

1875
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:23,460
over season grabbed all Neville's gear

1876
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:25,560
and stuff so we have all those in the I

1877
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:28,439
think we're calling it The Federation so

1878
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,820
in the Federation I do believe that a

1879
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:32,519
lot of Neville's work is going to start

1880
01:14:29,819 --> 01:14:34,738
popping back up

1881
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,060
you know I like the you know Liz I

1882
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:39,359
listened to

1883
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:41,039
the piss episode or the done show I had

1884
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:44,219
never smoked papaya you know what I mean

1885
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:47,399
I had no idea it was just a nl5 pays

1886
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:49,859
and uh they had these old school guys on

1887
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:52,439
talking about growing it and

1888
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:53,698
they were just like it was so easy you

1889
01:14:52,439 --> 01:14:56,639
just

1890
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:59,339
started from flower the minute it roots

1891
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:02,039
and then you know you save on like and I

1892
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:04,560
was like damn that is

1893
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:07,859
okay so yeah if you only have like a

1894
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,659
week or two or a veg and you got like 16

1895
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:12,000
or 18 weeks of flour

1896
01:15:09,658 --> 01:15:14,279
but it's on 12 and 12. you're going to

1897
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,158
save all that money on your veg

1898
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:18,119
and be able to you know

1899
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:19,920
um

1900
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:21,960
so I think that's pretty cool I've never

1901
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,600
done anything like that I've never just

1902
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,698
been like up if we started now in 20

1903
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,100
weeks it'll be done and it'll fill up

1904
01:15:26,698 --> 01:15:31,979
the whole room I've never

1905
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:33,719
really uh gotten down with anything like

1906
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:35,339
that so it'd be fun

1907
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:37,739
yeah

1908
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:40,739
but it's it's like I have I have the

1909
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:42,658
ceiling height for it that's nice

1910
01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:43,799
um it's a big commitment hold on where's

1911
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:47,039
the

1912
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,480
I'm cooking my dog's food as we speak

1913
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:51,000
um

1914
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:53,399
like and it's literally cooking like I I

1915
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,399
turkey and elk and then I gotta chop up

1916
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:58,799
this broccoli and then rice oh beautiful

1917
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:01,198
these dogs spoiled

1918
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,060
well so uh I moved to this little tiny

1919
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:05,579
town right I didn't know what I was

1920
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:09,179
gonna do man I moved this like the cops

1921
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:11,460
came to my spot in Denver and we're like

1922
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:12,960
uh you're only allowed six plants I'm

1923
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,179
like but I'm a caregiver

1924
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,920
and uh they're like sorry we passed a

1925
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:18,300
city ordinance let's see your garden and

1926
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,000
they went in and you're like holy [ __ ]

1927
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,980
wow look at that this is nice man sorry

1928
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,719
you're gonna have to cut it shut it down

1929
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:26,339
so I was like well

1930
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:29,039
so I had to move somewhere that was

1931
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:32,640
respecting you know people that still

1932
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:34,319
take care of people and uh

1933
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,760
so I found this place and I didn't know

1934
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:37,439
how you know I was going to acclimate

1935
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:42,000
into a Spanish Town either like

1936
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:44,158
everybody here is basically uh Spaniard

1937
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,020
like not Mexican there's there's some

1938
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:49,139
Mexican people in my town but basically

1939
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:50,460
like these guys came up from Mexico and

1940
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,619
they're they were Spanish and they

1941
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,840
settled in mine you know

1942
01:16:52,619 --> 01:16:57,840
so that like my landlord looks like a

1943
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:01,319
conquistador kind of

1944
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:04,380
um and you know so it's like

1945
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:06,899
so I started like giving out

1946
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:09,480
CBD and everything you know because

1947
01:17:06,899 --> 01:17:11,399
there's a lot of old people I I we made

1948
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:14,819
some dude

1949
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:17,939
um some cancer meds you know and then uh

1950
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:20,340
I'm at The Butcher and The Butcher his

1951
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:21,599
hands hurt so I gave him CBD and His

1952
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,600
Hands didn't hurt so he could continue

1953
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:28,320
butchering and we made friends and uh

1954
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:30,360
you know now uh in the fall when he

1955
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,039
harvests you know when people bring him

1956
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:34,319
the elk and the deer and all everything

1957
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:38,519
he just gives me all the scraps

1958
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:40,979
so I just you know uh a this is better

1959
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:43,500
than dog food you know what I mean and B

1960
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:46,859
it's cheaper technically to buy like

1961
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:51,140
rice and broccoli and just uh you know

1962
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:51,139
do it like this plus I like cooking

1963
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:55,260
and it's really good for them you know

1964
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:57,119
like uh my last dogs

1965
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:59,219
because I do believe because they had a

1966
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,399
good healthy diet and CBD they lived at

1967
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:05,640
17. nice that's pretty good

1968
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:08,719
and that's yeah that's I mean the new

1969
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:12,659
guy here he's eating like lion's mane

1970
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:14,399
and uh all kinds of stuff up front I got

1971
01:18:12,658 --> 01:18:15,179
like a mushroom blend because I'm trying

1972
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:17,039
to

1973
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:20,000
you know I want to see how I want to see

1974
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:22,439
how long I can keep a dog alive

1975
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,899
I don't like him dying early man it's

1976
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:28,678
the worst part like losing an animal is

1977
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:31,079
the worst uh so this way

1978
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:33,600
you know they eat a they eat a good diet

1979
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:35,579
it's awesome

1980
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,440
I was just gonna say one of the one of

1981
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:39,300
the common questions we get asked a lot

1982
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:40,859
is a lot of people want to do it but

1983
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:42,119
like they don't know where to start like

1984
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:46,099
what would you recommend as like

1985
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:46,099
starting Doses and ways to give it

1986
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:54,780
um I make a pet friendly one and uh

1987
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:57,299
what it is is uh just unflavored because

1988
01:18:54,779 --> 01:18:59,759
you know um I make I the other ones I

1989
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:02,159
make have organic flavoring like mango

1990
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:05,699
and all that I suppose I could put a dog

1991
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:09,119
flavoring in but uh

1992
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:10,259
I give them one squirt like actually I

1993
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:13,439
worked them up

1994
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:16,560
my dogs are 40 pounds and I give them

1995
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:18,059
like what I would recommend a human is

1996
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,580
like you know well

1997
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:24,060
you know

1998
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:26,340
to take like one milliliter

1999
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:29,039
but basically you know everybody has

2000
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:31,500
dogs in different sizes so you gotta

2001
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:35,100
again I'm not trying well I'm not a

2002
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:39,079
veterinarian either uh but

2003
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:39,079
like I think it's great I think you know

2004
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:45,300
everything alive

2005
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,399
uh you know mammalian kind of thing like

2006
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:49,260
dogs cats we all everything has this

2007
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:54,479
cannabinoid system that has been

2008
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:57,600
depleted because of uh the marijuana and

2009
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:58,678
hemp and one cannabis being made illegal

2010
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,480
you know

2011
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:03,239
I'm sure you've seen that Meme that's

2012
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:05,698
like back in the day the animals ate

2013
01:20:03,238 --> 01:20:07,019
hemp and then cannabinoids transferred

2014
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:08,039
through the milk and you know what I

2015
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,020
mean

2016
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:12,000
and that's why we didn't

2017
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:14,580
I I mean as

2018
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,158
uh you know I don't know if that it

2019
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:19,260
makes sense I'm gonna say

2020
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:21,059
um

2021
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:23,340
and then when we eliminated that you

2022
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:25,739
know since the endocannabinoid is

2023
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:28,319
directly responsible for

2024
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:31,859
like your immune system kind of you know

2025
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:32,939
like it's it's has a hefty Hefty weight

2026
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:37,019
in that

2027
01:20:32,939 --> 01:20:40,099
uh now they're finding you know like uh

2028
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:40,100
but it

2029
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:46,079
it actually has a lot of immune

2030
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:48,480
functions you know what I mean

2031
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:50,340
and then you know so it's the same in

2032
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:53,459
your dog and the same in your cat like

2033
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:56,460
they they have CB1 receptors and CB2

2034
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:58,260
receptors like I had a buddy who I went

2035
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,359
home my mom had passed away so we did

2036
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:03,119
her celebration of life and it was

2037
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:04,559
awesome and I I got to see some friends

2038
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:06,059
and one of my old friends came up and

2039
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,940
he's like hey man I'm noticing that

2040
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:12,659
Delta 8 is legal now I got a great idea

2041
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:15,178
that no one saw it he's like dealt a dog

2042
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:16,799
treats and he started asking me when I

2043
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:18,179
thought the dosage would be to like get

2044
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,940
your dog High

2045
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:24,000
and uh

2046
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:27,539
and like my dogs like not Bud he's new

2047
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,880
but Dojo woke up stoned as [ __ ] this

2048
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:31,198
morning uh I found this Northern Lights

2049
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,199
Number Five

2050
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:37,259
and in my I snuck into my flowering and

2051
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:39,719
it was uh throwing bananas like it was a

2052
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:41,280
Chiquita banana Factory so I cut it down

2053
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:43,140
and I started feeding it to the dog

2054
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:46,139
yesterday not the bud just the leaves

2055
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:48,179
and she she'll eat she knows what's up

2056
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,679
like when she doesn't feel good and the

2057
01:21:48,179 --> 01:21:51,779
other one did too but they don't feel

2058
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:55,699
good they go eat the leaves I had to

2059
01:21:51,779 --> 01:21:55,698
train them not to eat the plant you know

2060
01:21:55,738 --> 01:22:00,718
um but I think it's

2061
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:02,759
First a full spectrum I would think and

2062
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,679
then uh you would have to feel

2063
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,539
you know you have to build up a dog's

2064
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:07,800
tolerance to CBD and you definitely

2065
01:22:06,539 --> 01:22:09,658
don't want to get it high because I

2066
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,360
don't know if you ever dealt with a

2067
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:15,179
like you ever had a

2068
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:17,519
an animal eats your weed or like uh we

2069
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:19,739
made we made brownies one time or

2070
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,600
something back in the day and threw the

2071
01:22:19,738 --> 01:22:23,039
trim out back with the butter on and the

2072
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,480
dogs ate that thought they were I

2073
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,279
thought they were dying

2074
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:27,539
and it just turned out they were like so

2075
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:30,779
high

2076
01:22:27,539 --> 01:22:32,460
uh so you know be careful with anything

2077
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:34,079
you give your animals you don't want to

2078
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,698
uh

2079
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:37,679
you know make them uncomfortable or

2080
01:22:35,698 --> 01:22:39,479
anything but I think it's I think

2081
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,640
cannabis in all forms is good for

2082
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:44,959
everything with uh

2083
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,960
with the system you know

2084
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:49,679
yeah definitely definitely

2085
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:51,599
I saw it on your Instagram you've been

2086
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,600
experimenting with micro dosing

2087
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:57,900
mushrooms give me the lowdown

2088
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,880
so I do a couple uh things for my mental

2089
01:22:57,899 --> 01:23:03,599
health uh

2090
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:06,179
one of them is uh I do enjoy the micro

2091
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,980
dosing of the mushrooms like uh I don't

2092
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:11,399
like I haven't I actually quit drinking

2093
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:14,579
man on New Year's and I'm gonna say uh

2094
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:17,219
hey I really wanted to do it but like I

2095
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:21,600
was drinking like uh six to eight beers

2096
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:23,279
a day ipas that's like 200 calories of

2097
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,140
beer do you know what I mean like I had

2098
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:26,939
a beer belly I was like being a sloppy

2099
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:29,579
uh

2100
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:31,198
drunk and you know like um my mom wanted

2101
01:23:29,579 --> 01:23:33,300
me to quit drinking and I wanted me to

2102
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:34,619
quit drinking and I felt you know with

2103
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,440
this new

2104
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:39,179
thing coming up you know like uh it

2105
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:42,658
would be just better if I quit

2106
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:45,480
so uh on New Year's Eve or the no the

2107
01:23:42,658 --> 01:23:49,439
night before I went up to

2108
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:52,619
uh have you heard of the area 420 place

2109
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:55,319
yeah it's like uh so we went with those

2110
01:23:52,619 --> 01:23:57,300
guys we rented Adam rented uh

2111
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:59,819
uh the hot springs we went up there and

2112
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:02,159
I had eaten one of these little tablets

2113
01:23:59,819 --> 01:24:05,039
with some psilocybin in it and then the

2114
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:07,379
next night my uh

2115
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:10,019
my buddy's kid who isn't a kid he's like

2116
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:12,539
an adult but like you know uh came over

2117
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:15,540
and it was shitty outside so we all

2118
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:18,060
spent New Year's Eve together and I

2119
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:20,039
that's the last time I drank I I we made

2120
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:23,880
some mushroom tea and

2121
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:27,479
I like had a real deep conversation with

2122
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:30,539
him about why I wanted to quit drinking

2123
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:32,279
and like reinforcing like in my mind

2124
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:34,319
what I wanted and I woke up man I

2125
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:38,039
haven't drank since I believe that

2126
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:40,559
mushrooms magic and otherwise like have

2127
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:42,359
serious and I I you know Paul stamens

2128
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,539
has been doing a lot of research on this

2129
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:47,519
like I take a lion's mane supplement

2130
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:49,319
you know what I mean like uh it's an

2131
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,480
extract they do like hot water extracts

2132
01:24:49,319 --> 01:24:54,899
on them and that's supposed to you know

2133
01:24:51,479 --> 01:24:56,339
has been shown uh to rebuild your neural

2134
01:24:54,899 --> 01:24:59,460
network in your brain that could have

2135
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:01,679
been damaged by stress trauma drugs like

2136
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:03,600
alcohol

2137
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:06,119
uh

2138
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,100
and it also is like a mild serotonin

2139
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:11,880
booster so I was taking that and it's it

2140
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:13,739
uh what's the word it uh potentially

2141
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:17,760
it's the suicide

2142
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:21,479
into your brain more you know yeah nice

2143
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,860
supposedly it rebuilds your uh clusters

2144
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:26,279
you know where your nerves all get

2145
01:25:22,859 --> 01:25:27,658
together tenfold what they were like at

2146
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:30,059
their height of being the healthiest

2147
01:25:27,658 --> 01:25:32,579
like you're rebuilding your brain

2148
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:34,440
so I've been on that kick

2149
01:25:32,579 --> 01:25:36,719
uh

2150
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:40,259
and when I take when I micro dose the

2151
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,179
mushrooms with the with the Lion's man I

2152
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:44,880
have to be like really careful like my

2153
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:46,980
buddy made uh he put an ace into like a

2154
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,079
chocolate bar and each Square was

2155
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:52,799
supposed to be like a quarter gram

2156
01:25:49,079 --> 01:25:55,019
and that was like almost tripping pretty

2157
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,539
good like I have to break those into

2158
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:59,580
quarters because the Lion's vein makes

2159
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:01,019
it so much more potent

2160
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:02,760
so

2161
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:06,360
I haven't been doing that lately because

2162
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:08,579
I I noticed like I get

2163
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:10,920
somehow I assume it seems to affect me

2164
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:14,279
pretty good and I get pretty high so I'm

2165
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:16,679
it's not productive but like uh

2166
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:18,779
something I'm really really about and

2167
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:21,779
I'm willing to scream this from the top

2168
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:24,658
of the mountain is uh

2169
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:27,059
Academy for depression and anxiety like

2170
01:26:24,658 --> 01:26:29,579
I'm on the team like once every three

2171
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:34,199
three months I'll I'll uh

2172
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:36,539
fruit hear some and like uh have a I do

2173
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:39,539
a thing where I uh

2174
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:41,279
you know will Fast and then do it and

2175
01:26:39,539 --> 01:26:44,340
like do it

2176
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:46,198
for like two or three days and then uh

2177
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,819
come out of it it's like you know when

2178
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:49,259
your router goes bad on your computer

2179
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:51,079
and you got to reset it you gotta hold

2180
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:53,639
the button in and then

2181
01:26:51,079 --> 01:26:56,100
powers back up

2182
01:26:53,639 --> 01:26:59,100
I swear to God that does it to my brain

2183
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:01,320
like uh ketamine hits over 150 different

2184
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:04,139
receptors in your brain it's been shown

2185
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:05,939
like once it wears off it I don't know

2186
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:08,579
the chemical but it creates a chemical

2187
01:27:05,939 --> 01:27:11,519
in your brain that subsides like

2188
01:27:08,579 --> 01:27:14,039
depression and anxiety for like a month

2189
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:17,940
or two you know like

2190
01:27:14,039 --> 01:27:21,359
it literally in Parts like it's fun to

2191
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:23,399
do because I enjoy it and then also

2192
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:25,559
um when it's all over man I feel rinsed

2193
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:29,099
out like I can as somebody who suffers

2194
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:31,920
from those things uh like The Logical

2195
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:34,039
thought that it imparts you know makes

2196
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,960
both depression and anxiety like

2197
01:27:34,039 --> 01:27:39,359
illogical you know what I mean like

2198
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,920
because it's you know what you can't fix

2199
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,759
the past and you can't worry about the

2200
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:46,079
future

2201
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:49,260
and uh I have to say that's like my

2202
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:51,238
like I don't know if I would be in uh

2203
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:52,860
such a good mental

2204
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:54,718
state that I've been in lately if it

2205
01:27:52,859 --> 01:27:56,880

2206
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,439

2216
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:24,479
times and I I can actually say like some

2217
01:28:22,738 --> 01:28:25,859

2235
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,560
I had some [ __ ] happen to me a while ago

2236
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,859
and I went and got a shrink this is a

2237
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:11,460
couple years ago and uh

2238
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:13,559
I preached to him the benefits of

2239
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:15,359
ketamine so much that he went and

2240
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,639
started recommending it to his patients

2241
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:20,279
that were suffering and he said that

2242
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:23,159
they were seeing like significant and

2243
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:25,500
wonderful results uh

2244
01:29:23,158 --> 01:29:27,599
so like that's you know that's my

2245
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:29,698
regimen I don't either I I micro those

2246
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:33,960
mushrooms maybe like one week a month or

2247
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:35,698
something but it's that it's a uh once

2248
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:38,219
every three months that really makes my

2249
01:29:35,698 --> 01:29:40,019
brain feel like healthy and like I feel

2250
01:29:38,219 --> 01:29:42,840

out especially in Australia they just

2256
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,899
rolled it out I believe it's a nasal

2257

it's a disassociative tranquilizer slash

2263
01:30:10,819 --> 01:30:15,840
psychedelic I mean they were using it to

2264
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:17,639
like get they were giving the kids back

2265
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,679
in the day to like subdue them and then

2266

some adult did it it was like holy [ __ ]

2267
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:25,139
man and we should be giving that to kids

2268
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:27,239
that's trippy as [ __ ] uh

2269

a wonderful amount of psychedelics

2272
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:37,859
become more mainstream in the uses of uh

2273

2279
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:57,359
to have the the chemicals synthesized

2280
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:59,520
and like uh the most what do you want to

2281
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:01,380
call that uh

2282
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,239
you know it's got to be made according

2283
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:05,760
to like pharmaceutical specifications

2284
01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:08,819
for them so they had to like get that

2285
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,960
okayed by the FDA to get the lab that

2286
01:31:08,819 --> 01:31:11,880
you know what I mean

2287
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,139
but that's going to be like a big and

2288
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,119
then uh

2289
01:31:13,139 --> 01:31:18,359
if you haven't watched have you seen

2290

2293
01:31:24,658 --> 01:31:29,698
like that whole

2294
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,319
uh end of life where all those old

2295
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:34,559
people are like coming to terms and

2296
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:37,198
dying and cancer and like that's great I

2297
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,699
can't imagine like you know you're gonna

2298
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:40,379
die and you're worried about it and then

2299
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:41,759
you eat some mushrooms and now you're

2300
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:44,520
like you know what

2301
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,360
okay cool whatever let's do this you

2302
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:50,400
know

2303
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:52,259
that's a gotta be like a relief

2304
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:56,158
right

2305
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:57,960
yeah yeah hugely hugely some interesting

2306
01:31:56,158 --> 01:32:00,238
work being done in that area for sure I

2307
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:02,219
think definitely a long way to go with

2308
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:04,979
um you know end of Life Care palliative

2309
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:07,739
care those things we could do better

2310
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:10,439
yeah I mean um

2311
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:11,879
it's got to be scary like you know you

2312
01:32:10,439 --> 01:32:13,500
know you're

2313
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,940
I don't know yeah that's uh that's

2314
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:19,380
something that I've been pondering a lot

2315
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:21,178
since I I lost my mom like really like

2316
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:23,579
I've been taking I didn't started a

2317
01:32:21,179 --> 01:32:25,679
master class course on philosophy just

2318
01:32:23,579 --> 01:32:28,439
and it really was like super interesting

2319
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:31,319
because it uh you know philosophy is

2320
01:32:28,439 --> 01:32:33,299
like studying what it is to be human and

2321
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:34,979
it was like uh

2322
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,420
I don't know it really hit me in a good

2323
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:38,638
way so I've been thinking about like a

2324
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:40,679
lot of stuff like that lately like you

2325
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,739
know like what's your purpose here like

2326
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:46,380
what like you know do we when we die

2327
01:32:43,738 --> 01:32:48,899
like what's going on there like

2328
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:50,880
I don't know these are things I

2329
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:52,138
I have a lot of internal dialogue I

2330
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,760
guess

2331
01:32:52,139 --> 01:32:55,020
which is why I loved Academy and it

2332
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:58,800
shuts that down

2333
01:32:55,020 --> 01:33:00,840
yeah definitely hey look I mean we're

2334
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,940
sort of on the topic not to be morbid

2335
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:06,360
but I had a few people submit questions

2336
01:33:02,939 --> 01:33:07,859
saying I heard two lives in a morgue or

2337
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:10,380
used to live in a morgue what's what's

2338
01:33:07,859 --> 01:33:11,759
the deal with that no no yeah I live in

2339
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,920

2340
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,840

2344
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:25,020
[ __ ] crazy so uh

2345

basically like a credit you know so I

2354
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:44,238

2364
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:11,158
and it's out in the middle of [ __ ]

But as time went on

2371
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,520
like this actually became like the best

2372
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:30,539
option ever so I come down to check it

2373
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,400

01:34:42,658 --> 01:34:48,839
drawer like there's like you know in the

2380
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:50,519
movies when you get kidnapped by the bad

2381
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:53,760
guy like the German guy comes out and

2382
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:55,679
like the the rubber trench coat and he's

2383
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:59,100
like you're going to talk and unrolls

2384
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,779
that big roll of like evil looking metal

2385
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:03,120
things that he's gonna hurt you with you

2386
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:05,698
know what I'm talking about yeah that

2387
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:08,460
was in the drawer oh yeah that that

2388
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:10,678
whole kit like holy [ __ ] that I was like

2389
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:13,079
oh man then over here there was like a

2390
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:15,539
sink that they would hook up to

2391
01:35:13,079 --> 01:35:17,460
basically like it's a it's a one-way

2392
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:19,439
system they go in through your artery

2393
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,719
and out through another one at the end

2394
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:25,439
and then they pump you full of chemicals

2395
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:27,300
and like uh pump all your you know your

2396
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:28,979
liquids and stuff out so I had to move

2397
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:31,380
that I removed that sink

2398
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:33,000
that was kind of gross

2399
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:35,219
um and then the one of the selling

2400
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,920
points that he said was like oh there's

2401
01:35:35,219 --> 01:35:40,380
a floor drain which is

2402
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:42,899
you know so they were this was the

2403
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:45,239
corners station too for 10 years so

2404
01:35:42,899 --> 01:35:47,698
everybody in the county came through

2405
01:35:45,238 --> 01:35:49,738
like this place is you know no one ever

2406
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:52,198
died here but then it's weird to have

2407
01:35:49,738 --> 01:35:54,178
local people come over like say to buy

2408
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:55,919
CBD or whatever and like they're like

2409
01:35:54,179 --> 01:35:59,760
man I haven't been here since you buried

2410
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:03,600
my grandma and it's like that wasn't me

2411
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:06,539
yeah like uh but it's a big empty space

2412
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:09,960
and it's really nice and it works and uh

2413
01:36:06,539 --> 01:36:12,238
like uh the every like no one I'm not

2414
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:16,198
doing anything out of the ordinary down

2415
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:18,238
here like the what I had a roommate uh

2416
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:21,238
when I first moved here and he ended up

2417
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:22,198
uh robbing me with this woman who I was

2418
01:36:21,238 --> 01:36:26,158

being romantic with we'll say and uh I

2420
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:29,099
had to have the cops come through they

01:38:08,698 --> 01:38:12,960
yeah so it's in a funeral home

2466
01:38:10,979 --> 01:38:15,718
no one ever died here though just my

2467
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,340
dogs they were the first ones oh that's

2468
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:21,000
not good

2469
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:23,520
it's okay though the the so the landlord

2470
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,859
said while he was building the place

2471
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,260
uh well while the landlord was building

2472
01:38:25,859 --> 01:38:30,059
the place he said his brother-in-law or

2473
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:33,000
something came in and was like hurry up

2474
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:35,659
I'm gonna be the first guy you serve up

2475
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,639
and then he was

2476
01:38:35,658 --> 01:38:40,379
right oh no no no no and then the second

2477
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:44,159
guy came in and he was like Yo dude I'm

2478
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:46,199
gonna be the next guy and that dude was

2479
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:47,279
like uh they were calling it you know

2480
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:50,939
what I mean like

2481
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:53,359
it's a weird situation uh I know I've

2482
01:38:50,939 --> 01:38:56,279
never seen anything weird here like uh

2483
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:58,979
Spirits or ghosts I don't that's not

2484
01:38:56,279 --> 01:39:00,779
something I believe in but uh

2485
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:03,599
you know if I saw anything like that I

2486
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:05,460
might change my mind I suppose

2487
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,440
but you know how long has Ghost Hunters

2488
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:10,439
been on and they've never found [ __ ] so

2489
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:13,019
well look while we're on the subject of

2490
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:16,319
kooky and interesting I've been told by

2491
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:18,659
multiple people that yo the uh the

2492
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:20,340
Nicholas Tesla of cannabis tell me a

2493
01:39:18,658 --> 01:39:22,619
little bit about this teslaponics

2494
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:24,480
experiment you've done

2495
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:27,238
actually I'd rather fire that one back

2496
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:28,919
up uh

2497
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:30,479
I had

2498
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,399
like a keyhole I think they're called

2499
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:34,439
rack you like lock the little things in

2500
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:37,619
and then you know and I had it tubbed

2501
01:39:34,439 --> 01:39:39,719
out with uh what do you call it uh Pine

2502
01:39:37,619 --> 01:39:41,880
liner and it was off the ground and I

2503
01:39:39,719 --> 01:39:43,679
had a I had a what do you call that

2504
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:46,020
thing yeah

2505
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:48,840
heating mat in there

2506
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:50,699
and it says don't immerse in water

2507
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,319
and I had watered through all the plants

2508
01:39:50,698 --> 01:39:54,178
and you know there's a fin like it was

2509
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:56,219
just ever so

2510
01:39:54,179 --> 01:40:00,119
micro amounts of water in there but it

2511
01:39:56,219 --> 01:40:01,500
was all submersed and then uh I was the

2512
01:40:00,119 --> 01:40:03,179
next day I came in like holy [ __ ] man

2513
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:05,698
these are like the nicest plans I've

2514
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:06,480
ever [ __ ] seen I'm talking foot and a

2515
01:40:05,698 --> 01:40:10,319
half

2516
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:12,718
fat ass [ __ ] Sims like thick leathery

2517
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:15,059
[ __ ] leaves like not us nothing out

2518
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:17,399
of place no you know nothing out of

2519
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:19,199
place and I went to rub my arm over them

2520
01:40:17,399 --> 01:40:21,599
and they [ __ ] shocked me

2521
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:24,479
I was like what the [ __ ] so I got the

2522
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:28,920
the multimeter and I was running like 60

2523
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:30,839
watts or volt volts Watts volts 60 volts

2524
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,880
to the top of the plant

2525
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,400
right like uh

2526
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:37,619
like and I you know I had to ground it

2527
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:39,960
because it wasn't grounded so I when I I

2528
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:43,139
hit the I hit it on the concrete and

2529
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:44,340
tested it so I let this go you know and

2530
01:40:43,139 --> 01:40:48,060
I was trying to experiment with like

2531
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:49,560
this more water uh make it go up or down

2532
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:51,960
and eventually I think the thing was

2533
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:52,920
going bad because it got up to like a

2534
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,840
hundred

2535
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:57,239
and I assume that means it was shorting

2536
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:59,639
out or something so I didn't and then I

2537
01:40:57,238 --> 01:41:02,519
had I just decided that like

2538
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:05,340
um I don't have flyer insurance and like

2539
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:09,179
this seems like how you get a fire so I

2540
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:09,900
I pulled that experiment specific up and

2541
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:12,658
then

2542
01:41:09,899 --> 01:41:13,439
um I called a friend back home

2543
01:41:12,658 --> 01:41:17,158
um

2544
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:18,599
who you know is uh also he's a very

2545
01:41:17,158 --> 01:41:22,198
smart human and I was like check this

2546
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:25,139
out so we looked into it and uh it's

2547
01:41:22,198 --> 01:41:26,579
called Electro culture the technique is

2548
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:28,319
called electric culture and this dates

2549
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:30,960
back like talking hundreds of years

2550
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:33,658
right like uh for instance

2551
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,039
um it was like the late 1800s this uh

2552
01:41:33,658 --> 01:41:36,599
one of those monks you know the guys

2553
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:39,658
that do like the beer or whatever

2554
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:42,420
intelligent guys uh he was experimenting

2555
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:45,238
on bacterial growth from static electric

2556
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:46,800
charges and he found that he like one

2557
01:41:45,238 --> 01:41:49,618
static electric charge from say your

2558
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:52,940
foot into the ground increased bacterial

2559
01:41:49,618 --> 01:41:52,939
growth 400 percent

2560
01:41:55,139 --> 01:42:01,739
um this dude in the 30s uh this is cool

2561
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:05,819
this dude in the 30s uh

2562
01:42:01,738 --> 01:42:07,678
we took two poles and put them North and

2563
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:09,179
South like big poles he buried them in

2564
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,039
the ground and attacked him to a big

2565
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:13,199
piece of metal at each end

2566
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:15,060
and then he wound copper all the way up

2567
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:17,879
with the rotation of the earth like so

2568
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:20,820
many times and he put him on the north

2569
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:22,800
and south end of this field and he grew

2570
01:42:20,819 --> 01:42:26,340
clovers that he won the World's Fair

2571
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:29,699
with and they were eight feet tall

2572
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:34,619
office off passively pulling this out of

2573
01:42:29,698 --> 01:42:34,618
the air you know wow so

2574
01:42:34,738 --> 01:42:38,759
I I called him and he worked at a

2575
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,380
medical supply place and he sent me you

2576
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:42,420
know what a TENS unit is of course you

2577
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:44,639
do you know the thing you put on like oh

2578
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:47,940
I sprained my arm or something and it's

2579
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:50,400
got frequency and yeah say what

2580
01:42:47,939 --> 01:42:51,719
yeah on jackass they put it on their

2581
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:54,719
gooch

2582
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:56,460
oh I did not

2583
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,679
do you remember that on the first

2584
01:42:56,460 --> 01:43:00,359
Jackass movie they put it on their Gooch

2585
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:02,819
and were just that was my introduction

2586
01:43:00,359 --> 01:43:05,460
to a TENS machine

2587
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:06,960
no [ __ ] uh

2588
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:09,000
but it's like you know adjustable

2589
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,859
wavelength that like potency and stuff

2590
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,198
so I got a couple of those and instead I

2591
01:43:10,859 --> 01:43:15,479
put little patches on I like put on

2592
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:18,059
alligator clips and I stripped down some

2593
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:21,479
like uh raw mix which is you know like

2594
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:23,820
wire like housewire and I use the copper

2595
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:26,039
you know I clamped them on I put it in

2596
01:43:23,819 --> 01:43:29,279
the plants and it was getting like the

2597
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:30,658
same effect but not quite as magnificent

2598
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,658
you know because it's a lower lower

2599
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:37,019
amount of voltage but it was consistent

2600
01:43:33,658 --> 01:43:39,658
like uh I got some bugs and then I like

2601
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:42,480
uh turned them on and you could adjust

2602
01:43:39,658 --> 01:43:43,319
it like I think now listen I could have

2603
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:46,259
been high

2604
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:48,299
I didn't document this but

2605
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:50,340
I swear to God I could like make the

2606
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:52,260
bugs move faster or slower depending on

2607
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:55,199
the current I was giving them

2608
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:57,179
so uh

2609
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,979
got a couple of these hands units hooked

2610
01:43:57,179 --> 01:44:01,199
up a couple lemon plants grew them

2611
01:43:58,979 --> 01:44:04,799
electrically and then that's when we

2612
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:07,138
went to Holland and got that uh cup

2613
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,639
second place the whole week just

2614
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:10,500
tripping on acid it was [ __ ]

2615
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:13,618
hilarious I think I walked over 100

2616
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:16,260
miles through Amsterdam that week like

2617
01:44:13,618 --> 01:44:18,658
um we I smuggled weed out I guess yeah

2618
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:20,639
that's we're past that so we're I'm in

2619
01:44:18,658 --> 01:44:23,399
Amsterdam we got like

2620
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:25,859
uh three ounces left we're at the booth

2621
01:44:23,399 --> 01:44:28,439
and uh just rolling mad joints everybody

2622
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:30,479
else in the spot was just like the

2623
01:44:28,439 --> 01:44:33,000
greenhouse guys had like the nastiest

2624
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:34,500
like 20 foot long balloon volcano you

2625
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,520
know and like other people were giving

2626
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:40,920
out little like one-hitters and um in

2627
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:43,080
retrospect after I got like everybody

2628
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:45,239
every world's flew this was probably a

2629
01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:47,519
bad idea but smoking joints for

2630
01:44:45,238 --> 01:44:50,279
everybody and then the police raided the

2631
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,980
place and uh everybody like Adam's

2632
01:44:50,279 --> 01:44:56,158
grinding up all the weed and I like uh

2633
01:44:52,979 --> 01:44:57,059
stuffed it in my I stuffed the remaining

2634
01:44:56,158 --> 01:44:59,399
herb

2635
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:01,440
into my coach

2636
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:03,658
and walked out because the Dutch police

2637
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:05,698
they didn't look very tough so they are

2638
01:45:03,658 --> 01:45:07,979
so I put it in my arm and then as I got

2639
01:45:05,698 --> 01:45:09,779
closer to where they were all at I

2640
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:12,779
realized that they put the monsters up

2641
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:14,759
front man so as we're all waiting to be

2642
01:45:12,779 --> 01:45:17,519
searched and shuffled to get out of the

2643
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:19,560
venue I'm like hey because I've been

2644
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:23,100
riding a tram or the bus and everybody

2645
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:25,199

01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:29,579

2648
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:32,218

2649
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:34,439

2758
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:45,899
stuff so it's actually

2759
01:49:43,738 --> 01:49:48,419
and it smells terrific we've been

2760
01:49:45,899 --> 01:49:51,658
working with it uh

2761
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:53,460
so they they sent us that and then the

2762
01:49:51,658 --> 01:49:56,399
we were we had a couple different

2763
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:59,399
options with the LEDs and those fell out

2764
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:01,859
and then s-tech

2765
01:49:59,399 --> 01:50:03,539
uh who is a let me you know this is

2766
01:50:01,859 --> 01:50:06,000
really interesting

2767
01:50:03,539 --> 01:50:07,920
uh offered it to us and when we accepted

2768
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,079
them the other guys were like

2769
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,819
like just add her like come on man we

2770
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:14,219
got you like because they're

2771
01:50:11,819 --> 01:50:16,738
so Aztec is owned by this guy named Jack

2772
01:50:14,219 --> 01:50:19,980
Jack is a

2773
01:50:16,738 --> 01:50:21,839
uh he's a Chinese guy who developed uh

2774
01:50:19,979 --> 01:50:23,819
what do you call him uh street lights

2775
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,619
you only have all LED street lights over

2776
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:27,658
there so he developed the LED street

2777
01:50:25,618 --> 01:50:29,339
light which if you get if you're

2778
01:50:27,658 --> 01:50:31,279
thinking like a street light has to do

2779
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:33,360
what like project a lot of light down

2780
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:36,000
regardless of like

2781
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:37,679
you know fog and stuff like that so he's

2782
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,500
got a special

2783
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:42,539
like lensing on them that even one of

2784
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:45,420
the I'm not here to talk too much [ __ ]

2785
01:50:42,539 --> 01:50:47,579
even one of the best LED manufacturers

2786
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:50,279
was trying to steal from him and they

2787
01:50:47,579 --> 01:50:53,340
lost it's amazing because

2788
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:55,380
um these little road they're called high

2789
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:59,219
Bays they're like maybe six inches wide

2790
01:50:55,380 --> 01:51:00,600
by three ish feet long and you know as

2791
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:03,000
opposed to those ones look like spiders

2792
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:04,860
I got all those like you know bars going

2793
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,679
on these things have like uh and I'm

2794
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:09,479
gonna post it up here man like a bubble

2795
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,399
looking things

2796
01:51:09,479 --> 01:51:13,198
right and inside the bubble was like

2797
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:16,679
nine LEDs and there's something about

2798
01:51:13,198 --> 01:51:18,618
the the uh that lensing that he's got

2799
01:51:16,679 --> 01:51:21,179
that causes the LEDs to have like

2800
01:51:18,618 --> 01:51:23,698
immensely good light penetration I'm

2801
01:51:21,179 --> 01:51:27,118
talking like it was and I'm new to the

2802
01:51:23,698 --> 01:51:28,019
ppfd but it was at 8 50 it was two and a

2803
01:51:27,118 --> 01:51:30,479
half feet

2804
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:31,380
to 850 from the lens which is cool

2805
01:51:30,479 --> 01:51:33,299
because

2806
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:34,739
I don't know if you have you know LEDs

2807
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:36,179
generally you have to like have them

2808
01:51:34,738 --> 01:51:38,039
slammed down on there you know what I

2809
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:40,020
mean

2810
01:51:38,039 --> 01:51:43,500
and their Wi-Fi

2811
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:45,780
okay so you control them remotely

2812
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:48,179
here's the okay so uh

2813
01:51:45,779 --> 01:51:50,399
you know uh I we get them and we're

2814
01:51:48,179 --> 01:51:51,480
setting them up and uh I download this

2815
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:53,698
app

2816
01:51:51,479 --> 01:51:55,618
and at first it's like asking me for

2817
01:51:53,698 --> 01:51:58,439
permissions for everything

2818
01:51:55,618 --> 01:52:00,179
like I mean it was scary the amount of

2819
01:51:58,439 --> 01:52:01,500
permissions that this thing wanted and I

2820
01:52:00,179 --> 01:52:03,420
didn't really understand what was going

2821
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:06,600
on and I looked it up and it's actually

2822
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:07,920
this open source automation app you know

2823
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:10,440
what I mean

2824
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:13,199
and it'll control everything in your

2825
01:52:10,439 --> 01:52:16,460
house like from your Lance to your

2826
01:52:13,198 --> 01:52:18,719
your hvnc your uh your

2827
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:20,279
just everything you could possibly want

2828
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:22,859
to automate and stuff you didn't even

2829
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:24,899
know you wanted like your curtains

2830
01:52:22,859 --> 01:52:26,698
closing or your windows shutting on them

2831
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:29,339
you know what I mean

2832
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:30,599
um and all that's programmable within

2833
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:31,800
this little

2834
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:34,560
app

2835
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:37,139
so and if you I don't I don't want to do

2836
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:39,539
Alexa but you can do what Alexa do like

2837
01:52:37,139 --> 01:52:42,239
it all said you know Alexa turn on my

2838
01:52:39,539 --> 01:52:45,118
garden kind of thing yeah but I'm not

2839
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:47,279
don't do that because Jeff Bezos will

2840
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:49,139
then see your garden but you got secure

2841
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:51,000
home security it's all wrapped up in

2842
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:52,560
this nice app and it's sends you

2843
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,039
notifications when the lights come on

2844
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:58,800
and I imagine like once we can get more

2845
01:52:56,039 --> 01:53:00,719
uh environmental controls you know

2846
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,880
they'll be uh

2847
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:06,118
automated like that too the lights will

2848
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:08,520
dim down on their own if it gets too hot

2849
01:53:06,118 --> 01:53:10,500
and they cover like a nice for being a

2850
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:12,900
little bar they cover like three by four

2851
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:14,698
so we got them in a nice line

2852
01:53:12,899 --> 01:53:16,920
and uh

2853
01:53:14,698 --> 01:53:17,638
we just been setting it up you know

2854
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:19,920
um

2855
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:21,118
we got some tense from some people I

2856
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:22,079
have to look

2857
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:24,118
um

2858
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:26,519
and they're nice and white on the inside

2859
01:53:24,118 --> 01:53:29,899
as opposed to that you know speckled

2860
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:29,900
aluminum or mylar or whatever

2861
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:33,719
um

2862
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:35,159
and these are five by five which is nice

2863
01:53:33,719 --> 01:53:37,739
because they're bigger like I have a

2864
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:40,319
four by four that I breed in and when

2865
01:53:37,738 --> 01:53:42,059
that fan comes on it really sucks in and

2866
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:43,880
you know what I mean like kind of puts

2867
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:46,320
the cramping on the plants

2868
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:48,600
hydro grow those are the guys that gave

2869
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:51,118
us these tents they're really nice

2870
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:53,520
and then so basically we're gonna

2871
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:55,439
showcase all these people's products

2872
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:57,659
because we believe that these are you

2873
01:53:55,439 --> 01:54:00,059
know uh especially the LEDs these are

2874
01:53:57,658 --> 01:54:01,979
like really the

2875
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:04,320
I don't know I don't like these big

2876
01:54:01,979 --> 01:54:06,479
stupid LEDs that have all these bars

2877
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:09,719
these things are just streamlined

2878
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:10,979
they look nice talk to the computer

2879
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:14,219
you know

2880
01:54:10,979 --> 01:54:17,039
well it smells so good in there wow

2881
01:54:14,219 --> 01:54:19,800
that that soil really smells good he hit

2882
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:21,359
it with uh dragonfly Earth medicine also

2883
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:23,820
somebody who's helping out men those

2884
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,698
those are really nice products I don't

2885
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:29,460
they probably don't get to Australia

2886
01:54:26,698 --> 01:54:31,979
but uh unfortunately no but they're

2887
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:33,899
great product yeah and it's like they're

2888
01:54:31,979 --> 01:54:37,079
super organic like they're flowing in

2889
01:54:33,899 --> 01:54:41,039
the same vibe that we're trying to do so

2890
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:42,960
uh basically we're just gonna bounce out

2891
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:46,079
seeds man like

2892
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:48,000
they're legal they're like 100 you know

2893
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:49,679
there's no THC in there you don't have

2894
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,618
to worry about that

2895
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:54,719
so I wanna

2896
01:54:52,618 --> 01:54:57,539
expand the reach you know it's not my

2897
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:59,880
hemp plant my hemp strains are grown

2898
01:54:57,539 --> 01:55:01,198
okay anywhere hemp is grown you know

2899
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:03,239
it's kind of cool

2900
01:55:01,198 --> 01:55:05,579
but like it'd be nice to

2901
01:55:03,238 --> 01:55:07,500
my buddy runs a wreck I think they're

2902
01:55:05,579 --> 01:55:08,819
wreck in Israel I think that'd be fun to

2903
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,719
see

2904
01:55:08,819 --> 01:55:11,698
um

2905
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:13,439
some you know some gear over there and

2906
01:55:11,698 --> 01:55:15,658
stuff

2907
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:17,579
yeah definitely definitely it sounds

2908
01:55:15,658 --> 01:55:20,460
like you got a lot of options on the

2909
01:55:17,579 --> 01:55:23,340
plate I um

2910
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:25,439
I wanted to ask you you've mentioned the

2911
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:27,239
the lemon j a few times we need to get

2912
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:28,979
the back story on it what can you tell

2913
01:55:27,238 --> 01:55:30,839
us about it because I think I heard at

2914
01:55:28,979 --> 01:55:32,279
one point it's like a Colombian or

2915
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:34,619
something but I'd love for you to fill

2916
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:36,899
me in

2917
01:55:34,618 --> 01:55:40,079
okay

2918
01:55:36,899 --> 01:55:42,658
I have that G13 plant

2919
01:55:40,079 --> 01:55:46,800
that I've had for

2920
01:55:42,658 --> 01:55:48,539
since I was 18 for 27 years right

2921
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,539
I don't know anything about the other

2922
01:55:48,539 --> 01:55:52,380
side of that uh lemon G

2923
01:55:51,539 --> 01:55:55,019
um

2924
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:57,900
I'm not sure what uh description says

2925
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:00,780
but like it is definitely

2926
01:55:57,899 --> 01:56:03,839
that G13 because I've done a lot of work

2927
01:56:00,779 --> 01:56:06,539
with it and I get G13 Finos out of it

2928
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:09,360
I'm not sure what the sativa side is I'm

2929
01:56:06,539 --> 01:56:11,039
being honest like if I knew but I know

2930
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:14,279
I'm not one to

2931
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:16,039
to lie I have no idea all I know is that

2932
01:56:14,279 --> 01:56:19,019
it is one of the terpiest things ever

2933
01:56:16,039 --> 01:56:20,460
like it's literally like uh my

2934
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:23,460
ex-girlfriend would break out in hives

2935
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:24,899
trimming it like uh my friends would

2936
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:27,600
puke

2937
01:56:24,899 --> 01:56:29,638
um like trimming it and I've had a

2938
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:31,860
couple people puke smoking it like it

2939
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:33,239
irritates um I have one Buddy's throat

2940
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:36,559
so bad he won't

2941
01:56:33,238 --> 01:56:39,178
it's it's like lemon

2942
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:41,460
lemon you know what I mean with uh a

2943
01:56:39,179 --> 01:56:43,500
funky from the G like a turkey gravy up

2944
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:46,380
underneath it and that's like a

2945
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:47,698
quintessential G right there

2946
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:50,880
um

2947
01:56:47,698 --> 01:56:52,500
it's a beautiful plant it yields like

2948
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,940
you could have a giant bag of it and

2949
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:55,500
that's like an ounce you know what I

2950
01:56:53,939 --> 01:56:57,719
mean you got like a

2951
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:59,158
it's so fluffy it doesn't really have a

2952
01:56:57,719 --> 01:57:00,960
lot of weight and that was like one of

2953
01:56:59,158 --> 01:57:02,519
the reasons like when I got back from

2954
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:04,319
the cup I decided to put a northern

2955
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:05,880
lights that my buddy had been working on

2956
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:09,719
on it because I wanted some density and

2957
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:11,840
they flowed really well together uh

2958
01:57:09,719 --> 01:57:13,739
and I also

2959
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:16,560
there's a

2960
01:57:13,738 --> 01:57:18,479
it makes the most like uh amazing like

2961
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,060
for a Wilder it was the hottest thing in

2962
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:23,279
Colorado like extract wise because it

2963
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:26,760
that whole that

2964
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:29,698
that D limonene just came through so

2965
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:31,800
hard you know what I mean

2966
01:57:29,698 --> 01:57:34,500
but as far as your question goes man I

2967
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:36,900
can't answer that and I apologize

2968
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:38,460
I'm not sure of the lineage I just a

2969
01:57:36,899 --> 01:57:41,039
friend of mine when I was collecting

2970
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:43,260
strains in Ohio to bring out here

2971
01:57:41,039 --> 01:57:46,500
like I had been growing it but I I asked

2972
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:48,780
everybody that gave me strains uh when I

2973
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:51,420
came like can I take this with me and so

2974
01:57:48,779 --> 01:57:52,979
yeah that's that is the extent of my

2975
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:55,079
knowledge I'm sure there's a lot of Ohio

2976
01:57:52,979 --> 01:57:57,718
people coming online now I'm noticing

2977
01:57:55,079 --> 01:57:59,579
I'm sure somewhere in there

2978
01:57:57,719 --> 01:58:01,079
because somebody tried to call Adam

2979
01:57:59,579 --> 01:58:05,698
after the cub and they were trying to

2980
01:58:01,079 --> 01:58:06,960
tell him it was skunk times Misty which

2981
01:58:05,698 --> 01:58:09,839
um

2982
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:11,279
like I said I've done a lot of work with

2983
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:16,380
it you know like Crossing it with stuff

2984
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:17,819
and always get G13 my classic one out of

2985
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:19,319
it you know what I mean see you can see

2986
01:58:17,819 --> 01:58:23,960
it you can smell it

2987
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:27,118
uh so I don't know I guess long answer

2988
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:30,179
no that's fine that's a good answer

2989
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:32,039

like so much that when I was like

3082
02:02:02,219 --> 02:02:06,480
15 I took the Anarchist Cookbook into my

3083
02:02:04,859 --> 02:02:09,059
science teacher I was like Yo dude we

3084
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:10,799

3085
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:12,420
likely to do drugs and I was really

3086
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,539
pissed off and then he was like no it's

3087
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:18,719
a good thing sometimes so

3088
02:02:15,539 --> 02:02:20,939
we skipped school uh me and three or

3089
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:23,099

3090
02:02:20,939 --> 02:02:26,279

3093
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:30,780
um

3094
02:02:28,979 --> 02:02:34,138
and we were drinking at my buddy's

3095
02:02:30,779 --> 02:02:35,759
parents during school time and uh my

3096
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:36,420
buddy took his mom's Bowl she had a

3097
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:39,599
little

3098
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:41,940
like Marvel bull you know a few inches

3099
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:43,380
three inches long and uh

3100
02:02:41,939 --> 02:02:45,738
they tried to give me the smoking

3101
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:45,739
foreign

3102
02:02:49,639 --> 02:02:53,279
at that point when I was a kid man like

3103
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:55,439
uh

3104
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:58,139
I was like the first kid ever on Ritalin

3105
02:02:55,439 --> 02:03:00,079
and then like I was I was honestly

3106
02:02:58,139 --> 02:03:03,420
Prozac when I was later you know because

3107
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:05,460
I don't know they had like in third

3108
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:09,239
grade I was tweaking on Ritalin what a

3109
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:11,819
gross uncomfortable thing so

3110
02:03:09,238 --> 02:03:13,799
I was on some kind of antidepressant I'm

3111
02:03:11,819 --> 02:03:17,819
not really sure I can't remember

3112
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:20,400
and I stole the ball I climbed up a tree

3113
02:03:17,819 --> 02:03:22,618
and I [ __ ] smoked this bowl and I got

3114
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:24,960
high for the first time ever

3115
02:03:22,618 --> 02:03:27,238
and I pulled like a false damage done I

3116
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:29,279
got down and I decided to like

3117
02:03:27,238 --> 02:03:31,379
I feel pretty good

3118
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:33,479
I'm gonna quit taking

3119
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:36,359
the swagging Pharmaceuticals and I'm

3120
02:03:33,479 --> 02:03:39,419
just gonna go smoke weed

3121
02:03:36,359 --> 02:03:42,179
and then shortly after that I got into

3122
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:46,260
the Rave scene and you know

3123
02:03:42,179 --> 02:03:48,539
experiment with all the Gambit so

3124
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:50,520
but I you know uh cannabis has been

3125
02:03:48,539 --> 02:03:52,079
since that day because I was like you

3126
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:55,020

3127
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:58,559
horror because horrible serotonin

3128
02:03:55,020 --> 02:04:01,860
messing with your brain chemicals like

3129
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:04,619
it's saying like Okay then I went home

3130
02:04:01,859 --> 02:04:06,479
and uh I wanted to buy a bag of wheat

3131
02:04:04,618 --> 02:04:09,118
obviously that's what you do right yeah

3132
02:04:06,479 --> 02:04:10,738
I smoke so now where can I get it so my

3133
02:04:09,118 --> 02:04:14,039
buddy who I just talked to earlier

3134
02:04:10,738 --> 02:04:16,019
Donnie uh and I called her other buddy

3135
02:04:14,039 --> 02:04:18,658
dad and we're like hey man go to sleep

3136
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:21,420
so it took him like hours to come rain

3137
02:04:18,658 --> 02:04:23,279
is this bag of weed and uh it was like

3138
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:25,679
the corner of a brick

3139
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:27,238
and uh you know they'd have seeds in

3140
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:29,880
them so

3141
02:04:27,238 --> 02:04:33,479
I saved the seeds out of my weed and I

3142
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:36,118
went home and I in my

3143
02:04:33,479 --> 02:04:38,519
in my closet I had my toy box when I was

3144
02:04:36,118 --> 02:04:40,979
a kid that had things like my dungeons

3145
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:44,520
in the dragons books and my Taekwondo

3146
02:04:40,979 --> 02:04:47,939
uniforms and you know all that stuff my

3147
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:49,500
I was a nerd you know what I mean uh and

3148
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:51,059
I moved all that stuff out and I went to

3149
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:52,260
the Home Depot and I got myself a little

3150
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:54,239
grow light

3151
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:55,739
I put some plants and I started some

3152
02:04:54,238 --> 02:04:57,718
seeds and

3153
02:04:55,738 --> 02:04:58,919
my mom's like so what are you doing in

3154
02:04:57,719 --> 02:05:00,420
there

3155
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:02,940
and I'm like

3156
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:05,460
I'm growing orchids mom

3157
02:05:02,939 --> 02:05:08,039
and she

3158
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:10,439
uh laughed and she was like you know I

3159
02:05:08,039 --> 02:05:11,519
grew up in the 70s right because our

3160
02:05:10,439 --> 02:05:13,379
organs

3161
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:14,820
yeah you gotta get them out of here so

3162
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:17,159
then

3163
02:05:14,819 --> 02:05:18,299
um I was about to turn 18 and she was

3164
02:05:17,158 --> 02:05:19,439
like dude if you're gonna be selling

3165
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:21,599
weed you can't let me be doing it here

3166
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:23,039
so I moved out I got a hot girlfriend

3167
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:26,760
and moved out and then we just started

3168
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:29,939
growing like uh

3169
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:32,099
yeah and it started off we stole uh 400

3170
02:05:29,939 --> 02:05:34,919
watt high pressure sodium from the

3171
02:05:32,099 --> 02:05:38,639
college two of those up in a little

3172
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:40,739
closet and then you know as time grew so

3173
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:43,679
did you know and then you got to get a

3174
02:05:40,738 --> 02:05:46,259
couple thousands and you know why not

3175
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:48,480
get six or whatever so

3176
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:52,079
and then who got here instead of like a

3177
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:54,718
hundred and you know it just

3178
02:05:52,079 --> 02:05:57,359
growing stuff I I gotta put on probation

3179
02:05:54,719 --> 02:06:00,179
or parole actually I got I had to go sit

3180
02:05:57,359 --> 02:06:01,319
down for a couple years uh apparently

3181
02:06:00,179 --> 02:06:03,920
not to make drugs in your own home

3182
02:06:01,319 --> 02:06:03,920
you're not allowed

3183
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:08,579
what was some of the strains you were

3184
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:10,980
first growing did they have names or was

3185
02:06:08,579 --> 02:06:13,319
it before then

3186
02:06:10,979 --> 02:06:15,598
uh after I got a

3187
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:19,759
Jail jail uh

3188
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:19,760
I'd say pee tests and um

3189
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:25,138
I started dating this girl was growing

3190
02:06:22,139 --> 02:06:27,179
some herb and I failed the first one and

3191
02:06:25,139 --> 02:06:30,840
uh

3192
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:33,420
I got dinged for it and then

3193
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,159
the next one I deluded and then the net

3194
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:36,539
and so then Nicole in with the deluded

3195
02:06:35,158 --> 02:06:40,079
one and she's like

3196
02:06:36,539 --> 02:06:42,000
uh look this is deluded like what do you

3197
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:44,819
mean it's piss and she's like no it's

3198
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:47,099
not like it came out of my dick

3199
02:06:44,819 --> 02:06:49,319
and she's like you diluted it I'm like

3200
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:52,039
what makes piss piss and she's like

3201
02:06:49,319 --> 02:06:52,039
creatine

3202
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:57,359
and uh

3203
02:06:54,179 --> 02:06:59,340
so if you test hot again I gotta you're

3204
02:06:57,359 --> 02:07:02,339
gonna get in trouble and I gave her this

3205
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:04,380
big speech like look when I'm off parole

3206
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:05,819
I'm probably gonna I'm gonna go smoke

3207
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:07,020
weed I don't think there's anything

3208
02:07:05,819 --> 02:07:09,179
wrong with it I think it's medicinal

3209
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:10,260
I'll probably go grow somewhere I laid

3210
02:07:09,179 --> 02:07:12,840
it out and she looks right at me she

3211
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:15,539
gave me this big Smurf and she's like

3212
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:18,539
uh yeah whatever you want to do when

3213
02:07:15,539 --> 02:07:20,760
you're not my property don't fail again

3214
02:07:18,539 --> 02:07:23,399
so I go and got some creatine because I

3215
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:25,860
was smuggling like kilos of creatine

3216
02:07:23,399 --> 02:07:28,979
into the joint you know what I mean uh

3217
02:07:25,859 --> 02:07:31,079
that's a whole different story uh and we

3218
02:07:28,979 --> 02:07:34,138
were working out and so I knew what it

3219
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:36,359
was so I went and got some and uh mixed

3220
02:07:34,139 --> 02:07:39,060
it I like diluted myself but mixed it in

3221
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:41,279
and like I was taking that and like I

3222
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:43,440
passed and then she took me off that

3223
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:46,259
if anybody out there I mean this is a

3224
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:48,299
while ago but uh I assume that still

3225
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:50,400
works right

3226
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:52,380
it was just creatine though so she told

3227
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:54,059
she like told me what it was I was like

3228
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:54,900
what makes this and she's like creatine

3229
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:57,179
so

3230
02:07:54,899 --> 02:07:59,399
I worked it out and I passed and then I

3231
02:07:57,179 --> 02:08:02,579
didn't have to take anymore so then

3232
02:07:59,399 --> 02:08:03,839
I started I got like I started dating

3233
02:08:02,579 --> 02:08:06,359
this other girl and I was like we should

3234
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,739
grow weed and she's like

3235
02:08:06,359 --> 02:08:08,880
but what about getting caught and I'm

3236
02:08:07,738 --> 02:08:11,218
like don't

3237
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:14,340
and so we set up a little

3238
02:08:11,219 --> 02:08:17,760
a little guard in our basement and then

3239
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:20,819
uh it was nice actually and it was real

3240
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,739
efficient and then that's when uh

3241
02:08:20,819 --> 02:08:24,359
that's when I turned 30 and I went over

3242
02:08:22,738 --> 02:08:28,559
to Amsterdam

3243
02:08:24,359 --> 02:08:30,179
and I met like Adam and oh you know he

3244
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,219
eventually moved to my house when we

3245
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:34,679
moved to Colorado it was uh

3246
02:08:32,219 --> 02:08:36,960
pretty funny situation

3247
02:08:34,679 --> 02:08:39,899
wow so he came back to the states with

3248
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:42,599
you around the end of that 90s period

3249
02:08:39,899 --> 02:08:46,019
no I moved to uh well I want to say

3250
02:08:42,599 --> 02:08:48,179
Amsterdam 15 years ago

3251
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:51,239
uh when I turned 30

3252
02:08:48,179 --> 02:08:52,800
and then when I moved to Denver I kept

3253
02:08:51,238 --> 02:08:55,319
up with him you know and then when I

3254
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:57,960
moved to Denver I ran into him in Denver

3255
02:08:55,319 --> 02:09:00,179
and then we got a house and then I was

3256
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:02,219
like yo I got a house come on so he he

3257
02:09:00,179 --> 02:09:04,319
ended up moving there

3258
02:09:02,219 --> 02:09:05,279
that was crazy we had like the tiniest

3259
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:08,579
house

3260
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:10,679
and six dudes living in it like I slept

3261
02:09:08,579 --> 02:09:13,319
on bunk beds on pallet racks with like

3262
02:09:10,679 --> 02:09:16,020
300 clones next to me

3263
02:09:13,319 --> 02:09:19,340
it was the it was a wild time man that

3264
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:19,340
was the green Rush coming at her

3265
02:09:19,738 --> 02:09:26,158
it was an interesting time in Colorado

3266
02:09:22,979 --> 02:09:28,319
and were you just growing like uh for

3267
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:30,238
flour at that point

3268
02:09:28,319 --> 02:09:32,340
we just got here

3269
02:09:30,238 --> 02:09:33,959
and I got to sing I don't like to throw

3270
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:35,639
away plant matter so I'm growing like

3271
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:37,739
perfectly healthy plants I kind of want

3272
02:09:35,639 --> 02:09:39,060
to cut them and clone them so what

3273
02:09:37,738 --> 02:09:42,299
started with

3274
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:45,119
I brought maybe 20 different things out

3275
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:47,940
here and like uh a coat with a lock and

3276
02:09:45,118 --> 02:09:49,859
a lid and then once we got here they

3277
02:09:47,939 --> 02:09:52,019
just kept getting bigger so we set up

3278
02:09:49,859 --> 02:09:54,479
the Clone her with the intent of moving

3279
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:56,520
into a warehouse that was uh

3280
02:09:54,479 --> 02:09:58,198
that was like the entire intent you know

3281
02:09:56,520 --> 02:10:00,119
and then that's when

3282
02:09:58,198 --> 02:10:02,279
that whole Greenworks thing happened and

3283
02:10:00,118 --> 02:10:04,139
then the whole what we started talking

3284
02:10:02,279 --> 02:10:05,719
about when we first started the

3285
02:10:04,139 --> 02:10:09,239
conversation

3286
02:10:05,719 --> 02:10:10,679
ah interesting interesting okay

3287
02:10:09,238 --> 02:10:12,419
you like that like

3288
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:14,099
that Richie movie man I bounced back all

3289
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:15,779
the way to the beginning you know what I

3290
02:10:14,099 --> 02:10:18,980
mean like a neck

3291
02:10:15,779 --> 02:10:21,359
and that's how all that happened

3292
02:10:18,979 --> 02:10:23,279
there you go there you go I mean I'm

3293
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:25,079
interested to hear in the early days

3294
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:27,420
were there any breeders you specifically

3295
02:10:25,079 --> 02:10:32,099
were sort of looking up to

3296
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:33,239
uh okay so when we were like 18 uh some

3297
02:10:32,099 --> 02:10:35,340
friends

3298
02:10:33,238 --> 02:10:37,859
you know they decided to drive out west

3299
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:40,020
and like go to BC

3300
02:10:37,859 --> 02:10:40,979
and they called Mark Henry and that dude

3301
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:42,960
like

3302
02:10:40,979 --> 02:10:44,718
Mark Emery showed up in their hotel room

3303
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:47,760
with like uh

3304
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:49,319
like a photo album full of seeds and

3305
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:52,159
they ended up getting

3306
02:10:49,319 --> 02:10:52,158
uh

3307
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:58,139
I don't know a few different things from

3308
02:10:56,099 --> 02:11:01,739
um

3309
02:10:58,139 --> 02:11:04,319
like Sagar and math is uh

3310
02:11:01,738 --> 02:11:06,299
bubbleberry

3311
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:08,939
right like what else do we have back in

3312
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:10,079
Cali missed

3313
02:11:08,939 --> 02:11:12,658
um

3314
02:11:10,079 --> 02:11:16,559
I got some skunk number one you know

3315
02:11:12,658 --> 02:11:18,539
like that was well like 1996 Maybe

3316
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:21,179
so

3317
02:11:18,539 --> 02:11:22,500
uh I didn't really know about all that

3318
02:11:21,179 --> 02:11:25,800
stuff you know what I mean that was just

3319
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:28,500
I didn't really realize like the whole

3320
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:29,699
like uh

3321
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:31,738
I didn't you know I didn't really

3322
02:11:29,698 --> 02:11:34,198
realize the whole scope of it until a

3323
02:11:31,738 --> 02:11:36,000
few you know later

3324
02:11:34,198 --> 02:11:39,539
until then we were just growing like

3325
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:41,399
local strains like this G and this

3326
02:11:39,539 --> 02:11:43,019
Afghani number one that was like the

3327
02:11:41,399 --> 02:11:44,819
nastiest stuff ever

3328
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:47,760
and uh

3329
02:11:44,819 --> 02:11:49,618
the cream which was Charlotte's mom

3330
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,760
that stuff was a little later in the

3331
02:11:49,618 --> 02:11:53,460
stable

3332
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:55,560
uh

3333
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:57,899
yeah it was

3334
02:11:55,560 --> 02:12:00,539
it was more like what was regionally

3335
02:11:57,899 --> 02:12:02,098
available than you know and I assume

3336
02:12:00,539 --> 02:12:04,198
that a lot of that stuff was procured

3337
02:12:02,099 --> 02:12:06,840
from Amsterdam you know I mean like

3338
02:12:04,198 --> 02:12:08,339
people do go out there it's like you

3339
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:09,900
know it was a stoner repair you know

3340
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:11,639
that's where you went for genetics and

3341
02:12:09,899 --> 02:12:14,519
all that

3342
02:12:11,639 --> 02:12:17,219
do you know what the cream was

3343
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:18,780
yeah it's uh The Afghani number one time

3344
02:12:17,219 --> 02:12:20,880
is a Jack Herer

3345
02:12:18,779 --> 02:12:23,460
that's right okay the AFT check sorry I

3346
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,659
remember you said that okay

3347
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:27,239
uh

3348
02:12:24,658 --> 02:12:28,920
it would make you stupid it would like

3349
02:12:27,238 --> 02:12:30,598
make you so stupid that like you

3350
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:35,340
couldn't function that's why I thought

3351
02:12:30,599 --> 02:12:38,699
it had some other medical quality uh

3352
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:40,920
but it's it's funky and it's it I like

3353
02:12:38,698 --> 02:12:43,379
the Afghan number one like we're we're

3354
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:45,840
on like a you know he's got some skunk

3355
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:48,000
and I've got I think I got that Afghan

3356
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:49,920
one coming back I found somebody

3357
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,399
uh the internet is a wonderful thing

3358
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:55,859
sometimes like uh

3359
02:12:53,399 --> 02:12:58,439
there's a like the Clone trading and

3360
02:12:55,859 --> 02:12:59,819
like the it's you know what I mean like

3361
02:12:58,439 --> 02:13:02,098
the

3362
02:12:59,819 --> 02:13:03,719
the genetics they're moving all over you

3363
02:13:02,099 --> 02:13:05,520
know what I mean that's pretty cool it's

3364
02:13:03,719 --> 02:13:08,639
a great way to get past the disease too

3365
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:11,820
but uh you know what I mean or nowadays

3366
02:13:08,639 --> 02:13:13,679
man like nowadays viruses are they're

3367
02:13:11,819 --> 02:13:15,779
all the rage you know what I mean right

3368
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:18,118
like that seems to be

3369
02:13:15,779 --> 02:13:20,519
the zeitgeist

3370
02:13:18,118 --> 02:13:22,019
it seems to be relatively new now though

3371
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:25,619
it seems to have something to do with

3372
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:28,800
like the hemp thing that's going on and

3373
02:13:25,618 --> 02:13:31,679
yeah it certainly spread uh sped up

3374
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:34,139
sorry the the spread of a lot of viroids

3375
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:36,260
and various other sorts of things hasn't

3376
02:13:34,139 --> 02:13:36,260
it

3377
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:42,480
some ugly pet plants that had some [ __ ]

3378
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:44,279
like my buddy puts himself out they had

3379
02:13:42,479 --> 02:13:46,078
like a

3380
02:13:44,279 --> 02:13:47,759
it was some other

3381
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:50,279
weird virus you never heard of that

3382
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:52,860
affected like beets or something and it

3383
02:13:50,279 --> 02:13:54,840
looked all like cabbagey at the top and

3384
02:13:52,859 --> 02:13:56,219
all screwed up

3385
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,360
um

3386
02:13:56,219 --> 02:13:59,760
so

3387
02:13:57,359 --> 02:14:02,158
when I got here and we set up this big

3388
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:06,239
Warehouse the idiot that I came out here

3389
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:08,158
with uh Kelly roller uh this dude would

3390
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:09,839
lay under the plants cleaning the plants

3391
02:14:08,158 --> 02:14:11,399
smoking cigarettes like right at the

3392
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:13,739
stomata you know

3393
02:14:11,399 --> 02:14:17,339
like I'm pretty sure like that's how you

3394
02:14:13,738 --> 02:14:20,158
get tobacco mosaic virus so uh you know

3395
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:22,679

3405
02:14:39,479 --> 02:14:43,218
Waters

3406
02:14:40,618 --> 02:14:46,380
that is just Hops and carbonated water

3407
02:14:43,219 --> 02:14:47,698
and uh those turned out to be excellent

3408
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:50,578
so I still have all this brewing

3409
02:14:47,698 --> 02:14:53,698
equipment I'm trying to master those

3410
02:14:50,578 --> 02:14:56,099
uh and at one point I was like dude if

3411
02:14:53,698 --> 02:14:59,519
we uh

3412
02:14:56,099 --> 02:15:01,560
if we put some hops into the

3413
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:03,719
you know tea we could probably and then

3414
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:05,940
it was like nah man hot latent virus

3415
02:15:03,719 --> 02:15:07,739
that's you want hot plate virus that's

3416
02:15:05,939 --> 02:15:10,319
probably how you get that

3417
02:15:07,738 --> 02:15:13,618
but I did that once way long ago and it

3418
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:16,078
really did make the the herb more funky

3419
02:15:13,618 --> 02:15:19,139
like uh

3420
02:15:16,078 --> 02:15:21,238
and it was stonier like the mercy was up

3421
02:15:19,139 --> 02:15:23,940
you know

3422
02:15:21,238 --> 02:15:26,039
yeah nice that's interesting that's

3423
02:15:23,939 --> 02:15:29,698
really interesting to hear

3424
02:15:26,039 --> 02:15:31,979
I um I wanted to ask you what can you

3425
02:15:29,698 --> 02:15:33,479
tell me about the G13 clone you've said

3426
02:15:31,979 --> 02:15:34,859
a few times you know you've had it for a

3427
02:15:33,479 --> 02:15:37,379
long time and I saw on your Instagram

3428
02:15:34,859 --> 02:15:39,000
you're doing the reversal with it can

3429
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:41,099
you tell us a bit about what your plans

3430
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,920
with it are and if you can give any

3431
02:15:41,099 --> 02:15:47,340
insight on the back story

3432
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:50,039
I got my first uh

3433
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:52,260
spider mites from this kid

3434
02:15:50,039 --> 02:15:54,899
Jason Cantrell I think he's passed away

3435
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:58,679
but they came on this Afghani number one

3436
02:15:54,899 --> 02:16:01,500
and this G13 and we were told

3437
02:15:58,679 --> 02:16:02,279
like basically okay so if you find an

3438
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:05,279
old

3439
02:16:02,279 --> 02:16:07,618
Seed Catalog from back in the day

3440
02:16:05,279 --> 02:16:08,939
there's like the one of those old ones

3441
02:16:07,618 --> 02:16:10,979
you know it's like black and white and

3442
02:16:08,939 --> 02:16:13,098
stuff there's actually a picture of the

3443
02:16:10,979 --> 02:16:17,759
geez that I have and it's like cut only

3444
02:16:13,099 --> 02:16:19,920
this was uh the the lore behind it is

3445
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:22,940
what is it Mississippi or Mass

3446
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:25,618
Mississippi they had the federal

3447
02:16:22,939 --> 02:16:27,419
marijuana growing program going on for

3448
02:16:25,618 --> 02:16:30,118
like that dude who you always see that

3449
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:32,460
gets like that [ __ ] ridiculous size

3450
02:16:30,118 --> 02:16:34,859
tinted joints every month he's like the

3451
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:37,199
only guy left on that program uh

3452
02:16:34,859 --> 02:16:39,599
supposedly that it came out of there and

3453
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:41,700
it was an Afghani and they started like

3454
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:43,739
so many seeds and that was the 13th one

3455
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:45,920
that they kept supposedly

3456
02:16:43,739 --> 02:16:50,218
uh

3457
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:52,739
and then somehow it got over to Neville

3458
02:16:50,218 --> 02:16:54,119
and then he showed that picture and then

3459
02:16:52,739 --> 02:16:57,000
it started getting crossed with stuff

3460
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:58,500
and a lot of people that's what you know

3461
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,959
there's a lot of gender thing crosses

3462
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:02,939
and then Duke here was really nice

3463
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:05,218
enough to back me up I showed him I had

3464
02:17:02,939 --> 02:17:08,040
one in the breeding tent Crossing with

3465
02:17:05,218 --> 02:17:09,959
the sour and I was like smell it and

3466
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:11,820
he's like yeah dude that's that and then

3467
02:17:09,959 --> 02:17:13,799
he would uh you know then he showed me

3468
02:17:11,819 --> 02:17:18,359
like that his

3469
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:20,518
88 G13 HP it'll have that same Vibe and

3470
02:17:18,359 --> 02:17:24,960
uh which other one

3471
02:17:20,519 --> 02:17:27,599
the Airborne uh which I you know I've

3472
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:30,718
seen I don't think it had it but this is

3473
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:32,460
like more concentrated version of that

3474
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:33,358
and so

3475
02:17:32,459 --> 02:17:35,279
um

3476
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:36,719
he's got a couple things that have that

3477
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:38,639
in it we're gonna try and put it on

3478
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:42,659
those and

3479
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:44,339
but uh yeah so it's like a funky little

3480
02:17:42,659 --> 02:17:46,379
smells like food

3481
02:17:44,340 --> 02:17:47,760
like uh

3482
02:17:46,379 --> 02:17:51,239
I don't know

3483
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:52,920
ugly little plant that yeah it's like if

3484
02:17:51,239 --> 02:17:55,199
you took the lemon off the lemon G

3485
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:58,379
basically yeah you're left with the

3486
02:17:55,200 --> 02:18:01,979
cheese but it you know um it's been beat

3487
02:17:58,379 --> 02:18:05,638
up man like I think that that cut uh I

3488
02:18:01,978 --> 02:18:07,679
wanna give some props to a guy I call

3489
02:18:05,638 --> 02:18:09,779
Grandpa

3490
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:12,000
um he's one of my best buddies I met him

3491
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:14,280
back when I was like 17. he was the

3492
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,898
first guy I renewed to grow a plant he

3493
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:17,700
called it Sasha

3494
02:18:15,898 --> 02:18:20,159
and uh

3495
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:23,579
he was the keeper of that g for many

3496
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:26,340
many years but it has probably had every

3497
02:18:23,579 --> 02:18:29,039
single bug you can think of it's fought

3498
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:32,099
off fungus it's been it's never turned

3499
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:34,920
hermy ever like you can't get it to

3500
02:18:32,099 --> 02:18:38,340
throw a flower it's like super solid

3501
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:40,519
and uh so it's just been hanging out

3502
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:45,000
I I think it could use a little

3503
02:18:40,519 --> 02:18:47,880
Rejuvenation and I you know luckily for

3504
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:49,978
a a buddy named Nick mccooms who got the

3505
02:18:47,879 --> 02:18:52,679
job at Greenworks after I was fired or

3506
02:18:49,978 --> 02:18:55,500
got like whatever you want to call it uh

3507
02:18:52,679 --> 02:18:59,099
he saved it he saved a couple of my

3508
02:18:55,500 --> 02:19:01,439
things and and got me the that's

3509
02:18:59,099 --> 02:19:03,599
you might have given me my our uh four

3510
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:06,780
back then I'm thinking because he he

3511
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:10,079
like uh disgruntled with the company

3512
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:12,179
and so he stopped working there so like

3513
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:14,398
uh yeah I got he you know he kept some

3514
02:19:12,179 --> 02:19:17,819
of the Ohio stuff you know when these

3515
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:19,500
guys like I said these the Ohio guys are

3516
02:19:17,819 --> 02:19:20,939
coming out now you know like being a

3517
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:24,239
little more

3518
02:19:20,939 --> 02:19:25,800
uh on the insta and stuff and I see guys

3519
02:19:24,239 --> 02:19:27,599
working with the lemon and all this and

3520
02:19:25,799 --> 02:19:29,879
uh they say they have the G but when

3521
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:32,340
they when I ask him for pictures it's

3522
02:19:29,879 --> 02:19:34,739
definitely not my G you know what I mean

3523
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:36,960
like it looks more like the Airborne you

3524
02:19:34,739 --> 02:19:39,478
know bigger Buds and not quite the

3525
02:19:36,959 --> 02:19:40,739
because my G's kind of like bluish green

3526
02:19:39,478 --> 02:19:43,438
and like

3527
02:19:40,739 --> 02:19:47,159
I don't know not the same planet

3528
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:49,859
and so when Adam moved out to Colorado

3529
02:19:47,159 --> 02:19:52,079
he sent it uh this is awesome he said

3530
02:19:49,859 --> 02:19:55,020
his goons and they were awesome these

3531
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:56,700
two guys came Big Mike and uh

3532
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:58,739
Sam squanch I don't know what that

3533
02:19:56,700 --> 02:20:00,920
dude's name was you it was a beast so we

3534
02:19:58,739 --> 02:20:04,799
had gotten some herb and some of that G

3535
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:07,620
and uh he woke up and I handed it to him

3536
02:20:04,799 --> 02:20:09,239
I'm like hey man this is my G and he

3537
02:20:07,620 --> 02:20:11,340
took a big old hit and he got this look

3538
02:20:09,239 --> 02:20:13,319
on his face like he was pissed and he's

3539
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:15,420
like I don't know if I like that at all

3540
02:20:13,319 --> 02:20:18,478
what you know what I mean

3541
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:20,760
it's it's got a not a normal turret

3542
02:20:18,478 --> 02:20:23,279
profile so I think that's important to

3543
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:25,739
bring back you know what I mean like

3544
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:28,320
we're just getting homogeneous Terps

3545
02:20:25,739 --> 02:20:31,079
kinda like now you know it's weird how

3546
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:33,600
we have uh what's the new one candy gas

3547
02:20:31,079 --> 02:20:36,840
that's what everybody wants

3548
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:39,780
yeah and I think I think that's the new

3549
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:42,120
before it was fruity gas I hate fruity

3550
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:45,600
gas that's like oh my weed to be just

3551
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:47,520
funky and fire and gassy like keep your

3552
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,439
yeah

3553
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:51,359
if it's fruity I want a fruity like it's

3554
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:53,280
just weird I don't know it sucks that

3555
02:20:51,359 --> 02:20:54,960
trends like there's you know there's

3556
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:58,739
we're gonna have to break free of this

3557
02:20:54,959 --> 02:20:59,879
uh this weird mold that we're not you

3558
02:20:58,739 --> 02:21:02,639
know like the bowl that we're all

3559
02:20:59,879 --> 02:21:04,318
trapped in when it comes to I mean you

3560
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:07,680
could only read something so long like

3561
02:21:04,318 --> 02:21:10,219
right before it becomes genetically

3562
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:10,220
yeah

3563
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:15,420
and no fun yeah there's yeah

3564
02:21:13,318 --> 02:21:17,760
I mean

3565
02:21:15,420 --> 02:21:19,559
I was in a our argument I was in a

3566
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:21,960
conversation with some people and we

3567
02:21:19,559 --> 02:21:24,000
were talking about like you know f1s

3568
02:21:21,959 --> 02:21:27,059
versus like F5 so we're like you know

3569
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:28,020
respect the work F5 and but you when you

3570
02:21:27,059 --> 02:21:30,478
start them all you're definitely getting

3571
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:32,700
the whole it's all the same like there's

3572
02:21:30,478 --> 02:21:35,699
that's cool if you want that exact thing

3573
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:39,180
but it kind of loses a little oomph and

3574
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:40,979
like those fresh F ones or even f2s man

3575
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:43,800
that all that stuff so like you get a I

3576
02:21:40,978 --> 02:21:44,639
like Tofino hunt that's the fun part of

3577
02:21:43,799 --> 02:21:47,279
uh

3578
02:21:44,639 --> 02:21:49,799
of growing weed right it's fun to do but

3579
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:52,859
like yeah man I wanna I wanna I wanna

3580
02:21:49,799 --> 02:21:55,619
see different uh expressions of the same

3581
02:21:52,859 --> 02:21:58,079
plants that you know

3582
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:59,760
I don't know yeah you see those guys

3583
02:21:58,079 --> 02:22:03,139
talking about like heavy apps like I

3584
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:07,020
took it to F20 and you're like but why

3585
02:22:03,139 --> 02:22:09,779
what it's um it was homogeneous in like

3586
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:12,000
five kinda I don't see what your what

3587
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:16,560

3590
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:22,439
think that uh dude can I get along well

3591
02:22:20,219 --> 02:22:25,379
we both have the same kind of style when

3592
02:22:22,439 --> 02:22:26,880
it comes to like regenerative soil you

3593
02:22:25,379 --> 02:22:30,000

you know like uh

3606
02:22:58,620 --> 02:23:03,180

02:23:07,139 --> 02:23:12,059
what's so special about it you know uh

3611
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:14,460
what's different like

3612
02:23:12,059 --> 02:23:16,379
it's weird how

3613
02:23:14,459 --> 02:23:18,299
there's there's so many breeders out

3614
02:23:16,379 --> 02:23:20,938
there now and they each like you know

3615
02:23:18,299 --> 02:23:23,938
most of them there's a few of them just

3616
02:23:20,939 --> 02:23:26,880
do that hype on hype on hype you know

3617
02:23:23,939 --> 02:23:29,760
and then you know a few of them like JJ

3618
02:23:26,879 --> 02:23:32,099
do care that they all you know they try

3619
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:34,620
to work it out like

3620
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:36,359
don't just buy well actually I did I

3621
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:39,120
bought a Tempo I was giving a 10 bag of

3622
02:23:36,359 --> 02:23:42,059
seeds and I bred with it well I I did

3623
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:44,520
because out of literally ten thousand

3624
02:23:42,059 --> 02:23:47,039
dollars worth of seeds that I started

3625
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:48,659
two plants like there's a lot of garbage

3626
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:50,819
in there and those are like some of

3627
02:23:48,659 --> 02:23:52,559
those were like 200 packs from people

3628
02:23:50,818 --> 02:23:54,898
who were like you know

3629
02:23:52,559 --> 02:23:56,879
breeders and stuff but they were like

3630
02:23:54,898 --> 02:23:58,920
the most garbage [ __ ] I've ever seen

3631
02:23:56,879 --> 02:24:00,599
like

3632
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:03,120
uh

3633
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:06,300
start with [ __ ] bangers you know like

3634
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:10,560
I chose that taxi because

3635
02:24:06,299 --> 02:24:14,039
it hit me like man I love this weed this

3636
02:24:10,559 --> 02:24:15,959
is great this is this is my what weed

3637
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:18,420
should be it hits all the notches you

3638
02:24:15,959 --> 02:24:21,898
know what I mean it's it's funky it's

3639
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:25,739
got this crazy like mouth feel that like

3640
02:24:21,898 --> 02:24:28,920
leaves that greasy I just like some I

3641
02:24:25,739 --> 02:24:31,439
farted in my mouth or something uh and

3642
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:32,939
you know I I enjoy a weed that I could

3643
02:24:31,439 --> 02:24:34,680
smoke all day

3644
02:24:32,939 --> 02:24:39,359
because like that you know

3645
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:42,359
I smoke weed all day yeah so

3646
02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:45,120
and it fits into my so my growing style

3647
02:24:42,359 --> 02:24:46,079
is I got these big ass beds

3648
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,479
um

3649
02:24:46,079 --> 02:24:50,459
like full of soil which is

3650
02:24:48,478 --> 02:24:52,139
I'm still getting the hang of man you

3651
02:24:50,459 --> 02:24:53,579
know like there's some it's an

3652
02:24:52,139 --> 02:24:54,898
interesting

3653
02:24:53,579 --> 02:24:56,818
you know when you're working with all

3654
02:24:54,898 --> 02:25:00,719
one big bet it's an interesting bit I

3655
02:24:56,818 --> 02:25:03,180
got some blue mats water it in and uh I

3656
02:25:00,719 --> 02:25:04,679
use Ambassador soil that's definitely

3657
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:06,898
not something you can get it down there

3658
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:09,359
I think my Buddy Rich makes it it's all

3659
02:25:06,898 --> 02:25:10,500
like small craft Blended and it's all

3660
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:12,420
super

3661
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:14,700
uh I think the plants eat better than I

3662
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:17,540
do like for instance

3663
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:20,220
I mean

3664
02:25:17,540 --> 02:25:23,819
Alfalfa cattle protein soft rock

3669
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:35,700
the planet

3670
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:37,318
like as far as like antioxidant

3671
02:25:35,700 --> 02:25:39,359
properties and anti yeah look into

3672
02:25:37,318 --> 02:25:41,039
Moringa man it's like a it is I don't

3673
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:44,280
even know how like it is one of the most

3674
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:48,420
medicinal plants on the planet so

3675
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:49,020
um hey start with something you like

3676
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:50,818
um

3677
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:53,579
something you know why you have a

3678
02:25:50,818 --> 02:25:56,159
purpose like why are you you know just

3679
02:25:53,579 --> 02:25:57,420
don't take two stupid things start you

3680
02:25:56,159 --> 02:25:59,340
know and pick whatever out of there

3681
02:25:57,420 --> 02:26:01,799
there has to be you know like if you're

3682
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:02,639
breeding for excellent genetics you have

3683
02:26:01,799 --> 02:26:06,478
to

3684
02:26:02,639 --> 02:26:08,699
uh start with the parents you know like

3685
02:26:06,478 --> 02:26:10,858
uh

3686
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:13,260
you know and a lot what the next one

3687
02:26:10,859 --> 02:26:15,780
isn't applicable to a lot of people

3688
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:17,460
unless you know like uh when Ben

3689
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:19,680
dronkers started that skunk number one

3690
02:26:17,459 --> 02:26:22,919
he started ten thousand seeds and

3691
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:24,960
whittled it down from there you know

3692
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:27,059
um a high amount what do you call that

3693
02:26:24,959 --> 02:26:29,719
uh

3694
02:26:27,059 --> 02:26:29,719
a

3695
02:26:30,359 --> 02:26:34,500
a large

3696
02:26:32,219 --> 02:26:37,739
uh population like a good seed pop you

3697
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:41,398
know what I mean a Fino month you start

3698
02:26:37,739 --> 02:26:43,020
you know 20 20 30 seeds you're gonna see

3699
02:26:41,398 --> 02:26:44,699
winners come out of those for the most

3700
02:26:43,020 --> 02:26:45,780
part unless you're running like JJ's

3701
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:47,880
here I think they come out of everyone

3702
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:49,319
I'm gonna give that dude props again I

3703
02:26:47,879 --> 02:26:52,559
think he's a [ __ ] terrific breeder

3704
02:26:49,318 --> 02:26:54,600
and uh you know uh

3705
02:26:52,559 --> 02:26:56,100
uh you know I'm honored that he let's

3706
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:57,420
see where he's he doesn't like a lot of

3707
02:26:56,100 --> 02:27:00,300
people working with himself but he let

3708
02:26:57,420 --> 02:27:02,100
me do it I said and I sent him back uh

3709
02:27:00,299 --> 02:27:03,358
all the seeds that I made with it you

3710
02:27:02,100 --> 02:27:06,420
know I mean I sent him backpacks and

3711
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:07,920
like big ones and uh for him to work you

3712
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:10,500
know what I mean that's another thing

3713
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:12,478
like if you're gonna make seeds don't be

3714
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:14,939
a dick don't ask one somebody's beer

3715
02:27:12,478 --> 02:27:16,938
don't like reproduce people's gear that

3716
02:27:14,939 --> 02:27:18,960
they're working with you know like

3717
02:27:16,939 --> 02:27:22,020
be your own

3718
02:27:18,959 --> 02:27:24,659
like you know make your own path like

3719
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:26,340
find weird [ __ ] find the one that works

3720
02:27:24,659 --> 02:27:29,520
like

3721
02:27:26,340 --> 02:27:31,200
you know what I mean don't just

3722
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:32,399
I don't know don't just do it because

3723
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:34,740
it's cool

3724
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:36,478

3725
02:27:34,739 --> 02:27:38,818
like

3726
02:27:36,478 --> 02:27:41,459
reasons like why you put those two

3727
02:27:38,818 --> 02:27:42,978
together like what about you know what

3728
02:27:41,459 --> 02:27:46,438
do you like about that what do you think

3729
02:27:42,978 --> 02:27:47,699
that you're male which you should

3730
02:27:46,439 --> 02:27:49,680
run

3731
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:50,760
at least to see you know what's going on

3732
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:54,260
and make sure

3733
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:54,260
you check everything because

3734
02:27:54,478 --> 02:27:59,039
like uh

3735
02:27:56,280 --> 02:28:01,800
if you if you cross two plants that have

3736
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:04,380
a propensity to be hermaphroditic or

3737
02:28:01,799 --> 02:28:06,239
intersexual you're gonna breed that Gene

3738
02:28:04,379 --> 02:28:07,699
in there and it's just gonna

3739
02:28:06,239 --> 02:28:11,639
like

3740
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:12,840
magnify the chances of that uh showing

3741
02:28:11,639 --> 02:28:15,000
itself

3742
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:17,659
you don't want that

3743
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,659
so

3744
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:22,318
like okay so what you know be original I

3745
02:28:20,700 --> 02:28:23,159
guess that would be awesome like we need

3746
02:28:22,318 --> 02:28:25,500
more

3747
02:28:23,159 --> 02:28:28,079
uh

3748
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:30,359
need more weird [ __ ] like I don't

3749
02:28:28,079 --> 02:28:31,620
[ __ ] care about how your cake tastes

3750
02:28:30,359 --> 02:28:34,439

3751
02:28:31,620 --> 02:28:37,620

3752
02:28:34,439 --> 02:28:40,040

3753
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:42,960

work with and that you know like if you

3758
02:28:49,318 --> 02:28:54,000
like if you get seeds if you buy a pack

3759
02:28:51,780 --> 02:28:55,260
of dirty you know one of those and you

3760
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,000
decide you're gonna cross it with

3761
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:58,978
something uh

3762
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:01,200

3763
02:28:58,978 --> 02:29:03,299
you know you're not

3764
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:05,280
and don't don't be naming your [ __ ]

3765

amazing man like the fact that you know

3804

like that the CBD thing popped off even

3805
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:52,139
though it did the way it did like you

3806
02:30:49,139 --> 02:30:54,420
know knowing that like something I did

3807
02:30:52,139 --> 02:30:56,639
brought

3808
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:58,439
like helped bring the whole thing to the

3809
02:30:56,639 --> 02:30:59,579
table you know what I mean I brought

3810
02:30:58,439 --> 02:31:00,898
that plant and the next thing you know

3811
02:30:59,579 --> 02:31:03,659
it's on TV the next thing you know I'm

3812
02:31:00,898 --> 02:31:06,059
getting legalized like I feel like I had

3813
02:31:03,659 --> 02:31:08,340
a hand in that and that makes that's

3814
02:31:06,059 --> 02:31:10,139
fulfilling to me

3815
02:31:08,340 --> 02:31:12,359
um knowing that you know I dedicated my

3816
02:31:10,139 --> 02:31:13,920
life to this plant and it actually

3817
02:31:12,359 --> 02:31:15,420
did something so that's the most

3818
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:17,639
significant one how's that the fact that

3819
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:22,398
I know that I did something like

3820
02:31:17,639 --> 02:31:25,680
profound in the what I love

3821
02:31:22,398 --> 02:31:30,539
hell yeah what a brilliant answer

3822
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:32,460
so next question what is a strain where

3823
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:34,020
all of your friends were hyping it up

3824
02:31:32,459 --> 02:31:35,699
telling you like man you gotta try it's

3825
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:39,659
the next best thing and then you finally

3826
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:42,979
tried it and you were like ah is that it

3827
02:31:39,659 --> 02:31:42,978
that's a good question

3828
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:48,059
I hate uh and no offense to Jeff from

3829
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:51,420
irie I think he's a great dude I hate

3830
02:31:48,059 --> 02:31:54,659
Golden Goat people I know like love that

3831
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:56,579
[ __ ] it's like Ah that's gross like uh

3832
02:31:54,659 --> 02:31:59,520
just now it's you know like I said that

3833
02:31:56,579 --> 02:32:00,719
my brain isn't on the Golden Goat

3834
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:02,579
all right

3835
02:32:00,719 --> 02:32:04,559
um and recently my buddy's been trying

3836
02:32:02,579 --> 02:32:06,239
to convince me a runs that's how I knew

3837
02:32:04,559 --> 02:32:08,939
the guy that made runs is like a

3838
02:32:06,239 --> 02:32:11,340
millionaire now because he's like

3839
02:32:08,939 --> 02:32:12,898
he's just trying to convince me to like

3840
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:14,880
you should try growing this once man and

3841
02:32:12,898 --> 02:32:17,340
I'm like you know man I think we got

3842
02:32:14,879 --> 02:32:18,779
more in like I don't think uh I don't

3843
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:21,120
think Duke would be like yeah bring on

3844
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:23,640
the runs we'll work you know what I mean

3845
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:27,000
we're gonna cross some rocks with some

3846
02:32:23,639 --> 02:32:29,760
stuff although you know what uh to be

3847
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,680
honest uh I have a couple things that I

3848
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:35,520
like here like the cushman's and stuff

3849
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:39,059
and that's kind of bubba-esque and um

3850
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:40,739
I might do like a side project when we

3851
02:32:39,059 --> 02:32:42,659
get some of his stuff and like because I

3852
02:32:40,739 --> 02:32:45,600
think that that's a good strain that

3853
02:32:42,659 --> 02:32:49,439
that rabbit hippie cut is it's uh and

3854
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:51,180
this is why it's an amazing like it's on

3855
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:53,159
its own thing you know what I mean it's

3856
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:55,380
got that Bubba but it's a little

3857
02:32:53,159 --> 02:32:58,978
like sweeter and I don't know

3858
02:32:55,379 --> 02:33:00,599
uh and it stands out in a crowd

3859
02:32:58,978 --> 02:33:01,799
and that's important

3860
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:04,800
but

3861
02:33:01,799 --> 02:33:04,799
uh

3862
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:13,739
yeah Golden Goat I don't get it you know

3863
02:33:11,818 --> 02:33:15,719
yeah no that's a good one I haven't

3864
02:33:13,739 --> 02:33:18,600
tried it myself but there you go I like

3865
02:33:15,719 --> 02:33:20,398
the addition so for the next one imagine

3866
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:22,500
we're on a boat and I'm gonna drop you

3867
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:24,659
off on a desert island and you can take

3868
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:26,398
three strains with you to grow for the

3869
02:33:24,659 --> 02:33:28,799
rest of your life what three are you

3870
02:33:26,398 --> 02:33:30,358
gonna take

3871
02:33:28,799 --> 02:33:32,459
well

3872
02:33:30,359 --> 02:33:34,680
I'll probably need some for pain

3873
02:33:32,459 --> 02:33:38,898
so I'm gonna take a heavy indica and get

3874
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:38,898
Afghani I don't know which one though

3875
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:42,319
like uh

3876
02:33:43,859 --> 02:33:48,318
damn that's a really good question uh

3877
02:33:49,978 --> 02:33:55,199
I would take an OG Kush actually you

3878
02:33:51,959 --> 02:33:56,339
know what and I know that sounds weird

3879
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,979
um

3880
02:33:56,340 --> 02:34:00,420
before I smoked OG Kush I thought people

3881
02:33:58,978 --> 02:34:01,978
from California were just a bunch of

3882
02:34:00,420 --> 02:34:04,799
pompous douchebags not that that's

3883
02:34:01,978 --> 02:34:05,398
changed a lot but

3884
02:34:04,799 --> 02:34:07,199
um

3885
02:34:05,398 --> 02:34:09,119
they would always be like I only smoke

3886
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:10,920
OG Kush bro and it's like yeah whatever

3887
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:14,340
dude there's hundreds of strains you're

3888
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:16,920
just just [ __ ] up you know then I smoke

3889
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:20,280
some good OG and I was like you know

3890
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:22,318
all right I can see what and I think

3891
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:24,600
it's a great strain now that I've uh

3892
02:34:22,318 --> 02:34:27,000
kind of experienced you know

3893
02:34:24,600 --> 02:34:28,318
um a few different ones like we were

3894
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,659
talking about the San Fernando Valley

3895
02:34:28,318 --> 02:34:32,939
one of my favorites uh also there's this

3896
02:34:30,659 --> 02:34:35,639
one out here called uh

3897
02:34:32,939 --> 02:34:37,800
the the Coal Creek

3898
02:34:35,639 --> 02:34:39,420
not the Cold Creek the Cold Creek yeah

3899
02:34:37,799 --> 02:34:42,299
uh

3900
02:34:39,420 --> 02:34:44,398
and that one is like spectacular and

3901
02:34:42,299 --> 02:34:49,818
juicy uh

3902
02:34:44,398 --> 02:34:49,818
so yes one would be OG Kush uh

3903
02:34:50,398 --> 02:34:54,239
the second might be that Afghani number

3904
02:34:52,079 --> 02:34:56,219
ones were back in the day you know but

3905
02:34:54,239 --> 02:34:58,619
Nostalgia has a lot to do with your

3906
02:34:56,219 --> 02:35:03,239
memories you know like as far as I can

3907
02:34:58,620 --> 02:35:07,319
remember it was nasty skunky earthy like

3908
02:35:03,239 --> 02:35:09,379
Stoney like grew beautiful

3909
02:35:07,318 --> 02:35:09,379
um

3910
02:35:10,379 --> 02:35:14,699
and then

3911
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:15,840
something with CBD I suppose you know

3912
02:35:14,700 --> 02:35:17,520
you're gonna want

3913
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:19,439
I mean if I'm stuck there for the rest

3914
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:22,920
of my life I'm gonna need medicine

3915
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:24,120
right so something full spectrum like uh

3916
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:25,318
because at that point you don't need a

3917
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:27,120
one-to-one because you got your weed

3918
02:35:25,318 --> 02:35:28,799
there

3919
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,460
um

3920
02:35:28,799 --> 02:35:31,459
so

3921
02:35:34,379 --> 02:35:40,259
I don't know uh this can is so hard

3922
02:35:38,340 --> 02:35:42,600
that was [ __ ] beautiful man my buddy

3923
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:44,000
Ian and I put it together and it's

3924
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:47,880
Canada

3925
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:50,100
uh tonic sour tsunami uh and Harlequin

3926
02:35:47,879 --> 02:35:51,839
with and it's all like basically he just

3927
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:55,020
we put them all in there it turns purple

3928
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:57,359
has a fruit bouquet great like have you

3929
02:35:55,020 --> 02:35:58,319
ever smoked any CBD dominant bud or

3930
02:35:57,359 --> 02:36:01,859
anything

3931
02:35:58,318 --> 02:36:04,199
yeah yeah it's enjoyable yeah it's uh

3932
02:36:01,859 --> 02:36:06,780
they say it's not psychoactive but you

3933
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:09,120
know I'll be dead man that uh sure puts

3934
02:36:06,780 --> 02:36:11,399
some kind of feeling on you

3935
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:15,060
so

3936
02:36:11,398 --> 02:36:17,760
something like that like the AC DC or uh

3937
02:36:15,059 --> 02:36:20,039
the can of so hard or just something

3938
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:21,300
that smokes good and grows well and does

3939
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:23,040
CBD

3940
02:36:21,299 --> 02:36:25,199
just because I mean you know we're not

3941
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:27,840
yeah we're just growing it to stay

3942
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:30,180
healthy right so

3943
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:33,260
yeah there you go

3944
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:36,000
brilliant answers so as a follow-up

3945
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:37,859
we're gonna drop someone else off on the

3946
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:40,379
island this time someone you're not a

3947
02:36:37,859 --> 02:36:41,760
big fan of you get to choose what three

3948
02:36:40,379 --> 02:36:44,219
strains you're going to leave them with

3949
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:47,600
what would you give them

3950
02:36:44,219 --> 02:36:47,599
some Dr grinspoon

3951
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:52,680
um

3952
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:54,540
yeah

3953
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:56,220
um

3954
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:58,260
uphill battle

3955
02:36:56,219 --> 02:36:59,699
like

3956
02:36:58,260 --> 02:37:01,559
some hemp

3957
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:03,359
CBD ham you know you want to stay

3958
02:37:01,559 --> 02:37:04,680
healthy enough that they live a long

3959
02:37:03,359 --> 02:37:07,220
time but you don't want them to get as

3960
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:12,139
high as they potentially could right

3961
02:37:07,219 --> 02:37:12,139
yeah yeah and uh

3962
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:16,159
uh

3963
02:37:16,439 --> 02:37:19,979
uh some pure Haze

3964
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:23,580
throw them

3965
02:37:19,978 --> 02:37:25,739
you know love it love it some they're

3966
02:37:23,579 --> 02:37:27,299
gonna have to work for it but like so I

3967
02:37:25,739 --> 02:37:28,619
get to leave or do I don't have to stay

3968
02:37:27,299 --> 02:37:31,279
with them

3969
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:34,380
nah no no no it's just that

3970
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:37,020
oh okay cool

3971
02:37:34,379 --> 02:37:38,938
so as the final question

3972
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:41,700
I'm gonna give you a time machine you

3973
02:37:38,939 --> 02:37:44,100
can go any place geographically any

3974
02:37:41,700 --> 02:37:46,500
point in history to collect some seeds

3975
02:37:44,100 --> 02:37:48,059
or a clone where are you gonna go what

3976
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:50,159
are you gonna get

3977
02:37:48,059 --> 02:37:53,219
the future

3978
02:37:50,159 --> 02:37:57,000
and I have no idea

3979
02:37:53,219 --> 02:37:59,159
gotta bring yeah the Integrity weed that

3980
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:01,500
saves the future from you know what I

3981
02:37:59,159 --> 02:38:04,079
mean yeah

3982
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:06,780
like why would you yeah I go forward in

3983
02:38:04,079 --> 02:38:09,539
time and grab you know once they figure

3984
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:12,060
out and get it all you know the

3985
02:38:09,540 --> 02:38:14,580
I mean

3986
02:38:12,059 --> 02:38:17,760
I don't know you know like

3987
02:38:14,579 --> 02:38:20,159
everything now is available like it's

3988
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:23,040
cool I mean if you look hard enough

3989
02:38:20,159 --> 02:38:26,760
you can basically get

3990
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:28,620
you know anything like you want old

3991
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:31,380
Mexicans you get old Mexicans you want

3992
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:35,760
all your classic you know Thai all that

3993
02:38:31,379 --> 02:38:39,358
stuff is still available so I don't

3994
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:43,700
I don't know what why

3995
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:43,700
yeah man something that's not old

3996
02:38:44,219 --> 02:38:49,679
you know does that make sense

3997
02:38:47,159 --> 02:38:51,180
yeah definitely look no one's ever said

3998
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:53,880
they're gonna go forward either so I

3999
02:38:51,180 --> 02:38:55,020
love that for the uniqueness but that's

4000
02:38:53,879 --> 02:38:57,059
in line

4001
02:38:55,020 --> 02:38:59,579
it's in line with this whole episode

4002
02:38:57,059 --> 02:39:01,619
given you bring a a unique perspective

4003
02:38:59,579 --> 02:39:03,719
which we've enjoyed very much so with

4004
02:39:01,620 --> 02:39:05,280
that being said I think that just about

4005
02:39:03,719 --> 02:39:06,959
brings us to the end of things were

4006

4013
02:39:24,659 --> 02:39:31,559
my mom like most of all you know like uh

4014
02:39:29,579 --> 02:39:34,920
she accepted

4015
02:39:31,559 --> 02:39:36,719
that I chose a different lifestyle and

4016
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:39,420
it was because of her like she raised me

4017
02:39:36,719 --> 02:39:41,279
and uh there were

4018
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:43,200
you know like I don't think she knew

4019
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:45,960
what she was doing but I would ask her

4020
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:48,420
to tell me stories about the 70s and

4021
02:39:45,959 --> 02:39:50,818
Timothy Leary and Woodstock and all that

4022
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:53,520
[ __ ] and my mom wasn't like a hippie or

4023
02:39:50,818 --> 02:39:55,680
like a you know but she she was

4024
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:58,560
she grew up in that time and you know

4025
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:59,818
the more she told me all about LSD and

4026
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:01,379
like you know for you know people are

4027
02:39:59,818 --> 02:40:05,219
jumping out of buildings but that got me

4028
02:40:01,379 --> 02:40:08,879
curious and that's what led me to uh

4029
02:40:05,219 --> 02:40:13,858
you know my my alternative lifestyle

4030
02:40:08,879 --> 02:40:15,719
that I chose uh at a you know was uh I

4031
02:40:13,859 --> 02:40:18,420
think due to all those Pharmaceuticals

4032
02:40:15,719 --> 02:40:21,299
that they gave me as a kid but uh she

4033
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:23,460
supported me you know through like okay

4034
02:40:21,299 --> 02:40:25,739
here quick

4035
02:40:23,459 --> 02:40:27,839
so I I go to her house for Christmas I'm

4036
02:40:25,739 --> 02:40:30,059
there on Christmas Eve I had a drug lab

4037
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:31,079
right that's what I got busted for and

4038
02:40:30,059 --> 02:40:34,739
uh

4039
02:40:31,079 --> 02:40:36,359
I was like on a lot of drugs and I I was

4040
02:40:34,739 --> 02:40:37,799
like I was breaking down because you

4041
02:40:36,359 --> 02:40:41,700
know when you're at your mom's house all

4042
02:40:37,799 --> 02:40:43,259
[ __ ] fired up and uh on Christmas you

4043
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:45,479
know looking back like I'm [ __ ] up

4044
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:47,460
and she comes up and she's like what's

4045
02:40:45,478 --> 02:40:49,318
going on

4046
02:40:47,459 --> 02:40:51,539
and I'm like it's you know life's been

4047
02:40:49,318 --> 02:40:52,739
Savages like you didn't kill anybody or

4048
02:40:51,540 --> 02:40:55,319
