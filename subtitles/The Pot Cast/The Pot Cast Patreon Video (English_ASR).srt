00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,359
hey guys heavy days here from the

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,000
podcast I just wanted to make a quick

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:12,599
video to explain what this patreon's all

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
about over the past 12 months I've

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,798
received an overwhelming amount of

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
support and positive feedback for the

7
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:20,160
show and for that I cannot thank you all

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,839
enough it's truly been a labor of love

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,278
and something I've felt was more of a

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,000
passion than a job however with that

11
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:27,920
being said the biggest criticism I've

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,320
always got was that episodes took too

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,439
long to come out and that there wasn't

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
enough regular content so with that in

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,759
mind I've decided to started this

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,320
patreon account I want to be able to

17
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,039
dedicate more of my time to being able

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,520
to create better quality content and

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,920
more importantly more regular content so

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,640
I've decided I'm going to be creating

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,320
content on a more regular basis making

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,878
two episodes a month one being a patreon

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,399
exclusive with an additional video for

24
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:54,358
higher patreon tiers all of the

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,239
additional patreon content will become

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,079
available to the general public after a

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,878
few weeks because I never wanted to put

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,399
anything behind a hard pay wall

29
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,960
last year I was lucky enough to be able

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,320
to head over the states and spend some

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,719
time with some of my favorite breeders I

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,079
tried to make some really good quality

33
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,400
content however I fell short due to

34
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,319
underestimating the situations I'd be in

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
and bringing the adequate gear for that

36
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,959
I'd love to be able to get back to the

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,798
States and to be able to create some

38
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,239
really high quality media content for

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,600
everyone things like walkthroughs in the

40
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,560
gardens with breeders like BOD Brothers

41
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,000
Grim Matt Ry Coastal seeds Dynasty and

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,759
more ultimately whether you donate

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,118
anything or not is not important I'm

44
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,040
just really grateful that people watch

45
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:35,759
the show and that people enjoy it I'm

46
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,680
really excited to be able to create more

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
content on a regular basis and I hope

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,799
that you guys enjoy it as well and if

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,759
you do appreciate it again feel free to

50
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,439
sign up it really helps to have that

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,078
extra funding and it allows me to be

52
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,359
able to spend more time creating the

53
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:50,319
content that I'm hoping you guys are

54
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,640
going to love be sure to check out the

55
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,039
description box below I'll make sure

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,118
that there's some information in there

57
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,240
about what patreon fans can expect to

58
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,560
get from their exclusive

59
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,919
rewards and hopefully we can make this

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,240
show even better than it is

61
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,219
already so again a big thank you to

62
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:12,408
