let's get into it

92
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,098
so let's go back a bit you uh you moved

93
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,260
to the neighborhood and you started

94
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:13,139
getting exposed to a lot of the strains

95
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:15,298
we've talked about what was the progress

96
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,978
like before you started to do your own

97
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,280
open pollinations or did it happen

98
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,259
immediately

99
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,899
uh yeah no it didn't happen immediately

100
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:28,139
you know we were reading like uh

101
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:30,539
Rob Clark you know marijuana pot is was

102
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,939
the one you know that we were reading

103
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,800
back then and it's a great great great

104
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:41,579
book you know Timeless uh a real gem

105
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,379
uh but and and he would give you hints

106
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:45,899
you know about not backing yourself into

107
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,120
any Corners with your with your

108
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,638
selection you and and you give examples

109
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,639
of heterosis and stuff about you know

110
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,560
how how you know F1 was great for this

111
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,960
grower but in the next year there's a

112
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,478
few less and then eventually drove this

113
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,519
you know line into the ground and he

114
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,819
would give you examples of that in that

115
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,620
book and uh you know because and and and

116
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,319
and and speak of how this guy

117
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,840
inadvertently you know bred himself

118
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,139
backed himself into a corner and I can

119
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:19,138
you know so you could you could if you

120
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,060
could if you could hear that message

121
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,478
you know that he was trying to tell you

122
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,639
back then you know for for me first came

123
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,680
male pollen mixes was the big one okay

124
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm not gonna I'm not even gonna try to

125
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,879
select a male here because I don't want

126
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:33,839
to I don't want to lose something that's

127
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,759
special

128
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,739
and at the time something you can't even

129
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,900
really test for because you know you're

130
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,360
talking about smoke right how do I know

131
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:45,060
which one of these [ __ ] which one of

132
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,120
these males uh it smokes best you know

133
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,639
and uh I mean I'm not actually gonna

134
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,139
smoke and that's what Rob suggested he

135
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,939
said you know dry out a bag and see

136
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,160
which one disappears first

137
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,019
you know which is what I do with my

138
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
females but I'm not going to do that

139
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:01,379
with my males I'm just going to make a

140
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,939
[ __ ] male pollen mix and not back

141
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,860
myself into any corners and then

142
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,300
eventually you know a couple you know

143
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,038
after thinking about it more you'll

144
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,280
you'll end up at open pollination before

145
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,680
too long for that reason it's a it's a

146
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,138
way to make sure that you when you have

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,139
something you like it you know that you

148
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,600
don't [ __ ] it up just let let all the

149
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,160
pollen all the girls fly and then after

150
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,620
that you can [ __ ] around all you want

151
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,380
with more intensive breeding

152
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,079
yeah nice and I mean you've spoken

153
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:33,180
fondly about Rob Clark he's a phenomenal

154
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,399
source of information and a Pioneer I

155
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,680
was interested were there any other sort

156
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,399
of gurus breeders or other sources of

157
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,418
knowledge you hold in higher Steam

158
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,439
yeah

159
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,060
yeah I know

160
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,279
um gosh

161
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,319
any of them that they're

162
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,000
okay

163
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,699
any of them they can go out on a limb

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,019
and and voice something new when they

165
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,020
might be wrong you know

166
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:05,399
uh guys like Hive and and uh DJ Shore

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,639
you know he's got some bizarre theories

168
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,379
DJ Short does and uh you know and I

169
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,319
admire them for putting them out there

170
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,120
when uh you know

171
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,560
possible that people are going to laugh

172
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,780
at you

173
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,839
you know there's there's nothing I don't

174
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:24,059
respect anything higher than that people

175
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,978
that are willing to uh

176
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,319
you know say something that might sound

177
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:31,620
bizarre to a lot of others but you know

178
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,900
just just pure observation and and being

179
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,459
able to Bounce It Off people you know if

180
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,560
you don't say [ __ ] about what you're

181
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,719
thinking you know we're not going to get

182
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,120
very far are we

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,180
um and so I admire people that come

184
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,160
forward with you know bizarre new uh

185
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,079
theories and such

186
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,599
yeah a lot of those people you just

187
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,279
mentioned uh equally people I hold in

188
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,159
high esteem I'm interested now though

189
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,478
you mentioned it have you got any what

190
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,110
you would describe as bizarre

191
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,279
observations of your own

192
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,660
[Laughter]

193
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,000
um

194
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,340
sure I mean who doesn't I still suspect

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,379
these damn rents are where it's at you

196
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,818
know as big hire somebody back then said

197
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,839
it might have been spoken breeders to

198
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,939
you or somebody

199
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,198
but uh hey those might be the ones you

200
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,379
want

201
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,199
um just because you know so many times

202
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:25,860
this this best plan is is you know just

203
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,538
lacking in in in growth you know what

204
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,639
you want to see in in the growth of a

205
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,860
plant it turns out to be the best plant

206
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,820
but can you low yielding thing

207
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,740
so you know I kind of sometimes you'll

208
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,800
see these ones you know and they just

209
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,360
for a minute for for brief seconds you

210
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,699
know they can't bed dry you know but

211
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,639
then they they'll grow out of it and you

212
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,040
know and do fine but it's almost like a

213
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:54,240
regular environment is it freaks them

214
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,799
out you know uh these ones these ones

215
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,519
I've always I always like to keep an eye

216
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,799
on

217
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,700
they often they often are exceptional

218
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,919
one of the ones that won that uh you

219
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,980
mentioned that I see mag uh Cannabis Cup

220
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,240
or whatever 420 cup it was a plant like

221
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,519
that too

222
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,560
it's just happened so many times that I

223
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,759
always keep an eye on these ones that

224
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,859
are kind of

225
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,620
this one's you know kind of freaky doing

226
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,120
its own thing over here what's going on

227
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,980
but they'll often end up they'll often

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,080
surprise you and be kick ass you know

229
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,060
and it's never the plant that I always

230
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,759
say your favorite plant like changes

231
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,338
three or four times during the course of

232
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,019
a season you know

233
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,880
uh you know during gross you'll say oh

234
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,039
this one so I can kicking ass that's my

235
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,720
favorite plant as you enter buddy and

236
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,939
your favorite pal this one look at what

237

238
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,740
it keeps changing changing changing

239
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,379
looks smell resin resin you know and

240
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,778
then it changes one more time and by the

241
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,700
end that's when it hits the pipe and

242
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:54,838
that's the that's the final that's the

243
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,820
final say

244
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,100
you know

245
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,560
yeah I certainly have noticed that

246
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,860
myself a few times as well

247
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,479
it's a bit of a random sidestep question

248
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,120
but I'm curious to know what are you

249
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,940
growing this year

250
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,399
oh a bunch of popular crap or not even

251
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,800
popular just you know same stuff that

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,320
other people are you know growing in the

253
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,419
neighborhood a big variety of stuff I

254
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,740
have that that gelato 33 and that I

255
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,659
really liked

256
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,379
um I like the high off of it I won't lie

257
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:31,319
you know that's a good cerebral smoke

258
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,939
any other notable ones that you've been

259
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,560
impressed by

260
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,620
well there's a few that are coming in

261
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:40,139
now one Mendo fuel or something

262
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,019
uh that I haven't smoked yet it's still

263
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,458
uh it's just coming off the line uh

264
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,778
the [ __ ] that one I haven't even

265
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,399
harvested yet

266
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,200
there's a few of them that still need to

267
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,620
come in none of them are super

268
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,759
impressive from what I can see so far I

269
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,440
would say

270
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,059
and that's a drag

271
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,660
yeah

272
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,319
but they were free

273
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,439
[Music]

274
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,000
while we're talking about runs is that

275
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,500
sort of one of the reasons why you like

276
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,480
to grow from seed because you see those

277
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,919
runs pop up whereas with clone you know

278
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,839
you don't

279
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,458
all right but I've been going where I've

280
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,240
been going from clone for a long time

281
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:20,699
for for production you know but I I love

282
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,899
I love uh growing from seed because you

283
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,180
never know what you're going to find

284
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,039
it's like fishing isn't it

285
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,419
um you know you don't know what you're

286
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,419
gonna bring it up

287
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,519
yeah definitely well I mean let's let's

288
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,778
go back uh to when you know you're

289
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,220
learning the ropes and you're first

290
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:37,799
starting to do the open pollinations

291
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,700
with these lines which of these lines

292
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,199
really you know uh how should I say took

293
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,360
your heart first you know was it the

294
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,640
Deep chunk was it the x18 which one

295
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,060
really first captivated you

296
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,939
yeah it was deep chunk by far was my

297
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,199
favorite for years and years and years

298
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,720
um you know

299
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,879
I couldn't very well grow even Hayes

300
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,620
commercially you know it just wasn't

301
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,480
even an option

302
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,700
um all through those years but deep deep

303
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,399
chunk did exactly what I wanted it to do

304
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,100
you know produce well in in low light

305
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,799
conditions and um and it was really good

306
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,778
smoke I liked it cerebral smoke had very

307
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,859
uniform pounds you know that that plant

308
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:22,139
breeds true is the driven snow

309
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,300
um and so it turned out real very

310
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,039
consistent product for for decades for

311
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,078
me

312
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:30,719
yeah and when did the idea of Crossing

313
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:34,199
it to Hayes come into your mind

314
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,820
well probably after I read Rob Clark's

315
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,560
marijuana botany

316
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,480
um you know right away and that you know

317
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,879
as soon as I had that Haze and and knew

318
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,500
how good it was that that was the plan

319
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,480
kind of thing

320
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,778
so and what was it like when you first

321
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,339
grew those out the F1 were you surprised

322
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:51,958
by what you saw or it was all pretty

323
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,540
much what you expected

324
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:57,599
I pretended I've never really I've never

325
00:12:54,539 --> 00:13:01,379
grown the F1 commercially you know I was

326
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,019
uh back then uh the Deep chunk was it

327
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:06,778
was so good and giving what I wanted for

328
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,220
what I was doing you know but I was

329
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:12,059
trying to move weight

330
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,980
and uh it was predictable and easy and I

331
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:17,159
knew that Crossing out to that [ __ ]

332
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,139
14 to six week plan you know was gonna

333
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,360
have me into the end of November or

334
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,720
something here into the rains and stuff

335
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,000
so I didn't I wasn't looking to cross it

336
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,879
out uh it wasn't looking to cross them

337
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,339
together so much for production as I was

338
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,439
for my own head

339
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,000
yeah okay sure that's completely

340
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,220
understandable and I mean you've got

341
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,379
some other notable F1 hybrids like

342
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,019
particularly the [ __ ] Creek where you

343
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,879
cross the pine tar to the Deep chunk I

344
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,700
know that um you know that was one that

345
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,860
seems to get a few mentions online did

346
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,778
you did you like what you were able to

347
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,639
see from those F1 hybrids and would you

348
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:56,059
consider doing other F1 hybrids with

349
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,060
your lines

350
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,399
um you know I was just going for that

351
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,958
you know for that recombination

352
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,039
generation thing that we were talking

353
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:08,159
about before I was I was trying to uh

354
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,559
you know create something something not

355
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,958
not seen in either line by get by

356
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,958
getting in into that that was just

357
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,879
rightfully to those Generations uh and

358
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,500
and that was just Remnant seed that I

359
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,399
had sent in

360
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,799
um

361
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,539
but I never really continued on with it

362
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,578
much much after that I haven't done a

363
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:29,399
bunch of F2 searches through the through

364
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:32,519
them I still have f2c that I made which

365
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,679
was the point and and most of those f1s

366
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,078
were just uh Remnant seed that I passed

367
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,000
out along the way to what I wanted to

368
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:41,458
put away

369
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,740
yeah okay yeah so you're stocking up so

370
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,958
do you have any plans to get into those

371
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,820
or you just the other stuff is more

372
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:51,179
interesting right now

373
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,100
well right now I think you know uh the

374
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:55,799
haze is on the list

375
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,920
um and the and Andy chunk because it's

376
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:02,879
been I think his last reproduction

377
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:05,099
was 09 or something on both of those

378
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,980
and you know it's time to do a germ test

379
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,639
I'm probably flirting with with you know

380
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,039
something below 60 on what I have here

381
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,839
so that's kind of my next my next plan

382
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,578
is to do those things outside open

383
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,980
pollination time again

384
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:23,039
but I bet I'll probably make a point of

385
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:26,039
saving uh clones from the from the haze

386
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,360
a portion of that and try to find a good

387
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,759
one

388
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,220
yeah brilliant and do you feel like open

389
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,198
pollination captures everything in the

390
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,420
sense that have you noticed any

391
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,099
variation over time in any of the lines

392
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,360
you've done with open pollination or do

393
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,399
you feel like it does really just

394
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,079
capture the whole thing

395
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:47,120
well everything everything goes downhill

396
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:50,759
uh you know

397
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,419
at a fast pace or a slow pace and open

398
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,919
pollination is a way to make that slow

399
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,599
and and you know something's not going

400
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,659
to stay killer forever if you keep

401
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,420
reading with it you know breeding is is

402
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,939
both you know what how we have such

403
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,338
great cannabis and it's and it's also

404
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,860
why we have such bad cannabis or you

405
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,680
know or lines that have just been driven

406
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,180
into the ground you know

407
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,879
uh that's a lot of I think probably

408
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:20,159
what's happened everywhere in Thailand

409
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,139
in India you know all these places

410
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,000
you're like where is this great where is

411
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:29,039
this great [ __ ] from the old days man

412
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,559
well uh you know the the great spots

413
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:36,559
only stay good for this moment in time

414
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,559
you know if it's a moving Target man

415
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:40,980
yeah some wise words there and while

416
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,159
we're on the topic of it Thailand

417
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,199
recently legalized cannabis any thoughts

418
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,919
on that ever wanted to go there set up

419
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:48,919
shop over there

420
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,379
no I would say no I like um I like

421
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,360
southeast Asia but

422
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:59,159
um you know the language barrier there

423
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,699
is something that'll never be gotten

424
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:05,099
over uh with me anyway you know

425
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:06,838
so it's it's the other for me you know

426
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,000
for sure it represents something that's

427
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:12,619
true that's true that's too mysterious

428
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,619
for me I'm not that adventurous

429
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,100
yeah I feel you I feel you it's not too

430
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,519
far for me and yeah it also still seems

431
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,139
like a a big jump but just to loop back

432
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:23,699
you know obviously you know him for

433
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,640
doing open pollinations but you've done

434
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:29,519
some F1 hybrids and a focal discussion

435
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,160
point of the show is around selecting

436
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,440
males and I was curious to know do you

437
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,240
have any thoughts on selecting males do

438
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,919
you think it's just a fraught Adventure

439
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,558
given your preference for open

440
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,440
pollination and if not do you think

441
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,819
there are any traits that are associated

442
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,019
with a better male because I guess

443
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:47,700
that's one of the common things we

444
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,440
discuss like you know how do you select

445
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,580
a male what's your thoughts on the

446
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,038
subject

447
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:56,879
well resin you know

448
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:59,099
um if you have resinous mail uh that's

449
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,520
that's worth something more than a

450
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:04,500
non-residence male I think I used to I

451
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,720
used to go and and feel the stems of

452
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,619
page plants if I was going to try to do

453
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,480
a you know a half sib uh Cross or

454
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:16,319
something I would you know if I was

455
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,240
gonna try to get a a group of males out

456
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,159
of a big population and do some more

457
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,319
intensive breeding I used to whittle

458
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,259
them down by whether or not their their

459
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,359
stocks were sticky and veg because a

460
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:30,179
good portion of them are

461
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,459
um and uh and you can smell them and and

462
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,500
know that that's oh and here's this

463
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,120
here's this you know kind of a tie

464
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,119
profile that I'm after

465
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,860
yeah okay interesting and I mean I'm

466
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,419
curious what sort of terpene profiles do

467
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,418
you gravitate towards in general

468
00:18:52,140 --> 00:19:01,080
rotten meat

469
00:18:53,809 --> 00:19:01,079
[Laughter]

470
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,759
you know I was worried that you were

471
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,319
going to ask me how you know how does

472
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,599
one taste like that my neighbor brought

473
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,700
over and that's like what I that was my

474
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,219
first impression this thing [ __ ] take

475
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,860
like rotten meat man not rotten fruit

476
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,480
but rotten meat like this this is a

477
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:24,439
pretty foul you know unpleasant odor if

478
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,440
it wasn't cannabis

479
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,579
um so I I you know I like that one and

480
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,558
there was there's been a lot of like uh

481
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,899
Jamaicans and stuff like that that kind

482
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,178
of had this weird uh smell that uh

483
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,280
flavor and stuff that were really

484
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,440
bizarre but that's one that I like I'm

485
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,779
not kidding you know they're kind of a

486
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,600
rotten fruit rotten meat you know that

487
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,259
that that area in there

488
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,159
um

489
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:53,700
citrusy stuff I like to tie the Thai

490
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,700
um you know tends to tends to wane as it

491
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,340
stores you know you know the like when I

492
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,558
when I grew that that chocolate tie that

493
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,720
we had grown out on my friend's rooftop

494
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:06,178
there and it was like oh this this

495
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,339
doesn't smell at all like the brown tie

496
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,298
Bud that we had smoked you know of the

497
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,399
parent

498
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:14,940
it's entirely different it's kind of

499
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,200
citrusy and and uh you know a totally

500
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,058
different thing if you and then if you

501
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,279
store it and all that stuff kind of

502
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:23,639
oxidizes and stuff feels you'll get some

503
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,279
really more complex uh flavors and such

504
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,700
out of it but you know and I suspect

505
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,918
with Haze too I would say but you know

506
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,779
when I find a good Haze I

507
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,000
unfortunately don't have it or any

508
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,918
around when it but you know I'm still

509
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,019
smoking that [ __ ] gone while it's still

510
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,880
green because you just you don't reach

511
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,400
for anything else

512
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,120
I mean in more recent times there's been

513
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,820
a lot of discussion around the uh usage

514
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:52,739
and the benefits associated with an

515
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:54,779
actual curing phase and I guess most

516
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,519
notably one of the big companies in

517
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:59,178
California and now in other states like

518
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:02,220
Florida and a few others the jungle boys

519
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:04,140
they their owner Ivan he famously came

520
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,360
out and said they don't cure their weed

521
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,799
at all they think it's best as soon as

522
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,319
it's harvest like as soon as it's dry

523
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:12,720
and smokable that's when it's best would

524
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,519
you say that you think that's incorrect

525
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,700
or do you think it's strain dependent

526
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,918
what's your take on a cure

527
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,080
yeah um the everything's going to be

528
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,220
different you know

529
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:28,980
um several you know modern plants will

530
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,960
probably be best when they're relatively

531
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,700
fresh and

532
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,159
well you know there's a bunch of them

533
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,380
that might get better with age you know

534
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,380
I think it's going to be different from

535
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,260
Individual to individual for sure

536
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,360
yeah interesting and with Hayes are

537
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:46,919
there any notable changes that take

538
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,500
place with the Cure like obviously the

539
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,480
color changes how does the effects

540
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,400
change over time

541
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,569
I wouldn't know I smoked that [ __ ] when

542
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,419
it's fresh until it's gone gone

543
00:21:55,569 --> 00:22:00,000
[Laughter]

544
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:02,400
all right but recently I have seen

545
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,319
people that you know have grown some of

546
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,659
it out and

547
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,279
um and we're just kind of meh about this

548
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,440
one and you know kind of put it in their

549
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,480
closet you know when it was fresh

550
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,519
and then they'll break it out months

551
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,860
later and and remember this plant being

552
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,538
kind of meh and just to have it and be

553
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:21,178
incredible months and months later after

554
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:23,158
it sits around and oxidizes them and

555
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,038
reveals something that was you know

556
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,320
there all the time lurking underneath

557
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:31,220
once the main you know profile kind of

558
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:34,139
dissipates what's lying underneath and

559
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:37,140
settle it at first up and it's like

560
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,720
really really unique and beautiful and

561
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,659
that's what Ty was for me and and the

562
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,659
brown Hawaiian and stuff and Jamaican

563
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:48,539
you know none of these uh

564
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:51,480
stuff that that we were getting in

565
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:54,119
Imports back then was fresh you know it

566
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,400
all it all had months

567
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,459
um and and [ __ ] gets really interesting

568
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,380
when when it when it has that but you

569
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,720
know if you only have a pound of it or

570
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,880
something you're and it's the best thing

571
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,558
you know by far you're just gonna go

572
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,620
through it you know yeah you're gonna

573
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:13,940
get to that stage to realize it

574
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:16,519
yeah definitely definitely

575
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,519
let me give you a hypothetical right

576
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:22,319
you've just been hired to uh consult for

577
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,298
a Thai company and they say look we've

578
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,460
got like this facility we can do outdoor

579
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:28,798
we can do indoor we can do whatever you

580
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,558
tell us what to do what do you think we

581
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,240
should do what would you say would would

582
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:35,460
you say that they should grow land race

583
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,659
stuff are you going to tell a modern how

584
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,319
would you help them

585
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:42,240
haha in Thailand yeah I really liked it

586
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,158
too I liked it what they're doing there

587
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,740
you know good for them it's pretty

588
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,460
ballsy in that area of the world you

589
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,980
know

590
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,440
I would go on a gene pool search they're

591
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,298
locally you know go on germ plasm hunt

592
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,340
there locally and try to turn up

593
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:58,558
something that was that was you know

594
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:02,279
worth it worth the name

595
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:05,460
of how good that stuff can really be

596
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,259
um I I have my doubts that uh

597
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,200
the stuff that they're working with you

598
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:12,298
know it's probably some evaluation some

599
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,360
loud stuff or something that's kind of

600
00:24:12,298 --> 00:24:18,240
mediocre as Ty became it in the end

601
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,619
there but I I want to believe that the

602
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,179
old seed is still there and I would go

603
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:23,178
on a hunt for it you know

604
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,538
but hire a bunch of hookers and and

605
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,179
tuk-tuk drivers it's up there somebody

606
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:32,339
and Uncle Bill's the attic you know the

607
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,320
old seeds has to be around somewhere I

608
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:36,720
wouldn't even pass go until I found

609
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:40,579
something worth talking about and I kind

610
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,019
of suspect they didn't wait for that

611
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:46,259
I love it yeah it would be really cool

612
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:48,599
to see like some uh tewa land race Thai

613
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:50,640
stuff coming out I think I think there's

614
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,678
probably gonna realistically end up

615
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,038
being a mix of both right because you

616
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,980
know USA hybrids are a popular worldwide

617
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:01,740
no doubt about that but um that's really

618
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,058
interesting to to hear that that you

619
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,460
would be Keen to do that that's really

620
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:07,859
cool just to take us back to the the

621
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,779
breeding sort of questions from um and I

622
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:12,839
wanted to ask you a lot of people talk

623
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:15,298
about selecting a male around this sort

624
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,918
of Paradigm of hemp trait versus drug

625
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:19,379
trade and like you know just to give you

626
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,360
a common example they'll say the really

627
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,940
fast flowering male that wants to put

628
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,979
out ball sacks first that's like a hemp

629
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,440
trait Associated mail like it's probably

630
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,940
not your best male whereas we've heard

631
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,259
earlier that like you're not going to

632
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,700
Cull that male you keep it around

633
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,919
because it's got something to offer

634
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,900
which is interesting so I'm curious to

635
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,520
know do you buy into the hemp trade drug

636
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,900
trade Paradigm or do you think like

637
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,900
they're all drug trade really

638
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:49,140
that those traits are inherited

639
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,179
separately and um and that's why I don't

640
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,759
call them

641
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:56,159
but yeah you know yeah uh that's a

642
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,859
correlation that I that I that I don't

643
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,820
believe you know I've had early plants

644
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:04,740
uh uh that were and they were very high

645
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:07,019
in potency

646
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,640
um so

647
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:11,158
I wouldn't I wouldn't make that

648
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,038
Association I wouldn't bet on it pal I

649
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,100
guess would be my answer to that man I'm

650
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:19,859
not buying it I'm trait

651
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:21,778
um yeah no the the I I believe those

652
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:22,798
those characters to be inherited

653
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:24,778
separately

654
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:28,019
yeah cool that's an interesting answer

655
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:29,819
okay so what sort of males do you like

656
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,679
besides resinous one is there any sort

657
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,658
of profile you like or it's just

658
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,679
independent and each strain is its own

659
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,380
thing

660
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:40,200
yeah I don't I don't try to even judge

661
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,480
them too much I I just go for numbers

662
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,940
when it comes to males I have for you

663
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,120
know decades too um I've always been a

664
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:51,179
big fan of the male pollen mix

665
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:53,639
and and you know resin you know you know

666
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,019
resins were something to me

667
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,419
you know

668
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:59,759
but other than that I I really I can't

669
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:03,480
think of anything else that I would even

670
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,759
dare to try to place importance on okay

671
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,360
well I mean while we're talking about

672
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,519
importance do you have a sort of like a

673
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,979
hierarchy of traits you like to breed

674
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,980
for and I guess notably someone like DJ

675
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,839
Short has sort of always commonly said

676
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,099
everything is secondary to the effect so

677
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,959
he's sort of saying like I don't care

678
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,538
what it looks like if the effect is good

679
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,038
then that's it do you feel like oh you

680
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:28,259
know you've got to sort of like balance

681
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,419
different aspects it's got a yield Okay

682
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:32,700
blah blah blah where do you fall on that

683
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,759
one with your trait hierarchy

684
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,679
well you know um it's uh it's like I

685
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,778
said before your favorite's gonna change

686
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,019
several times you know throughout that

687
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:45,538
cycle and then once more at the end when

688
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:48,298
you smoke it when it's in the pipe your

689
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:49,940
favorite changes again every time

690
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:52,679
um and that's the most important thing

691
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,419
but you should be you should be growing

692
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,259
and breeding your favorites

693
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,538
um

694
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:00,179
I'd like to see a plant that grows well

695
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:01,558
and stuff like that but but I'll trade

696
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,259
all that for something that's better

697
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,000
smoke and and that's why you know that's

698
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:08,460
I think the only thing you can really

699
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,259
say is your favorite right so yeah I

700
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,259
agree with DJ on that

701
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:15,480
uh you know I'll judge other plans uh

702
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:18,000
certainly like when I'm when I'm [ __ ]

703
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,819
counting or calling clone material from

704
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,679
growing in gaps or something you know

705
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:25,918
like I despise a plant that can't hold

706
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,900
itself up you know I you know I have a

707
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,080
bunch of other criteria that I'm very

708
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,480
picky about and such but when it comes

709
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,759
to breeding cheat you know

710
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,640
um you know if you're if you're just

711
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,079
talking about the average guy you know I

712
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,340
hope that they're breeding for the best

713
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,720
smoke

714
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,939
um I don't give a [ __ ] about anything

715
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,058
else I don't think anybody else should

716
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,580
either

717
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:52,859
I agree and I wanted to touch on the x18

718
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,720
specifically because I think out of your

719
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:57,178
strains it's known for having a very

720
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,519
unique flavor profile as well as being

721
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,620
like a fairly quality Pakistani all

722
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,839
round I was always interested you know

723
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:06,119
the Apple phenotype is sort of

724
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,500
referenced here and there and it it's

725
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,538
like an interesting flavor because it's

726
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,778
not really apparent in many modern

727
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:15,179
strains the Apple flavor what's x18 like

728
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:18,980
to you how do you describe it and what

729
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,980
are your what are you fond of about it

730
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:24,298
it's one of the ones that still you know

731
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:26,220
that still survive of what it was like

732
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,139
you know in the old days that's that

733
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,460
plant's been grown here in this

734
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,759
neighborhood where I'm sitting right now

735
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:35,159
for you know since the early or mid 80s

736
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,000
or something I guess it's

737
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,360
um

738
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,640
it's a very old and and Divergent and

739
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,439
not related to anything that's you know

740
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,240
that's going around in the in the modern

741
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,700
gene pool for the most part you know

742
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,140
so it's Unique in that way it's

743
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,080
different you know it's not it's not

744
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,179
gonna rip your [ __ ] head off like uh

745
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:58,918
you know like some of the OG so it would

746
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,460
or something

747
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,919
um but it's certainly unique and um and

748
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,500
that's where something you know you know

749
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,960
uh to a lot of people for something to

750
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,359
me because you know that's what that's

751
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,298
how you get that you know transgressive

752
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,339
segregation is you know you need plants

753
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,960
that are Divergent from each other it's

754
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:21,418
not going to happen when you're breeding

755
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,960
brother to sister or something

756
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,278
yeah definitely and I mean to me one of

757
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,500
the things I like about your offerings

758
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:30,778
is that there's sort of a few pakistanis

759
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,898
in the mix with the pine tar cool Shaw

760
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:35,519
so I always got the impression Pakistani

761
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:37,619
sort of didn't get enough credit because

762
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,200
they've got that real cerebral aspect to

763
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:43,079
the Indica High which really underrated

764
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,058
in my opinion have you been like a big

765
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,460
fan of the pakistanis do you do you

766
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:49,918
favor them or where do you sit on it

767
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,740
yes and I you know for the exact same

768
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,259
reason I think that you know a lot of

769
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,538
the pakistanis have probably likely been

770
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:58,798
outcrossed to some really cerebral

771
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:01,619
Indian

772
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,398
at some point in the distant past you

773
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,239
know

774
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:08,278
um and uh I also do you find them more

775
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,399
cerebral than a lot of certainly than

776
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:13,919
most of the Afghans uh that I've come

777
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:16,019
across are more of a sleepy you know

778
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,020
dreary lethargic High

779
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:22,079
whereas the pakis or the pakistanis are

780
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:24,119
are you know much more cerebral and up

781
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,798
which which I've always liked I always

782
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,099
like I'm not that's what I'm looking for

783
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:31,019
and pretty much everything that I smoke

784
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:32,759
yeah it's interesting that like for the

785
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:34,980
longest time I thought you must have

786
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,079
been like a real Indica head because

787
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,700
like on paper it seems like there's

788
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,859
these Indica offerings but like it's

789
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,538
more the cerebral stuff you like it's uh

790
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:44,699
sort of ironic

791
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:47,158
though those are the ones that I capped

792
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,558
anyway yeah yeah

793
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,320
um like there's a lot of you know people

794
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,720
you know like like this you know purple

795
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,058
Oracle and some of some of these old

796
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,000
broad leaves from up here and stop by

797
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:03,119
for me they just make me sleepy and um

798
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,159
and yeah it's not it's not where I'm at

799
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,859
what is what's your thoughts on the

800
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,960
Oracle it's got a really big rise in

801
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,219
popularity over the past years have you

802
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,840
grown it and what do you think the

803
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,179
genetics are

804
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,298
oh we used to grow it we used to grow it

805
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:20,519
uh quite a bit you know some I don't

806
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:22,500
know 20 years ago or something

807
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:27,599
um that's a pretty old one that's been

808
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:30,119
around forever and uh it's I I thought I

809
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,158
thought I remember it coming off of

810
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:35,639
Salmon Creek or somewhere up in there up

811
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,278
in Humboldt but I'm not sure I think it

812
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,259
was introduced to me as like a salmon

813
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,179
Creeks version of the monkey balls or

814
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:45,240
something you know the old you know the

815
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:48,960
DC okay it was there broadly but they're

816
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,960
real flavorful got a nice grape flavor

817
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,720
um it breeds really well but it's you

818
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,940
know until it's relatively homozygous

819
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,500
and Crosses out well

820
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,500
um to a lot of stuff

821
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,359
and uh but but yeah it makes me sleepy I

822
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,419
smoked that stuff and it's just kind of

823
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:09,119
it's not not very potent and it kind of

824
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:11,340
makes me sleepy it didn't float my boat

825
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:15,418
um you know so I stopped growing it

826
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:17,819
yeah okay interesting interesting and uh

827
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:20,519
we had a lot of listeners uh chime in

828
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:23,099
that were hoping to hear about and I

829
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,679
noticed this myself that DNA for a while

830
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:27,959
was offering the x18 what was the

831
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,519
backstory behind that

832
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,278
hmm

833
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,859
um I think it was on one of the uh

834
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,538
forums or something yeah they just

835
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:37,979
caught up with me I don't remember what

836
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:39,419
happened I think I sent him a bunch of

837
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,480
pollen and some seeds or something

838
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:44,460
though and they did some crosses and may

839
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,500
have done some reproduction I don't I

840
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,759
don't really know but I do remember it

841
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,980
was like the only people that I ever

842
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,538
seen any pollen out to you know because

843
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,360
they were into it and I was like yeah

844
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:57,298
well okay I just happened to have a you

845
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:59,038
know big bindle of pollen right here but

846
00:33:57,298 --> 00:34:00,898
you know because I was you know doing

847
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:04,798
some breeding with it myself at the time

848
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:07,079
I think they did some crosses originally

849
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,940
um and and you know and I probably sent

850
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:11,460
him seed as well

851
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,159
um so I didn't really follow it but I I

852
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,260
know that did happen okay cool I guess

853
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,358
like you're sort of confirming it's like

854
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,060
it's authentic it's not just like random

855
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:23,639
seed they found yeah I would I I would

856
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,619
hope not I don't see why it would be I

857
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,260
did have you know I did send them a

858
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:31,980
package at one point way back when

859
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,320
yeah cool interesting okay okay so

860
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,240
what would your advice be for a new

861
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,940
breeder who's looking to get into it a

862
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,338
lot of people talk these days about how

863
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,440
it's also a poly hybrid that you know

864
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:46,019
like we're not getting anywhere with it

865
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,300
how can someone like get their toes wet

866
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:50,940
while also actually progressing towards

867
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,419
something from your point of view

868
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,480
well I mean Slammer you know you develop

869
00:34:54,418 --> 00:35:00,480
a library of your favorite things and

870
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,179
keep them separate and you know and and

871
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,920
try to cross together things that are

872
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:07,319
the most far apart from each other the

873
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,838
most Divergent you know and try to get

874
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,539
into these recombination generations and

875
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,578
find something unique and extreme

876
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:16,199
you know is is basically where all

877
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,039
breeding starts

878
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,739
um

879
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,480
that's Crown zero that's what I would do

880
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,439
and and make it be something that you

881
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,719
like

882
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,059
forget about what you think people are

883
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,838
gonna like just focus on what you

884
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:33,358
actually honestly like and and you know

885
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,559
that way you're more likely to not not

886
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:36,539
lose it

887
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,578
and um and that's that's what's really

888
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:42,539
worth something I think

889
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:44,519
trust your own taste and and uh just you

890
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,199
know do your own thing and if it's you

891
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,099
know if other people agree with that

892
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,019
then

893
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:50,640
you know you'll you'll you'll be a

894
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,880
winner

895
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:55,799
yeah beautiful stuff I wonder what do

896
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,500
you think would be a good place to start

897
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,200
genetics wise out of Southeast Asia do

898
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,480
you think just go for Thai

899
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,139
no I think that

900
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,960
um

901
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:09,000
you know there's there's a lot of places

902
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,460
around there I would just scour that

903
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,679
whole that whole area including you know

904
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,858
places like Reunion Island and stuff and

905
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,960
and you know but uh Hawaii's probably

906
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,880
totally different today they're probably

907
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,179
growing white runts and stuff out there

908
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,300
now but um but there's probably some

909
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:29,519
Pockets you know over over there in in

910
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:33,300
that in that region that still have some

911
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:35,820
really good stuff you know uh Vietnam

912
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,359
even places like this that it probably

913
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,140
all came you know from [ __ ] and Ty but

914
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,480
uh

915
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:44,960
uh you know it held on a little better

916
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,159
while the tide got bred into the ground

917
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,019
that would that would be a rich hunting

918
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:50,399
ground for me I might you know I don't

919
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:52,199
know what things are like in Jamaica

920
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,039
anymore

921
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,639
um

922
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:58,559
Colombia maybe you know some of some of

923
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,239
the more Southern parts of Mexico and

924
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,159
the Caribbean side there might be some

925
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,739
good stuff down in there

926
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,899
but I don't know you know

927
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:09,598
I do know I smoke some kick-ass

928
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,900
Colombian in Costa Rica you know not you

929
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,599
know not too many decades ago uh late

930
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,000
90s around around you know around 2000

931
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,000
or something I smoked some really nice

932
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,900
Colombian uh that this guy had in Costa

933
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,320
Rica

934
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,320
uh that was extremely cerebral and very

935
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,640
auditory and

936
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,380
excellent so you know I still have hope

937
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:34,199
that there's good [ __ ] in all these

938
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,940
places and you know hopefully they turn

939
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:37,618
up from time to time

940
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,900
you gotta trust that the cream's gonna

941
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:42,539
rise to the top and if they're good

942
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,700
they'll probably stick around

943
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:46,739
but people do appreciate them these days

944
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:49,799
more it seems like

945
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:51,899
yeah I think Colombians are certainly on

946
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,839
the rise at the moment they've been a

947
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,180
focal discussion point I I would love to

948
00:37:54,838 --> 00:38:00,000
see more in circulation do you have any

949
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:01,799
Colombian seed stock

950
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,380
no I don't

951
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,720
just uh adjust the haze is the only

952
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,420
narrow the tropical that I that I have

953
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,980
ever that I'm growing there's some stuff

954
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,619
in neighborhood like I said that

955
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,199
Hawaiian and you know you probably try

956
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,920
that stuff out but I've smoked some of

957
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:22,259
it from the guy and

958
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,358
I'll stick with A's

959
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,160
do you ever like try to search out

960
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:28,139
certain seed stock or are you more sort

961
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:31,078
of wait for it to come to you

962
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:33,539
yeah I know I have what I have and

963
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,060
that's probably all I'm ever gonna you

964
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:37,679
know bother to reproduce I enjoy you

965
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:39,480
know I enjoy clowns whatever the

966
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,500
neighbors are going it's always exciting

967
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,480
to smoke

968
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,300
but I don't think I would I don't think

969
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,280
I'm reading new stuff is not really in

970
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,740
the cards occasionally a plaque comes

971
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,220
along that you know that I really like

972
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:55,618
and and the market stops agreeing with

973
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:58,199
me and I know that I'll probably not be

974
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,180
growing it you know for very much longer

975
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,098
and I'll do like a quick back Crossing

976
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:05,819
you know stay on it and put some seed

977
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:09,059
away of it you know like I did that with

978
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:12,180
the Mendo docs OG cut that I really like

979
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:13,980
because it grows so well and adapt but

980
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:15,838
the market got burned out on it and then

981
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,519
everybody [ __ ] canned it and I was like

982
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,920
well but wait wait this is a good plan

983
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,300
forget about your taste you know about

984
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,039
wanting something new forget you're

985
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,099
burned out on it that's a good plan guys

986
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,320
and then so I'll do a quick you know you

987
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:30,420
know either shelf it or do a quick back

988
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,400
cross program and make sure to you know

989
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,280
try to save stuff that I like that I

990
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,500
think to that the markets gets sick up

991
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,560
and and and uh we'll probably come

992
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:43,320
around back around too at a later date

993
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,059
Ah that's interesting what plans have

994
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,059
you solved out of curiosity I guess it's

995
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:50,159
a reflection of what you think's good

996
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:52,019
yeah well I felt that one we just

997
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,819
mentioned the docks and that was a

998
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:55,920
couple of years ago

999
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,019
um I'm still growing it by clone but the

1000
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,119
market has certainly turned tower on and

1001
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:03,059
we shut it down everybody's throat for

1002
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:05,519
probably a decade here it probably you

1003
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:07,440
know one of the most popular ones that

1004
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,380
that people were growing in hoops for

1005
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,720
for a long long time the market was so

1006
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,240
saturated that the buyer said nah no

1007
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,659
more of that you know so people stopped

1008
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:20,699
growing it but but I still am [ __ ] them

1009
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:22,559
I still grew it just because I like that

1010
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:25,439
I like the way the plant grows and

1011
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:27,358
produces and it's kind of it's got a

1012
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,880
good high you know it takes off a lot of

1013
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,519
boxes you know no it's not the original

1014
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,160
this or that but here's a plant that

1015
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:38,039
does what it does really well

1016
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,739
um you know comes in early all that [ __ ]

1017
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:42,358
you know it's a Grower's dream uh

1018
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:45,179
interesting and when you when you back

1019
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:47,639
cross something do you have any

1020
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:49,919
particular thoughts on what sort of

1021
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:52,259
pollen donor you use like for example

1022
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,539
some people say use a pollen donut

1023
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,339
that's very different to the planetary

1024
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:58,980
Crossing too just because it's easy to

1025
00:40:56,338 --> 00:41:01,559
phenotypically like curl those plants

1026
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,179
out in the F1 do you have any thoughts

1027
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,639
like that

1028
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:08,759
I would use something that yeah that you

1029
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:11,519
also like and I wouldn't have any I

1030
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,020
wouldn't have any criteria after that

1031
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,119
um it depends what you're doing if

1032
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:17,099
you're like trying to isolate some trait

1033
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,200
and and you know that would what you

1034
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,059
just said would be you would do in a

1035
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:24,000
back Crossing scheme you you know

1036
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:25,739
something that would be easily easily to

1037
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,179
know that you know it's not coming from

1038
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:29,939
this parent it's coming from this parent

1039
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:33,239
you know if they're two plants of the

1040
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,760
donor parent is is very Divergent from

1041
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:39,179
the recurrent parent then you're gonna

1042
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,760
easily you know separate And Trades from

1043
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:44,759
each parent but that but that's never

1044
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,160
like my I use that Crossing just as a

1045
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,680
dirty quick way to keep this this pool

1046
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:51,598
of genetics

1047
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:54,739
I love the dirty quick way okay if I

1048
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,539
guess that's good yeah

1049
00:41:54,739 --> 00:42:00,838
that yeah that's what it is you know I

1050
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:03,239
mean but some people like you know get a

1051
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,940
bit sort of how can I say it they take

1052
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,858
issue with s1s and they would say oh bx1

1053
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,240
is way better do you have any issues

1054
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,699
with this ones or you think like no

1055
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:14,098
they're good they do what I needed to do

1056
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:16,618
yeah yeah I have no problem with with

1057
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:18,480
selfie implants

1058
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:21,420
um but depends what you want you know

1059
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,639
but it's there's no inherent uh you know

1060
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,858
bad thing about it or problem with it or

1061
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,500
argument against it if you're trying to

1062
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:31,259
you know capture something as quickly

1063
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,119
and it's dirty dirtily as possible you

1064
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,859
you would sell but

1065
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,559
um you know and you know you boom over

1066
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:39,598
one generation now I can store the seeds

1067
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,739
and and readdress it at some later date

1068
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,920
you know

1069
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:46,319
uh well you know why why take what'd you

1070
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,079
say first generation back cross versus

1071
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,338
BC ones you say that takes about one two

1072
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,380
three you know it takes a few

1073
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:54,599
Generations

1074
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,900
um there's no extra points for taking

1075
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,059
longer to get to the same place

1076
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:02,579
yeah definitely definitely I've thought

1077
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:04,380
that I mean you're sort of hovering

1078
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,359
around the idea of like some people

1079
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,358
would use that same analogy to say we

1080
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:10,799
should be using like labs to help us

1081
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:13,679
analyze things do you feel like there's

1082
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,000
any need to use like high-tech lab stuff

1083
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,000
what's your thoughts on labs

1084
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,700
this is going to be a tough one in a

1085
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,460
perfect world like you know I mean if I

1086
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:29,939
have my own I I might use it a little

1087
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:33,179
bit but uh I wouldn't rely on I would

1088
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,400
I'd proceed with caution let's say you

1089
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:37,858
know I I

1090
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,500
most Labs you know a guy had some weeds

1091
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:42,858
sends it to three labs and uh whatever

1092
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,539
one tells him he has the highest THC

1093
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:47,818
this is his favorite lab that he goes to

1094
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,679
from now on Labs know this and they

1095
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:51,659
inflate numbers these are some of the

1096
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,480
shiftiest [ __ ] in the whole in

1097
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:56,098
the whole industry right now and uh I I

1098
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,240
wouldn't I wouldn't rely on the

1099
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,619
information

1100
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:00,419
um too much

1101
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,119
and I

1102
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:05,400
the other you know

1103
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,200
you know because it because it's you

1104
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,818
know it's kind of a scam you know and

1105
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,139
the labs know this they want to make

1106
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:12,000
money they're going to kick out these

1107
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:13,858
high numbers for you you know so they

1108
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,260
have a giant customer base it's a

1109
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:18,779
business don't kid yourself these these

1110
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,579
guys are can be Shifty too

1111
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:24,660
um so I don't trust it for that reason

1112
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:27,060
and uh and and more you know [ __ ] you

1113
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:29,338
know we could be wrong about you know

1114
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,318
about this being such an important deal

1115
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:34,380
you know high THC or something we could

1116
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:36,539
be entirely wrong about that there could

1117
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:40,858
be giant pieces of the puzzle that are

1118
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:43,139
still missing and um I you know I still

1119
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:44,880
think that the first bag that disappears

1120
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,920
out of the group of your samples that's

1121
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,960
the best weed and I don't care what a

1122
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,220
lab says especially if there's room for

1123
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,720
human error and you know uh that's like

1124
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:57,118
asking somebody else you know what you

1125
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,679
should smoke you know I mean I think

1126
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,619
that's a judgment that you should make

1127
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:04,318
in the old-fashioned way and be very

1128
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:07,260
leery about how I mean these numbers

1129
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,239
drive your drive your selections

1130
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,099
so we're this is like a really

1131
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,739
interesting discussion point because a

1132
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:16,740
lot of guests end up discussing this and

1133
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:19,259
how the market is being led too much by

1134
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,399
numbers and I guess when I think about

1135
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,740
it

1136
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,079
the issue that I see is that a lot of

1137
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:27,719
the really hardcore smokers and Growers

1138
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:31,740
are very aware of this but it's it's

1139
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:34,618
largely speaking the 80 of the Casual

1140
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:36,838
consumer base so to speak that are

1141
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:39,119
driving a lot of the decisions and

1142
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:41,159
purchases through what is seemingly just

1143
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,440
looking at the numbers so I guess the

1144
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:46,379
question becomes how do we educate like

1145
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,119
the Casual smokers out there that you do

1146
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,460
need to use your head because for a lot

1147
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,380
of them it's sort of like they just want

1148
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,199
an easy metric to fall back on and the

1149
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:57,300
THC percentage seems to be that is it is

1150
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,159
it education or do you think like maybe

1151
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,720
the Growers just need to force it on

1152
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:03,000
them by just saying no we're only

1153
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,759
growing this like Haze

1154
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,940
you do have to put up a shut up you know

1155
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,280
kind of thing I mean if the cream will

1156
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,880
rise to the Top If if you have something

1157
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,800
that only tests at 17 or something and

1158
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,160
and it just and it [ __ ] rips your

1159
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,318
head off and there's no denying it

1160
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:25,078
that'll eventually cut through all right

1161
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:27,539
and you know and become popular and

1162
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:30,539
people people will smoke it and want it

1163
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:33,179
and covered it and uh and it'll it'll

1164
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:35,460
rise to the top I don't think uh and all

1165
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:37,858
this high THC stuff it's kind of oh man

1166
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,119
you know most of the time I try these

1167
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:41,400
new things that are supposed to be all

1168
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,079
this and all that and of this sticker

1169
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,800
with this big high number on it and

1170
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,160
stuff

1171
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,079
it's like yeah you know not not too much

1172
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:52,500
of it is what I would call

1173
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:55,680
you know incredibly potent or cerebral

1174
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,239
yeah okay interesting interesting there

1175
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,000
is very much like a sentiment that

1176
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:02,879
there's like a same sameness about a lot

1177
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,179
of the modern stuff some of the notable

1178
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,818
older heads are like notably not a fan

1179
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:11,639
of like cookies and the the derivatives

1180
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:13,559
of it are you are you a bit like that do

1181
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:15,779
you feel like cookies is like the poster

1182
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:17,639
child for us backing ourselves into the

1183
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:21,260
corner so to speak or do you like it in

1184
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,259
some of the uh offspring of it

1185
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:28,800
[Laughter]

1186
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:31,440
I think it's too popular you know and

1187
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,099
it's driving too many people's uh

1188
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,720
decisions in their selections

1189
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:38,760
um because they want to get a piece of

1190
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,679
this popularity and stuff but that but

1191
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,220
that's grabbing this huge giant market

1192
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:46,139
share of of breeders time and stuff and

1193
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:48,659
they should be doing something else man

1194
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:51,960
but at the same time you know I've I've

1195
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:53,759
enjoyed some very cerebral plants out of

1196
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,880
that gene pool

1197
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,859
um as well and you know I think it goes

1198
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,920
back to really the OG

1199
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:04,440
that's like TK and stuff these things

1200
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,260
are are pretty good man

1201
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,079
Yeah a hundred percent and the story

1202
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,300
that goes around about the TK is that

1203
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,700
it's essentially like two Hindus crossed

1204
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,640
together could you believe that

1205
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:19,199
oh I don't know I wouldn't even touch

1206
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,440
I'd rather try to touch the moon than

1207
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,539
try to figure out the lore of [ __ ]

1208
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,220
cannabis that everybody is so con you

1209
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:29,279
know obsessed with in the history of

1210
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:31,318
this and that you know um because it

1211
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,079
doesn't matter you know what matters is

1212
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:36,000
it's a really great plant it breeds you

1213
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,640
know it breeds really well

1214
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,380
and um well I speculate on what we don't

1215
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,480
know it would be I guarantee it'd be a

1216
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,980
guess that we don't know what it is so

1217
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,358
why the [ __ ] guess about it you know

1218
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:50,039
that's silly I like it I like it so I

1219
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:52,559
wanted to ask you you know you've grown

1220
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:54,659
up during what would be arguably the

1221
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,719
golden years of Northern California

1222
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:59,399
being in the Mendocino area what's it

1223
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:01,379
been like to live there over the years

1224
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,858
and what are some of the interesting

1225
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,880
changes you've seen unfold

1226
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:08,460
um

1227
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:11,300
you know not much has changed you know

1228
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:14,639
when you don't go anywhere kind of thing

1229
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:16,740
it's a beautiful place to be

1230
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,679
um and it just has a really good vibe

1231
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:23,098
and and you can live your and you can

1232
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:26,399
live your life you know in peace

1233
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:29,280
um you know there's when when you know

1234
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,200
medical came out and stuff or you know a

1235
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,180
bunch of new guards came up here and

1236
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,960
guys with dollar signs in their eyes and

1237
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:39,000
stuff but that's you know that's

1238
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,980
fading away now too

1239
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,079
um

1240
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,539
I I just really enjoy it it's it's

1241
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,640
peaceful you know you can you can live

1242
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:49,219
how you want and that's really important

1243
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:52,259
to me

1244
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:54,659
yeah I mean I know you're fairly

1245
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:58,619
self-sufficient do you like that sort of

1246
00:49:54,659 --> 00:50:00,239
more isolated lifestyle being up there

1247
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:04,880
oh for sure

1248
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,879
um you know people they're the worst

1249
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:12,779
crabs and animals sure you know I I love

1250
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:14,818
both of those things but um yeah I'm

1251
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:18,119
kind of a Hermit in that regard I have a

1252
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:21,420
bit of autism and and um I'm perfectly

1253
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,800
fine to to be for long periods of time

1254
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,079
by myself

1255
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,300
I've done some single-handed sailing you

1256
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:29,519
know too and enjoy that a lot

1257
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,539
uh tell us about the sailing that sounds

1258
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:35,579
cool

1259
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:39,119
well back in I think it was 99 or 997.99

1260
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:41,818
I um about a sailboat and um

1261
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,680
failed from California down through you

1262
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:46,500
know Mexico and Central America down to

1263
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,539
Costa Rica I mean in Quebec a couple

1264
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,960
years later you know it took like took

1265
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:55,139
some time to uh to do some sailing some

1266
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,300
you know to the tropics and such it was

1267
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:58,858
good fun

1268
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:01,859
uh is that when you got to try that

1269
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:03,838
Infamous Colombian

1270
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:07,380
um no actually I tried the Colombian on

1271
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,139
a just a previous uh plane ride trip

1272
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,180
down there looking at property the real

1273
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:14,460
estate guy was the guy who actually had

1274
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:16,679
it but what a sales technique get you

1275
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:18,539
all high on Colombian take you for a

1276
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:21,539
walk through the tropical you know

1277
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:24,239
properties that he had for sale you'd be

1278
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:28,139
like wow man but yeah it was a real

1279
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:30,779
estate guy and in the western uh side of

1280
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:32,639
Costa Rica but that yeah that was that

1281
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,319
was previous to when I sailed down there

1282
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,299
was about I sailed down there about 10

1283
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:39,480
years after or something

1284
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:41,280
yeah okay interesting interesting and I

1285
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,219
mean if we jump back to sort of the

1286
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,500
growing up in the Emerald Triangle so to

1287
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:48,419
speak a lot of focal discussion takes

1288
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,338
place around like the legal changes that

1289
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,960
have occurred over the past 10 years how

1290
00:51:50,338 --> 00:51:53,880
some people have been forced out of the

1291
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,579
industry and even out of the area in

1292
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,400
general do you feel like there are any

1293
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:02,220
changes needed to the current sort of

1294
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,920
regulations and legal landscape or do

1295
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:07,318
you think it's like you know that it's

1296
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,480
just about the cream rising to the top

1297
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:11,219
well I think you know that's going to

1298
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,318
happen regardless

1299
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:15,779
and I don't know I don't I think it

1300
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:17,400
would be wasted effort to to try to

1301
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:19,859
change anything there there are people

1302
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,660
that are crying you know about big money

1303
00:52:19,858 --> 00:52:24,659
coming in and stuff

1304
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:27,000
uh but now there's big money it's crying

1305
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:28,618
you know packing its bags and heading

1306
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,858
back down to the city

1307
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:34,380
so um I would I wouldn't pretend to know

1308
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:36,960
what to change you know nobody's getting

1309
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:39,780
busted and going to jail now for long

1310
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,579
periods of time that's good

1311
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,000
um you know whatever else comes with

1312
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:46,740
that is just tough [ __ ]

1313
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,780
yeah certainly certainly I think it's

1314
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:51,299
definitely the number one metric we need

1315
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:54,839
to take into account despite how uh

1316
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:56,760
incomes might be affected but um I

1317
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:59,699
wanted to ask you because I'm invariably

1318
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,220
gonna get hassled if I don't if people

1319
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:04,139
wanted to get your seeds is there a way

1320
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:05,699
they can get them are they available at

1321
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:07,679
all

1322
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:10,618
um I don't you know I don't know if any

1323
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,239
of these Banks still have seed stock

1324
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:14,760
well there's a lot of people that have

1325
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,439
done reproductions and stuff I think

1326
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,960
yeah I don't know I'm certainly not

1327
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,240
doing it anymore or you know you know I

1328
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,699
still pass out seeds to friends and

1329
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:26,939
stuff and sometimes friends will do a

1330
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:29,879
reproduction too I think I think it's up

1331
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:32,519
there at CSI did maybe a ptk one or

1332
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,318
something you know and that's good but

1333
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:38,219
it's got you know and and he does a good

1334
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:40,139
job you know I mean I if I was me and I

1335
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:43,259
would have no problem going to him you

1336
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:45,420
know I've seen some really good Haze uh

1337
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,700
stuff out there too that have been done

1338
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:50,159
by other people

1339
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:52,919
the business is just it's not for me

1340
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,779
really I'd rather breed I'd rather breed

1341
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:58,019
dogs

1342
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:01,800
tell me what dogs do you braid

1343
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:04,259
um uh British working carriers I like

1344
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,880
Patterdale and and Jack Russell and and

1345
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,579
lakies

1346
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:12,119
um you know digging dogs work working

1347
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:14,160
dogs of the you know Terriers from from

1348
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:17,160
Britain from UK

1349
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:18,480
uh that's brilliant have you got any on

1350
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:22,558
your property now

1351
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,599
in Asia right is where is is where I do

1352
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,119
it you know I have a farm or you know

1353
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:29,220
place there and they have a big rat

1354
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,619
problem I mean it's something like I

1355
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:33,899
don't know up to 20 or something per

1356
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:36,059
year of their rice crop is just

1357
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,680
demolished by rats

1358
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:40,260
you'll see them out there with a stick

1359
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,940
of bamboo SWAT net rats in the in the in

1360
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,400
the fields you know trying to kill rats

1361
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,579
like that and I just thinking oh there's

1362
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,160
got to be a better way man

1363
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:53,099
so I so I imported a bunch of Kick-Ass

1364
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:56,219
little terriers from from the UK you

1365
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:58,200
know to Asia to try to help out the

1366
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:01,019
farmers there with their with their rat

1367
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:04,379
problem in a more uh you know efficient

1368
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:05,940
manner that's cool do you have like a

1369
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,160
little base you've set up over there

1370
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,420
like where you go and spend time every

1371
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:11,639
so often

1372
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,539
oh I have children there and family

1373
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:15,000
there

1374
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:16,079
oh wow that's cool I don't think anyone

1375
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,858
knew that

1376
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:23,160
yeah yeah in in the Philippines I have

1377
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:24,960
two uh two children fantastic and you

1378
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:26,159
just alternate between California and

1379
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,079
there

1380
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,779
yeah as much as possible I mean the

1381
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:33,240
whole clothing uh kind of screwed us up

1382
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:37,140
a whole bunch didn't it you know travel

1383
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:40,259
is is more difficult financially too you

1384
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:42,239
know now everybody's busy working you

1385
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,220
know and and not taking off around the

1386
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:47,399
world as as much as they'd like

1387
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:49,139
including me yeah yeah certainly

1388
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,519
certainly it must be tough how long has

1389
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:53,219
it been since you've been able to get

1390
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:54,659
back there oh it's been just I think two

1391
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:57,358
two years now

1392
00:55:54,659 --> 00:56:00,199
or 2021

1393
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:02,699
I'm hoping to get over there this fall

1394
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:05,699
but yeah it's been a good two years now

1395
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:10,199
that whole country was on lockdown for

1396
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:13,199
God for several months and when I came

1397
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:16,500
back here the last time from there I

1398
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:18,058
barely got out of the country and um

1399
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,559
I was like you know I mean it was the

1400
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:21,540
only plane that left that day everything

1401
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:24,059
else was canceled canceled canceled down

1402
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:26,159
the list I was really lucky to get out

1403
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:27,780
and then for a while I was it was still

1404
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:30,118
teetering on the edge and I was scared

1405
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,519
to go can I go back and get stuck there

1406
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,519
and and you know and not be able to be

1407
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:37,500
here at work where I need to be

1408
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:39,659
things like that so but I hope to get

1409
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,519
back this year things they seem today

1410
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:42,420
everything has settled down quite a bit

1411
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,900
now

1412
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:48,838
as far as you know worldwide travel goes

1413
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,818
yeah certainly certainly I'm curious to

1414
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,440
know how do you find the difference in

1415
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:55,079
climate do you do you feel like you've

1416
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,920
adapted to the Heat

1417
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,500
um

1418
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,358
yeah uh yeah I mean it's hotter here but

1419
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,858
it is it is humid there

1420
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:06,838
but you know it's only like low 90s

1421
00:57:03,858 --> 00:57:08,338
whereas you know here the other a few

1422
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,759
days ago I mean it was a record-breaking

1423
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:12,659
heat day but it was 110 here the other

1424
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,000
day

1425
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:17,279
um and it was hot I mean your water your

1426
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,920
water water bottle jug that you had

1427
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,359
beside you all day by the time six or

1428
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,099
seven o'clock in the evening rolled

1429
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,719
around you'd take a swig off of it and

1430
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:26,940
you'd be damned it's water if it feels

1431
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,759
hot in my mouth that's how hot it was

1432
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:31,200
and it's never like that there and you

1433
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,540
know where I'm at it's kind of coastal

1434
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,519
and it gets a breeze and you know

1435
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:37,558
there's a little elevation so it's not

1436
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,719
too bad where I'm at

1437
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:41,099
okay nice that's cool to hear that's

1438
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:43,858
cool to hear

1439
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:46,740
on a sort of unrelated note I wanted to

1440
00:57:43,858 --> 00:57:49,259
ask you I've always loved the names of

1441
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:50,699
your lines I think like deep chunk and

1442
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:54,440
pine tar Kush they're like they're cool

1443
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:54,439
names where did these names come from

1444
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:58,559
um

1445
00:57:55,858 --> 00:58:01,338
party Chris was just my my

1446
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,839
um you know like I I would call it D15

1447
00:58:01,338 --> 00:58:06,420
you know or whatever the chemist calls

1448
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:08,099
it they call them all by numbers and um

1449
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,220
I know you know I kind of felt like that

1450
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:12,900
wouldn't do you know for people when I

1451
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:16,199
when I passed around so I tried to you

1452
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:18,858
know describe them and you know the the

1453
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:21,239
first the early time I was passing out

1454
00:58:18,858 --> 00:58:23,279
the deep chocolate you know it would be

1455
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:25,500
called monkey balls because that's what

1456
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,180
you know it used to be called you know a

1457
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:30,119
friend of mine named it that actually

1458
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:32,719
it's a you know there's a tree that

1459
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:37,079
grows all over uh

1460
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:40,019
Suburbia United States that that when it

1461
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:42,660
seeds it drops these like round golf

1462
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:44,699
balls onto the sidewalks everywhere and

1463
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:47,279
we used to Skid on them when we were on

1464
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:49,439
our skateboards and you know it you know

1465
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,660
people would have fights with them

1466
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,420
throwing them at each other you know all

1467
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:56,759
over the small towns of America and and

1468
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,740
that nickname for this these round balls

1469
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,780
that cover sidewalks and streets and

1470
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:02,399
entire neighborhoods are it's just a

1471
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,380
shade tree it's not good for much else I

1472
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,119
don't think but but the nickname for

1473
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:07,318
them these these round balls are monkey

1474
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,059
balls

1475
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:10,500
so my friend said he got any more of

1476
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:13,500
those monkey balls one day and it was

1477
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:16,380
pretty funny we kept the name uh for a

1478
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,838
long long time right before I put it out

1479
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,880
there in public to people from like

1480
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:22,500
overgo and such

1481
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,680
um I had seen like I think it was like a

1482
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,179
South Park cartoon or something where

1483
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,460
where they actually said Jesus Christ

1484
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:31,078
monkey balls or something something I

1485
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,500
looked up monkey balls I'm like working

1486
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,900
where'd they get this from and um

1487
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,579
and monkey balls it was what it was a

1488
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,858
video game right

1489
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:43,798
and I was like [ __ ] I'm gonna get sued

1490
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:46,259
right by this [ __ ] video game kidding

1491
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:48,480
people I can't [ __ ] release this [ __ ]

1492
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:50,880
under the handle monkey balls right some

1493
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,798
stupid Nintendo or somebody right it's

1494
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,838
gonna come after me so I change it to

1495
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,780
deep Chunk on the Fly real quick before

1496
00:59:54,838 --> 01:00:00,659
I put it out there to the public

1497
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,579
um the x18 was one that my mother Kim is

1498
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:04,739
called number 18 and I was just too lazy

1499
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:06,660
to come up with a name for it

1500
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:09,959
um the pine car crash you know it does

1501
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:11,879
have some some uh Piney and tarry kind

1502
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,639
of things going on and it's a broad leaf

1503
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,260
you know so it's just just threw it out

1504
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:19,078
there

1505
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:22,079
beautiful I love the name d chunk that's

1506
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:25,200
a a flash of creativity if nothing else

1507
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:28,380
I love it our our buddy Caleb inspector

1508
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:31,078
he actually said at one point that after

1509
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:32,818
doing that plantar Kush Recreation like

1510
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,619
having gotten a bit of experience with

1511
01:00:32,818 --> 01:00:36,298
the line through seeing the numbers he

1512
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:38,400
says he wouldn't be surprised if it's

1513
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:41,880
somehow in her cool do you have any

1514
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,260
thoughts on this given you've seen both

1515
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,119
um

1516
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:48,299
I don't know I think

1517
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,280
they're probably both derived from you

1518
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:52,980
know similar [ __ ] from the from the

1519
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,720
similar neighborhood up here inspect is

1520
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,639
always trying to find you know figure

1521
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:59,578
figure [ __ ] out that he's never gonna

1522
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:01,739
know for sure you know but why spend

1523
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:03,359
time on that I I don't know it's

1524
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:05,279
certainly different from you know

1525
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:07,920
they're different but they're the same

1526
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,680
type of plant you know these are just uh

1527
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,079
sir you know broad Leafs from from from

1528
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:15,179
this region that you know that were

1529
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:17,700
around way back in the day

1530
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:18,899
I'm talking late 70s early 80s you know

1531
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:21,358
right from the beginning of the

1532
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,519
introductions to broadleaf and up in

1533
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:26,159
these up in these you know communities

1534
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:29,039
up here they're both certainly survivors

1535
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:31,558
of that but as to their relation I don't

1536
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:32,880
know Urkel's very different

1537
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:35,940
um from it

1538
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:39,358
and so I don't know

1539
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:42,480
yeah so I understand I understand

1540
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:45,239
out of curiosity have you ever heard of

1541
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:49,880
Christmas tree bird or Christmas Bud oh

1542
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:49,879
sure yeah that was uh that was

1543
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,900
um stuff that we used to get around

1544
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:57,660
Christmas time back down in Southern

1545
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,740
California I would come in it would come

1546
01:01:57,659 --> 01:01:59,399
in late

1547
01:01:58,739 --> 01:02:01,798
um

1548
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:04,019
at least the one that I remember we used

1549
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:06,539
to call it Christmas but

1550
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:09,960
um and uh

1551
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:11,818
it was uh also called something else I

1552
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,159
think it was a three River sativa or

1553
01:02:11,818 --> 01:02:16,558
something come out of the like Yosemite

1554
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,798
region or not Yosemite but uh what's

1555
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,540
that other national park down there

1556
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:23,880
Sequoia

1557
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:27,480
in the foothills of this National Park

1558
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,039
uh you know East Northeast of La you

1559
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,139
know they that was a growing Community

1560
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,818
they're called Three Rivers and there

1561
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:35,039
was some late sativa that came out of

1562
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:37,259
there that have always be in by

1563
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,880
Christmas and that's what me and my you

1564
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,760
know people that I knew down there we

1565
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,559
used to call it Christmas bud uh okay

1566
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,359
the reason I ask is because I'd heard

1567
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,619
some people I can't remember who I wish

1568
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,858
I could credit them

1569
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:51,720
compare the Christmas Bud to ptk and I

1570
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:53,098
guess like someone was sort of saying

1571
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:54,779
like are they the same thing maybe

1572
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:56,519
they're just similar sort of pakistanis

1573
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:59,640
I guess really

1574
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,139
yeah who knows so I I if we might be

1575
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:04,139
talking about a different holy different

1576
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:06,179
totally different term you know this uh

1577
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:08,759
there's three River sativa that that we

1578
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:11,279
used to get down in L.A

1579
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,500
um that certainly didn't smell like a

1580
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,298
Christmas tree if if that's what these

1581
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,179
other the stats with this other

1582
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:19,199
Christmas you said Christmas tree bud

1583
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:21,419
it's probably something all right

1584
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:24,539
probably something entirely different

1585
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:26,579
um but uh the ptk does have some of that

1586
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:28,980
type of some some of those type of

1587
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:32,039
profiles in it for sure

1588
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:34,858
you know kind of kind of piney thing

1589
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:36,838
going on and but it's pretty variable

1590
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:42,358
still too you know I mean it's pretty

1591
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:45,239
raw that one the x18 I think was more uh

1592
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:47,940
stable uh from of the chemists you know

1593
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:50,219
of those two I think that's a ptk still

1594
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:53,220
still pretty raw there's probably lots

1595
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:56,338
of good stuff in it you know

1596
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:58,259
yeah interesting and did you ever try

1597
01:03:56,338 --> 01:04:01,078
any of like the fabled Northern Lights

1598
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:03,660
clones that circulated the Mendo area in

1599
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:05,519
like the 90s like and did you were you a

1600
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:10,500
fan of it if so

1601
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:14,639
oh well we up on this road where I'm at

1602
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:17,579
um everybody had it in seed form

1603
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:19,858
um it was you know everybody was growing

1604
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:22,740
from Northern Lights from seed

1605
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:25,558
feminized seed mind you

1606
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:27,838
um from you know stressed out rooms and

1607
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:30,240
stuff that and that stuff came out

1608
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:33,420
really uniform

1609
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:35,279
um and sold real well but yeah most

1610
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,079
people grew Northern Lights from seed

1611
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,740
none of the Clones

1612
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:43,019
um you know five two all these ones

1613
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:45,659
um that everybody else knows of we're up

1614
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:48,298
here that I know of but everybody had

1615
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:50,639
Northern lifetime sheep and Seed Farm up

1616
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:53,460
here and they and they used that because

1617
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:56,338
it was all female seed but they kept on

1618
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,900
you know producing in their rooms you

1619
01:04:56,338 --> 01:05:00,358
know it would throw a couple of seeds

1620
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:02,700
and as you're smoking or whatever you'd

1621
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:03,960
save your seeds from it and you'd end up

1622
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:06,118
with the pile of these Northern Light

1623
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,159
seeds and you'd [ __ ] grow them again

1624
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:11,519
and it'd be it would it would be a way

1625
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:13,259
to without cloning rent all female uh

1626
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,298
rooms up here that happened for years

1627
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,880
and years and years and years

1628
01:05:15,298 --> 01:05:20,759
um I know several people that grew Craig

1629
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,980
and Lester's Northern lifestyle that's

1630
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,200
what we call it up here

1631
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:27,199
um they've both passed away now so it's

1632
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:30,179
okay to say their name

1633
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:32,939
but these two brothers had epic Northern

1634
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:35,699
Lights uh line up here on on the hill

1635
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,500
where I'm at and that that was that was

1636
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:39,179
like the earliest thing that anybody was

1637
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,858
growing up here and they and they did

1638
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:42,480
that for years and years and years later

1639
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:45,838
you know a few people would try out some

1640
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,400
White Widow or something but uh then the

1641
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,279
Northern Light seed from the hill here

1642
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:53,160
was was a staple for like you know the

1643
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,740
first decade of indoor growing up here

1644
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:58,139
big generator grows you know it's with

1645
01:05:55,739 --> 01:06:01,558
60 lightrooms and such

1646
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:04,019
and what was the the bud like

1647
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:06,359
it was pretty much um

1648
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:09,179
looked very similar

1649
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:10,920
um to this that went up in Canada BCC

1650
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:13,318
here or something

1651
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,240
um I've seen photos of some pretty legit

1652
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:17,219
looking Northern Lights but it's very

1653
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:19,739
resinous but it's another one with these

1654
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:21,779
small resin heads man and it was pretty

1655
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:24,538
lightweight I have to say it didn't get

1656
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:27,539
you super high I mean it was serviceable

1657
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:29,640
smoke for sure but it was one of these

1658
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:32,640
ones that were that faked you out man

1659
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:35,578
looked like a sea resin but um they were

1660
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:37,818
empty nests man nobody was home upstairs

1661
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,559
their small one-bedroom apartment

1662
01:06:37,818 --> 01:06:42,420
that small resin head man

1663
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,400
um I I didn't particularly like it I

1664
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,260
still have some of the seed here and you

1665
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,059
know but they don't they don't they

1666
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,339
won't germinate for me anymore they're

1667
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:52,680
that old but um but I save them anyway

1668
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:54,659
we might be able to get them back that

1669
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:56,098
way you know via other tissue culture or

1670
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:58,920
something one day

1671
01:06:56,099 --> 01:07:00,480
so I'd say seeds even if they don't even

1672
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,858
if they don't want germinate for me

1673
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,139
anymore but

1674
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:05,699
yeah there's there's a famous old one up

1675
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:08,279
here up in the hills

1676
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:11,159
but I don't remember the the clothes I

1677
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,680
remember it a thing that the Northern

1678
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:16,500
Lights didn't grow anywhere near as good

1679
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,960
outdoor as it performed indoor you know

1680
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,818
you you weren't gonna like try to try to

1681
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,039
grow giant plants of it or something it

1682
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:25,318
it lacked bigger compared to a lot of

1683
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,940
other stuff that we were growing outdoor

1684
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:29,279
back then

1685
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:32,460
um it didn't produce as much it was just

1686
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,680
a smaller plant you know less bigger

1687
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:36,720
um there's decent serviceable weed but

1688
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:38,759
it was kind of a morning smoke you know

1689
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:41,098
it wasn't going to floor you

1690
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:44,160
it's a great breeding plant I you know

1691
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:47,700
have no doubt about that we've seen you

1692
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:49,920
know kazilian hybrids with it in it that

1693
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:52,139
are good you know so it's a great you

1694
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,240
know nothing to say that nothing bad

1695
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:57,078
about it it's it's a it's a famous and

1696
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:59,519
and an excellent plant that's that's

1697
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:01,079
certainly been valuable to the gene pool

1698
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:01,798
I think

1699
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:05,460
um

1700
01:08:01,798 --> 01:08:07,318
but you know I mean it itself as a line

1701
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,579
yeah it was okay

1702
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:11,460
you know

1703
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:13,940
my more value it for breeding words

1704
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,940
probably

1705
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:18,179
yeah well you read my mind when you said

1706
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:21,060
you know you're still sitting on it even

1707
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:23,640
though they won't germ I was curious to

1708
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:25,259
know do you have any other notable seeds

1709
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,140
in your collection that are like special

1710
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:29,819
to you even though they may not germ but

1711
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,319
you know yeah memorable for one reason

1712
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:35,219
or another

1713
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:39,060
yeah well I still have all those uh the

1714
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:40,380
pro the I think the original uh uh ptk

1715
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,940
stuff

1716
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,500
the stuff that went back to all that

1717
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:46,139
[ __ ] Creek that's getting pretty old

1718
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:48,359
now that was like I don't know 2000 or

1719
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:50,640
something might have been even been from

1720
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,679
the late 90s or something that's

1721
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,600
probably about sprout anymore but but

1722
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:57,659
I'm gonna throw them away

1723
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:00,359
um let's see there's some old I have

1724
01:08:57,659 --> 01:09:02,818
some old Reunion Island stuff that

1725
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:06,359
probably won't Sprout but I won't throw

1726
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:09,600
it away and yeah

1727
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:12,000
um that old Northern Lights fine

1728
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,640
um some old Salmon Creek hybrids

1729
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,380
probably yeah yeah I have I have a few I

1730
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,819
know that I know are Like Beckham won't

1731
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,798
Sprout and then

1732
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:21,120
um but but I refuse to throw them away

1733
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:25,079
I'm just a

1734
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:26,338
you know a seed junkie I guess and they

1735
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,818
might be worth something later I can't

1736
01:09:26,338 --> 01:09:28,818
throw it away

1737
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:34,198
I love it I love it and uh were there

1738
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:35,399
ever any notable clones that went

1739
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:37,198
through the area that were really

1740
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:39,539
special to you that have just been lost

1741
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:43,198
to time

1742
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:46,140
yeah well you know I mean

1743
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:48,539
some of the Great Outdoor performers you

1744
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:50,400
know I wish people had kept had held on

1745
01:09:48,539 --> 01:09:52,979
to

1746
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:56,879
um any other Salmon Creek

1747
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:58,799
you know uh I I even I missed the blue

1748
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,199
dream sometimes to be honest people are

1749
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,860
gonna laugh though that was an okay plan

1750
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:06,779
Old Faithful Got You High you know

1751
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:07,619
um I'm there with you I thought it was

1752
01:10:06,779 --> 01:10:10,079
great

1753
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:11,300
yeah yeah I mean it wasn't it wasn't you

1754
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:13,500
know I mean there's there's a certain

1755
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,420
there was a certain what I call

1756
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:17,640
muddiness to the high it wasn't like

1757
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,619
crystal clear and stuff it was it was

1758
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:22,920
kind of a little bit

1759
01:10:19,619 --> 01:10:25,738
um you know fuzzy and and cloudy I would

1760
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:28,920
say ever high but uh it was certainly

1761
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:32,698
potent and man that plant's bomb proof

1762
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:35,579
you grow right through a snowstorm

1763
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:37,979
hell yeah and I mean given you're in the

1764
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:40,319
area did you ever like you know you hear

1765
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:42,658
stories about the famous brothers of

1766
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:45,119
eternal love and stock coming from the

1767
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:46,679
early stuff they brought in did you ever

1768
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,899
see any of that or do you think that's

1769
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:50,699
sort of a bit more fabled

1770
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:52,439
I have no idea

1771
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:54,539
um I don't have a

1772
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:57,178
any opinions about that that's mostly

1773
01:10:54,539 --> 01:11:00,560
that's I'm not probably quite that old

1774
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:03,179
that's like Sam Skunk Man old

1775
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,580
I'm not quite I'm not quite I'm getting

1776
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:07,859
up there but I'm not there yet

1777
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:10,198
um what I do know that there is lots of

1778
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:12,059
really really good [ __ ] and you know I

1779
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:13,619
mean California and

1780
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:17,280
you know

1781
01:11:13,619 --> 01:11:19,738
um Surfers you know they smoke weed and

1782
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:22,079
uh the California has always been a

1783
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:23,939
great big fan of weed

1784
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:26,340
um and there's some really good [ __ ]

1785
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:28,859
that that got shipped into California

1786
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:31,079
ports you know due to that

1787
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:32,519
and uh you know there's great Mexicans

1788
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:34,198
and there was and there was crappy

1789
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,760
Mexicans too

1790
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:37,859
um but that was probably the the you

1791
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,539
know the most popular

1792
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:42,000
um or the most you know

1793
01:11:39,539 --> 01:11:44,819
of what was there I think you would get

1794
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,738
the Jamaicans the Thai the Hawaiian you

1795
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:48,299
know all this stuff came in occasionally

1796
01:11:46,738 --> 01:11:49,799
and there were some really really great

1797
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:52,320
stuff

1798
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,300
um here in California always you know

1799
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:57,059
and it's allowed us to like you know

1800
01:11:54,300 --> 01:12:01,980
kind of be be a kind of a place where

1801
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:04,739
you know things thrived for a long time

1802
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:06,359
yeah interesting and I mean I don't

1803
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:08,339
think you've mentioned it so I'll just

1804
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:10,380
ask and get it out of the way do you

1805
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:13,260
ever have you ever had any experience

1806
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:14,819
with like African strains do you have a

1807
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:17,760
spot in your heart for them what's your

1808
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:18,599
thoughts I grew a Malawi up here one

1809
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,360
time

1810
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:23,520
um during the late 80s and it and it

1811
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:26,759
[ __ ] it was a

1812
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:29,580
intersex you know nightmare that was all

1813
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,079
seated and just gave me a headache and

1814
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,698
uh and I threw it I threw it in the

1815
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:34,679
toilet

1816
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:36,658
but I probably wish I didn't I would say

1817
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:38,880
you know if I probably should have you

1818
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:40,259
know if I if I had known I would have

1819
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,579
probably grabbed some of those seeds and

1820
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,219
set them aside

1821
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:46,079
you know but you know the one time I had

1822
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:49,800
a look at some African here it didn't

1823
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,500
work out and I quickly called it

1824
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:55,820
yeah okay there you go not as much

1825
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:58,920
successes with some of the hazes

1826
01:12:55,819 --> 01:13:01,198
yeah um there and there's some you know

1827
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,658
before before the broad leaves came up

1828
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:05,698
here everybody was growing Mexican you

1829
01:13:03,658 --> 01:13:07,379
know the earlier Mexicans you know there

1830
01:13:05,698 --> 01:13:09,178
was a there's definitely two different

1831
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:11,340
kinds of Mexican

1832
01:13:09,179 --> 01:13:13,859
um you had your you know your really

1833
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:16,739
trippy cerebral you know ones that were

1834
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:18,299
down from further south on the on the on

1835
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:20,519
the Mediterranean or on the on the

1836
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,320
Caribbean side and then they had those

1837
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,120
Northern Mexican stuff that came in real

1838
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:26,340
early and it was like the bulk of what

1839
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:28,679
got shipped North through California it

1840
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:30,539
was lower quality but some of that stuff

1841
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:33,179
came in early and you could finish it in

1842
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:35,760
Northern California you know way better

1843
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:37,619
than the ties and everything else

1844
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,420
um so you know early on that's what most

1845
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:40,920
people were growing up here with some

1846
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,079
Mexican

1847
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,640
um there's there were some good ones of

1848
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:46,859
those around

1849
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,179
um and I saved one I forgot what the

1850
01:13:46,859 --> 01:13:50,339
hell happened to that thing I guess I

1851
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:52,140
don't have it now but I had it and you

1852
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:55,440
know 20 years ago or something and sent

1853
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:58,500
it to somebody I forget who I don't

1854
01:13:55,439 --> 01:14:01,559
remember anyway

1855
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:03,539
wow very interesting very interesting

1856
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,480
so we had some of our listeners as well

1857
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:09,000
as myself were curious you sort of have

1858
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:11,459
had a bit of a notable absence in the

1859
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,319
community for a few years are you

1860
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,060
willing to share any insight about what

1861
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:18,000
you've been doing in that time or why

1862
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:22,140
you decided to take some time away

1863
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,960
and you know I mean there's there's a

1864
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,679
there's there's good people

1865
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,219
um

1866
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,899
that I've met from those places uh from

1867
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:32,279
the you're talking about the forums yeah

1868
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,539
there's some great I've met some great

1869
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:35,158
friends

1870
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:37,738
um you know getting involved with all

1871
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:40,319
that but there's but there's also some

1872
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:42,299
you know there's some real bills that

1873
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:45,238
somehow for some reason seems to get

1874
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,279
attracted to this to the whole to the

1875
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:49,019
whole scene man

1876
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:50,460
um and that kind of freaks me out a

1877
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,199
little bit you know

1878
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,179
um

1879
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:56,819
uh that that not everybody has your best

1880
01:14:54,179 --> 01:15:01,440
interest in mind so I so I just don't

1881
01:14:56,819 --> 01:15:04,439
you know I I felt like I had to have a

1882
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:06,238
presence there when I passed out a bunch

1883
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:08,759
of genetics you know and made available

1884
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:12,059
a bunch of genetics I felt I owed it to

1885
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:13,739
people you know to try to to try to you

1886
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:15,120
know say something about him help them

1887
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:17,218
with them or whatever

1888
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:19,140
but um

1889
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:21,300
but I felt like those dudes you know

1890
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,039
that that you know that I've done that

1891
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,560
and um

1892
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:27,719
and other than that it's like and it

1893
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,280
kind of gives me the willies to even to

1894
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:31,920
even go there I feel the same way about

1895
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:34,198
going to Europe you know I mean I

1896
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:37,199
um I'm just uncomfortable in that in

1897
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:38,519
that in that scenario kind of you know I

1898
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:41,099
don't like being the center of attention

1899
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,900
although you know I'll get drunk on some

1900
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,880
beer and just kick my foot and pour

1901
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:47,158
gypsy's front door and just raise hell

1902
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,719
until you know and play off the handle

1903
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:51,259
it doesn't bother me you know when I'm

1904
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:54,060
hammered

1905
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:56,640
when I'm sober and and probably have

1906
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,140
something to actually add it's just yeah

1907
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,679
it doesn't even that I'm not even

1908
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:03,960
attracted anymore you know

1909
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:06,539
um I wanted to ask you there's actually

1910
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:09,480
a notable clone that goes around like

1911
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:11,579
the NorCal area it's chemd across to Tom

1912
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:14,158
Hills Hayes have you ever heard or seen

1913
01:16:11,579 --> 01:16:16,738
of that one by any chance never have

1914
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:19,019
that's awesome though

1915
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,879
um that somebody's taking the time to

1916
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:23,340
you know to actually set aside a club

1917
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,440
and I think that's [ __ ] bitching I'd

1918
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:28,260
love to I'd love to check it out but

1919
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:30,479
yeah I have not heard that there you go

1920
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:32,039
yeah we'll have to put the feelers out

1921
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:33,609
for it try to get it into your hands

1922
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:34,939
it'd be cool

1923
01:16:33,609 --> 01:16:38,519
[Laughter]

1924
01:16:34,939 --> 01:16:41,219
uh so I I wanted to ask you a bit

1925
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,380
unrelated but um what do you what's your

1926
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:45,239
thoughts of Sam you know Sam often gets

1927
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:47,460
scapegoated as like a bit of a villain

1928
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:49,559
by some people but it sounds like you're

1929
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:51,420
more of the school of thought that I am

1930
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,520
which is that he's you know maybe done

1931
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:55,079
more than anyone where do you fall on

1932
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,440
that one what's your thoughts on Mr

1933
01:16:55,079 --> 01:17:01,198
David Watson oh he's he's you know he's

1934
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:03,899
a there's there's not many that have

1935
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:06,419
done what he's done uh for the for the

1936
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:07,799
community and and the worldwide gene

1937
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:10,679
pool and stuff you know he made

1938
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:13,380
available stuff that people you know

1939
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:14,819
would have never even you know had to I

1940
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,319
mean what were they doing in Holland

1941
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:18,359
when he showed up I think they were

1942
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:20,939
smoking some dirty hash from Morocco or

1943
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:22,920
somewhere mixed with tobacco so yeah I

1944
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:26,339
think he's I think he's a good man and

1945
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:28,560
and uh and honest and all that you know

1946
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:31,319
um I don't I don't think he you know

1947
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:33,120
I'll give him hell when I'm hammered but

1948
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:35,939
um but about I think for the most part

1949
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:38,640
this guy's this guy's great and and his

1950
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:42,079
friend rob you know I think those guys

1951
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:44,880
are are absolutely you know excellent

1952
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:46,979
uh ambassadors of

1953
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,679
of cannabis

1954
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:51,658
yeah here here here

1955
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:53,760
I should have asked you this one a bit

1956
01:17:51,658 --> 01:17:56,099
earlier when we were talking about you

1957
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,679
know sort of being in the NorCal area

1958
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:01,560
but I wanted to hear your thoughts on

1959
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:03,600
the idea of like clones degrading over

1960
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:06,179
time and people speculate like maybe

1961
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:09,120
it's like genetic drift or like

1962
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:10,920
deterioration what's your thoughts do

1963
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:13,079
you think that clones degrade over time

1964
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,819
and like do you think it's possible to

1965
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:16,619
stop that through like maybe keeping

1966
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:18,840
them like really happy their whole lives

1967
01:18:16,619 --> 01:18:22,079
where do you fall on this

1968
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:24,239
well I think that time itself is it

1969
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:26,640
won't degrade them I think that we're

1970
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:27,238
actually talking about pathogens

1971
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,480
um

1972
01:18:27,238 --> 01:18:33,479
that that you know eventually get them

1973
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:35,158
and uh and and they'll succumb to them

1974
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:37,919
and and you know put out less

1975
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:40,079
performance and that's just a a fact of

1976
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:43,020
cannabis unfortunately it doesn't last

1977
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:45,119
as long as a grape clone or

1978
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:47,340
something else you probably clean it up

1979
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,859
in the lab and all that stuff's possible

1980
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:52,140
and such but yeah it doesn't just

1981
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:55,859
deteriorate and fall apart genetically

1982
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:58,079
uh anyway you know I mean I mean you

1983
01:18:55,859 --> 01:19:00,599
might have drift or something or talk I

1984
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:02,039
don't even know yeah no I don't see it

1985
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,900
happening

1986
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:05,760
um I I think they said we're talking

1987
01:19:03,899 --> 01:19:09,779
about pathogens that just you know

1988
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:12,239
eventually the plant succumbs to

1989
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:14,698
have you ever heard people talk about

1990
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:17,759
dudding

1991
01:19:14,698 --> 01:19:20,759
yeah same thing same thing

1992
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:23,280
um you know these are likely pathogens

1993
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:27,719
that have you know taken hold of the

1994
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:30,420
plant and and [ __ ] up its performance

1995
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:32,279
yeah I know that um in the community The

1996
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:34,619
Hop late and viroid is like largely

1997
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:36,119
considered the source of that but I

1998
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:37,260
guess you know being secluded and

1999
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:40,140
growing from seed you probably don't

2000
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,699
really encounter much about that do you

2001
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:44,640
no

2002
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:48,119
um I don't uh when I'm growing from seed

2003
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:52,140
and and and luckily I haven't you know I

2004
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:54,119
haven't had any bad problems uh

2005
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:56,760
from clone either

2006
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:58,738
and I I don't know I don't know how I

2007
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:02,159
hear that it's widespread but I'm

2008
01:19:58,738 --> 01:20:04,319
probably pretty removed from you know

2009
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:06,179
what everybody else is kind of working

2010
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:08,399
with

2011
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:10,739
um I'm not going down and you know

2012
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:12,179
buying clothes from the dispensary or

2013
01:20:10,738 --> 01:20:15,119
whatever

2014
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:18,119
yeah true Advantage the uh the ultimate

2015
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:20,819
quarantine I love it I love it so I

2016
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:24,300
think that brings us to a quick fire

2017
01:20:20,819 --> 01:20:26,460
question so I wanted to ask you first of

2018
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,199
all what is your absolute favorite

2019
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:29,880
strain of all time

2020
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:32,460
hmm

2021
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,920
Ty Reid

2022
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:39,119
Thailand race I love it I love it okay

2023
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:40,800
so next one what is the most single

2024
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,779
memorable experience you've had with

2025
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,699
cannabis be it like you know because it

2026
01:20:42,779 --> 01:20:46,439
was potent or just because of like the

2027
01:20:44,698 --> 01:20:48,299
Saturn setting and it was super

2028
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:50,658
memorable what's the number one most

2029
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,659
memorable

2030
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,199
um this flavor that I came across in a

2031
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:56,760
deep chunk plant once

2032
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:59,219
um I call it top rock because that's

2033
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:01,980
where it was grown but it had such a

2034
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:04,920
rich uh kind of coffee flavor that

2035
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:08,218
actually would coat your throat and make

2036
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:10,440
your throat actually numb and give your

2037
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:12,239
throat a numb feeling

2038
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:14,399
um it was nothing like ever anything

2039
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,439
I've ever experienced with cannabis um

2040
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:19,500
before or after

2041
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:20,819
wow you've only seen it that one time

2042
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:24,539
yeah

2043
01:21:20,819 --> 01:21:27,119
oh gosh that's beautiful love it okay so

2044
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:29,579
on the other end of the spectrum what's

2045
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:31,319
a strain where everyone was hyping it up

2046
01:21:29,579 --> 01:21:33,059
and you were really excited to try it

2047
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:35,099
and then you finally did and you were

2048
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,340
just disappointed

2049
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:39,900
[ __ ]

2050
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:42,179
could I say most everything that's been

2051
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:43,279
that's around right now you know I mean

2052
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:45,658
um

2053
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:48,059
everything's hyped up these days and it

2054
01:21:45,658 --> 01:21:49,920
never [ __ ] comes through

2055
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:51,480
um you know as much as you're hoping you

2056
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,880
know you you just you know that the

2057
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:56,579
majority of what's out there

2058
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:58,260
um fits that description I think

2059
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:00,420
um no so not one sticks out you know

2060
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:02,820
thousands upon thousands upon thousands

2061
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:05,460
of wave of them stand out to me it's

2062
01:22:02,819 --> 01:22:08,299
like you know everything is hyped up and

2063
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:12,480
it never delivers

2064
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:16,140
holding no punches so let's say I'm

2065
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:18,479
gonna drop you off on a mythical magical

2066
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:20,280
desert island you've got everything you

2067
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:22,139
need to grow and you're only allowed to

2068
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:24,779
take three strains with you you can take

2069
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:26,820
seeds or clones what three things are

2070
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:29,340
you gonna take that are gonna do you

2071
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:31,500
right for the rest of time

2072
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:33,900
huh

2073
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:36,600
uh

2074
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:38,399
Hayes High and deep Chunk in seed form

2075
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,620
all

2076
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:42,299
that's brilliant and then if I come back

2077
01:22:40,619 --> 01:22:44,420
in like 20 years you'll just have

2078
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:47,079
recreated everything

2079
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:49,520
no I'd probably still be growing Haze

2080
01:22:47,079 --> 01:22:53,238
[Laughter]

2081
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:57,300
okay so final question

2082
01:22:53,238 --> 01:22:59,759
what is your ultimate hopes in terms of

2083
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,860
the future for the Cannabis sin in what

2084
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,780
direction do you want to see it go what

2085
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:05,779
would be the best outcome in your mind

2086
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:13,319
well for to you know finish to finished

2087
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:16,860
making it not a a criminal activity you

2088
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:20,279
know around the world that would be nice

2089
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:22,920
um and for you know as far as the Scene

2090
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:26,340
goes I wish people would just you know

2091
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:28,199
be be more doing what they want to do

2092
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:30,300
what they'd like doing doing what they

2093
01:23:28,198 --> 01:23:32,519
like growing what they like reading what

2094
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,739
they like what they like not what their

2095
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:37,080
Market's looking for anything else but I

2096
01:23:34,738 --> 01:23:39,059
wish people would be more honest with

2097
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:41,279
you know what their favorite is and and

2098
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:43,739
kind of kind of take it upon themselves

2099
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:45,479
to be a steward of you know of those

2100
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:48,479
varieties

2101
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:51,119
what a brilliant sentiment I love it I

2102
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:53,039
can totally endorse that one so I think

2103
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:55,260
that just about brings us to the end of

2104
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:57,238
it for this one do you have any comments

2105
01:23:55,260 --> 01:24:00,300
or shout outs you'd like to make

2106
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:02,099
no I'm good um you know I just I know

2107
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:04,079
it's hard time for a lot of a lot of

2108
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,699
people that are still in the you know

2109
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:08,100
cannabis Zone
