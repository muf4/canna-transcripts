excited so first question we've been

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,798
doing recently what are you currently

30
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:20,118
smoking

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:24,799
on uh I'm I still love my OG the uh sfv

32
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:28,759
Cut's been my favorite for 15 plus years

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,600
now um can't get enough of it so been

34
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,959
smoking a little bit of that little bit

35
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,438
of lemon tree um doing some blends of

36
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,519
the two give give that lemon tree a

37
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,000
little extra

38
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,239
kick wow there's a lot to go into so

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,799
first of all the sfv thing that's

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,519
interesting I've noticed a lot of the

41
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,680
chem fam seems to favor sfv do you think

42
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,319
that a lot of people just like don't

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,560
really maybe have the real cut and so

44
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,118
they don't think it's the best like why

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,478
do you think that most I guess what I'm

46
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:57,560
trying to say is why do you think most

47
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:01,399
people don't regard it as the best while

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,118
a lot of the real heads do

49
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,680
I think the majority of the people that

50
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,758
have sfv now have some kind of fake cut

51
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,879
they bought from the club and was just

52
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,399
called

53
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:16,079
SF uh a lot of the dispensaries out here

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,400
um I know they pass off a Cali

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,959
Connection cut of the San Fernando

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,800
Valley as the real cut you know um so

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,280
it's it's just a lot of

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,280
mislabeling and you know they they

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,479
probably just don't have the real deal

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,878
is what's going going

61
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:37,000
on and out of curiosity do you think all

62
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,679
of the calicon hybrids are made with the

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,318
real

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:46,400
one uh swerve

65
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:48,799
uh who knows about that guy um I'm sure

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,039
he's just throwing names on stuff here

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,760
and there uh he got me he got me for a

68
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,000
few packs of seeds maybe 10 plus years

69
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,518
ago

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,959
and worst seeds I've ever grown in my

71
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:05,080
life I mean even even worse than Sensei

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,039
seed now oh yeah see he got me for a few

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,159
packs too but here's what I do have to

74
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,959
say about swer because I know swerve he

75
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:12,400
listens to the show and he doesn't like

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,158
me because I've said some things about

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,439
him in the past but what I think is true

78
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:19,560
and I don't say this as a criticism is I

79
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,840
like to describe swerve gear as like a

80
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,000
glass Cannon I think if you run like six

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,439
F seeds from him probably going to find

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,840
four Hermes but one of them could well

83
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,639
be a really nice keeper and that was my

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,719
experience I I ran like three of his

85
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,719
packs I think out of the three packs I

86
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,400
found two keepers which is you know like

87
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:39,000
I hope to find at least one from one

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,039
pack so you know I was hoping for three

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,318
got two so maybe a little low but you

90
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,840
know those Keepers were nice but the

91
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,199
fact that the others were Hermes that

92
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,400
was a bit like you know i' maybe just

93
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:53,158
prefer they weren't Keepers

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,079
but oh well I guess that's yeah sry were

95
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,679
they were they uh feminized seeds or

96
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,439
regular seeds feminized but here's how

97
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,760
we can add more to the story one of the

98
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,000
p one of the ones that I was

99
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:06,479
particularly Blown Away by was the it

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,318
was Bubba Kush feminize like but it was

101
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,119
from like a BX line and then I heard

102
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,560
that he actually purchased that line

103
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,799
from someone else and hadn't really done

104
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,639
it himself so I was like oh well I like

105
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,600
that one so H nice nice yeah he got me

106
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,000
for uh i' had bought 10 packs of the of

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,280
his sfv OG you know and went back and

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,079
forth talking to him and and you know he

109
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:34,638
sold himself pretty good anyhow that 10

110
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,319
pack of seeds or yeah the 10 packs um I

111
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,280
ended up throwing most of it

112
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,120
away yeah well I knew that he definitely

113
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,599
had some issues with the sfv line in

114
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,439
particular a few years ago and I think

115
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,840
ultimately the reason he came out and

116
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,759
said that there was some pollen

117
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,918
contamination

118
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,240
issues oh really yeah but I think he

119
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,079
also I mean I could be totally wrong but

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,960
I think he also said that like it was a

121
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,599
he had outsourced that crop and so yeah

122
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,638
I think that's maybe had happened could

123
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,879
be totally wrong if so feel free to come

124
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,840
on the show swerve

125
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:11,680
um I asked him he said no um anyway so

126
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,478
he sold me pretty good on those seeds

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,680
like I kept on asking him I was like you

128
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:18,560
know uh they need to be consistent what

129
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,918
did I think he said like they were work

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,680
to F6 or F7 or something like that yeah

131
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,719
yeah see seed finder says that they they

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,160
were consistent but it was it was

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,840
consistent crap is what it ended up

134
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,600
being all right well that that means

135
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:37,638
that like I got no idea of what sfv is

136
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,720
cuz that's my only real experience with

137
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:45,639
it is is the Cali Connection sfb yeah oh

138
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,199
okay all right I I grew out uh all the

139
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,759
ogs side by side one year um everything

140
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:55,240
I could get my hands on uh I did the sfv

141
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,800
the ghost the fire the triangle the

142
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,199
Tahoe uh what else was there there was a

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,960
y uh

144
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:07,439
white WiFi number three I think I had

145
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,758
gotten from uh from cornbread Ricky or I

146
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,719
forget what his name goes by big Ricky

147
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:17,800
from Swamp boys and uh there were my my

148
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,800
favorite out of all of them was

149
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,639
SF even to this day there's just

150
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,959
uh it works great for my body

151
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,918
chemistry it it it uh never lets me down

152
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,359
it's always just uh takes me to a higher

153
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,359
level doesn't matter how much of it I

154
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,720
smoke it gets me higher and higher each

155
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,000
time just just one and I mean it's been

156
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,880
a good solid shoot since you know the

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,839
early

158
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,839
2000s that uh I've been smoking on it

159
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:50,038
almost on a daily basis and I I still

160
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:52,478
haven't gotten tired of it yeah okay so

161
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,598
where do you think it sits in regards to

162
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,839
the ogs do you think it's one of the

163
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,878
originals or where do you think it it

164
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:03,679
spurts off in the lineage so to speak I

165
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:07,879
think it's just say uh a S1 maybe off

166
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,879
the triangle cush

167
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,799
um yeah probably probably just an S1 off

168
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,240
the triangle you know I'm not too sure

169
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,560
and and uh I I I stopped paying

170
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,280
attention to a lot of the uh the history

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,160
and the background of strains a while

172
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,679
ago it just seems like people were

173
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,120
making up a lot of [ __ ]

174
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,478
and yeah the truth would never really

175
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,079
came out so but

176
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,598
okay well I'm going to have to push you

177
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,918
for one more then because this is the

178
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:39,399
one I'm most interested in I got the

179
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,839
suspicion like most people that triangle

180
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:45,638
is the first but no one can really seem

181
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,519
to elucidate where ghost fits into

182
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,079
things cuz it's like I guess ghost could

183
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,758
maybe be an S1 of triangle and it's kind

184
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,598
of very triangle leaning and that it's

185
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,038
not like lemony like sfv but then I've

186
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,639
heard other people say that maybe it

187
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:05,079
went like triangled to ghost and then

188
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,918
from there ghost SL um you know cuz

189
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:09,279
obviously Oregon kid had it and he did

190
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:12,439
that famous S1 project and then someone

191
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,079
was like what if all of the sfv and the

192
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,680
face off and all of that just came from

193
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,878
that S1 series and I was like that's

194
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,598
that's plausible you know I mean I guess

195
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,158
right right I I know the face off

196
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,079
definitely came off of those uh I

197
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,560
remember when Fletch got those

198
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:31,198
originally um he kicked down a couple of

199
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,918
cuts and uh yeah I'm pretty sure he he

200
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,278
even said there were s1's from uh the

201
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,439
ghost or or maybe it was the cross uh

202
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:41,158
it's been so long it's hard to

203
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,880
remember but you know I I I hear people

204
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:47,200
say lemony with

205
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,360
sfv and I when I grew them all out side

206
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,278
by side I mean it it was really hard to

207
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,759
tell a difference between them like The

208
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,838
Ghost and the Tahoe are almost

209
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,240
identical uh you know even the triangle

210
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,399
there I mean there was just slight

211
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,079
slight little difference is when growing

212
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,919
them all out but just the the high from

213
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:09,199
the sfv and and I mean even the the

214
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,559
flavor just seemed to come out better

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,240
for me you know every grower is

216
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,799
different so I I don't know if I just

217
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,039
have a connection with that plant or

218
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,799
what but yeah okay and then what do you

219
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,919
think about the idea I don't know if it

220
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,000
was an actual grow or if it was a Fus

221
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,599
thing but someone basically put the idea

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,759
forward that they did a similar thing

223
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,399
too they collected them all and they

224
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,720
were like most of them are just the same

225
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,320
cut

226
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
yeah I seen that with the phos I was

227
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,879
just actually just on there a couple

228
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,720
days ago and noticed that there were all

229
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:41,120
but you know with phos who who knows

230
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,120
who's sending what cut in there and and

231
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,879
you know did did they were they able to

232
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,759
trace it back to the you know to the

233
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,439
original person you know so I'm not I'm

234
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,600
not

235
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,959
too until phos gets a a uh legit cut of

236
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,720
everything to to you know like a a

237
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,518
baseline for their Galaxy it's it's

238
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,720
still a little up in the

239
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,919
air yeah well what do you how far off do

240
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,278
you think they are because I I was of

241
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,759
the same mindset and then I was talking

242
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,958
to someone a few days ago and they

243
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,200
listed a whole bunch of cuts that we had

244
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,159
on record had been sent in like for

245
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,240
example uh you know CSI has said that he

246
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:25,679
sent in the chem 91 and purple urle meno

247
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,399
perss and then Noto dog uh sorry yeah

248
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,399
Noto dog is um sent in a few things and

249
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,958
you know what I mean like if you go

250
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,240
through all the Instagram posts online

251
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,000
you can kind of draw up a list of what's

252
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,480
been gathered and when I looked at the

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,200
list I was like that's actually pretty

254
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,680
comprehensive and I'm pretty confident

255
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,800
most of these guys have got the real

256
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,479
ones so I guess it kind of raises the

257
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,199
question at what point would you feel

258
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,399
comfortable with the Galaxy cuz I do

259
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,040
share that same concern but I I now

260
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,879
start to question like it it's looking

261
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,679
kind of complete to me right well you

262
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:58,720
just you just said the two names that I

263
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:01,278
I uh I I trust in those guys um they've

264
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,320
done their their homework both CSI and

265
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:07,480
not so dog they they've uh you know

266
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,800
they've tracked down their their cuts to

267
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:14,000
the to the original Source you know so

268
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:17,359
those guys I I totally trust um totally

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,919
you know believe in their judgment um

270
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,159
and their opinions uh but majority of

271
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,479
the

272
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,838
folks it's hard to say yeah true because

273
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,320
there's a lot of other stuff being sent

274
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,760
in that's just not correct yeah

275
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,360
absolutely absolutely I kind of blanked

276
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,120
on that one all right well let's jump

277
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,839
back for a moment all the way back to

278
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,200
the beginning what was your first

279
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,839
experience with

280
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,680
cannabis um I grew my my old man smoked

281
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,200
I got an older brother older sister uh

282
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,958
so my whole life it's always just been

283
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,920
there um the smell like I I remember

284
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:58,759
that from it's like one of my earliest

285
00:11:53,919 --> 00:12:01,919
memories uh and then I was a latchy kid

286
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:04,278
both my parents worked um so at a young

287
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,719
age and the place I I grew up in the in

288
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,278
San Francisco area and it it was you

289
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,320
know uh low-income

290
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,759
housing um so there was a lot of

291
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,680
everything around it was we didn't

292
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,759
called the ghetto we called it the

293
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,399
get-go because there was just like every

294
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,879
other house was cooking meth in this

295
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,039
neighborhood um it never slept always

296
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,879
Sirens going off so there there was

297
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,958
pretty much just about anything and

298
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,198
everything you can imagine

299
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:35,119
at your fingertips in this

300
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,838
neighborhood so my first experience with

301
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,320
cannabis I was pretty

302
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,639
young um probably like nine or 10 with

303
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,920
the neighborhood kids uh smoked it a

304
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:50,519
couple times never really did

305
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:52,879
anything and then uh

306
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:56,360
my eighth grade

307
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:59,000
year someone had broughten some uh some

308
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,759
some nice green nuggets to school and we

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,159
all smoked out and that was the first

310
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,360
time I ever got really high and I

311
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,919
remember walking uh down the hallway of

312
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,159
the school and like just every step I

313
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,399
took just felt like I was climbing

314
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,838
higher and higher like floating in the

315
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,919
air

316
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,720
um kind it was you know I went to class

317
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:23,240
that day and and that that was a that

318
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,360
was a mistake I should have just cut and

319
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,039
never went

320
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,839
but it rocked my world and then uh fell

321
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:35,399
in love with it it just um put my mind

322
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,880
to ease uh they had put me on like you

323
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,839
know riddlin addd medicine all that

324
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,879
stuff at a young age so the the herbo

325
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,519
has always just been uh I never knew it

326
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,879
at the time but I always self-medicated

327
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,278

to Cali you know every time I was like

378
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,839
this is what I'm going to do this is

379
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:09,198
this is my way out of the ghetto

380
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:11,759
so that was pretty much uh my herb like

381
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:14,958
I you know the beginning of it and then

382
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,278
um came back to California when I was

383
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,278
almost

384
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:23,399
16 and uh just jumped right into it I uh

385
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,198
would there was a a little Park well I'm

386
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,240
not a little park but it's called

387
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:31,318
bionis and uh I rode my bike you would

388
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,360
ride BMX down there and hiked down you

389
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:34,278
know I didn't really know what I was

390
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,519
doing but had some seeds I hiked down

391
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,639
into the creek then I grew him in the

392
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:42,000
shade nothing much really ever came out

393
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,600
of it and then uh one you know the few

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,198
that I did Harvest I ended up drying

395
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,079
them in the trees and turned brown and

396
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,838
moldy and nasty but you know this is the

397
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:55,198
early early 90s it didn't matter it was

398
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,199
uh me being you know 15 16 with some

399
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,679
herb it was pretty nice I was pretty

400
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,838
stoked hell yeah yeah

401
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,918
so what I just wanted to ask before we

402
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,439
move too far past it is when you were

403
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,319
getting that stuff from The rosters was

404
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,439
it ever anything

405
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:14,480
good no it wasn't and they would always

406
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,880
pass it off as like oh Humble County or

407
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,279
this that or the other and what it would

408
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,400
be would be it would be like a little

409
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:24,318
Grand baggie and the outside of it would

410
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,240
be you know brick weed and then in the

411
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,078
middle of it they would pack it full of

412
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,200
stem and Seed like I mean it must have

413
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:34,879
taken a good 30 minutes to package each

414
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,960
one of these things [ __ ] but you know I

415
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,360
just grind it all down and roll it up in

416
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,000
a tobacco leaf and a blunt back then it

417
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:45,359
was the only way I can handle the taste

418
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,558
and you know coming from Cali it was uh

419
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,558
you know where I grew up it it was all

420
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:53,359
just pretty much like the roadkill skunk

421
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:54,319
or cat piss uh we we' barely ever saw

422
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,439
Mexican

423
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:00,038
weed and so going traveling America and

424
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,519
going to like the East Coast I spent

425
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:04,798
some time in the South a little bit and

426
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:06,359
that's all they had it was all just uh

427
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:11,038
the brown

428
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:13,038
frown damn that sucks so yeah so when

429
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:17,759
did you first start growing properly was

430
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:21,798
it when you got back to Cali uh properly

431
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,519
so I got back to Cali uh I was about 16

432
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:27,119
I lived with my folks

433
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:30,519
for few months and then I took off again

434
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:33,918
and then I moved in with uh my pot

435
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:36,119
dealer at the time uh he let me uh C

436
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,799
couch Surf and all I pretty much had to

437
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,558
do was just answer his phone while he

438
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,400
went to work and you know take care of

439
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:43,319
his business while he was gone he let me

440
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,440
stay there for it's probably a good

441
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:51,359
solid year and then from there I moved

442
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,840
in with this uh old ha family they took

443
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,359
me in for about a year and you know I

444
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,119
was doing my thing always uh you know

445
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:03,240
hustling on the side and working odd

446
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:05,759
jobs here and there and

447
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,679
then when I turned

448
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:13,440
18 I was living with this with this girl

449
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,159
and my dealer at the time his name was

450
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,320
his name was Rick we called him tweaker

451
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,880
Rick you know you got early 90s in

452
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:22,558
California everyone uh all the old

453
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,120
cokeheads from the 80s turned to meth in

454
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,319
the 90s so it it was It was kind of

455
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,918
chaotic but anyhow my my pot dealer at

456
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,279
the time he was a tweak so we called him

457
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,400
tweaker Rick and he would do like weird

458
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,359
[ __ ] like he would come over

459
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,559
unannounced you know and be like hey man

460
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,918
I need to talk to you and then he would

461
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:40,759
take me out to his car turn up the music

462
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,480
like as loud as he could and then like

463
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,679
whisper in my ear like you know

464
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,880
everyone's listening to him anyhow uh

465
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,440
tweaker Rick ended up he was getting

466
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,400
herbf fronted as well from another guy

467
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,400
out in Santa Cruz mountains and uh

468
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,880
tweaker Rick ended up getting the great

469
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,880
idea of using this guy

470
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,720
all this guy pot money that he had owed

471
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,840
him to buy Elton John tickets right and

472
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,720
thinking he was going to scalp these

473
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:12,000
tickets in the parking lot and make all

474
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,038
his money back and double it up anyhow

475
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
he didn't sell a single ticket took you

476
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,839
know everybody he knew to see Elton John

477
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,319
and then you know ended up stiff in the

478
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,918
sky in Santa

479
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:27,000
Cruz so his way to pay back the guy in

480
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,120
Santa Cruz was he had introduced him to

481
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,960
me and and you know I I was still paying

482
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:35,319
the tweaker Rick price but now to you

483
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,919
know the source you know so he had

484
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:40,798
gotten his money back that way and after

485
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,000
a while uh we had built a relationship

486
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,279
he got some trust you know in me and he

487
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,400
was like you

488
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,918
know then that's when he told me that he

489
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,720
was grown he invited me over up to the

490
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,000
hills once and I started trimming for

491
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:58,240
them and so at this point I'm

492
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
18 and then uh he asked me one day he

493
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,359
was like you want to come help you know

494
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,960
you want you want to move out here and

495
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,519
help me out and I was like yeah

496
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,240
absolutely and and they were doing a

497
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,279
hydro setup and you know I I didn't know

498
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,960
much I didn't know anything back then to

499
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,960
be honest and they were doing a a rock

500
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,519
wool they were growing in rockwool uh

501
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,079
4-in Rockwall cubes on Rockwall

502
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:24,119
slabs and uh you know like this is

503
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:26,319
before carbon filters or anything like

504
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,199
that in Northern California we had three

505
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,558
Hydra Hydra stores there was one

506
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,798
Berkeley we had one in San Jose and then

507
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,480
we had one in in Santa not Santa Cruz in

508
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:39,759
Sacramento uh I think the only kind of

509
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,278
products were out was maybe uh Earth

510
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,079
Juice and General

511
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:45,960
Hydroponics I don't think there was

512
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:50,199
anything else out at that

513
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,400
time so uh ended up moving to Santa Cruz

514
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,159
was working uh for this

515
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:00,798
guy um like I said in rock wall on the

516
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,159
slabs and they had a cycling system so

517
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:06,158
the nugs never like filled out really

518
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:09,200
good uh you know the climate wasn't all

519
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,240
like gr but it's it's the early 90s so

520
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,278
as long as it didn't have seeds or if it

521
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:18,120
was brown you know it was going and you

522
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:20,599
getting top top dollar for it back then

523
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,199
so the guy I was working with they ended

524
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:27,439
up opening up a hydro store in the Santa

525
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,240
Cruz mountains and so this is yeah early

526
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,180
'90s

527
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:36,599
um no this is mid 90s uh n probably

528
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:42,720
[Music]

529
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:44,639
907 96 or 97 and my boss man uh had a

530
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,720
set up another house with this couple

531
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,559
living inside of it and they had just

532
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,798
opened up a Hydra store in the Santa

533
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,639
Cruz mountains in

534
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:55,440
sakel and the uh the DEA or I don't

535
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,640
think it was yeah maybe it was a DEA

536
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
they ended up following everybody uh

537
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,520
home

538
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,839
that would go to the Hydra store oh no

539
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,599
so it was called operation green fire

540
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:10,359
and they did it to you know I think it

541
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,000
was every Hydra store we had here in

542
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:13,759
Northern California so I mean it wasn't

543
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,640
too many but uh they were following

544
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:20,480
people home and ended up doing massive

545
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,919
raids and whatnot so at that time uh I

546
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,400
was at the grow house um early in the

547
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:28,440
morning my boss man wasn't there and you

548
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,919
know the door gets kicked down and and

549
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,360
you know here comes all these guys

550
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,600
hooting and hollering and whatnot and uh

551
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,918
so ended up getting busted then um my

552
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:42,839
boss man ended up getting uh six months

553
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,880
of work release in the Santa Cruz area

554
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,798
back then which you know for for the

555
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,360
amount that there he was growing I mean

556
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,319
if you were probably like you know in

557
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,599
Southern California or Eastern

558
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,079
California they would have thrown the

559
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:57,558
book at you and given you like five to

560
00:23:54,079 --> 00:24:00,199
10 years but is you know out here you

561
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:02,119
got to know your laws and out here if

562
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,600
you live in the Northern District the

563
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,879
judge back then was very lenient with

564
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,359
the herb where you know the the judge in

565
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,559
the eastern district would would have

566
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,798
just thrown the book at you and you

567
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,678
would have been locked up for a long

568
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,599
long

569
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:17,120
time [ __ ] so that was my first Growing

570
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:19,199
Experience uh real like growing uh

571
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,719
Perpetual Harvest you know they taught

572
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,000
me how to clone

573
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,839
um uh so after we got busted there I

574
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,200
ended up going back to San Francisco

575
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:35,480
area um was doing my thing there

576
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,840
uh and back then I was getting some

577
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,679
really really good herb a indoor herb

578
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:44,000
from Santa Cruz mountains um like I

579
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,759
remember we had some awesome big bud and

580
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,798
Mongolian

581
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,440
indicia what else was there there was

582
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:51,639
one called The Asthma that I've been

583
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,200
looking for but no one's ever heard of

584
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,200
it um

585
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,960
since uh what else was there uh anyhow

586
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,600
so I was doing my thing in the bay um I

587
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,038
had some of the best herb in the bay

588
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,719
during the time and then the the

589
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:10,079
Canadian the Canadian the BC herb

590
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,720
started coming through and prices of

591
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:16,158
herb went from you know uh quality

592
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,440
indoor like wholesale was 4,000 bucks

593
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,000
and then this BC herb started flooding

594
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,640
in and it was going for

595
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,720
$2,000 so now no one wanted the quality

596
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,240
stuff they wanted the cheap cheap cheap

597
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,319
and uh that pretty much ended it for me

598
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,319
out there and then I moved to the Sierra

599
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,240
mountains and that's where I started

600
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:38,558
pursuing my grow uh much more and not

601
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,278
only that I had I had a a uh I had my

602
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,319
first kid then as well so that kind of

603
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:47,240
pushed me into it um I went back to

604
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,240
school uh got a couple jobs you know I

605
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,159
was working full-time and going to

606
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,640
school fulltime and uh was growing a

607
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,760
little herb in the backyard had a eight

608
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:02,038
lighter inside um help you know help get

609
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:04,240
bu and whatnot and at that time so you

610
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,240
know I learned with the rock wools so

611
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,519
that I was growing I I started with the

612
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,440
rock wool and you know just it would

613
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:13,038
just never turn out the way I wanted it

614
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,159
and you know I was taught with a

615
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:18,960
recycling system so the only thing I did

616
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,640
different was I ended up uh ditching the

617
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,120
recycling system and going to a drain to

618
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,000
waste and and that just changed the

619
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,359
whole setup I mean it it was night and

620
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,798
day just it all a sudden just turned out

621
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:33,519
amazing thick buds you know super Frost

622
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,319
I was growing train wreck back then and

623
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:39,158
uh nothing but train wreck for like a

624
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:43,439
good solid three years

625
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:46,320
and and then uh

626
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,120
man a lost track world no that that's

627
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:52,119
that's amazing so far so the question I

628
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:54,038
want to ask first off is were there any

629
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,678
uh like kind of prominent breeders back

630
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:58,119
then or was everyone still super Hush

631
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,360
Hush about everything super super super

632
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,918
Hush Hush super Hush Hush no one ever

633
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,158
knew what you were doing uh you didn't

634
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,840
tell anybody definitely didn't like you

635
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,960
know bring any girlfriends or anything

636
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:13,639
like that around um very very hush hush

637
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,240
you know uh and you know the only thing

638
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,799
you could learn from were the books back

639
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,599
then I mean I had all these high times

640
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,519
and all that stuff ask Ed but uh you

641
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,278
know there was there was nobody to talk

642
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,079
to about about it you know and you know

643
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,558
I had I had friends that were growing

644
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,918
also but they didn't know I was growing

645
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:32,678
and I didn't know they were growing at

646
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,440
the time it was always you know it was

647
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:38,200
really really Hush Hush back then and so

648
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,880
what what was the progression into your

649
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,798
first breeding project and what was like

650
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,480
the first cross you

651
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:49,879
made my first cross I ever made was uh

652
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,759
it was LE leato Uno or something like

653
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,600
that um I forget the name of the seed

654
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,119
leato Uno yeah I think it was leato Uno

655
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,079
or something like that I forget the seed

656
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,759
bank and I had uh there was a string

657
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,839
going around it was called the Blue Dot

658
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,879
um in

659
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,839
California and someone had told me it

660
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,960
was this lato Uno you know and that's it

661
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,398
was just a feno out of that and so

662
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,120
bought a pack of seeds popped them out

663
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:17,918
um didn't know you know really what I

664
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:21,558
was doing I was just playing and ended

665
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:25,120
up T dusting a train wreck with a mail

666
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:28,240
of that and I remember the seeds just

667
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,239
being these tiny tiny tiny little seeds

668
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,079
um which is is a normal characteristics

669
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,278
when you cross anything to train rank

670
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,398
but I thought I [ __ ] it up somehow you

671
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:39,798
know uh so that that was my first real

672
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:43,719
Cross or not real cross but me just

673
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:44,710
playing around and then um I ended up

674
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,519
getting the

675
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,159
[Music]

676
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:51,798
strain in about it was probably like

677
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:55,278
2000 maybe 2002 it was my old high

678
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:56,879
school strain cat piss and you know back

679
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,759
in when I was going to high school

680
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,600
everything was either catpiss or skunk

681
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,798
there was uh we didn't really have names

682
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:05,639
to it at all it was green or brown they

683
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:09,000
called it schwag or dank you know

684
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,159
kbud uh KGB killer

685
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,278
greenbud um so I ended up getting this

686
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,600
cat

687
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:20,079
piss uh founded in my hometown um

688
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:23,000
getting that and and I always thought

689
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,839
the cat piss was related to the roadkill

690
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,558
skunk back in you know in the uh in the

691
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:31,759
90s we the skunk we would always get

692
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:35,278
would be uh it would just be this really

693
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,960
light green barely any hairs and it

694
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,759
would always have these really fat uh uh

695
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,919
Sugar Leaf that would just coat like

696
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:47,599
cocoon the whole bud you know and and uh

697
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,320
so the cat piss is what kind of got me

698
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,319
going really into the breeding thinking

699
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:56,960
that I could find the roadkill inside of

700
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:59,398
it um but it wasn't in there at all it's

701
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,480
just all cat

702
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:05,038
piss so that that's what uh kind of got

703
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,399
me going into it and it was just uh it's

704
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,960
just labor love for

705
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:13,678
me man that's that's going to become a

706
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,679
sound bite just so you know that was so

707
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:23,000
good it's just all cat piss so

708
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:25,240
then so you know I've uh I was blowing

709
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,798
glass for a long time I've always liked

710
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,960
I've always enjoyed creating

711
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:33,918
uh things it's it's the breeding is is

712
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,960
like my art now it's

713
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:42,080
uh you know sort of just creating making

714
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,880
your own strain um digging through

715
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,240
digging through the seeds you know not

716
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,600
knowing what's going to pop up it's it's

717
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,640
super I I love it it's just uh really

718
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:54,278
exciting I love the gamble of it

719
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,880
um I love everything about

720
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:58,319
it yeah no I agree and I think that's

721
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,559
why we should pop more seeds and we're

722
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,759
going to talk about that soon but just

723
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:04,158
to quickly jump back to the cat piss I

724
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,240
noticed uh strains like the cat piss and

725
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,360
including cat piss pop up somewhat

726
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,720
commonly on your Instagram and more

727
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:13,879
importantly a lot of people you know

728
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,159
generally speak quite highly of it yet

729
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,840
it's hard to find and almost no one

730
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,559
really breeds with it why do you think

731
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,959
it fell off if it is kind of getting a

732
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,519
bit of a Resurgence right

733
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,919
now uh it's it's the same thing with

734
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,079
like the roadkill skunk

735
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,880
um well well back then so

736
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,599
mid90s uh like the cat piss that I'm

737
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,440
working with and you got the name

738
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:44,599
catpiss was just uh Loosely thrown on

739
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:48,600
anything that had that smell so the ciss

740
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:51,278
that I have now is a pure Indica but

741
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:53,879
like in in high school we would uh we

742
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,599
would get like a we would either name

743
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,080
the catus from the city we bought it

744
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:00,638
from or from the deal dealer so like we

745
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,480
we had the Nate dog piss we would get

746
00:32:00,638 --> 00:32:05,798
cat piss from the girlr CLA so we called

747
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,319
it the CLA piss uh the cat piss that I

748
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,960
hold right now we would get it from this

749
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:11,480
town called Pittsburgh so we called it

750
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,679
the Pittsburgh piss um there was another

751
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:19,599
one called the Danville piss uh Tom the

752
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:22,038
bomb piss you know uh so and now after

753
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,798
you know growing for so many years I've

754
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:27,839
kind of you know like we the one we'd

755
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,879
get from this guy Nate um it had to be

756
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,638
like a super silver haze or some kind of

757
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,919
haze it was always really Airy really

758
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:38,879
you know really uh skinny um sugar

759
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,720
leaves where like you know a lot of the

760
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,799
other ones would be uh now you know

761
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,919
looking back at it I could tell it they

762
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:48,038
had to be you know indicas of some sort

763
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,360
just because of how fat the Sugar Leaf

764
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:52,960
would cocoon you know just be like one

765
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,719
leaf uh one blade would like cocoon the

766
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,639
whole entire

767
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,880
nugget yeah wow so I've always had like

768
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:04,119
a similar suspicion about cuz I noticed

769
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,200
that on your feed uh purple Inda pops up

770
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,558
and I've always figured that was another

771
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,038
cat piss type thing where it was just

772
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:11,398
like a broad term for many strains do

773
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:14,398
you think that is the case or it was

774
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:17,079
always referring to one cut the the

775
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:19,918
purple Indo has always been the one

776
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:22,398
cut ah see it's almost

777
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,278
counterintuitive yeah um came from the

778
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,398
Pacific

779
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:29,200
Northwest uh now I I have seen the

780
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:32,359
purple Inda here in

781
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:37,120
California but labeled purple

782
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:39,479
kush yeah so you know I I don't know if

783
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,959
the if it's the Garberville Purple Kush

784
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,599
from a long time

785
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,519
ago um I don't know if you know if it

786
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,079
started in Garberville made its way to

787
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,558
the Pacific

788
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,359
Northwest uh what what other names they

789
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,000
call they call it the ultraviolet as

790
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,719
well the purple

791
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,159
Indica um I think it might even have

792
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,720
another name but I just can't can't

793
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,159
remember off the top of my

794
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
head yeah it's so funny you mentioned

795
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,360
that cuz I remember the the first strain

796
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,559
to ever really kind of proper Captivate

797
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:10,559
my attention was indeed the Purple Kush

798
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,960
that was like the the mislabeled purple

799
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,159
Inda and I remember it was the second

800
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,480
time I'd ever smoked like proper good

801
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,280
American weed and there was something so

802
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,480
special about it and looking back on it

803
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,079
one of the first things I think of is

804
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,760
why don't people breed with these or

805
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:27,000
more importantly why don't you see like

806
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,760
s1's of these surely there'd be a demand

807
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,918
you'd

808
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:35,839
think you'd think you know and back in

809
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:39,398
the day before uh Instagram and I guess

810
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:42,039
before you know the oil craze there

811
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:44,358
there was you know this because uh you

812
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,599
know 100% of the market was all buying

813
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:48,279
flowers now it's like you know 50% of

814
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:52,720
the Market's buying flour and the other

815
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:55,839
50% is buying oils now so we lost a lot

816
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,480
of that and then now it's also big uh

817
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,159
you know it's it's what ever the jungle

818
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,079
boys is grown it's what people want and

819
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,598
and uh whatever is all hyped up or

820
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,560
whoever's rapping about what is is just

821
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,039
what the market wants now and and so

822
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:14,239
like a lot of these good Classics are

823
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:15,920
are going extinct and uh people are

824
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,919
missing out there's there's a there's a

825
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,559
lot of great weed but you know they just

826
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,519
want that picture picture perfect uh

827
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,000
herb that's on Instagram that

828
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:27,039
everybody's you know hyping about and

829
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,960
and you know they're they're going to

830
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,920
miss out on a lot of these good stuff

831
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,039
these good Classics that we had also

832
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,000
that that that purple Indica is uh it's

833
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,480
a real finicky plant and it's it's kind

834
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,760
of a pain to grow so I think that's that

835
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,679
was another reason why it never really

836
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,520
picked up like a lot of other strains

837
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:51,318
did yeah okay so in regards to

838
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:54,639
concentrates do you feel like the the

839
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:57,239
growing demand of consumers wanting

840
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,480
things like say Vape cartridges and just

841
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,879
you know dabs whatnot distillates in

842
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,599
general is going to have a negative

843
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,920
impact ultimately on the growing

844
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,160
culture yeah absolutely I absolutely I

845
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,200
think uh I know I know a lot of

846
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,358
Old-Timers you know they have been

847
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:16,039
smoking their whole lives and they don't

848
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:19,000
even smoke flour anymore they just go to

849
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,960
the cartridges now on the pens it's just

850
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,440
uh it doesn't smell for them they could

851
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,358
keep it in their pocket they could puff

852
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,039
it

853
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,759
anywhere uh it it's it's changing it's

854
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,480
changing really really fast the whole

855
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:35,160
the whole uh the whole ganja culture

856
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,358
that we had out here it's uh it's it's

857
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:40,000
definitely going to be a thing in the

858
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:43,519
past I feel like in the next 10 20

859
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,239
years and so how can we raise kind of

860
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,960
this issue in the broader mindset of the

861
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,358
the consumers Community I guess because

862
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,960
I think something which is kind of

863
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:54,400
implied in this whole discussion is that

864
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,639
a lot of the people buying these

865
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,240
cartridges are probably just blow and

866
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,519
they probably you know don't know much

867
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:03,159
about the majority of this do you think

868
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,239
we should try to put some information

869
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:07,719
out there or do you think like it's you

870
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:10,399
know like you can't force someone to be

871
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:12,159
like into something so to speak yeah I

872
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,240
don't think you could force people into

873
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:17,039
you know they people like what they like

874
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,919
and and uh they like things that are

875
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,519
easy and those cartridges are easy like

876
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,240
I said I mean people that have smoken

877
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:25,960
their whole lives or or uh smoking you

878
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:29,118
know flower their whole life or or just

879
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,240
switching over to the pens it blows me

880
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,920
away like and I've tried a couple pens

881
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:34,559
here and there I've tried some that

882
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,159
where they add the fake flavoring and

883
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:40,838
whatnot and you know I ain't gonna lie

884
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:42,960
they tastes good you know it's it's it

885
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:45,358
tastes like candy some of them and it

886
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,400
does kind of work but it's for me it's

887
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,400
it's not my thing you know I I don't

888
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,880
like the dabs I don't like the pens uh

889
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,318
you know I like to roll up a big fatty

890
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,920
and kick back and I like to enjoy it you

891
00:37:55,318 --> 00:38:00,119
know I I I eat I like to eat my food

892
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,599
slow I like to smoke my you know I like

893
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:06,079
to relax with my

894
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:08,880
weed um so the the oil thing in the pens

895
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,760
has never been my jam but even even the

896
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,480
younger generation now um like I know my

897
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,599
my kids friends they always tell me that

898
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,800
they say like you know they've never

899
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,800
smoked herb before they've only taken

900
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:25,599
dabs which just blows me away you

901
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:28,920
know wow yeah with that in mind do you

902
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,039
have to keep this top this type of uh

903
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,920
consumer demand in mind when you breed

904
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,519
do you kind of reluctantly make plants

905
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,240
which might be more inclined to

906
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:42,000
concentrate production or is it an

907
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:44,919
afterthought no it's uh I breed for

908
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,480
myself I always have it's it's uh the

909
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,800
weed that I breed is the weed that I

910
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,519
enjoy smoking um and I mean I guess I

911
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,440
guess the real reason why I started was

912
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:55,960
you know I don't want to lose these like

913
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,679
like you know the roadkill skunk is

914
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,440
completely G gone for the most part and

915
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,239
and you know I I don't want to lose the

916
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,838
OG I don't want it you know 20 years

917
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:07,118
from now it just be completely gone so

918
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,960
pre

919
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:14,039
everything is uh has been I guess the

920
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,280
majority of stuff has been what I enjoy

921
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:19,079
smoking um I like I like uh it's got to

922
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,480
make my mouth water if it doesn't make

923
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,240
my mouth water I don't want anything to

924
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,039
do with it uh and it's got getting high

925
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:28,919
you

926
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:30,400
know yeah two two very good criteria so

927
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,599
going to get into some serious good

928
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,000
stuff here but the first thing I wanted

929
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,920
to throw out I wanted to put you a

930
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,358
little bit off foot here and say that

931
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,760
chem 4 has got to easily be my least

932
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,759
favorite of the chams so it's your job

933
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,520
it's your job to change my

934
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,280
mind

935
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:49,880
well I got a thing that I do with like

936
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:53,800
the sour the sour d and the chem where

937
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:57,720
uh I I lose half my yield but I I I

938
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,519
rootbound them um and when I do that uh

939
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:01,679
you know as long as you can get your as

940
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,239
long as you keep it healthy and and root

941
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,199
bound so I'll grow them out in a one

942
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,719
gallon pot and I'll leave it inside

943
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,358
there you know a veg for a month and

944
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:14,118
then I'll flower them out and what I

945
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:18,799
find is with with both the sourd and the

946
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:24,358
chem4 uh is the buds become much smaller

947
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,960
but much tighter and uh like the the I

948
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:29,920
don't know if it's just like the the

949
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:33,199
potency goes up or what but for my body

950
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,960
chemistry that chem 4 works really well

951
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:39,838
I had gotten the um the chem 91

952
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,559
originally before I got the chem 4 and

953
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:45,759
uh that came straight from skunk V I met

954
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,799
him he was uh doing some work over at my

955
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,800
neighbor's house one day and uh I went

956
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,280
over there and we just started talking

957
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,200
and then you know he had mentioned uh

958
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,920
the the chem

959
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:01,318
91 um the first time I had heard about

960
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,000
the chem 91 was from I think maybe I

961
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:05,440
read it in High Times or something like

962
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,159
that it was going like for $600 an ounce

963
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,240
in New York City uh you know the best

964
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:15,039
weed ever and then the second time I

965
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:20,439
heard about it was I was at a harvest

966
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:24,599
party and um Noto dog was there who else

967
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,599
Jack herrer was there um Kyle

968
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,400
kushman Eddie LEP always at these things

969
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:34,079
too and um at that party talking to Nato

970
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,680
dog he had also mentioned the chem 91

971
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,800
you know and I'm already intrigued now

972
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,559
I'm hearing $600 an ounce in New York

973
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,400
it's the best weed the strongest you

974
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:44,559
know this that and the other and uh you

975
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,039
know I begged him for a cut he was like

976
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,719
no it's you know him and his crew had a

977
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:53,480
pack it wasn't going anywhere so uh you

978
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:55,358
know fast forward to a year or two later

979
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,800
I met skunk VA over at my neighbor's

980
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,239
house and you know he's telling me the

981
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,440
story and then you know similar stories

982
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:05,159
as as Noto dog told me so I knew it was

983
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,720
legit uh and you know he had also told

984
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,000
me he was like you know I've never given

985
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,439
out a cut of this and you know I told

986
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,079
him I was like you know you know I'm

987
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,358
breeding um you know playing around I

988
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,440
was like you know let let me work it and

989
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:22,000
you know I'll give you back every step

990
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,159
of seeds that I make from

991
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,920
it um

992
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:29,159
so

993
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:33,760
so he he ended up uh giving kicking me

994
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:38,440
down a cut uh I grew it out a bunch um

995
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:41,480
my first cross with it was uh I had uh

996
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,838
back cross three the Bubba

997
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,440
cush and then used the mail of that and

998
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:49,358
hit the chem

999
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,519
991 and then from that I think I did

1000
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:55,679
another back Cross of the cham

1001
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:58,599
91 and then at this point I was parting

1002
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,919
a lot during these days so one day I I

1003
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:04,599
took off for like two days and I left my

1004
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,000
seeds out um out of the jar well I left

1005
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:10,559
the jar the lid open and when I came

1006
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
back home the jar was completely emptied

1007
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,839
all all the uh the packages of seeds had

1008
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,920
a little holes in them and there was a

1009
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:20,358
bunch of R uh mouse or rat [ __ ] all over

1010
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,680
it they had eaten like a good like six

1011
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:27,039
seven years of breeding work um [ __ ]

1012
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:28,759
yeah yeah it totally sucks

1013
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,759
but you know I I shared I shared a [ __ ]

1014
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,359
ton of seats a lot of people and you

1015
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,800
know tracked everybody down was like you

1016
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:36,558
know can I get those back can I get

1017
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,160
those back and slowly you know gathered

1018
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:43,599
as much as I could um and then uh

1019
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:46,399
inspecta got

1020
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,200
the chem you know one two 3

1021
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,000
4 and he had kicked those down and I

1022
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:57,358
grew those out and and

1023
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:01,599
uh the chem 91 to me reminds me a lot of

1024
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:04,039
OG so when I had a jar um and this is

1025
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,720
just me this is my my flavor you know my

1026
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:07,800
my taste bud so it's it's not going to

1027
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:11,318
be the same for everybody for but to me

1028
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:14,160
it reminds me a lot of of OG and so when

1029
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:15,480
I had a jar of you know like chem 91 or

1030
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,960
an

1031
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:22,719
sfv I always found myself going towards

1032
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,039
the OG the sfv uh I just found the taste

1033
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,358
better and then and then I got the chem

1034
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:30,318
4 and all those ones and and the chem

1035
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:33,679
4 and like the chem CIS have a real

1036
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:35,519
similar flavor the chem D has a similar

1037
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:37,199
flavor to the chem 4 and the and the

1038
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,920
chem CIS but it's more has more of a

1039
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,838
fuel to it and then the chem 91 just to

1040
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,519
me doesn't smell like any of the other

1041
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:45,239
ones I mean to me it smells and tastes

1042
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:49,119
like

1043
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:51,279
OG so that's when I stopped uh working

1044
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,039
with the chem 91 and actually I started

1045
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,839
with my sfv project at that point and

1046
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:01,400
ended up going with the chem 4 I didn't

1047
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:04,279
have the CIS or the D at that time um

1048
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,440
and so I started working the chem 4 and

1049
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,920
I I don't know what it is about it it's

1050
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,440
just one of those ones that it when you

1051
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,200
when you get it right it it uh I mean

1052
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,318
I've seen a lot of shitty examples uh of

1053
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:18,118
it and a lot of people like uh I don't

1054
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:21,480
know the buds just get real fluffy or

1055
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,400
they burn it you know it's um but when

1056
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:27,039
you get it right man for for me it's

1057
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,880
just I love that taste I don't know

1058
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:32,480
yeah okay so the first thing we have to

1059
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,160
loop back to you said uh inspector

1060
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,159
kicked you some cuts of the chem one

1061
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:39,239
through to four and you grew him

1062
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:42,318
out uh yeah I I

1063
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:44,879
remember I remember the

1064
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:48,480
three maybe I didn't get the one and the

1065
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,760
two or maybe I did I it's been so long

1066
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,480
um but I all I remember I think the I

1067
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,079
you know I can't remember the the ones

1068
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,800
but the the four was the one I like the

1069
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,519
best out of all of

1070
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:05,240
them I remember one being more OG style

1071
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:07,358
it grew more of a Vine um do you

1072
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:08,959
remember it being sativa cuz that's the

1073
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,358
commonly said thing that like one of

1074
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,639
them was quite sativa I think it was

1075
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:16,880
either one or two I don't remember I I

1076
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:21,239
can't remember at all it's been so long

1077
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,680
ago okay so you you mentioned that um at

1078
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:26,000
that point you started working on the

1079
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,639
sfv line as well as you know having that

1080
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,599
in with skunk VA that's really

1081
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:32,239
interesting cuz I wanted to ask cuz um

1082
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,838
he's he's not the type of guy who like

1083
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,000
you know often says people's names

1084
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,759
unless like you know he knows you're

1085
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,559
cool but he had he had kind of told me

1086
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,839
that same story you had told me but just

1087
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,599
without actually saying names so I guess

1088
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:47,199
that would mean that uh you are the kind

1089
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,480
friend who donated the uh the sfv BX

1090
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:53,399
line that he's started his backcross

1091
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:58,000
project with yeah yeah yeah I gave him

1092
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:00,240
uh so he gave me the cut um we chilled

1093
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,280
for you know hang out with him for about

1094
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,879
a year after that and then uh you know

1095
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:10,119
life just got busy he got busy and we

1096
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:13,599
lost contact for several years and then

1097
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:17,519
probably about four years ago we had met

1098
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:22,119
up at the emerald cup um and at that

1099
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:24,159
point you know I had uh I had I had I

1100
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:26,760
think I was pretty much done with my

1101
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:29,358
chem 4 line at that point right so I

1102
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,880
gave him every step of the breeding

1103
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:34,960
process of of all the chems that I had

1104
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:39,039
made um you know I had lost a lot of the

1105
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:41,240
chem 91 stuff early stuff from the mice

1106
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:44,719
but uh G gave them what I could and at

1107
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:49,558
that same time um I had just finished

1108
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:55,279
making uh sfv back cross 2os and I also

1109
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:56,480
had did a uh back cross one uh f2s as

1110
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,240
well

1111
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,400
um and you know I hadn't I hadn't grown

1112
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:03,239
him out but I just gave it to him um to

1113
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,039
see what he had thought and then uh yeah

1114
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:09,279
but I think the the sfv backcross twos

1115
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,079
that he's working with were uh from the

1116
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,359
seeds that I had given

1117
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:16,400
him yeah fantastic and I remember

1118
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,318
initially when skunk VA said to me that

1119
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,119
he felt the sfv or maybe broadly

1120
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:24,159
speaking the OG was a good partner to

1121
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:26,240
complement the chem 91 in terms of like

1122
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,399
starting a back Crossing project

1123
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:28,959
it was something that I hadn't really

1124
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,639
heard expressed at the time you know

1125
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,280
especially because in the past a lot of

1126
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:36,799
Cam back cross projects like if you look

1127
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,160
at uh JJ or even Rez they just use land

1128
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,960
race afghanis so I was almost expecting

1129
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:43,078
him to say something like that would be

1130
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,960
what he would use so when he said oh no

1131
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,640
I've gone with this sfv OG BX it was a

1132
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,480
little it threw me off kilter a little

1133
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,598
bit but I guess at the same time it's

1134
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,079
exactly the same thing you've been

1135
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:54,680
saying this whole interview of like how

1136
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,559
OG and kemma really quite similar and

1137
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:59,598
complimentary

1138
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:02,400
right right right yeah you know like I

1139
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:06,000
said uh I think they're totally related

1140
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,079
um you know I I I've always felt the OG

1141
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,838
came from the uh the

1142
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:16,400
91 you know maybe from a bag seed

1143
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:18,078
or yeah or or something like that but uh

1144
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,519
yeah I think they complement each other

1145
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:24,280
very well um you know to the sfv by far

1146
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:27,920
is probably my favorite strain of all

1147
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,640
times but uh so you can't can't really

1148
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,880
go wrong with that at all and then

1149
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:36,358
everything you know even that when I

1150
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:39,920
cross uh to the sfv the actual clone um

1151
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:43,159
it it's similar to the 91 it packs a

1152
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:46,720
punch it brings the potency way up on on

1153
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:48,838
anything you uh pollinate it

1154
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,358
with yeah for sure that's that's

1155
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:53,400
something we definitely hear commonly

1156
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:56,318
spoken about so one thing I do have to

1157
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,720
kind of ask and get it out of the way

1158
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:01,318
why is South folk seeds using your chem

1159
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:04,759
for IBL as

1160
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:06,798
well uh not only there's been uh quite a

1161
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,799
few seed companies that uh I've given

1162
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:13,559
seeds to before they even had a seed

1163
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:15,519
company and you know um it it breeds

1164
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,760
well I I I put my you know I put my

1165
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,199
heart and soul into these seeds and and

1166
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,920
uh you know I try everything out if if

1167
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:24,439
it does you know if the cross didn't

1168
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,480
work I go back you know I start over

1169
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,318
until until I'm happy with the

1170
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,000
results uh I'm very selective with my

1171
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:33,639
with my breeding I know a lot of people

1172
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,079
disagree with it but I'm I'm one male

1173
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:39,679
one female um you know I reverse I

1174
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,920
reverse all my males so I can see what

1175
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,919
kind of turps they got um when I was

1176
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,798
able to go to the labs I could get them

1177
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,680
tested and and like so you know if I

1178
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:51,679
select like out of a run you know let's

1179
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,279
I I'll select like four or five males

1180
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:57,199
that I find that you know has got what I

1181
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,400
like and and then I'll cross each male

1182
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,279
to its own female of the you know the

1183
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,200
same exact clone so let's just say the

1184
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,000
chem 4 line uh so i' pick you know you

1185
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:08,558
know four or five of the chem4 males

1186
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,880
that I liked and then I would cross each

1187
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,240
male to its own chem4 clone and then I

1188
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,680
would grow all those out and that now I

1189
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:20,078
can pinpoint like you know what male did

1190
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:24,159
what and and you know like uh my my the

1191
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:25,680
sfv I've been working on um that OG's is

1192
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:27,679
probably one of the hardest strains I've

1193
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,838
worked on trying to get that that flavor

1194
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:32,399
out of it and and there's been times

1195
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:37,318
where you know I found a full-blown OG

1196
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:40,079
mail smells um just like OG but when I

1197
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:42,960
back cross it it comes out this like

1198
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:46,480
water like watered down OG almost like a

1199
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,639
wet cardboard taste and smell to it um

1200
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,400
so you know not always does it work out

1201
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:54,679
but uh for the most part I'm able to cut

1202
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,240
out all the guess work when reversing

1203
00:51:54,679 --> 00:52:00,358
the males

1204
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:03,959
yeah and uh so I mean the line's very

1205
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:07,400
stable you know every seed comes out uh

1206
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:11,440
chem dog with that chem 4 um and then

1207
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:14,559
you know for breeding purposes it's uh

1208
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,318
you know depending on what your goal is

1209
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,160
uh it's it's a it's a good start you

1210
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:21,400
know the the seeds are totally stable so

1211
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:23,039
you're not going to get you know a bunch

1212
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,119
of different variation throughout the

1213
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:30,159
seeds and and uh

1214
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:31,880
you know I I never I never wanted to the

1215
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,519
seed making has always just been for

1216
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:37,039
myself it's it's my hobby it's it's what

1217
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:39,719
I enjoyed doing I I never intended to

1218
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:42,119
come out with a seed company and then

1219
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:45,558
seeing all these people

1220
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:48,079
uh using my seeds to start up a seed

1221
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:52,280
company um kind of you know a little

1222
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,000
fire in my ass and and push me to uh uh

1223
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,640
you know come out with my own seeds you

1224
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,159
know I'm spending th tens of thousands

1225
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,598
of dollarss on

1226
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,440
electricity um you know making these

1227
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:04,359
lines and whatnot and then I'm seeing

1228
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,720
all these other guys profiting off of

1229
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:11,318
off my work and some of them give me

1230
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:14,358
credit some of them don't um you know

1231
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:16,599
the this whole breeding world it's kind

1232
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:19,199
of a shady industry to be honest with

1233
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:22,480
you I'm not a a big fan and and I don't

1234
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,879
know how much longer I got it in me uh

1235
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,079
some of the things these people are

1236
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,358
doing is just just so unethical and just

1237
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:32,599
downright

1238
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:34,480
Shady um so I don't know South Fork uh

1239
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:35,880
you know they must like the stuff and

1240
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,400
they went with

1241
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,798
it yeah and so is that the Diplomatic

1242
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,639
answer or like you don't mind if

1243
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:45,599
someone's using kind of like the same

1244
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:47,000
mail that you're using at the same time

1245
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,359
uh you know they're not using the same

1246
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,239
exact male I I gave them a handful of

1247
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:55,119
seeds but uh you know the seed Line's

1248
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:56,838
totally consistent so it's like any

1249
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,920
knucklehead can pop out 10 of these

1250
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:00,519
seeds and and you're going to find chem

1251
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,639
dog they're all going to be chem dog

1252
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:08,559
males so it's not like uh yeah no I get

1253
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:12,639
you definitely so you know so at what

1254
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:16,319
point did you decide to start 707 seed

1255
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:20,279
bank um I think it was

1256
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:22,679
uh ins inspector and little Hill

1257
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,798
Farms were just kept on pushing me they

1258
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,159
were just like you know uh all all these

1259
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:29,480
guys that you they were like stop giving

1260
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:32,159
out your seeds because everybody had

1261
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,240
been giving the seeds out uh to had

1262
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:37,239
started up a seed company you know

1263
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:41,399
there's South Fork

1264
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:45,639
um uh you know who else uh skunk VA with

1265
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:50,039
that with the uh with the

1266
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:53,318
SF um I know I know uh uh Swamp Boy

1267
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:54,880
seeds use uh some white diesel seeds I

1268
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:56,318
had given them in some of their in one

1269
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,680
of their

1270
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:01,039
crosses um who else is there there's a

1271
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:04,239
couple uh guy in

1272
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:07,199
Oregon uh what has he

1273
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:10,679
got chronic culture or something like

1274
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:13,199
that um I know he used the uh the cat or

1275
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:15,798
the um the chem dogs in his

1276
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,960
line uh there's another guy I don't want

1277
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:20,798
to mention their name but um I had

1278
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,639
traded seeds to him he's you know he

1279
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:25,159
gave me the whole oh I got the roadkill

1280
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:28,358
skunk it came from you know menes you

1281
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:31,318
know Joe this that or the other traded

1282
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:34,519
him seeds and uh you know I grew out all

1283
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:36,480
of his seeds they must have been um from

1284
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:39,119
some brick weed that he had picked out

1285
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,079
it was just crazy long sativas and

1286
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:44,880
whatnot and that guy ended up coming out

1287
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:47,318
with this uh a seed company and using my

1288
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,119
chems using the chem 4 but he had

1289
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:52,079
switched the name to like chem deer

1290
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,160
something like that but um if you look

1291
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,359
at the guy the guy's pictures were

1292
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,199
obviously km for and not only that like

1293
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:02,639
I'd given them the breakdown of how I

1294
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:04,960
made the seed line and instead of uh uh

1295
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:05,798
you know using the Bubba back cross 3

1296
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,119
chem

1297
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:13,079
91 as my first uh as the first donor he

1298
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:16,318
had switched up the name from Bubba back

1299
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:20,640
cross 3 to uh heirloom Afghan cross to

1300
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:23,599
chem 91 cross to uh Kem and then he's

1301
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:26,078
changed the chem 4 to chem but um so

1302
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,798
that was just kind of I mean it's it's

1303
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,318
very flattering I'm I'm I'm really

1304
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:32,000
honored that these people uh like to you

1305
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:35,400
know think think the seeds are good

1306
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,519
enough to use and uh breeding projects

1307
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,119
but at that point I was just like you

1308
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:43,079
know um maybe I got something here you

1309
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:45,680
know my so that that's when I decided to

1310
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:48,920
come out and do my own thing you know

1311
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:52,639
I'm I'm My Own I'm my worst critic

1312
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:56,680
uh so everything uh I mean I got I got a

1313
00:56:52,639 --> 00:57:00,000
a refrigerator full of seeds that uh you

1314
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:02,639
know won't ever release or uh you know I

1315
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,039
just give them out um but it just they

1316
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:08,000
just didn't reach my standard or or you

1317
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:11,400
know and there's a lot of strains where

1318
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,559
you know like like the cat piss uh uh I

1319
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:17,639
I tried Crossing males to the actual

1320
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,720
clone but the uh the traits that I was

1321
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:22,199
looking for like the ciss flavor and the

1322
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:24,000
smell would have never transfer through

1323
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:26,000
it was more the structure so then that's

1324
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,159
when I was like okay I got to make this

1325
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,440
cat piss into a male form and then try

1326
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:35,318
to hit these other clones to you know

1327
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,159
boost the potency up on it um you got to

1328
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:40,558
remember the weed back in like you know

1329
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:42,199
late 80s early 90s uh doesn't compare to

1330
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,280
the weed that we have now just like you

1331
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:47,519
know the really oldtimers where they're

1332
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:50,400
always like uh oh the aapco gold or the

1333
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:52,759
Panama Red or you know this side or the

1334
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,318
other oh it was the best weed ever back

1335
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,920
in the day you know I mean if you grow

1336
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:59,679
it out now it's like you know you smoke

1337
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,400
a couple joints and you try to give it

1338
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:03,239
away to people and then they don't want

1339
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,880
it and it ends up getting thrown

1340
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:08,479
away you know it just doesn't compare to

1341
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:13,160
the weed nowadays and

1342
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:15,440
so yeah for sure so one of the strains

1343
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:18,118
that I think is possibly most well known

1344
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,960
from your Work Cush cleaner give us a

1345
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:25,880
little bit of a background on it uh the

1346
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,039
Kush cleaner actually um

1347
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,358
the the original cross was made by

1348
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:32,880
somebody else it was is by this really

1349
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:38,000
great guy his name is Lauren really

1350
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:42,880
sweet guy um uh and he was breeding for

1351
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:46,519
motor Rebel for a while and uh he when

1352
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,000
he gave me the seeds um he called it

1353
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:52,480
long bottom

1354
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,480
leaf and uh it was just an awesome

1355
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,358
awesome producer outside uh finished

1356
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:01,639
fairly early middle of October huge huge

1357
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:05,038
light green buds almost had an indoor

1358
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:08,279
but it it's really high in like merine

1359
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:10,000
um kind of that train wrecky flavor and

1360
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,200
like I was saying I had grown that train

1361
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,760
wreck for so many years straight and

1362
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:18,679
smoked it for so many years uh you know

1363
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,760
nothing but it that that flavor um and

1364
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:22,038
that smell that tarpine profile just

1365
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,200
kind of makes me

1366
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:29,520
cringe but everybody else loved the uh

1367
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:31,519
long bottom Leaf but they hated the name

1368
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,798
and every year you know I'd go back to

1369
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,599
Lauren I'd be like hey you know I need I

1370
00:59:33,798 --> 00:59:38,440
need a few more hundred seeds you know

1371
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:41,519
so he he was just like take the mail

1372
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:44,280
make your own um so he gave me the cut

1373
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:46,440
of uh he's a Jax cleaner

1374
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,640
male um so he gave me the cut of the

1375
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:53,400
mail uh ended up making my own

1376
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:56,519
seeds and um hit you know hit the sfv

1377
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:59,440
with it uh I also hit this Blockhead

1378
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:01,318
that I had grown out for years and years

1379
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,358
actually the blockhead is what I had

1380
01:00:01,318 --> 01:00:08,000
grown before I started growing the Kush

1381
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:12,038
cleaner as as a a major outdoor

1382
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,400
crop um potent potent potent this the

1383
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:18,720
the male was just a stud anything he

1384
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:22,119
touched just became huge uh but it also

1385
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:25,439
gave off that that Jack mercing um

1386
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:29,280
flavor and smell to everything attached

1387
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:32,760
so uh yeah anyhow Lauren gave me the

1388
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:35,440
mail I ended up making my own seeds uh

1389
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:38,520
the name long bottom Leaf wasn't really

1390
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,639
flying so a bunch of my trimmers you

1391
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:42,239
know they were like call a Kush cleaner

1392
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:46,078
and then that's when the name stuck to

1393
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:50,399
it uh but but not it's not my uh you

1394
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:53,280
know I I just recreated uh the seeds but

1395
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,200
um not my you know it wasn't my work at

1396
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:59,920
all it was it definitely all came from

1397
01:00:55,199 --> 01:01:04,798
Lauren and then maybe a good 10 years

1398
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:10,760
ago uh Lauren had lost the mail and then

1399
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:14,440
um my I had also lost the mail so he uh

1400
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:17,720
he then got some more Jack cleaner seeds

1401
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:20,559
and recreated it um but calls it now

1402
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:22,759
just uh calls it long bottom rather than

1403
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,160
the long bottom Leaf so you know it's

1404
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:28,520
not uh The Identical or anything like

1405
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:30,759
that as as the original one but um still

1406
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:33,440
I'm sure it's it's pretty

1407
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:37,720
good yeah wow that's that's a really

1408
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:40,720
cool story as a bit of a side note I um

1409
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:42,759
I think I tried that newer one cuz I

1410
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:46,318
think could be wrong here but I think he

1411
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:49,240
had to use the ja cleaner 2 instead of

1412
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:51,679
the original one just due to what TJ is

1413
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:53,919
releasing yeah yeah yeah that's exactly

1414
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,399
what had happened yeah man that's such a

1415
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:59,278
small world because I actually he ended

1416
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:03,000
up making a little freebie project where

1417
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:05,119
it was that new one he made that male uh

1418
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,199
cross to Gorilla Glue it's just like a

1419
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,240
freebie because you know like little

1420
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:11,838
hype thing I got some yeah I got some of

1421
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,959
those seeds grew them out found an all

1422
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:16,199
right leaning female and then crossed it

1423
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,679
to this choba but oh my God it tapped

1424
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:20,278
into that long bottom and it's just

1425
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:23,118
amazing so it was so funny just hearing

1426
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:25,318
you talk all about that oh right on

1427
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:28,440
right on yeah and then I don't know if

1428
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:32,038
Lauren still breeds with uh is still

1429
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:37,200
breeding for motor Rebel but I I know he

1430
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:40,319
he had also used uh uh the chem4 the my

1431
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:43,679
seed line of chem4 in some of his lines

1432
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:47,239
and he had also used uh a pineapple

1433
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:49,440
tie in some of his in some of his work

1434
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:51,759
there but I'm not too sure if he had

1435
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:55,240
released him with motor Rebel or

1436
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,640
not yeah okay well I mean either way

1437
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:58,159
interesting we'll have to dive into it

1438
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,679
later I want to ask you about the

1439
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:01,399
pineapple tie because this is on the

1440
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,719
website and it's so interesting to me

1441
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,400
because you don't often hear about

1442
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,598
pineapple tie you know like I mean

1443
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,519
chocolate cherry Thai stick these are

1444
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:11,160
all the commonly spoke about ones was

1445
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,079
pineapple a rare one or is there a bit

1446
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:15,318
more of a story behind it than it's just

1447
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:19,680
simply a pineapple TI land

1448
01:03:15,318 --> 01:03:21,759
race uh I I'm the I got the Clone um

1449
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:24,879
it's it's a cut that's been going around

1450
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:28,880
Menino for quite a few years

1451
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:32,920
now um so it came to me as a clone only

1452
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:34,960
string and uh but work working through I

1453
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,480
mean it it smells and tastes just like

1454
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:41,519
pineapples it's I mean a strong order

1455
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:43,719
odor of pineapple but when I was uh

1456
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:46,880
working it into seed

1457
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:50,239
line there's definitely uh some Haze

1458
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,278
inside there um that that you know that

1459
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,038
just that

1460
01:03:51,278 --> 01:03:56,559
spicy uh I don't know how to describe

1461
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,720
the Haze but just that classic Haze

1462
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:02,278
smell like uh have you ever tried the

1463
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:06,679
nl5 haze back in the day or the cough or

1464
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:08,519
yeah see the dog [ __ ] um I don't know

1465
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:10,038
some people disagree with me and I could

1466
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:11,880
totally be wrong but I I've always

1467
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:14,799
thought like the Colorado cough and the

1468
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,760
Pacific Northwest dog [ __ ] it were all

1469
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:17,599
just Northern Light five haze just you

1470
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:21,200
know

1471
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:25,798
renamed um but there was definitely some

1472
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:29,278
of that inside there uh big plant um

1473
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:33,759
indoors it's real light green uh but

1474
01:04:29,278 --> 01:04:37,519
just like I said a strong strong ripe

1475
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:40,559
pineapple um with with a slight hazy you

1476
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:42,239
know aftertaste to it um makes my mouth

1477
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,839
water every time just even talking about

1478
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,118
it right now I'm starting to salivate a

1479
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:49,078
little

1480
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:52,200
bit that's how you know it's a good

1481
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:54,278
herb so just some of the other strains

1482
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:56,199
which kind of caught my eye off you you

1483
01:04:54,278 --> 01:04:59,239
know that were on the front page of the

1484
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:00,879
site the UK cheese this is one which

1485
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:03,278
doesn't get a mention anymore for the

1486
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,559
most part and most people are aware you

1487
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:07,480
know it kind of comes from the skunk

1488
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,880
number one stock and I think some people

1489
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,240
may be regarded as a bit weaker imp

1490
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,440
potency like kind of like a bit of a

1491
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:15,519
strain of yester year as DJ Short would

1492
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,480
say do you think do you think people are

1493
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:22,480
missing the boat with this

1494
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:26,400
one uh you know again it's it it isn't

1495
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:29,039
as potent as the weed is today um but

1496
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,559
man that you know that flavor to it is

1497
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,520
just unreal I mean some some people are

1498
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:36,680
really turned off on it and some people

1499
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:43,079
really like it I myself um really like

1500
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:44,960
it and uh so that that one um actually

1501
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,480
came out really turned out really good

1502
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,278
with that chem dog because the chem dog

1503
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:53,639
uh gave it a little bit uh an extra kick

1504
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:55,639
to it added some potency and lightened

1505
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:58,558
up the color color a little bit on it

1506
01:05:55,639 --> 01:06:01,078
but for the most part it it's uh it ret

1507
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,920
it retained all that cheese flavor and

1508
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:07,278
even the structure of the plant is is uh

1509
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:10,358
mostly cheese but with the chem dog just

1510
01:06:07,278 --> 01:06:14,278
it did add some um potency which was

1511
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:16,119
definitely needed in it but like I don't

1512
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:18,278
know that that the taste of that cheese

1513
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:22,160
I mean I love it I love it I can't get

1514
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:24,519
enough of it so this might sound like a

1515
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:26,798
bit of a silly question but

1516
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:29,119
the the exact source of the skunk that

1517
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,440
the UK cheese comes from a little bit

1518
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,640
ambiguity because obviously you know

1519
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,920
skunk's been offered by a lot of

1520
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:35,960
different seed banks at a lot of

1521
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:39,760
different times do you think it was from

1522
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:42,480
the uh you know widely regarded as less

1523
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,880
ideal sweeter skunk stock or probably

1524
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,240
from the earlier

1525
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:50,880
stuff I think it was from the earlier

1526
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:55,439
stuff um the the the the later stuff of

1527
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:58,240
skunk number one to me always had a uh

1528
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:02,039
perfumey smell to it a sweeter

1529
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:05,000
perfume um where where this one is just

1530
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:08,720
uh I mean I've never tasted herb like

1531
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,639
this from anything else it's so

1532
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:13,919
um I don't know I don't know it's just

1533
01:07:11,639 --> 01:07:16,358
it's it's special it's special that the

1534
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,039
tur profile off of it is just

1535
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:21,400
unreal yeah for sure I remember I had a

1536
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:23,319
a cheese S one before that was insane so

1537
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:27,000
I can only imagine the original was just

1538
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:29,038
the icing on the cake with that so

1539
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,880
something I did want to run by I noticed

1540
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,920
not only on the website but also on my

1541
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,318
Instagram a fair few times I've seen

1542
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,440
lava cake pop up and what I wanted to

1543
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:38,759
ask was obviously give us a bit of a

1544
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,720
rundown on lava cake but more

1545
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,520
importantly what do you think it is

1546
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:45,480
about the cookies and chem combo that's

1547
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:47,199
so alluring to people do you think it's

1548
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,920
purely a hype thing cuz I think it's

1549
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:50,759
beyond that cuz I you know I think

1550
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:53,960
there's too many cookie and chem hybrids

1551
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,960
that work for people to just be doing it

1552
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,480
for like a market reason you know do you

1553
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,278
think it works well and what about them

1554
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:03,440
do you think Blends well together it it

1555
01:08:00,278 --> 01:08:08,199
works well the um the chem male that I

1556
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:11,318
use uh is a blank male um meaning the uh

1557
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:14,719
the females completely take over the

1558
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:18,158
cross uh rarely do I get in any of like

1559
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:21,158
the uh the chem crosses um will you get

1560
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:23,960
that chem uh flavor or structure or

1561
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:24,759
anything with with the mail that I have

1562
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:30,079
I've been

1563
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:33,359
using um so with the lava cake uh I used

1564
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,640
the thin mint with that cross and when

1565
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:39,640
when I grew all those out like I got

1566
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:41,759
every single feno of uh cookies

1567
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:44,159
imaginable I got that short little

1568
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,719
Indico which is like the

1569
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:49,599
ogkb um I got like you know the the

1570
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:53,560
lanky one like the Forum and then I got

1571
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,640
the you know a nice big yielding um like

1572
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:59,319
the like the thin mint and then a few

1573
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:02,000
others I think out of uh I did a big run

1574
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:03,880
of them inside of a greenhouse and out

1575
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,158
of all of them there was only one that

1576
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,640
ended up being a light green like

1577
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,318
something I hadn't seen before but um

1578
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:14,560
there's definitely some interesting

1579
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:18,120
stuff in that lava cake and and uh you

1580
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,920
know the the name uh I I just uh had

1581
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:22,198
somebody on Instagram pick out the name

1582
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,960
for me um did like a you know a little

1583
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:26,879
contest but I know there's quite a few

1584
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:30,079
different breeders now that actually use

1585
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,920
that uh the lava cake name um I don't

1586
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:34,920
know if if I don't know if they use it

1587
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,279
first or I did it's it's there's so many

1588
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,000
breeders out there it's hard to keep

1589
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:40,880
track of now of all the different names

1590
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,119
oh it's it's almost easier just to go

1591
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,880
with h instead of naming a strain just

1592
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:48,798
just write down the lineage of what it

1593
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,719
is and let it be that yeah yeah know I

1594
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:51,880
know what you

1595
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:53,759
mean the last thing I wanted to kind of

1596
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,079
probe into in regards to the lava with

1597
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:59,238
was you say it uses the thin mint cut

1598
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:00,519
this is of curiosity to me because you

1599
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:01,919
know of all the people we've asked on

1600
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,560
the show we still can't really get a

1601
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,880
solid ruling on what the thinman is if

1602
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,960
it was the original how does it differ

1603
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,039
to The Forum really and you know overall

1604
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:15,399
what do you think cookies

1605
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:18,800
is uh definitely OG definitely has some

1606
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:23,158
kind of OG I think um I think

1607
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,440
any you know my I think any new strain

1608
01:10:23,158 --> 01:10:28,238
out

1609
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:32,039
now um to to meet the

1610
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:34,439
uh you know modern day criteria of you

1611
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:35,960
know their potency and all this stuff I

1612
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:38,639
think it all need all has to have a

1613
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:40,920
little OG mixed into it to to get that

1614
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:44,679
that potency up to to

1615
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:48,359
today's you know um up to par to today's

1616
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:52,279
weed so uh defin definitely

1617
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:55,679
some o cookie or OG inside there the

1618
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:58,559
whole uh Durban thing thing um yeah I

1619
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:01,520
don't buy that one bit uh I don't see

1620
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,520
any bit of Durban inside there at all

1621
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,719
I've grown out every single Seed Company

1622
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:10,560
there was that had Durban and they all

1623
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:13,880
have a very strong uh what is it

1624
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,239
trolene um fluffy buds you know Out

1625
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:19,520
outdoors they would always finish

1626
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:21,678
extremely early but uh yeah I I don't

1627
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,199
know and I I've talked to these the

1628
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:26,079
cookie guys before

1629
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:28,119
and each one kind of gives me a

1630
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:30,960
different story so I don't even think

1631
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:32,960
they know oh man that was the other

1632
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,840
question can we trust anything that

1633
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,239
comes at a camp cookie

1634
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:43,560
fam yeah yeah yeah you know um I I I

1635
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:46,559
trust CSI humble I trust not so dog

1636
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:49,320
that's about it uh you know I don't know

1637
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,760
and you know I I don't know I don't keep

1638
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:54,198
track to all these people out now or or

1639
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,920
anything like that

1640
01:11:54,198 --> 01:11:58,839
so I've been uh I've been fed a lot of

1641
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:03,440
[ __ ] I've been fed a lot of fake

1642
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:05,199
cuts uh and a lot of fake ass seeds so

1643
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:09,198
it's kind of just left me to this point

1644
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:12,079
where uh I do my thing um I I enjoy

1645
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:14,359
talking to inspecta about breeding and

1646
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:16,439
this that and the other uh you know we

1647
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:20,079
have we have different taste buds in

1648
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:23,238
herb uh but you know it works out well

1649
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,079
um I I can run stuff off of him and uh

1650
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:27,479
you you know he he does he does the

1651
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:29,679
homework and finds out you know about

1652
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:32,519
this that and the other so it's it's

1653
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:35,440
always nice to pick his brain and and

1654
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:39,080
see what's what but you know grow

1655
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:40,919
growing out all the durans the yeah I

1656
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:41,679
don't I don't see that one bit inside

1657
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,279
the

1658
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:49,199
cookies um yeah you know I I've grown

1659
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:51,920
strains in the past uh uh some Dutch

1660
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:54,079
stuff that had cookies profile you know

1661
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,880
little buds lanky l

1662
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:56,519
uh

1663
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,159
plants

1664
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:03,440
um but as as for the

1665
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:04,719
uh the genetic makeup of of the cookies

1666
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,319
I couldn't tell

1667
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,880
you yeah I I'd have to agree with like

1668
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:11,359
everything you said there especially the

1669
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,960
durb and having been able to smoke a bit

1670
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:15,479
of it myself and see the growth

1671
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,239
structure of it and whatnot I think it's

1672
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:19,638
totally overrated like the the

1673
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:21,919
percentage of what people say it could

1674
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:24,800
be in there and another little funny

1675
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:27,039
little side note like when you said uh

1676
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,039
you enjoy talking to Prof inspector you

1677
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,840
know he does his homework I was like

1678
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:33,319
that's that I remember I made that exact

1679
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,119
comment to him at um Emerald cup and he

1680
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:37,079
just looks at me and goes do you ever

1681
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,399
wonder why they call me inspector he

1682
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:42,039
just walks

1683
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:45,359
off laugh so

1684
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:47,238
hard yeah he does his homework so I

1685
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,039
guess to summarize it all up you know

1686
01:13:47,238 --> 01:13:50,319
we've speculated on the genetics of

1687
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,000
cookies and we were talking about

1688
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:55,479
cookies and cam what is your speculation

1689
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,119
on the genetics of

1690
01:13:55,479 --> 01:14:00,718
chem the the

1691
01:13:58,119 --> 01:14:03,679
chem yeah what do what do you

1692
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,279
reckon uh definitely you know after

1693
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:09,119
growing out those Hermes seeds that I

1694
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:11,719
had gotten from skunk VA uh you know I

1695
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:13,000
think some kind of it's definitely HJ

1696
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:16,800
pod of

1697
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,439
stuff um definitely see that like a

1698
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,639
Pakistani style something in there some

1699
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:24,238
kind of

1700
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:26,880
indicia uh but

1701
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:31,039
you know who knows who

1702
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,800
knows okay so another strain from kind

1703
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,479
of the old school which no one can

1704
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,719
really give me too much info on but I

1705
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,718
got a hunch you're going to be the one

1706
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:39,760
to do it old Betsy can you give us any

1707
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:45,279
story on

1708
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:47,480
her uh old Betsy came from uh a buddy of

1709
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:51,238
mine from overgrow he went by

1710
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:54,439
budel uh he had broughten the Betsy up

1711
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:58,319
to Humble back in the early

1712
01:14:54,439 --> 01:15:01,879
2000s um from what information I

1713
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:04,920
gathered it's the same guy that did the

1714
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:09,400
Hogs breath and the bull

1715
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:13,399
rider who also did the uh the old Betsy

1716
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:14,960
and you know I've asked around um and

1717
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:17,439
just like you know breeding with it

1718
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:20,119
seeing the different stuff that pops up

1719
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:23,919
I kind of believe the White Widow maybe

1720
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:26,039
Super Skunk Cross or something like that

1721
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:29,600
uh but again you know this is all

1722
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:31,399
speculation but I think um for sure the

1723
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,639
White Widow I've grown out quite a few

1724
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:35,599
white widows in the past and kind of see

1725
01:15:34,639 --> 01:15:40,119
that in

1726
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:43,440
it um but again uh I think whoever was

1727
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:45,599
growing a long time ago is long gone and

1728
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:47,799
and uh it's going to be another one of

1729
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,239
those mystery plants that you know maybe

1730
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,199
when phos gets enough uh stuff gathered

1731
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:54,238
up they'll be able to tell us in the

1732
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:56,559
future

1733
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:58,158
yeah okay and what's it like as a as a

1734
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,960
smoke you know what's the flavor what's

1735
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:04,238
the

1736
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:08,760
high um so a lot of the uh a lot of my

1737
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:11,039
breeding um the past 10 years has been

1738
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:17,079
for commercial

1739
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:22,279
outdoor uh so the Betsy um very pungent

1740
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:24,719
this like rotten mango or maybe like a

1741
01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:28,639
baby eight a ton of mangoes and then

1742
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:30,679
[ __ ] them out you know it it's funky and

1743
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:36,359
and the smell it's it's got a really

1744
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:39,119
really strong uh uh tur profile to it uh

1745
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:41,319
the thing I really liked about it was um

1746
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,479
how quick how fast it finished outside

1747
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:46,639
it's usually about October 5th for us

1748
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:49,238
over here uh October 5th to like uh you

1749
01:16:46,639 --> 01:16:53,039
know if you wanted to I guess maybe

1750
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:54,839
October 15th latest latest no uh October

1751
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:58,920
oer 5th about October 8th is usually

1752
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:03,159
when I cut it um big big big yielder

1753
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:06,440
very Hardy and and just the uh the the

1754
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:09,559
the tur profile on it um that stuff can

1755
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:11,519
sit for a solid year and when you open

1756
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:15,760
it up it's just going to stink like it

1757
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:17,840
did from day one uh I've had people you

1758
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:22,440
know take that over

1759
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:25,560
OG um they they loved it they love it um

1760
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:27,439
it's a good it's a good daytime smoke uh

1761
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,520
pretty pretty pretty heavy

1762
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:34,678
duty um what

1763
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:38,760
else but again more more for the

1764
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:41,319
outdoor uh is is what I started working

1765
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:45,920
it's got you know for for

1766
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:48,799
outdoor there's certain types of herb

1767
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,199
that um when done right outside has an

1768
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:56,199
indoor look to it uh Betsy being one of

1769
01:17:52,198 --> 01:17:58,879
those um a lot of breeder Steve stuff

1770
01:17:56,198 --> 01:18:01,638
from back in the day uh had some really

1771
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,719
nice uh would would have a really nice

1772
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:05,400
like indoor look to it there there's one

1773
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:08,840
uh a blockhead that I've been working

1774
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:12,359
for several several years now from him

1775
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:14,079
um that that I mean for the longest

1776
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:16,119
times like when the dispensaries first

1777
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,760
started opening up out here I was taking

1778
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:20,158
it in and passing it off as indor and

1779
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,159
they were loving it and they were taking

1780
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:24,920
it giving me top dollar all the time for

1781
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:27,000
it uh so so the Betsy is another one

1782
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:31,679
like that it's just it's just got that

1783
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,960
that look um to it um it's got the it's

1784
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,520
got the nose to it and it's got the

1785
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:39,880
structure to it um so it was one you

1786
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:44,440
know I I couldn't let it pass up so I

1787
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:47,920
worked that into uh back uh inbred line

1788
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:50,759
I guess um just kept on back Crossing it

1789
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:53,800
and uh it's it's a winner for sure it's

1790
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:57,800
a winner the the name of it um turns a

1791
01:18:53,800 --> 01:19:00,840
lot of people off so most most times uh

1792
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:03,920
I've seen it being passed off as Oregon

1793
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,949
blueberry or Mango

1794
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,480
Kush

1795
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:10,719
[Music]

1796
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:12,959
um there a couple other names but again

1797
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:14,760
it was just it was a cash Cropper back

1798
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,600
then for the indoor and it's a cash

1799
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,719
Cropper now for the outdoor and I mean

1800
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:22,320
and it does great insight as well but

1801
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:26,158
that's cool so when you kind of take a

1802
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:27,920
look over 707 offerings as a seed bank

1803
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,479
seems to me on face value it's pretty

1804
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,279
evenly split down the middle in terms of

1805
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:32,799
kind of like sativa and indicas I mean I

1806
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:34,519
guess you could argue a little more into

1807
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,920
cening with you know some of the cham

1808
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,280
hybrids but overall you know was that

1809
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,000
kind of intentional did you look to

1810
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:42,198
cater to both sides of the market or is

1811
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,800
it really just about

1812
01:19:42,198 --> 01:19:48,719
you it's uh yeah I hate to say it but

1813
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:50,840
all it's just what I like and I I tend

1814
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,279
to go more towards the indicas but you

1815
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:55,639
know I do like a little bit of sativa

1816
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:58,559
here and there not not anything super

1817
01:19:55,639 --> 01:20:00,800
heavy sativa like um what was it like

1818
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,039
the genius from Brother Grims actual

1819
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,000
genius clone I mean that thing just

1820
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:08,920
makes my head spin I start hearing

1821
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,719
things in the walls and that's like all

1822
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:14,440
I want to

1823
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:16,560
smoke the P sativas huh oh genius I

1824
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:18,759
remember when I got to smoke genius I

1825
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,520
just exhaled and just within about 5

1826
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:23,719
seconds I just looked at soul and was

1827
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:25,960
just like this is my new favorite plant

1828
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:28,800
yeah yeah I remember the the first time

1829
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:31,800
I I grew the genius and flattered it out

1830
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:34,840
I I uh I had harvested it had it in my

1831
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:37,239
garage and then uh left came back a

1832
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:39,639
couple hours later and I I had thought

1833
01:20:37,238 --> 01:20:42,000
somebody had thrown up in my house and

1834
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:44,560
like didn't paint it up that smell was

1835
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,319
just like wow it was something else I

1836
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:50,960
love that smell and the taste of it but

1837
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:53,000
uh it just makes my head spin yeah it's

1838
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,719
just too much and my head already go um

1839
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,479
you know I already go a thousand miles

1840
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,439
per per minute here and uh I I don't

1841
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:01,479
need anything else to increase that you

1842
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:03,158
know I need something to calm me down

1843
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:04,839
yeah okay so I guess it would be safe to

1844
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:07,559
say overall you're definitely more into

1845
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:09,639
your indicas than sativas more more

1846
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,639
indicia hybrids yeah I definitely like

1847
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:15,480
the blend you know pure pure indicas of

1848
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:17,319
course you know they lay me out um I got

1849
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:19,678
an army of kids so it's it's pretty hard

1850
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:24,359
to function if I if I smoke too much of

1851
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:28,158
those things so uh I like uh a nice

1852
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:31,079
blend nice hybrids of uh I guess but

1853
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:34,238
more I guess I guess more

1854
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:35,800
into yeah for sure so a little while

1855
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:37,479
back you mentioned that you were

1856
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,039
reversing the males and in fact you did

1857
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:41,158
it for all of your males that you were

1858
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:43,238
going to like kind of greenl light we've

1859
01:21:41,158 --> 01:21:45,439
had people talk about this process but

1860
01:21:43,238 --> 01:21:47,198
no one's ever really you know said that

1861
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:48,479
they've actually really done it would

1862
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:49,559
you be able to give us a bit of a run

1863
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:51,399
through of what it's like and more

1864
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,239
importantly what's the bud like when you

1865
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:55,238
smoke it and does it give like a real

1866
01:21:53,238 --> 01:21:58,279
true representation of the male or is it

1867
01:21:55,238 --> 01:22:00,959
more just kind of hinting things to you

1868
01:21:58,279 --> 01:22:03,599
uh it it uh I I've never smoked it

1869
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:07,399
before it it's the the stuff I use is

1870
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:10,600
called florel and um it's a bare product

1871
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:14,079
so it it's it's definitely really

1872
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:16,800
toxic uh so yeah like I mean when I

1873
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:19,600
spray the plants um you know I'll spray

1874
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:22,800
him outside and then I I won even touch

1875
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,840
the plant um for a good while so it's

1876
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,199
one of those things I really like

1877
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:29,760
telling people use it because uh you

1878
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:31,158
know most people are stoners and they're

1879
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,520
just going to spray it without any kind

1880
01:22:31,158 --> 01:22:35,879
of covering or or respirator or anything

1881
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,920
like that and it you know I don't know

1882
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:41,400
what it could do to you but I know it's

1883
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:43,119
toxic I know uh it's ban in Europe so I

1884
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:47,319
mean that that says a lot right there

1885
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:50,479
you know uh but what what you get off of

1886
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:53,479
it is uh the tur profiles you can

1887
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:56,319
definitely you know since I'm always

1888
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:59,158
after you know a certain tur profile

1889
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:02,479
this I could weed out all the [ __ ] that

1890
01:22:59,158 --> 01:23:04,238
I don't want anymore you know uh and

1891
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:06,439
then when I was able to take them to the

1892
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:08,638
labs uh you know you could get it tested

1893
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:11,439
for potency and whatnot it gives you you

1894
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,880
know a slight little idea but when you

1895
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:15,439
reverse it it just it just produces I

1896
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:18,639
mean I guess I've had some strains that

1897
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:20,399
actually produce a nugget but most times

1898
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:23,760
it's just like a little seed

1899
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:25,559
CX and uh you know just and it just goes

1900
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,639
up to stem kind of like that uh what's

1901
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:31,159
that string Green Spoon Grim spoon or

1902
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:34,600
something like that yeah Dr grein spoon

1903
01:23:31,158 --> 01:23:37,319
yeah it turns out similar to that uh in

1904
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:39,800
structure but you you can get the tur

1905
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:43,319
profile which is what I'm after all the

1906
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:47,119
time and uh you know it cuts out all the

1907
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:51,479
guests work and breeding um there was

1908
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:54,559
just recently a uh post by Mr Bob

1909
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:56,638
Hill where he has I think it was just

1910
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:59,600
yesterday actually um where he had

1911
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:03,279
posted a thing where he had gotten some

1912
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:07,000
ohaw Hawkin seeds or something like that

1913
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:08,759
and he only ended up with one male uh so

1914
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,079
in that you know in that case he could

1915
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:15,440
he could reverse that male pollinate

1916
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:17,800
itself and now you're able to get both

1917
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:20,399
male when you when you reverse a male

1918
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,800
and make male US ones most people would

1919
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:25,000
think you're getting all male seeds but

1920
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,880
the uh the male carries both chromosomes

1921
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,760
the X and Y so you get both male and

1922
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:33,079
female

1923
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:35,159
seeds so you know in that case you know

1924
01:24:33,079 --> 01:24:37,399
since he wasn't able to get any females

1925
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:38,759
or anything like that now you're able to

1926
01:24:37,399 --> 01:24:42,319
he can reverse the

1927
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:43,760
male pollinate itself and you know go

1928
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:47,399
through the seeds and now you have both

1929
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:49,639
male and female seeds and uh I've done

1930
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:51,839
that with like the cat piss before where

1931
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:53,239
I made uh you know male s1's I guess

1932
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,560
you'd call it

1933
01:24:53,238 --> 01:24:59,479
and uh grew those seeds out and I read a

1934
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,960
thing on uh where Sam the skunkman said

1935
01:24:59,479 --> 01:25:03,198
you know do you get a certain percentage

1936
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:06,239
of male certain percentage of female

1937
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:09,279
this that and the other but

1938
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:11,759
uh I ended up pretty much no I ended up

1939
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:14,319
with a pretty much a 5050 split you know

1940
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:17,560
the same amount of females as males when

1941
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:20,719
I did it um yeah I remember that article

1942
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:22,960
he said it was uh 25% male 25% female

1943
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:25,279
50% home

1944
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,439
yeah yeah and then again I think that's

1945
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:30,599
uh strain dependent are are you working

1946
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:33,638
with the hermy or or not the uh the cat

1947
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,679
piss that I have it's it's stable it's

1948
01:25:33,639 --> 01:25:37,960
strong uh I've never seen any kind of

1949
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:40,399
intersects with it or anything and even

1950
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:43,239
with the seeds there there was no Herms

1951
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:46,118
whatsoever uh when I had did the male S1

1952
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:48,279
project and and uh again it was it was a

1953
01:25:46,118 --> 01:25:51,158
good split you know

1954
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:53,000
5050 I mean everything sounds great in

1955
01:25:51,158 --> 01:25:54,439
theory but

1956
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,520
man you don't really know what you're

1957
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:59,000
going to get until you grow them out you

1958
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:01,280
know not not all males cross the same

1959
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,238
you know that's why you know when I pick

1960
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:06,920
out all my males I do one male to one

1961
01:26:04,238 --> 01:26:09,839
female you know and now I can grow all

1962
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:12,960
those out and and pinpoint exactly what

1963
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:15,440
Mal is doing what uh like and like I was

1964
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:18,079
saying with like the OG thing you know I

1965
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:20,879
found a few males that smelled like OG

1966
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:23,880
you know completely like OG but when I

1967
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,880
would cross it back to the sfv it would

1968
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:29,639
get this watered down carb a lot of them

1969
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,440
turn out like the Fire OG really really

1970
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:34,440
Frosty but just not much flavor and

1971
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:37,759
taste to it at

1972
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:40,079
all yeah okay so I guess the thing which

1973
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:44,679
comes to mind then is

1974
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:46,960
um uh with in regards to these seeds do

1975
01:26:44,679 --> 01:26:49,199
you think there is anything valuable to

1976
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,198
be gained in them like these M seeds or

1977
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:52,799
do you think it's more of just a novelty

1978
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:54,439
thing

1979
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:57,159
uh if

1980
01:26:54,439 --> 01:27:00,599
you're wanting to go deep inside you

1981
01:26:57,158 --> 01:27:02,439
know inside of what it is to see what uh

1982
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,960
you know what what kind of Heritage it

1983
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:07,559
might have had or or something like that

1984
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,880
sure I think it could be valuable or you

1985
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:13,679
know and and in like Mr Bob Hamp Hill's

1986
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,279
situation where he only has one male and

1987
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:18,199
that's it and no other

1988
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:21,359
seeds uh yeah absolutely you know

1989
01:27:18,198 --> 01:27:23,079
reverse that sucker and and uh you know

1990
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:25,118
you're going to get both male and female

1991
01:27:23,079 --> 01:27:27,118
seeds out of out of it and and now

1992
01:27:25,118 --> 01:27:31,198
you're able you know go deeper inside of

1993
01:27:27,118 --> 01:27:34,238
it see what's going on in there um yeah

1994
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:37,638
the sorry go on the reversing of the

1995
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:41,079
males it it it it cuts out all the guess

1996
01:27:37,639 --> 01:27:43,560
work for for the most part you

1997
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:45,600
know there's no more questioning you

1998
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,960
know what is this going to do I mean you

1999
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,800
never know what it's going to do but you

2000
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:53,639
can always pick out the uh the uh the

2001
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:57,119
tpping profile or here here's a great

2002
01:27:53,639 --> 01:28:01,239
example um a few years back uh I want to

2003
01:27:57,118 --> 01:28:03,880
do a CBD line so I had bought a bunch of

2004
01:28:01,238 --> 01:28:06,279
uh seeds online CBD I remember there's

2005
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:08,440
some like reer man stuff and and some

2006
01:28:06,279 --> 01:28:12,079
other people's stuff so I grew them all

2007
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:14,198
out um reversed all the Maes took all

2008
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:16,960
the males to the lab to see you know

2009
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:19,000
what kind of percentage what things had

2010
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:23,600
none of the seeds that I had bought had

2011
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:26,679
any CBD they all came back THC

2012
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:30,880
huh right so I mean like situations like

2013
01:28:26,679 --> 01:28:34,760
that you know it saved me uh quite a few

2014
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:37,960
quite a bit of time yeah wow that's

2015
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:40,600
that's questionable so uh I noticed when

2016
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:42,520
you reverse a female the female plan

2017
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:45,760
itself tends to not really want to

2018
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:48,119
accept the pollen and and form any s1's

2019
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,400
on itself but I'm pretty confident I

2020
01:28:48,118 --> 01:28:50,880
noticed when I was looking a little

2021
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:52,960
closer at some of your photos of the

2022
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,079
males that it looked like it it was

2023
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:59,880
making seeds on itself is that the case

2024
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:59,880
and and why do you think there is this

2025
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:08,198
difference um well when reversing the

2026
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:09,479
females I guess a lot of times when

2027
01:29:08,198 --> 01:29:12,079
you're when you're spraying it with the

2028
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:14,799
silver nitrate or whatever uh you know

2029
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:16,760
you're burning up the uh the

2030
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,320
pistols so

2031
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:21,679
[Music]

2032
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:24,920
um you know I I I don't know I don't

2033
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:27,920
know I I thinking about it but uh I

2034
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:30,520
don't know uh with with the males it's

2035
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:33,039
every time I reverse them it seeds

2036
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:34,600
itself uh and and that's one of like the

2037
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:37,198
downfalls of when I would take it to the

2038
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,960
lab because the the seeds and and the

2039
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:41,118
stem and all that bring the testing way

2040
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,359
down so people are always asking me like

2041
01:29:41,118 --> 01:29:44,279
you know what what kind of numbers are

2042
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:46,719
you getting from your males and I'm like

2043
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:50,399
you know it's only like 12 to

2044
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:52,359
14% but you know most of that sample is

2045
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:55,439
is seed and stem you know know there's

2046
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:59,960
there's very little cxes or to to test

2047
01:29:55,439 --> 01:30:01,359
off of yeah okay and so with the male

2048
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:03,039
traits that you're assessing when you

2049
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:05,198
reverse it let's just say you know you

2050
01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:07,880
you're smelling the turpine profile have

2051
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:10,118
you found that what it Expresses in the

2052
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,679
female reverse trait is what it will

2053
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:14,839
pass on in its

2054
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:17,840
pollen most times yeah yeah the ma the

2055
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:18,840
majority of the time yeah cool well

2056
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,199
that's pretty

2057
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,400
reassuring yeah yeah absolutely I mean

2058
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:25,198
not in every case

2059
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:28,519
but but most times yeah it it does pass

2060
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:30,799
off uh you know the traits the pass off

2061
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:33,800
to the female most

2062
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:37,400
males in in my case I guess have uh

2063
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:40,560
usually take over the cross um you know

2064
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:42,158
when when you find a blank male uh it's

2065
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,360
it's really something special and hold

2066
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:47,319
on that sucker tight when you know the

2067
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:49,439
females completely take over the cross

2068
01:30:47,319 --> 01:30:52,719
uh th those are the real special ones

2069
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:55,279
that um and I I don't I out of thousands

2070
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:58,319
and thousands of males I've only found

2071
01:30:55,279 --> 01:31:01,559
like one or two in my life that do

2072
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:03,719
that yeah of course and it kind of plays

2073
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:06,199
into the idea of I've been thinking

2074
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:09,158
about this for a while that people buy

2075
01:31:06,198 --> 01:31:13,158
strains predominantly for the

2076
01:31:09,158 --> 01:31:17,638
female yeah absolutely absolutely um you

2077
01:31:13,158 --> 01:31:21,319
know when I was buying uh seeds you know

2078
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:24,560
the description sold me uh and you know

2079
01:31:21,319 --> 01:31:27,158
n out of the 10 times uh you might find

2080
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,560
one seed out of the pack that would

2081
01:31:27,158 --> 01:31:32,198
actually be what the description

2082
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:33,639
is so that that's that's why I like the

2083
01:31:32,198 --> 01:31:35,879
back Crossing and

2084
01:31:33,639 --> 01:31:38,239

you're going to get you're not going to

2087
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:44,679
get one out of 10 you know every single

2088
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:47,679
seed of the heavily worked lines that I

2089

have is coming out exactly what I say

2090

it's going to be you know like the

2091
01:31:49,238 --> 01:31:53,479
betsies they're all turning out how uh

2092
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:55,559
it's Des cribed you know cat piss every

2093
01:31:53,479 --> 01:31:59,879
single one comes out these short little

2094
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:02,719
Indica uh cat piss you know um no

2095
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:05,760
variation and so like uh for doing

2096
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:08,520
commercial outdoor it was uh you know I

2097
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:10,920
wanted to be able to grow out um let's

2098
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:14,159
say like you know 10 10

2099
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:17,199
seeds and every single one turn out

2100
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:19,238
exactly the same to where uh you know

2101
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,960
you can mix the different plants

2102
01:32:19,238 --> 01:32:24,238
together and no one's going to know

2103
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:26,920
difference you know uh if if like if I'm

2104
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:29,479
buying a pack of seeds from somebody

2105
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:30,960
else uh and you know I'm growing them

2106
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:31,959
out I got three or four different kind

2107
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,880
of

2108
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,920
fenos uh the end user isn't going to be

2109
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,719
happy if I call it all one thing when

2110
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:43,199
there's three different you know flavors

2111
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:45,399
out of it so that that was uh the big

2112
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:48,198
driving force behind the uh making

2113
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:50,439
outdoor seeds is just having that

2114
01:32:48,198 --> 01:32:52,319
consistency um you know obviously the

2115
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:55,638
seeds going to get twice sealed as a

2116
01:32:52,319 --> 01:33:00,000
clone is and uh you know a lot more

2117
01:32:55,639 --> 01:33:01,840
resistant to pests and mold and whatnot

2118
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,639
so yeah

2119
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:07,520
100% so I mean just kind of slotting

2120
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:10,480
this one in there would you ever

2121
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:13,679
consider offering any feminize

2122
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:16,879
work uh I I love feminize seeds I love

2123
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:20,319
feminize seeds um I make them for myself

2124
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:22,159
uh I I do it more for preservation of of

2125
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:24,840
clones that I want to let go

2126
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:27,439
you know a feminize make

2127
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:31,520
s1's and put them in the

2128
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:33,919
vault the thing I found with you know a

2129
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:36,270
lot of the you know when you're making

2130
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,520
an S1 of one strain

2131
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:42,480
[Music]

2132
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:45,880
um it doesn't generally turn out as well

2133
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:48,158
as if you uh make a hybrid with s you

2134
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:50,079
know U make feminized hybrids those

2135
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:52,559
usually turn out much better than actual

2136
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:54,118
the uh when when make the

2137
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,920
S1

2138
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:59,000
but uh you know I got them in the vault

2139
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:00,920
so in 20 years from now if I want to

2140
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,840
grow you know this that or the other I

2141
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:05,600
can always just bust them out and Sprout

2142
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:07,679
them and uh I'm sure you know out of out

2143
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,760
of 10 or 20 seeds you're going to find

2144
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:14,039
exactly what you're looking

2145
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:16,480
for but uh as of offering them to the

2146
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:19,840
public I don't even know I don't even

2147
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:24,158
know what the future of 707 Seedbank has

2148
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:26,279
uh the uh I said this it breeding has

2149
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:30,198
always been my passion it's been my

2150
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:34,759
hobby and uh now kind of bringing it

2151
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:36,759
into a into the market Zone you know I'm

2152
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:39,600
always scared it's going to uh cloud my

2153
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:42,719
judgment a little bit like you know uh

2154
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:45,679
everyone wants this purple punch or or

2155
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:48,039
wedding cake or this that or the other

2156
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:51,118
you know I've smoked purple punch a few

2157
01:34:48,039 --> 01:34:53,600
times and uh there was no punch to it

2158
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:55,158
you know what I'm saying it was just

2159
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:59,239
purple it tasted good but there was

2160
01:34:55,158 --> 01:35:01,039
definitely no punch so but that's that's

2161
01:34:59,238 --> 01:35:04,000
what it seems like the market wants they

2162
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:08,158
all want these uh whatever jungle boys

2163
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,158
is growing is what what they

2164
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:17,599
want the reason why

2165
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:20,479
I is because I noticed that lemon do you

2166
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:23,380
breed with lemon and soig if you're will

2167
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:25,118
to

2168
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:28,960
[Music]

2169
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:30,439
sure sure yeah that that uh the the

2170
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:36,158
lemon tree

2171
01:35:30,439 --> 01:35:38,279
S1 um I have a buddy who was uh the

2172
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:43,118
lemon tree guys' distributor when they

2173
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:45,759
first came out and you know as as he was

2174
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:48,759
moving the packs he would always find a

2175
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:50,679
couple seeds inside each pack and saved

2176
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:54,360
them and he wasn't he wasn't growing at

2177
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:57,560
the time he he does now but uh he gave

2178
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:58,679
me um all all the lemon tree Hermes

2179
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:02,480
seeds he had

2180
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:05,679
found and uh I grew them all out uh you

2181
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:08,678
know like like I said with the s1's you

2182
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:11,679
know a good half of them turn out to be

2183
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:15,239
like Duds or just really weak grown or

2184
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:18,960
whatnot uh that lemon

2185
01:36:15,238 --> 01:36:21,919
tree it's you know it's got that citrusy

2186
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:23,880
kind of Calo uh

2187
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:28,480
uh you know tur

2188
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:32,079
profile um and and you know most those

2189
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:35,599
tangies and stuff like that for me uh

2190
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:37,960
doesn't get me all that high tastes

2191
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:40,119
great you know a couple joints are good

2192
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:43,639
but after that it's just like uh it

2193
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:44,319
doesn't do nothing so the the lemon tree

2194
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:47,679
you

2195
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:50,479
know seems to be a little bit more

2196
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:52,399
potent than uh the majority of the

2197
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:56,000
citrusy string trins that that I've

2198
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:59,479
worked but it's that flavor on it is

2199
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:03,600
just so mouthwatering so flavorful and

2200
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:07,638
and uh it it does pack a good good punch

2201
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:10,239
uh but you know like like uh most s1's

2202
01:37:07,639 --> 01:37:13,679
it's it's it's kind of a [ __ ] to grow

2203
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:17,158
has a real weak weak uh root system to

2204
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:20,800
it um same thing with the I use a

2205
01:37:17,158 --> 01:37:23,198
snowman um S1 which is from the cookie

2206
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:27,719
guys is uh one of the ones that they've

2207
01:37:23,198 --> 01:37:29,839
kind of held down more on a uh uh they

2208
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:33,079
they've held that one down pretty good

2209
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:36,239
they didn't let it go at all but

2210
01:37:33,079 --> 01:37:39,559
uh again with like the snowman also weak

2211
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:43,319
Roots very finicky to grow but a lot of

2212
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:44,760
these uh s1s you know like like the SF I

2213
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:47,118
I wouldn't be surprised that if that

2214
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,840
wasn't a hermy seed even though I've

2215
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:53,039
never seen OG hermy on me any of them

2216
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,639
indoors but uh I imagine you know that's

2217
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:58,000
where most of all these Cuts came out

2218
01:37:54,639 --> 01:38:00,719
from but uh you know weak weak root

2219
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,399
system but awesome flavorful flavorful

2220
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,760
herb you know I can't I can't let that

2221
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:08,598
stuff pass up when it when it's that

2222
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:10,440
good is this the same lemonry S1 which I

2223
01:38:08,599 --> 01:38:11,319
think swamp boys have used in a hybrid

2224
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:15,638
or

2225
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:18,359
two uh not the same cut no uh

2226
01:38:15,639 --> 01:38:22,359
most the the lemon tree guy stopped by

2227
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:23,880
my booth at the emerald cup uh last year

2228
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:25,279
and and I've heard this from other

2229
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:28,199
people

2230
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:31,800
before uh and they said that they've

2231
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:35,319
never given out the actual clone and

2232
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:38,719
everybody that does have a lemon tree uh

2233
01:38:35,319 --> 01:38:42,920
cut is comes from you know a seed that

2234
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:45,760
they found uh inside inside their bag so

2235
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:48,118
uh the Swamp Boy guys also uh uh they

2236
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:51,679
found their own seed

2237
01:38:48,118 --> 01:38:53,839
um and and uh grew theirs out I haven't

2238
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:57,800
seen uh I haven't seen or smoked their

2239
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:59,599
lemon tree at all but uh different so

2240
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:02,320
everybody's got a different one I I've

2241
01:38:59,599 --> 01:39:04,920
I've shared my cutout with a few people

2242
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:07,559
I know I gave it to Archive uh and a

2243
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:10,760
couple other folks but not not too many

2244
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:12,080
so it's definitely not out there at all

2245
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,719
ah is that the one he used in the

2246
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:17,960
creation of the lemon peel

2247
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:21,880
line who used lemon peel or what's lemon

2248
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:23,880
peel I think it's uh lemon tree cross

2249
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:27,639
something from

2250
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:29,760
archive oh okay yeah yeah if if archive

2251
01:39:27,639 --> 01:39:32,400
have it it was the cut of lemon tree

2252
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:35,639
that I gave them cool cool cool yeah

2253
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:37,960
know I've tried um I think it was called

2254
01:39:35,639 --> 01:39:40,599
lemon drop or something one of the

2255
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:42,719
hybrids he made so he made a hybrid with

2256
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:45,079
lemon tree and then crossed that to

2257
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,719
other things and so I got to try the end

2258
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:50,359
product one of them and it was really

2259
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:53,359
good it was really good did that citrusy

2260
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:56,279
fun come Mountain to the Cross or um

2261
01:39:53,359 --> 01:40:01,198
well I don't know cuz I also tried lemon

2262
01:39:56,279 --> 01:40:02,759
tree at U Mr Bob hemp's place and that

2263
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:04,719
sounds much more like what you're

2264
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,360
talking about whereas the one I trade

2265
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:08,118
from archive was just a really nice

2266
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:10,158
lemon hybrid and I could definitely see

2267
01:40:08,118 --> 01:40:13,118
that lemon tree was in there I could

2268
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:14,719
believe it I should say but um kind of

2269
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:17,639
what you're talking about is definitely

2270
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:18,880
like what I tried at Bob Hill's house oh

2271
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:21,760
right on so what did you think of the

2272
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,079
lemon tree I really liked it but I found

2273
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:25,400
there was something a little bit

2274
01:40:23,079 --> 01:40:28,519
obnoxious about it it was like obnoxious

2275
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:29,759
lemon like it was um and it's not like

2276
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,520
the way he grewed or anything I think

2277
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,719
it's just a my personal preference thing

2278
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,719
but I definitely see what you mean when

2279
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,480
you say like there's a Calo vibe to it

2280
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:38,279
cuz it's almost like not a bang on Lemon

2281
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:41,359
it's like a very tart

2282
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:43,439
lemon right right right yeah I I I

2283
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:45,279
personally don't get any lemon out of it

2284
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:47,439
yeah it's it's not like the way some

2285
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:49,238
OG's a bang on Lemon it's not like that

2286
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:52,359
lemon in my opinion at

2287
01:40:49,238 --> 01:40:55,079
all right right yeah I feel I feel the

2288
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:58,319
same way to me it's more uh uh like a

2289
01:40:55,079 --> 01:41:01,279
orangey but um Everyone likes a lemon

2290
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:03,439
now I guess the name's uh pretty popular

2291
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:05,880
yeah it's an interesting cut nonetheless

2292
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:08,079
so it Spurs the question to mind for me

2293
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:10,520
though I've seen people breeding with

2294
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:12,279
S2s is that something you interested in

2295
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:14,199
like not necessarily breeding with an S2

2296
01:41:12,279 --> 01:41:16,399
but like digging to that generation and

2297
01:41:14,198 --> 01:41:19,879
doing that type of thing or not

2298
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:22,079
necessarily oh oh absolutely um I don't

2299
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:24,880
I don't think there's

2300
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:25,840
you know there's no right or wrong way

2301
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,359
in in

2302
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:32,840
breeding uh if you if you have a goal in

2303
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:34,759
mind uh you know just go for it try it

2304
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:36,679
out if it doesn't work try a different

2305
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:38,800
way you know not not all strains are

2306
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:40,760
going to breed the same not you know

2307
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:45,679
what might work with one strain might

2308
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:49,440
not work with another so uh any kind of

2309
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:55,000
tool that I could use I use it uh s1's

2310
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:57,439
S2s reversing males uh you know the the

2311
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,840
one one one one thing uh I've noticed

2312
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:02,079
with reversing males and it's it's

2313
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:05,039
something that I I still do to this day

2314
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:06,599
is uh the stem rub you know before I

2315
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:09,158
reverse a mail I'll go through all my

2316
01:42:06,599 --> 01:42:11,520
males and I'll rub the stem and you know

2317
01:42:09,158 --> 01:42:14,000
I I'll I'll pick out what I think is

2318
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:17,159
going to be the killer stud of the group

2319
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,079
and you know I'll label

2320
01:42:17,158 --> 01:42:21,920
those not once has one of those males

2321
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:24,960
been the the the keeper stud It's

2322
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:27,239
usually the one off in the far corner so

2323
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:31,880
with that stem rub

2324
01:42:27,238 --> 01:42:36,198
thing uh I've noticed

2325
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:38,800
maybe 5% of plants that stem rub

2326
01:42:36,198 --> 01:42:40,359
actually comes through to the flower but

2327
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,480
for the most part that stem robe doesn't

2328
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:43,960
mean [ __ ] uh whatever smell you're

2329
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:46,399
getting off that stem robe it's going to

2330
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:47,960
come out completely different to the

2331
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:50,559
flower

2332
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:52,800
uh so that that's you know another cool

2333
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,880
thing with the reversing of the males

2334
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:57,119
just finding these little little things

2335
01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:01,279
but whatever any kind of

2336
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:04,598
tool um whatever I could do to reach my

2337
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:08,399
end goal is you know I'll use it the uh

2338
01:43:04,599 --> 01:43:12,520
I don't have uh any problems with with

2339
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:15,839
s1's S2s and actually I think uh to make

2340
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:18,199
a strain Tighter and to breed like to

2341
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:22,599
breed a pure you know a real

2342
01:43:18,198 --> 01:43:25,198
F1 I think you do need to go to S2 S3 S4

2343
01:43:22,599 --> 01:43:27,599
um you know and then cross that to

2344
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:30,359
something else that has also been taken

2345
01:43:27,599 --> 01:43:34,239
that far and and you know to get that

2346
01:43:30,359 --> 01:43:36,759
true that true hybrid figure and that

2347
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:40,079
was another reason why I did the uh I

2348
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:41,440
like the back Crossing um to you know

2349
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:43,279
back cross the hell out of it to where

2350
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:47,399
every seed comes out the exactly the

2351
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:49,000
same and then I'll cross those back to

2352
01:43:47,399 --> 01:43:51,559
you know a different strain that I did

2353
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:55,960
the same thing with in hopes to get a

2354
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:59,480
true you know full-on Vigor you know

2355
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:01,719
hybrid yeah wow I mean the first thing I

2356
01:43:59,479 --> 01:44:04,158
kind of think of is what are some other

2357
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:06,880
little tips and tricks you may have for

2358
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:06,879
uh selecting a

2359
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:13,880
male the reversing of the mail I I I

2360
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:15,960
pick out everything from there uh you I

2361
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:18,719
like when I sprouting my seeds and stuff

2362
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:22,198
like that I I'll automatically uh call

2363
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:25,399
off anything that's weak or are uh

2364
01:44:22,198 --> 01:44:28,479
doesn't doesn't fit my bill uh growing

2365
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:30,158
wise so I just keep all the best ones

2366
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:34,359
and then from there I'll start reversing

2367
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:36,000
and and and then pick it that way yeah

2368
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:37,639
wow interesting I think the thing which

2369
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,880
comes to mind most when you mentioned

2370
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:42,359
that the you know the how should we say

2371
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:44,960
the interreliability of the stem rub is

2372
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:46,920
um our most recent guest Mass strains he

2373
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,560
said that something he had noticed which

2374
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:50,158
wasn't exactly what you said but it very

2375
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,159
much was following that train of thought

2376
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:54,238
was that

2377
01:44:51,158 --> 01:44:57,279
he said uh don't put too much stock in a

2378
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:59,439
single stem rub because if you do the

2379
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:03,000
stem rubs consistently over a long

2380
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:04,759
period of time it changes wildly and so

2381
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
yeah if you just stem rub on any old day

2382
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:10,840
like who knows what that really

2383
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,439
means right right like I said only uh

2384
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:15,520
like the cat piss will actually the the

2385
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:17,799
smell will come off on the on the stem

2386
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,840
rub and a lot of those uh that Tangi

2387
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,119
like the lemon tree and that those

2388
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:24,159
citrus

2389
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:26,799
strains uh the stem rub will actually

2390
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:29,079
translate to the flower you know but the

2391
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:32,599
the every other strain I've ever tried

2392
01:45:29,079 --> 01:45:35,639
um not even close nowhere near

2393
01:45:32,599 --> 01:45:37,279
close so this is maybe a bit of a weird

2394
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:38,840
kind of farfetch concept but I really

2395
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:41,439
like the idea of it where basically an

2396
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:43,520
old idea DJ Short put forward was that

2397
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:45,719
he always said he found crosses worked a

2398
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,920
little better when the more sativa of

2399
01:45:45,719 --> 01:45:49,319
the two plants was the mother have you

2400
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,039
ever found anything like that or found

2401
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:55,319
any of your own little kind of of weird

2402
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:57,719
rules that seem to work like that um no

2403
01:45:55,319 --> 01:45:59,399
uh you know like not not all not all

2404
01:45:57,719 --> 01:46:03,000
strains are going to mix a match the

2405
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:07,079
same uh you know some sometimes like

2406
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:10,560
like uh sfv if if you cross uh anything

2407
01:46:07,079 --> 01:46:13,519
to the actual xfv clone it's almost

2408
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:16,880
guaranteed the potency goes up uh if you

2409
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:18,840
cross anything to my cat piss clone um

2410
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,880
that cat piss smell just does not go

2411
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:25,319
through it just doesn't it just doesn't

2412
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:27,079
translate to the crosses uh and I I just

2413
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:29,158
uh maybe about a year or two ago I made

2414
01:46:27,079 --> 01:46:32,118
a bunch of cat piss crosses where I

2415
01:46:29,158 --> 01:46:35,079
actually use uh a mail for my cat piss

2416
01:46:32,118 --> 01:46:36,719
and and cross it to a bunch of stuff and

2417
01:46:35,079 --> 01:46:37,840
it was kind of weird anything that like

2418
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:41,279
had hermy

2419
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:44,639
Tendencies um it it it just brought it

2420
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:47,118
right out like anything uhh the chem 91

2421
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:50,000
her hella bad the the Girl Scout cookies

2422
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:51,839
her really bad uh but strains that

2423
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,560
didn't really have any hermy Tendencies

2424
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:57,920
we we're perfectly fine which is totally

2425
01:46:54,560 --> 01:47:00,960
weird uh I I I stress all my males out

2426
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,800
for a good long time usually just

2427
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,480
because I'm not home and able to use

2428
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:08,119
them but uh I I'll be gone for like you

2429
01:47:05,479 --> 01:47:10,000
know a good season and then finally come

2430
01:47:08,118 --> 01:47:13,238
back and get to them and you know

2431
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:17,319
they're kept in little tiny cups uh you

2432
01:47:13,238 --> 01:47:18,959
know half dead and and if some of them

2433
01:47:17,319 --> 01:47:22,158
sometimes will start spitting out hairs

2434
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:24,960
and crystals and at that point uh you

2435
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:27,279
know off to the mulch pile they go but

2436
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,840
you know if if they if they can survive

2437
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:32,198
me being absent for that long then I

2438
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:36,520
know I got to keep her you

2439
01:47:32,198 --> 01:47:39,519
know so there's some strong genetics in

2440
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:42,320
there so what are some of the next

2441
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:46,440
crosses you're looking at working

2442
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:50,880
on uh I'm I'm still working on my

2443
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:54,399
SF uh currently got a um a seed run

2444
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:57,760
going on that uh I've been working that

2445
01:47:54,399 --> 01:48:00,479
uh spice of life Blockhead clone for

2446
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:03,560
quite a few years but more more of an

2447
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:06,718
outdoor uh project so when I breed for

2448
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:09,440
outdoors uh vers indoors I I do

2449
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:12,599
completely different things for my for

2450
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:16,279
outdoor breeding uh I I'll leave all my

2451
01:48:12,599 --> 01:48:18,480
males outside until the very end uh see

2452
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:20,960
you know what's going to flower first

2453
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:24,439
under the natural light

2454
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:27,960
uh grow structure this that or the other

2455
01:48:24,439 --> 01:48:29,238
and you know for for outside uh like

2456
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:32,279
right now I'm working I'm trying to

2457
01:48:29,238 --> 01:48:35,158
finish out my Blockhead this year it uh

2458
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:37,158
the blockhead I used the same Jacks

2459
01:48:35,158 --> 01:48:40,279
cleaner for the cush cleaner for my

2460
01:48:37,158 --> 01:48:44,679
original cross uh I back crossed it

2461
01:48:40,279 --> 01:48:48,479
twice to the Clone but the Clone would

2462
01:48:44,679 --> 01:48:50,719
do this thing outside to where like the

2463
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:53,559
very tip of the plant would would die

2464
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:56,118
off or just one branch would die off on

2465
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:58,679
it and without fail like it you know it

2466
01:48:56,118 --> 01:49:00,519
did it every year just the Clone and

2467
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:02,560
when I started back Crossing it I

2468
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,679
started noticing it was actually going

2469
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,880
through into the uh into the seed I

2470
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:09,920
don't know I I still don't know what it

2471
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:13,920
is so then I started uh you know making

2472
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:16,920
f2s f3s f4s with it uh breeding that

2473
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:19,118
part of it out so for for you know

2474
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:22,480
outdoor seed uh especially with this

2475
01:49:19,118 --> 01:49:24,639
Blockhead you know picked my this year I

2476
01:49:22,479 --> 01:49:27,158
took clones off all the males and just

2477
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:31,079
let them all do their thing outside and

2478
01:49:27,158 --> 01:49:33,920
then I picked out uh several of the

2479
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:36,800
earliest ones to start

2480
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:40,359
flowering um got those you know set

2481
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:43,560
aside and then uh you know take cuts off

2482
01:49:40,359 --> 01:49:45,439
of the females that are the earliest um

2483
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:47,080
that are the ones that are starting to

2484
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:49,359
flower

2485
01:49:47,079 --> 01:49:51,399
first so that's where I'm at right now I

2486
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:54,679
got clones of every everybody set aside

2487
01:49:51,399 --> 01:49:56,879
the males uh a reverse them come this

2488
01:49:54,679 --> 01:50:00,239
winter inside to see you know which

2489
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:03,520
one's got the tur profile I want and uh

2490
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:05,158
from there then next season you know

2491
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:08,280
during during winter hopefully I'll have

2492
01:50:05,158 --> 01:50:10,439
enough time to uh you know cross the

2493
01:50:08,279 --> 01:50:12,559
males to the females that I like and

2494
01:50:10,439 --> 01:50:14,719
then I'll test them out next year and

2495
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:17,560
and see what see what happens or you

2496
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:22,039
know which stud worked the best and

2497
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:22,039
Carry On from there doing it that way

2498
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:30,119
sounds yeah after the blockhead uh you

2499
01:50:26,279 --> 01:50:32,000
know I've wanted the roadkill skunk but

2500
01:50:30,118 --> 01:50:33,839
I I just think that thing is

2501
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,439
goner

2502
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:40,599
um I've spent tens of thousands of

2503
01:50:36,439 --> 01:50:44,399
dollars on fake seeds Cuts uh driven All

2504
01:50:40,599 --> 01:50:47,119
Over America to fine Cuts people say

2505
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:48,479
they have the cuts you know usually

2506
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:49,679
they're just trying to trade for the

2507
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:54,118
stuff that I got and they give me

2508
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:57,560
something you know completely off and uh

2509
01:50:54,118 --> 01:50:59,679
but I I don't uh I'd like to work CBD

2510
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:02,400
I'd like to make some CBD lines but I'm

2511
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:05,719
just uh I got a bunch of these Panama

2512
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:08,479
CBD that Mr Bob Hill gave me I like to

2513
01:51:05,719 --> 01:51:11,439
work those but as of right now the uh

2514
01:51:08,479 --> 01:51:12,839
the labs are all cut off to me they

2515
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:14,000
won't let me take anything in to get

2516
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:17,039
tested

2517
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,960
so until I can find a testing facility

2518
01:51:17,039 --> 01:51:21,760
I'm kind of put on hold with the

2519
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:24,439
CBDs uh I was even thinking about you

2520
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:27,599
know doing some hemp lines

2521
01:51:24,439 --> 01:51:32,638
um I think that might be a thing in the

2522
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:35,760
future but uh really after the the

2523
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:39,639
sfv if I can ever get that thing right

2524
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:42,000
I've I've been going back to it um for

2525
01:51:39,639 --> 01:51:43,719
years and years just uh thinking I got

2526
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,560
it right grew out the seeds it's not

2527
01:51:43,719 --> 01:51:48,239
what I've been looking for so I start

2528
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:51,039
over and we'll see what happens with

2529
01:51:48,238 --> 01:51:53,279
that one but I don't really have uh

2530
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:55,840
much more in the works than what I've

2531
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:59,840
already done

2532
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:01,840
um I think uh yeah well one one thing I

2533
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:04,639
wanted to ask in relation to the seed

2534
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:06,960
thing quickly was when you do your feno

2535
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:08,880
hunting or maybe more specifically when

2536
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,880
you're testing lines you create how many

2537
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:16,078
seeds do you like to pop at any one

2538
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:18,039
time as many as I can as uh uh let's

2539
01:52:16,078 --> 01:52:20,639
just put it this way I got chased out of

2540
01:52:18,039 --> 01:52:22,519
Trinity County by the police

2541
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:25,359
and when they came over to my property

2542
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:28,040
they said that they were they would have

2543
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:31,679
loved to arrest me but they didn't have

2544
01:52:28,039 --> 01:52:31,679
the manpower to cut down my

2545
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:39,560
Gardens so as much as I can that's a

2546
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,198
good answer and so in general how

2547
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:43,440
important is it do you think that people

2548
01:52:41,198 --> 01:52:45,158
do engage in the whole kind of art of

2549
01:52:43,439 --> 01:52:49,399
pheno

2550
01:52:45,158 --> 01:52:51,559
hunting absolutely uh uh 100% you know

2551
01:52:49,399 --> 01:52:54,039
just

2552
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:56,560
what what you want to find the new new

2553
01:52:54,039 --> 01:52:58,359
or or something that you know is special

2554
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:01,719
to your heart or to your to your taste

2555
01:52:58,359 --> 01:53:03,319
buds uh got to pop seeds or we're just

2556
01:53:01,719 --> 01:53:05,319
going to be stuck with this purple punch

2557
01:53:03,319 --> 01:53:09,559
forever you

2558
01:53:05,319 --> 01:53:11,639
know yeah yeah I understand that so

2559
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:13,320
something I surprisingly haven't asked

2560
01:53:11,639 --> 01:53:15,400
yet you mentioned earlier you know you

2561
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:17,639
did the whole rock wool slab thing do

2562
01:53:15,399 --> 01:53:21,839
you grow organically now and what style

2563
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:26,960
of growing do you use in general uh I

2564
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:30,639
grow uh I do everything um for

2565
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:33,840
outdoor I'm not I'm not 100% uh organic

2566
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:35,560
I keep my soil completely organic like

2567
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:38,400
no no liquid bottles nothing in the

2568
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:41,840
plastic ever will touch my soil but I do

2569
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:45,078
foler spray with uh you know certain

2570
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:49,319
bottle nutrients so that that's uh but

2571
01:53:45,078 --> 01:53:51,319
for you know head stash um I was doing

2572
01:53:49,319 --> 01:53:54,920
uh Oran Organics mixing all my

2573
01:53:51,319 --> 01:53:58,238
amendments uh but then I found a a super

2574
01:53:54,920 --> 01:54:02,039
soil that they make out of out of out in

2575
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:04,439
organ and I think they use the dragonfly

2576
01:54:02,039 --> 01:54:06,560
Earth medicine is that the name of those

2577
01:54:04,439 --> 01:54:09,598
guys I think they use their stuff inside

2578
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:11,880
the soil uh works great I just dump a

2579
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:13,840
bag you know a bag of it inside of a pot

2580
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:17,520
and plant and I'm good to go just

2581
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:22,520
straight water uh but you know that term

2582
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:24,560
organic uh you know I use drip lines so

2583
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:26,199
I know a lot of people will tell me it's

2584
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:31,039
not organic because I'm using plastic

2585
01:54:26,198 --> 01:54:35,000
drip lines or whatnot and and uh but and

2586
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:37,560
then for indoor um I I I learned with

2587
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,920
General Hydroponics and

2588
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:45,400
rockol and then uh later in life I did

2589
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:48,319
go to all soil um I I had done Organics

2590
01:54:45,399 --> 01:54:50,279
I I tried uh aquaponics before with the

2591
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:52,198
Guppies and

2592
01:54:50,279 --> 01:54:53,840
uh ended up just killing all these fish

2593
01:54:52,198 --> 01:54:56,439
over and over again so I stopped that

2594
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:57,360
that was pretty hard I've done nft I've

2595
01:54:56,439 --> 01:54:59,678
done

2596
01:54:57,359 --> 01:55:04,759
aeroponics

2597
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:08,960
uh for and really I'll just use whatever

2598
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:12,400
is free to me uh there was a a company

2599
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:15,158
growth science um they sent me like a

2600
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:18,879
good like six Monon of of fertilizer so

2601
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:21,559
I used that for indoor uh the past year

2602
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:23,880
and then um

2603
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:26,920
yeah it just depends on the situation

2604
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:29,319
where I'm at and what I'm after pretty

2605
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:31,560
much yeah okay I mean it makes sense

2606
01:55:29,319 --> 01:55:33,118
right so do you ultimately prefer

2607
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:34,400
organic I mean you kind of alluded when

2608
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:38,920
you said head

2609
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:43,279
stash yeah yeah definitely for smoke

2610
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:45,840
like uh herb grown in rock wool has a

2611
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:48,759
certain look to it and like always has

2612
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:50,679
that same kind of certain look to it and

2613
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,599
a certain flavor to it it it definitely

2614
01:55:50,679 --> 01:55:55,920
sticks out to me I could I could pick it

2615
01:55:52,599 --> 01:55:59,199
out like night and day uh

2616
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:02,639
Organics By far for head stash always

2617
01:55:59,198 --> 01:56:06,000
turns out the nicest ta the tastiest for

2618
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:09,000
me um but for outdoor you know like

2619
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,560
outdoor production it's just not cost

2620
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,319
efficient it it just doesn't work out

2621
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:15,920
it's it's not like uh you you don't get

2622
01:56:13,319 --> 01:56:18,319
that extra Buck because it's organic and

2623
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:22,039
not only that most times uh your yield

2624
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:24,158
will go down just a slight bit but for

2625
01:56:22,039 --> 01:56:26,960
the most uh I like to do that Tom Hill

2626
01:56:24,158 --> 01:56:30,158
mix uh out outside and then you know

2627
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:33,840
I'll also as as a base it's really good

2628
01:56:30,158 --> 01:56:36,519
chicken [ __ ] bone meal um oyster can't

2629
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:40,000
really go wrong with it solid it's been

2630
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:41,679
proven um it's proven test of time with

2631
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,719
with those old school humble Growers

2632
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:44,118
they've been they've been using that

2633
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:47,118
stutsman

2634
01:56:44,118 --> 01:56:48,238
forever yeah yeah 100% And it even flows

2635
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:50,000
through into a lot of the no toil

2636
01:56:48,238 --> 01:56:52,519
recipes today

2637
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,560
so something I get asked a lot of

2638
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:58,000
questions about but sadly I don't really

2639
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:59,560
have a lot of answers for is when in

2640
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,800
regards to being an outdoor grow what

2641
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:02,920
are some of your tips for getting the

2642
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,800
plants big do you like to veg them

2643
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:06,279
indoors do you do like some light depth

2644
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:07,199
thing or how do you get him nice and big

2645
01:57:06,279 --> 01:57:09,960
in

2646
01:57:07,198 --> 01:57:12,238
vegge uh start from a

2647
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:16,520
seed SE seed

2648
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:19,718
always um I I start my

2649
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:21,480
seeds about the middle of March I'll get

2650
01:57:19,719 --> 01:57:23,880
them big inside and then from there I'll

2651
01:57:21,479 --> 01:57:26,359
put them into a greenhouse and then from

2652
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:28,760
there they go outside so by the time

2653
01:57:26,359 --> 01:57:31,118
they're actually reach their hole or

2654
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:34,199
their pot or you know whatever style

2655
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:36,279
it's going in uh they're already like a

2656
01:57:34,198 --> 01:57:39,598
good 3 to four

2657
01:57:36,279 --> 01:57:42,800
feet you know and then from there then

2658
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:44,679
you just uh just let it do its thing

2659
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:47,480
give it water give it sunshine it's good

2660
01:57:44,679 --> 01:57:50,840
to go I mean it's a PL you know it's a

2661
01:57:47,479 --> 01:57:53,479
weed that stuff just grows like crazy

2662
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:55,039
and so do you have a dedicated IPM

2663
01:57:53,479 --> 01:57:56,919
regime or how do you deal with pests

2664
01:57:55,039 --> 01:58:00,679
when they

2665
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:02,800
arise uh I don't don't really uh deal

2666
01:58:00,679 --> 01:58:04,199
with much pest I'm I'm everything is

2667
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:06,840
pretty clean

2668
01:58:04,198 --> 01:58:08,960
inside uh before they even go

2669
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:13,679
outside

2670
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:17,679
uh so I mean I I don't do much uh spring

2671
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:21,039
for anything like that and if uh I I

2672
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:25,039
have been battling um what is it

2673
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:27,880
scales for for a while now uh I try

2674
01:58:25,039 --> 01:58:29,118
ladybugs this that the other but I just

2675
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:30,279
I just can't shake them right now I

2676
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:32,399
don't know what the deal is with those

2677
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:34,759
things for kind of a pain in the

2678
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:38,960
ass yeah yeah for

2679
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:41,159
sure so one thing you may or may not be

2680
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:43,639
experienced with how do you feel about

2681
01:58:41,158 --> 01:58:46,719
reving cuts and more specifically do you

2682
01:58:43,639 --> 01:58:50,440
feel like it causes any damage to the

2683
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:53,560
cutting uh so when I was

2684
01:58:50,439 --> 01:58:56,839
growing train wreck I didn't keep

2685
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:59,520
mothers of it I just went uh I I just

2686
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:02,560
took Cuts as right when uh the plant

2687
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:04,760
would flip I would take cuts off of off

2688
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:06,639
the clones and I did that for about a

2689
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:10,360
three for three years straight with that

2690
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:14,960
train wreck and I I never really noticed

2691
01:59:10,359 --> 01:59:18,198
a difference and then with reving plants

2692
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:20,560
uh I rev my seeds all the time um just

2693
01:59:18,198 --> 01:59:22,960
to save space if I don't have enough

2694
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:25,840
space to take clones off of

2695
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:28,000
Everybody uh even with the females you

2696
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:30,840
know I I'll just grow them out if I like

2697
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,920
one of them uh you know I just cut cut

2698
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:35,719
half of it down and then put the rest of

2699
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:39,639
it in back in the vegro and let it you

2700
01:59:35,719 --> 01:59:41,800
know reveg back out but I I'm sure if

2701
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:44,078
you kept doing it over and over and over

2702
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:46,719
again for years and years yeah you you

2703
01:59:44,078 --> 01:59:50,679
notice a difference but I I've never

2704
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:54,039
noticed a difference off of uh doing a

2705
01:59:50,679 --> 01:59:55,199
myself yeah okay so it's going to seem a

2706
01:59:54,039 --> 01:59:56,920
little weird question but I definitely

2707
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:59,158
want to run this one by especially in

2708
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:00,399
light of our purple punch comments you

2709
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:02,198
know a lot of people in general when

2710
02:00:00,399 --> 02:00:03,719
they talk about purple strains there's

2711
02:00:02,198 --> 02:00:05,598
kind of this undertone of like how you

2712
02:00:03,719 --> 02:00:07,078
know purple weed is always weak and it

2713
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:09,440
seems to be you know an idea that comes

2714
02:00:07,078 --> 02:00:11,000
up again and again do you kind of agree

2715
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:12,799
with that in general or do you just

2716
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:15,039
think it's the purple strains that are

2717
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,520
currently around are just maybe not the

2718
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:20,560
most

2719
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:25,280
potent uh no I I think uh purple weed

2720
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:27,880
and that like Calo type uh that citrusy

2721
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:30,599
kind of herb has always been

2722
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:32,880
weak there's there's a a certain few

2723
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:34,760
that pop out every now and then that

2724
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:37,679
that are really good like the purple

2725
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:39,280
urle I mean that thing's potent it's

2726
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:42,239
strong it knocks me

2727
02:00:39,279 --> 02:00:44,519
out uh but then again purple urle is is

2728
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:47,279
one of those purple strains where you

2729
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:49,679
need the cold to make it really purple

2730
02:00:47,279 --> 02:00:52,759
out um

2731
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:58,039
but I think generally I you know most

2732
02:00:52,760 --> 02:01:00,320
purple her uh is generally on the weaker

2733
02:00:58,039 --> 02:01:02,800
side yeah

2734
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:04,519
understandable so a few little legal

2735
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:07,880
questions before we get into the tail

2736
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:10,360
end of things how do you feel that the

2737
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:13,599
industry is going to evolve in light of

2738
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:17,559
the legal changes that came to pass with

2739
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:20,679
uh prop 64 and do you feel that it is

2740
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:23,840
the impending death of the m pop

2741
02:01:20,679 --> 02:01:27,599
business yeah yeah I hate to say it but

2742
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:29,960
yeah I I think it's it's the end of

2743
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:33,719
quality herb quality

2744
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:35,639
genetics uh there's going to be a lot of

2745
02:01:33,719 --> 02:01:38,480
I I don't I don't I don't see people

2746
02:01:35,639 --> 02:01:41,239
smoking weed really in 20 years I I feel

2747
02:01:38,479 --> 02:01:44,198
like they're all just going to go to the

2748
02:01:41,238 --> 02:01:45,718
pen I I think uh the flowers is just

2749
02:01:44,198 --> 02:01:47,000
going to be a thing in the past but you

2750
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:49,359
know that that's just my personal

2751
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:54,078
opinion I think there'll always be that

2752
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:55,759
little uh uh you know connoisseur group

2753
02:01:54,078 --> 02:02:00,198
like like the micr

2754
02:01:55,760 --> 02:02:03,480
Brew but for the most part uh I I think

2755
02:02:00,198 --> 02:02:06,638
the whole cannabis culture and the mom

2756
02:02:03,479 --> 02:02:09,439
and pop thing uh California has

2757
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:13,319
definitely killed it and are is trying

2758
02:02:09,439 --> 02:02:16,759
very very hard to uh end it and just

2759
02:02:13,319 --> 02:02:20,960
pretty much let this uh a massive

2760
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:20,960
corporate takeover pretty much

2761
02:02:21,319 --> 02:02:28,039
yeah yeah so do you think that uh with

2762
02:02:26,039 --> 02:02:31,078
those changes all of the kind of

2763
02:02:28,039 --> 02:02:32,479
cultural events like the cups and um you

2764
02:02:31,078 --> 02:02:33,960
know Harvest parties and things like

2765
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:36,238
that will kind of forever be different

2766
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:40,520
or it'll still

2767
02:02:36,238 --> 02:02:42,078
survive the the events are done I feel

2768
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:45,639
like I think they they're going to be

2769
02:02:42,078 --> 02:02:50,078
completely finished uh you know the the

2770
02:02:45,639 --> 02:02:53,078
the uh humble counties DND in away I

2771
02:02:50,078 --> 02:02:55,599
mean even property values out there you

2772
02:02:53,078 --> 02:02:58,799
know land that was selling for a million

2773
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:01,159
or two million a few years ago isn't

2774
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:05,320
even selling for 300,000

2775
02:03:01,158 --> 02:03:07,238
now it's uh you know they killed it

2776
02:03:05,319 --> 02:03:08,759
Humble County is doing this thing if if

2777
02:03:07,238 --> 02:03:11,799
you're growing without a permit right

2778
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:13,280
now they send you a letter and they'll

2779
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:15,039
give you a couple days to cut down your

2780
02:03:13,279 --> 02:03:17,198
garden and if you don't cut it down

2781
02:03:15,039 --> 02:03:21,118
within those days you're going to get a

2782
02:03:17,198 --> 02:03:25,158
fine for $10,000 a day that every day

2783
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:27,559
your garden up so I mean 10 grand a day

2784
02:03:25,158 --> 02:03:29,399
it it made a lot of people shut down and

2785
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:32,520
and a lot of people got those letters

2786
02:03:29,399 --> 02:03:33,198
already up up over there so that that's

2787
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:35,400
you

2788
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:37,359
know they're they're going to turn

2789
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:39,078
Humble County into a ghost town I mean

2790
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:40,960
the whole the whole Emerald Triangle is

2791
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:43,118
probably going to become a ghost town in

2792
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:45,639
a while property valleys are just

2793
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:48,598
completely plummeting

2794
02:03:45,639 --> 02:03:49,960
uh the the harvest parties uh you know

2795
02:03:48,599 --> 02:03:51,440
that's well always be around there's

2796
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:54,279
always going to be that small group of

2797
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:55,719
people you know who's all stoked you

2798
02:03:54,279 --> 02:03:57,399
want to share your flowers at the end of

2799
02:03:55,719 --> 02:03:59,078
the year you know so you smoke mine I

2800
02:03:57,399 --> 02:04:01,839
want to smoke some of yours let's you

2801
02:03:59,078 --> 02:04:05,479
know let's talk see what's good you

2802
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:09,719
know so I don't see that ever going away

2803
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:13,718
but uh the whole cannabis culture thing

2804
02:04:09,719 --> 02:04:16,639
I think is uh definitely dying out very

2805
02:04:13,719 --> 02:04:18,359
fast yeah so I mean in the previous

2806
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:20,199
question you alluded to you know the

2807
02:04:18,359 --> 02:04:24,198
coniss Market do you think that'll

2808
02:04:20,198 --> 02:04:24,198
almost become synonymous with the black

2809
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:31,400
market yeah I mean you know just like

2810
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,679
Colorado uh and all the other states

2811
02:04:31,399 --> 02:04:35,638
that had legalized beforehand the laws

2812
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:37,239
are going to are going to you know

2813
02:04:35,639 --> 02:04:39,520
they're working it out so they're

2814
02:04:37,238 --> 02:04:43,078
constantly going to be changing so who

2815
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:46,079
knows maybe uh they they'll throw us

2816
02:04:43,078 --> 02:04:48,599
little guys a bone here and uh not make

2817
02:04:46,078 --> 02:04:50,960
it so rough uh maybe they'll they'll cut

2818
02:04:48,599 --> 02:04:54,078
down down on the on these crazy

2819
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:55,960
taxes uh maybe some of these landlords

2820
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:57,479
that are trying to charge ridiculous

2821
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:59,198
prices for where houses are going to

2822
02:04:57,479 --> 02:05:02,000
realize you know they're just wasting

2823
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:04,479
people's times a lot of a lot of these

2824
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,198
uh a lot of these poor investors that

2825
02:05:04,479 --> 02:05:07,558
are throwing in millions and millions of

2826
02:05:06,198 --> 02:05:09,678
dollars to hear some like you know

2827
02:05:07,559 --> 02:05:12,279
20-year-old talking about oh I could do

2828
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:14,000
this make you rich rich rich you know

2829
02:05:12,279 --> 02:05:17,759
they're all going to go belly up in a

2830
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:19,599
couple of years um the same thing it

2831
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:22,159
happened in Colorado it happened in

2832
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:26,480
Washington it's going to happen

2833
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:29,519
here yeah so if you could make say one

2834
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:31,279
change to the legislation that in your

2835
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,040
mind at least would hopefully ensure

2836
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:34,960
that the canine kind of continues in a

2837
02:05:33,039 --> 02:05:36,639
healthy direction what sort of change

2838
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,760
would you want to make or do you feel

2839
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:41,960
that no change needs to be made uh they

2840
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:44,639
just need to lower the taxes it's just

2841
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:45,800
too much there there's nothing left

2842
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:47,400
there's nothing left you're you're going

2843
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:49,199
to be working your ass off just trying

2844
02:05:47,399 --> 02:05:51,558
to break even

2845
02:05:49,198 --> 02:05:54,879
uh you know each each city has its own

2846
02:05:51,559 --> 02:05:57,039
tax and then you got the state tax and

2847
02:05:54,880 --> 02:06:00,239
it's it's just it's just ridiculous for

2848
02:05:57,039 --> 02:06:03,679
for a little grow I mean you know for a

2849
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:07,000
yearly license some of uh some of these

2850
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:09,520
cities you know want anywhere from 40 to

2851
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,399
$100,000 every year and then and then

2852
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:14,639
you got you know employees you got to

2853
02:06:11,399 --> 02:06:17,479
pay for electricity you got to pay for

2854
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:19,920
rent uh warehouse space that would

2855
02:06:17,479 --> 02:06:22,919
normally go for 80 cents to a dollar per

2856
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:25,599
square foot is not anywhere from3 to4 do

2857
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:30,000
per square foot uh there's just there's

2858
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:33,440
just nothing left over you know

2859
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,880
yeah so I guess as a more International

2860
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:37,198
based question and just one that

2861
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:38,960
obviously bit relevant to home here in

2862
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:41,558
Australia do you think countries should

2863
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:44,559
give up their right to be able to have a

2864
02:06:41,559 --> 02:06:46,480
personal grow if it means that they can

2865
02:06:44,559 --> 02:06:50,599
get access to Legal cannabis but it's

2866
02:06:46,479 --> 02:06:50,598
being done through say a big Corporation

2867
02:06:52,359 --> 02:06:56,639
I mean if that's all you got then yeah

2868
02:06:54,880 --> 02:07:00,920
but I mean if there's any other options

2869
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:03,639
like uh you know I mean for the for the

2870
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:07,000
every day or guess just you know it's

2871
02:07:03,639 --> 02:07:09,480
not the prop 64 is not all that horrible

2872
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,479
you know everybody can grow a few plants

2873
02:07:09,479 --> 02:07:12,839
so that I mean that's cool you know

2874
02:07:11,479 --> 02:07:15,879
you're not getting thrown in jail

2875
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:17,440
anymore for well I I guess now you would

2876
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:18,960
be able to or they're going to start

2877
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:21,078
throwing people in jail I get anything

2878
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:22,679
over six plants again is a felony out

2879
02:07:21,078 --> 02:07:24,880
here which is

2880
02:07:22,679 --> 02:07:27,319
ridiculous

2881
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:30,000
but uh you know if that's all you got

2882
02:07:27,319 --> 02:07:31,920
then yeah you know there's there's uh

2883
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,800
nothing wrong with it it's better than

2884
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:36,399
uh you know as a kid growing up in the

2885
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:38,960
bay I mean I had a I had a friend that

2886
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:41,439
got some guy unloaded the clip in him

2887
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:44,480
for a quarter pound of weed you know it

2888
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:46,839
was uh 1,200 bucks back then in the

2889
02:07:44,479 --> 02:07:49,558
early 90s and and they killed them for

2890
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:51,719
it so you know get getting rid of that

2891
02:07:49,559 --> 02:07:53,520
element yeah I'm all about the uh

2892
02:07:51,719 --> 02:07:57,198
legalization get rid of that whole

2893
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:58,599
criminal um gangster whatever but you

2894
02:07:57,198 --> 02:08:01,719
know the way they're they're going

2895
02:07:58,599 --> 02:08:02,679
around with uh these crazy taxes the

2896
02:08:01,719 --> 02:08:05,399
crazy

2897
02:08:02,679 --> 02:08:07,800
regulations um you know they you should

2898
02:08:05,399 --> 02:08:11,719
be able to use whatever they're using on

2899
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:14,480
our food on on cannabis which you can't

2900
02:08:11,719 --> 02:08:17,279
you can't even use that uh uh safer so

2901
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:20,238
BT for you know the caterpillars

2902
02:08:17,279 --> 02:08:22,559
anymore yeah yeah that's that's a bummer

2903
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:24,039
isn't it cuz that's a good product yeah

2904
02:08:22,559 --> 02:08:25,760
it's a great product now you know I'm

2905
02:08:24,039 --> 02:08:28,639
stuck out there with tweezers picking

2906
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:31,199
off caterpillars all day long it's uh

2907
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:33,400
it's not fun so I guess on the flip side

2908
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:34,719
question what are you excited for in

2909
02:08:33,399 --> 02:08:36,039
regards to the can scene you know is

2910
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:37,399
there any kind of interesting develops

2911
02:08:36,039 --> 02:08:39,118
that have really caught your eye and

2912
02:08:37,399 --> 02:08:43,879
you're a bit optimistic

2913
02:08:39,118 --> 02:08:46,719
about no no nothing I'm uh I'm looking

2914

for a new place to move to uh some place

2915
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:52,639
a little bit more lenient not as

2916
02:08:48,078 --> 02:08:55,238
expensive ensive uh you know if if uh

2917

some corporate dude wants to hire me I'd

2918
02:08:55,238 --> 02:08:59,319
probably take a job at this

2919
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:03,078
point yeah

2920
02:08:59,319 --> 02:09:05,639
bu yeah yeah it's uh I mean we had a

2921

good ride for a good solid 20 years it

2922
02:09:05,639 --> 02:09:11,880
was uh it was pretty damn good like I

2923
02:09:08,279 --> 02:09:14,359
mean I had uh I had uh some weed taken

2924
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:15,920
from me by the sheriff's before and then

2925
02:09:14,359 --> 02:09:17,639
they sent me a letter and they're like

2926
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:20,359
come pick it up and they kept it for

2927
02:09:17,639 --> 02:09:21,920
about a good six months and then uh when

2928
02:09:20,359 --> 02:09:23,639
I picked it up out of the sheriff's

2929
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:25,760
office they when I was there they're

2930

like you know take a look make sure it's

2932
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:32,920
still good and they they kept it better

2933
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:35,319
than I could have they kept it in a nice

2934
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:38,440
like you know consistent like 60 degree

2935
02:09:35,319 --> 02:09:40,599
room all all climate controlled and I

2936
02:09:38,439 --> 02:09:44,198
mean I was pretty shocked how well they

2937
02:09:40,599 --> 02:09:48,000
kept it that's pretty

2938
02:09:44,198 --> 02:09:49,919
neat um cool all right so onto the tail

2939

02:10:37,238 --> 02:10:41,039
makes the uh the list almost every

2958
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:43,439
interview

2959
02:10:41,039 --> 02:10:44,960
actually right right you know what the

2960
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:49,558
oldtimers tell

2961
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:52,439
me is uh it's

2962
02:10:49,559 --> 02:10:56,000
sucked they they say you know it was a

2963
02:10:52,439 --> 02:10:58,719
small little Afghan plant um you know

2964
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:04,520
the same time uh when the roadkill came

2965
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:06,198
out is when uh is when uh you know the

2966
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:08,520
the states were allowing a lot of uh the

2967
02:11:06,198 --> 02:11:11,839
Afghan Freedom Fighters into the country

2968
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:14,840
you know it was what the Soviet uh went

2969
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,639
to Afghanistan like 79 to like the late

2970
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:20,199
80s or something like that and uh you

2971
02:11:17,639 --> 02:11:22,000
know when the CIA got involved you know

2972
02:11:20,198 --> 02:11:24,678
helping the freed The Afghani Freedom

2973
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:27,679
Fighters a lot of them got uh you know

2974
02:11:24,679 --> 02:11:30,760
were getting Refugee or play Refugee out

2975
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:35,078
out here and with a lot of them you know

2976
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:37,320
they they brought the seeds and uh so

2977
02:11:35,078 --> 02:11:39,279
you know there were short little indicas

2978
02:11:37,319 --> 02:11:41,319
and even when I was getting the the

2979
02:11:39,279 --> 02:11:44,078
skunk back in in like my high school

2980
02:11:41,319 --> 02:11:46,319
days you could you knowing what I know

2981
02:11:44,078 --> 02:11:48,799
now it was definitely indicas because of

2982
02:11:46,319 --> 02:11:52,118
how fat the little sugar leaves were

2983
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:56,320
that were cocoon the buds and um so you

2984
02:11:52,118 --> 02:11:59,719
know the Oldtimer is telling me that uh

2985
02:11:56,319 --> 02:12:01,319
that the the old roadkill skunk sucked

2986
02:11:59,719 --> 02:12:04,559
and I'm like what what do you mean it

2987
02:12:01,319 --> 02:12:05,880
sucked that stuff was great but you know

2988
02:12:04,559 --> 02:12:10,360
that's when I first started kind of

2989
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:12,279
smoking herb it was uh uh you know

2990
02:12:10,359 --> 02:12:14,399
pretty pretty much anything back then

2991
02:12:12,279 --> 02:12:17,198
would have gotten me high you know but

2992
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:19,519
uh they say you know it was it was it

2993
02:12:17,198 --> 02:12:21,598
was short little plant it was a pain in

2994
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:23,719
the ass to trim and it didn't get him

2995
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:25,559
high after you know they they smoked it

2996
02:12:23,719 --> 02:12:27,599
a while and then like you know all all

2997
02:12:25,559 --> 02:12:30,639
the fruits and a lot of the Dutch stuff

2998
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:33,639
came through that grew big was you know

2999
02:12:30,639 --> 02:12:37,520
a lot more stronger and and uh easy to

3000
02:12:33,639 --> 02:12:42,199
trim you know so that that uh that old

3001
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:45,679
roadkill just want extinct from uh from

3002
02:12:42,198 --> 02:12:48,439
you know uh just people not Desiring the

3003
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:49,880
uh the the the traits from it well at

3004
02:12:48,439 --> 02:12:50,759
least old school Growers that were

3005
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:55,559
growing

3006
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:58,119
it yeah okay so what in your opinion is

3007
02:12:55,559 --> 02:13:02,440
your favorite strin of all

3008
02:12:58,118 --> 02:13:08,158
time OG Kush can't get enough of

3009
02:13:02,439 --> 02:13:11,558
it hell yeah that that SF it's uh tried

3010
02:13:08,158 --> 02:13:13,839
and true it works every time even to to

3011
02:13:11,559 --> 02:13:16,119
this day you

3012
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:18,440
know so on the opposite end of the

3013
02:13:16,118 --> 02:13:20,880
spectrum what is the strain that's least

3014
02:13:18,439 --> 02:13:23,879
jive with

3015
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:23,880
you

3016
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:30,598
uh man you know I I I really like the

3017
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,559
flavors of a lot of the the hazes and

3018
02:13:30,599 --> 02:13:35,199
stuff like that but there the heavy

3019
02:13:32,559 --> 02:13:37,039
sativas get me oh you know what there's

3020
02:13:35,198 --> 02:13:39,198
a couple other strands I like to throw

3021
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:43,039
in they're the old school ones that I

3022
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:45,759
miss um yeah in the Taho

3023
02:13:43,039 --> 02:13:48,719
area uh we used to get this one called

3024
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:50,079
Afghan queen that was is really amazing

3025
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:51,439
and from the same guy we were getting

3026
02:13:50,078 --> 02:13:54,399
one called the

3027
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:58,158
club uh and both of them were were just

3028
02:13:54,399 --> 02:14:00,359
just um head twisting and then in the

3029
02:13:58,158 --> 02:14:03,198
early 90s there was one called the

3030
02:14:00,359 --> 02:14:07,598
asthma in the Santa Cruz mountains that

3031
02:14:03,198 --> 02:14:10,839
it used to get um and I missed that

3032
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:14,319
one what else was there uh there was a

3033
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:16,599
Romulan uh not the we had two romulans

3034
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:18,399
floating around we had one that was a

3035
02:14:16,599 --> 02:14:21,800
short little indica

3036
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:24,198
piny real piny tasting to it and then we

3037
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:26,639
had another one that was more sativa

3038
02:14:24,198 --> 02:14:30,519
that had this like

3039
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:32,599
grapy um like a creamy grape taste to it

3040
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:37,280
that was that was really really good

3041
02:14:32,599 --> 02:14:39,360
miss that one yeah oh man yeah

3042
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:42,279
yeah starting to think about it I could

3043
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:46,359
probably name off a few dozen strains

3044
02:14:42,279 --> 02:14:48,078
that I wish were still around but so

3045
02:14:46,359 --> 02:14:49,839
yeah what I was going to say is to jump

3046
02:14:48,078 --> 02:14:51,279
back to the question do we do we get a

3047
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:55,880
worse

3048
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:55,880
strain a worst strain

3049
02:14:58,039 --> 02:15:05,000
uh I can't really think of anything um I

3050
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:08,118
love it all bud it's all I love it all I

3051
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:11,479
love how they grow I love the

3052
02:15:08,118 --> 02:15:14,118
flavors um what would be one that I

3053
02:15:11,479 --> 02:15:14,118
didn't really

3054
02:15:15,359 --> 02:15:22,000
like I can't think of a single one it's

3055
02:15:18,198 --> 02:15:25,198
a good problem to have yeah it's not too

3056
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,238
bad so if you could go back to one place

3057
02:15:25,198 --> 02:15:30,319
in history and in time to collect some

3058
02:15:27,238 --> 02:15:33,638
land R seeds where would you

3059
02:15:30,319 --> 02:15:38,599
go uh you know I'm a I love my indic car

3060
02:15:33,639 --> 02:15:41,639
so so probably uh the the Kush mountain

3061
02:15:38,599 --> 02:15:45,639
ranges would have to be

3062
02:15:41,639 --> 02:15:49,359
it that's a good answer yeah um you know

3063
02:15:45,639 --> 02:15:53,719
Afghanistan Pakistan

3064
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:55,078
um you know nowadays it's uh I don't

3065
02:15:53,719 --> 02:15:58,000
know where you'd be able to find any

3066
02:15:55,078 --> 02:16:00,158
true land races almost every uh country

3067
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:04,719
has been watered down with either Dutch

3068
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:07,439
or you know American genetics by now

3069
02:16:04,719 --> 02:16:10,279
but yeah I would I would probably say

3070
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:14,078
you know uh late

3071
02:16:10,279 --> 02:16:16,920
70s about the late 70s in the Afghan

3072
02:16:14,078 --> 02:16:18,679
region or somewhere out over there where

3073
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:22,559
where things weren uh didn't get all

3074
02:16:18,679 --> 02:16:23,840
dutchified yet and and uh remain true

3075
02:16:22,559 --> 02:16:27,320
that you know things that they've

3076
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:31,319
probably been breeding for thousands of

3077
02:16:27,319 --> 02:16:31,319
years yeah that pure

3078
02:16:31,559 --> 02:16:38,519
pure so lucky last question what is your

3079
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:38,518
biggest hope for the Cannabis scene in

3080
02:16:39,079 --> 02:16:43,519
general oh go back how it

3081
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:51,800
was did you know um no I think things

3082
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:53,079
are good things are good uh you know

3083
02:16:51,799 --> 02:16:55,279
long as people aren't going getting

3084
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:58,280
thrown in jail for for little amounts of

3085
02:16:55,280 --> 02:17:00,439
weed and and uh you're able you know

3086

02:17:02,439 --> 02:17:08,960
all that's it the Sun keeps shining so

3089
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:12,239
