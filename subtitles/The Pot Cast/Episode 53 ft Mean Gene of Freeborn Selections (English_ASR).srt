excited for this one to happen so the

57
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,359
first thing I want to ask you what are

58
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:36,719
you currently smoking on

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,400
currently smoking on let's see right in

60
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,259
front of me the latest stuff that I got

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,019
which is not really that late I've had

62
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,899
it sitting here for a little bit

63
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,819
um I got a really cool uh LA

64
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,920
Confidential

65
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:53,399
from uh

66
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,799
from my friend who does uh Tyler Buds

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,599
and Roses he gave me some of this uh LA

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Confidential he said it was a nice run

69
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,719
and it's kind of cool I'd always

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,700
wondered

71
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,800
I heard that they use this thing they

72
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,399
call the AFI

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,239
um

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,760
to breed that and

75
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:16,080
it was really interesting to get it

76
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,759
because it's actually probably about the

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,519
closest weed I can remember seeing to

78
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,139
what we call Black Affy up here which

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,840
makes me wonder if there's any relation

80
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,158
or if it's just that it's that good kind

81
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,300
of uh

82
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:33,539
darker coffee Afghani type I mean it's

83
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,000
it's pretty common in California Afghani

84
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,859
so that's kind of out of out of the

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,680
ordinary because it was a it was a gift

86
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,379
but um pretty stuff really nice

87
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,519
yeah that's an interesting strain

88
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:47,759
because

89
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,340
a lot of people talk about how that

90
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,919
really special Alfie mother you

91
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,500
mentioned was replaced in subsequent

92
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:58,079
releases of that of the LA con with

93
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,840
something else I don't suppose you'd

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,260
ever tried the subsequent releases that

95
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,658
people weren't so impressed by

96
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:09,298
um this one I assume just judging by

97
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:11,519
what it looks like I assume is the

98
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,299
original one although I have really no

99
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,899
ground to stand on on that except for

100
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:21,660
saying that it really has an old old

101
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,519
Cali Afghani

102
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,340
um look it's very similar to what I have

103
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,879
that was the Hindu cross black Affy

104
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:32,159
back in the day that I made and um

105
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,500
the black Affy itself was a little less

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,180
resonance and then crossed with the

107
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,199
Hindu kind of beefed up the resin

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,959
content

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,600
and uh this was like pulling out they

110
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,918
could have told me oh I had I I I kept

111
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,800
some of those seeds and I grew this out

112
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,500
and I would have thought it was the same

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,240
uh Hindu cross uh black coffee

114
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,180
so that was kind of cool but I don't

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,040
remember ever seeing anything from the

116
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,220
later ones all I know is the first time

117
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,600
I saw LA Confidential

118
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:06,080
was at a point that was two thousand

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,800
uh seven

120
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,839
and 2007 yeah that would have been 2007

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,819
and I only remember because it was like

122
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,918
the first time I went to the emerald cup

123
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,659
when it was still a little event

124
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,659
and um

125
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,720
it was still at the area 101 there and

126
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,000
my friend who has a company now called

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
Giving Tree genetics which has really

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,160
nice stuff

129
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,719
um he had it and he had just come back

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,039
from Amsterdam and he was like yeah I

131
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,199
got all the different stuff over there

132
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,959
and this was one of the nice things and

133
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,639
it's called LA Confidential and we had

134
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,739
never heard of it we had never heard of

135
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,840
DNA we had never we didn't really know

136
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,800
anything about any like Seed Company

137
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,060
stuff other than like old Neville and uh

138
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,939
seed bank

139
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,038
and so he showed it to me and what I

140
00:05:53,939 --> 00:06:00,139
remember about that particular one was

141
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,860
that it was like a really sweet fruity

142
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,079
OG

143
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,360
and I was like wow this is this this is

144
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,279
[ __ ] bomb like it was really really

145
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,538
nice weed and he had grown he had

146
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,459
brought the seeds back and grown it

147
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:15,599
himself and he's a really good grower

148
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:17,758
from down the road from here and uh

149
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,160
you know kind of makes everything shine

150
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,199
and so it was like that was my first

151
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,060
experience with it and so I kind of

152
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,280
expected something like that when I saw

153
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,220
this and then to see how much it was

154
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,779
like the black Affy that's why it kind

155
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,800
of made me think like oh so maybe that

156
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:35,818
La AFI was very similar to

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,160
um

158
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,500
to the black Africa you know

159
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,840
so wow that's a that's a cool little

160
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,459
rundown on it all something which has

161
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,119
always piqued my interest especially

162
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:51,599
when I hear the term lafi and black Affy

163
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,720
in general it makes me wonder if this is

164
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,300
the same sort of Alfie which might have

165
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,979
gone into the creation of Urkel I just

166
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,100
at least whenever I hear Urkel I always

167
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:03,599
think black Alfie is that sort of what

168
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,379
you think or do you feel like they're

169
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,720
they're kind of bit different actually

170
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:12,060
well I mean the way genetics work it's

171
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,560
really hard to be able to call that kind

172
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,060
of stuff

173
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,699
um somebody like uh uh inspector at CSI

174
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,538
would have a better idea of what's

175
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,939
inside the gene pool because of um

176
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:30,598
because of us wanting that because a

177
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:34,139
selfie uh the Urkel what people I think

178
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:36,719
don't know there's a there's a

179
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,819
belief that a lot of people hold that if

180
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,520
you take something and you self it you

181
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,379
get a bunch more of the exact same plan

182
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,439
but the reality is when you sell

183
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:50,038
something it's the most extreme version

184
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:53,219
of an inbreeding you can do which will

185
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,060
reveal anything recessive that can pop

186
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,160
out

187
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,280
and

188
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,080
um of course show you also those those

189
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,179
those dominant things that are in that

190
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,038
plant so you get a picture of what the

191
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,780
parents were and you even get a picture

192
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,598
of what the grandparents were and the

193
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,459
great grandparents probably you know he

194
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,399
he might have a better idea but I've

195
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:17,899
kind of seen what he posts from it and

196
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:22,918
I've grown crosses of it

197
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:24,598
and uh inbred those and I haven't seen

198
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,418
anything that I would say as anything

199
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,519
like what

200
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:30,719
um the Affy was that I had the black

201
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,299
coffee

202
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,278
or

203
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,658
what obviously is the AFI that's in this

204
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:37,740
La conf

205
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:44,158
um

206
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:46,320
it uh it has more sweetness and

207
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,958
um Urkel the really really impressive

208
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,519
thing about Urkel to me was it has a

209
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,739
a kind of a rose a rose oil and a lime

210
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,519
peel

211
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,560
and

212
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,539
um things I associate with like fruits

213
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,079
fruit loops Flintstones Vitamins

214
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:06,539
artificial flavor candy things and a

215
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,560
nice little dose of some skunk on it

216
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:09,480
which

217
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,579
people don't think of it as but when you

218
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,379
have really nice outdoor Urkle it gets

219
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,220
this little bit of skunk over the top of

220
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,379
it

221
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,440
and uh

222
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:26,159
you know the AFI that I had was more of

223
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,160
a more of a earth spice licorice incense

224
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,920
um

225
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,359
and that's the same deal with this La

226
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,599
con so

227
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,100
I would say you know that the that the

228
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,839
the Urkel

229
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,399
I wouldn't be surprised if it has

230
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,200
something that's Afghani in it because

231
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,080
it's very short

232
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,100
um and stout and bushy it grows sideways

233
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,639
almost

234
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,839
faster than it wants to grow up

235
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,360
um

236
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,820
and it gets it gets nice big fat buds if

237
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,240
you grow it right like an Afghani

238
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,339
so I wouldn't be surprised if it has

239
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,459
um something like that in it I kind of

240
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,580
you know this is on a tangent but when I

241
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:08,518
was about nine years old

242
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,459
I went to Leggett to this lady's house

243
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,580
and this was when

244
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:18,179
this was when the movie Willow was brand

245
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,800
new and I watched the movie Willow there

246
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:23,099
and

247
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,000
when we were chilling there she pulled

248
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,339
out

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,278
some pounds of weed

250
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,920
and this was when I had only seen a

251
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,778
little bit of dried Weed really like and

252
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,579
had any interest in it because you're

253
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,259
just at that age where you're not just a

254
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,860
little little kid

255
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:42,240
and I looked at it and it was what she

256
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,360
called the purple

257
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,700
and it was more of a red purple than a

258
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,860
blue purple or a black purple

259
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,620
and it was purple from the inside out

260
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,959
and it had this particular sweet smell

261
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,700
and

262
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,619
that was the first time I had ever seen

263
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,660
weed that was purple and so it had this

264
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,539
impact in my head like whoa that's crazy

265
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,639
there's weed that's purple because to me

266
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,879
it was always like oh pot it kind of

267
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,639
smells like hippies burning sage and

268
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:15,320
it's green and then I saw this and I

269
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:19,379
went huh it smells like

270
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,899
sweetness and fruit and

271
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,820
it is purple so that was really really

272
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,379
weird to me so I remembered it it's like

273
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,420
probably the first wheat I really

274
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,220
remember anything about as far as

275
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:31,500
features besides it being some green

276
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:37,620
[ __ ] in a bag you know

277
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:39,778
and so in about 94 or 95 a lady who's a

278
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,820
really really close friend of mine who

279
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:44,939
who I consider like my Aunt who actually

280
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,379
moved up from Santa Cruz when my mom was

281
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,940
pregnant with me

282
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:52,559
and uh

283
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:55,279
in uh into 79 early 80.

284
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:59,578
um she moved up here and she had a place

285
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,539
and when I was uh proud for freshman

286
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,559
year

287
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,719
um

288
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,879
I moved up I lived with my sister for a

289
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,920
while and then my sister moved and when

290
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,419
she moved I still wanted to stay in

291
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,039
school because I didn't want to go back

292
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,139
to Sonoma

293
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,179
um where I had been living for eighth

294
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:18,179
grade

295
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:20,159
and so she was cool enough to say hey

296
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:23,519
you can stay in my cabin

297
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,899
so I stayed in her cabin and she and her

298
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,659
neighbor

299
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,578
were growing this clone

300
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:31,559
and

301
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:33,419
she showed me the weed and offered me a

302
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,939
little bit of it

303
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:39,000
and I said oh

304
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,459
this is crazy purple I go as this is

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,519
this thing from so and so and Leggett

306
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:46,619
and she goes yeah I got it from the

307
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,000
neighbor over here you know if you've

308
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,620
seen it before and I go yeah I remember

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,559
it from years ago when I was a little

310
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,320
kid I remember the smell as soon as I

311
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,259
smell it I get this nostalgic smell

312
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,579
so she had it at that point so not only

313
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,559
did I see it when I was really little

314
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,620
but I saw it about five years six years

315
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:07,199
later and it came from the same lady so

316
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,820
it was like the same thing you know it

317
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,040
was a friend a friend both of them are

318
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,940
friends of my mom and

319
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,179
um

320
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,820
now when I smell Urkle crosses cherry

321
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:19,979
pie crosses

322
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,720
granddaddy crosses

323
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,759
um things that are in the Cherry Pie

324
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,100
things that are in the gelato there's

325
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,399
this common smell they all have even in

326
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,980
a little bit of the Purple in my Pina

327
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,720
it's that same thing which I call the

328
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,759
smell leg at purple

329
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,920
because that's where I originally saw it

330
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,980
and from this one from this one

331
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,559
particular lady now I'm fairly convinced

332
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,139
that whatever that clone was and I

333
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:49,739
believe it was probably some kind of a

334
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:51,959
killer Afghani clone or something

335
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,919
I think that clone was probably the

336
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,879
mother

337
00:13:52,919 --> 00:14:00,360
of everything that people now call like

338
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,159
the perps smell like granddaddy all that

339
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,200
different stuff and the only other stuff

340
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,838
that I ever saw different than that that

341
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,360
had a real name on it that would give

342
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,100
you any idea of origin was that the

343
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,500
purple purple Nepal

344
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,778
and um I don't know that that was

345
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,339
necessarily that was really Nepalese

346
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:20,159
weed or if somebody just thought that

347
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:24,120
sounded exotic and slapped a name on it

348
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:27,179
but long story short I think because of

349
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,399
being having that knee-jerk reaction of

350
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,199
deja vu when I smell these smells and

351
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,679
it's sending me back to when I was young

352
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,379
like that I think that that clone was

353
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:41,278
probably where all these other purple

354
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:43,019
things came from because if you look at

355
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,198
that and you go it was already something

356
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:49,679
in 89 being grown by several people and

357
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,259
by the time 95 came around it was still

358
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,958
being grown

359
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:57,360
uh you know a little ways down the road

360
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,000
not that far but far enough away from

361
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,720
Leggett to branscome

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,698
um

363
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,040
it had to have circulated quite a bit

364
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:11,759
and I saw 94.95 probably 95

365
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:14,458
for the last time and Urkel seems to

366
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,740
have surfaced about 96.

367
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,500
in Redway

368
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,198
um so I personally think there's some

369
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,179
connection there and I tried to see if

370
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:26,159
that clone was still around and the lady

371
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,259
I still see her sometimes in the store

372
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,219
and she runs a she runs a little

373
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,198
business

374
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,560
um down the road A Little Spa business

375
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,539
probably not there anymore unfortunately

376
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,838
she said that she gave it to one person

377
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,578
in Canada years ago and that he might

378
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,339
still have it and I haven't ever really

379
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:46,679
checked back in on that but I I really

380
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,240
think that that was where all that [ __ ]

381
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,219
came from

382
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,100
um and I couldn't tell you what that was

383
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,040
but it is very different in that the AFI

384
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,959
is more of an acrid sometimes has some

385
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:02,338
garlickiness to it

386
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:06,239
it's more deep and licorice sometimes

387
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,839
but not like Jager or something and then

388
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,000
um

389
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,100
it has like a resin where you think it's

390
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,839
not resinous but then you smoke it and

391
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,839
it chokes you it's like it's coated in

392
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,720
resin instead of Frosty whereas this old

393
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,579
perp thing and the Urkle and all that it

394
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,259
has a more visibly you know it's

395
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:24,419
resinous when you look at it it doesn't

396
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,939
trick you you know so I think that

397
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:30,838
they're I think those are kind of two

398
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:34,079
things that are uh parallel and and uh

399
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:37,820
unconnected just based on

400
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:40,739
um my experience with both both jingles

401
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,500
wow what a comprehensive sort of

402
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,419
breakdown on The Afghani lineage and

403
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,639
purple strains in general I mean there's

404
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,139
so many Avenues we could go off in the

405
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,879
first question that kind of comes to

406
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:53,820
mind to me is that sometimes when we

407
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:57,480
hear these stories what kind of starts

408
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:00,778
to pan out from them is that rather than

409
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,420
what I used to mistakenly believe in

410
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:05,578
that we started out with like these

411
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:07,139
really shitty clones and just through

412
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:08,519
Miracle you get that one in a million

413
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,380
and it's a bit better and then it gets a

414
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,359
bit better it sounds almost like the

415
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,579
opposite was true in a way in that like

416
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:17,519
the older stuff was possibly the best

417
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:19,558
and sometimes it was retained in quality

418
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:23,220
each generation but sometimes it went

419
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:26,699
down would you generally agree with that

420
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:30,860
sort of logic or how do you see it

421
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,860
I think you know if you go to places

422
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,038
um you know it's neat because you get to

423
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,619
kind of follow it a little bit

424
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,000
um with with some of the people now who

425
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:40,619
share things

426
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,619
uh

427
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:47,879
like uh

428
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:49,798
um Deepak uh what is it uh Horizon is

429
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,320
that how you pronounce it yeah yeah it

430
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,179
isn't yep when you follow him around you

431
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,460
look and you you can you can watch

432
00:17:54,179 --> 00:18:00,660
people take these fields of stuff that's

433
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:04,740
hardly fed hardly Dr hardly um watered

434
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,480
not really dried the way anybody you

435
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,279
know who are our contemporaries would

436
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,558
dry their head stash

437
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,379
what's in the sun you know it's maybe

438
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,538
leaned up in a room it's put in huge

439
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,360
piles it's passed through and if you

440
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:19,980
know anything about hash and you look at

441
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,399
the resin that they produce in these

442
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,099
piles you go wow that's actually really

443
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,460
good [ __ ] resin

444
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:32,038
and the the quality of cannabis comes

445
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,900
from the resin it's not about whether or

446
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,298
not you have a

447
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,679
flower that looks a certain way and you

448
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,940
you look at these places that are

449
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,700
traditional

450
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,160
producing countries and um you know it's

451
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,319
it's been said for a long time that they

452
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,298
don't have anything anymore all they

453
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:52,980
have is a bunch of bastardized European

454
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:54,538
remakes of other stuff that was given

455
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,620
back to them and their Gene pools

456
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:59,038
diluted

457
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:01,439
but I know the old original Afghani

458
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,419
types because when I saw them here they

459
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,940
were only had been bred maybe two or

460
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,400
three times and even if they had been

461
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,259
hybridized with newer stuff those ones

462
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,360
still pop out and I look at stuff that

463
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:15,298
he posts like right now from Kandahar

464
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,759
and I'm like that is the same [ __ ] we're

465
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:21,298
growing like that is Cherry Pie that's

466
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:25,079
cookies that's like the things that

467
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:29,639
people think are so modern

468
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:31,859
um they're there and they uh they're not

469
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,720
really grow like you know I've grown

470
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:35,879
things a lot of different ways and when

471
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,779
you just leave something you can have a

472
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,480
clone

473
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:40,980
of something that's exceptional and if

474
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,960
you just kind of put it out there and

475
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,179
you barely water it you barely feed it

476
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,700
then it's you're just like yeah it's it

477
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,620
is what it is but it's not it's not

478
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,140
going to look like a crazy Instagram

479
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:55,500
picture of some [ __ ] quote-unquote

480
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,299
Zaza you know and you you can look at

481
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,740
stuff he's posting from Kandahar right

482
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:02,400
now and you go dude if you grew that

483
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,380
indoor or in a deck or just really took

484
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,120
care of it and grew it outdoor like you

485
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,419
would be looking at that and going [ __ ]

486
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,639
is that what is that cherry pie or runts

487
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,259
or gelato or all those things that

488
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,299
people are like oh these modern things

489
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:18,179
are [ __ ] I'm like they honestly just

490
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,579
seem like the old [ __ ] from back in the

491
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,419
day to me you know

492
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:25,439
um

493
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:27,000
and then I was just talking to somebody

494
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,320
um today or yesterday

495
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,240
and they were talking about the old

496
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,819
stuff that we had around here

497
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,160
and growing up I always thought that it

498
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,139
was like so so long ago you know because

499
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,000
it's like oh it's 95 and they're talking

500
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,559
about 84 the import from 84 or

501
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,538
81 or whatever and I was like whoa

502
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:46,619
that's crazy that's the old school stuff

503
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,779
and

504
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,599
now that I'm not 15 years old anymore

505
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:53,220
I'm like dude that's [ __ ] yesterday

506
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:56,399
the difference in in breeding if you

507
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,440
import something in 84. and somebody

508
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,480
makes seeds two or three times and then

509
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,038
you see it in the mid 90s like it's

510
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,038
still the same [ __ ] weed you're not

511
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:08,220
gonna get that far doing enough

512
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,379
breedings just to make it be

513
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,058
um fresh seed because you know in the

514
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,580
back in the day people didn't just make

515
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:16,139
every make seed every year and try to

516
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:18,779
improve it it's like they got some

517
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,059
killer Afghani or Pakistani they brought

518
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:23,099
it here they made seeds they seeded a

519
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:24,418
whole plant they grew them for a few

520
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:26,159
years and then they went you know what

521
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,140
we should probably make seed again this

522
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,419
year so by the time you're seeing stuff

523
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,480
it's only been displaced three three or

524
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,000
four breedings at the most from 84 to

525
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,179
95.

526
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,159
so my own opinion of how all that plays

527
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:46,200
out is that

528
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:49,140
some people in basically from the 60s to

529
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,298
the 90s really to the to the early 80s

530
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,059
got their hands on things that were

531
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:56,519
already killer they made more seed they

532
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:58,379
grew them while they selected the

533
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,599
females a couple times that were a

534
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,940
little better or maybe a lot better than

535
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,740
the average and all of a sudden they

536
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,380
have these really really knockout

537
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,440
strains that today are what we consider

538
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,700
everything that's killer and then at the

539
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,919
same time

540
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,360
through all those years people took

541
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,100
things and they bred them the other way

542
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,199
where they had something that was really

543
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:21,658
great and then they turned it mediocre

544
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,600
because they thought man this is too

545
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:26,700
stinky it doesn't look crystally enough

546
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,678
it

547
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,538
um you know it doesn't quite have the

548
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,600
right thing that we're looking for and

549
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:35,700
they bred away from what actually made

550
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:37,139
enjoyable killer weed in their pursuit

551
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,819
to try to make what they thought was

552
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,538
what weed should be but they had a weird

553
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:44,099
idea of it you know and uh so I think

554
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:45,599
there was two directions I think there

555
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,819
they started with killer stuff they

556
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,339
started with bad stuff some people made

557
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:52,678
the killer stuff more killer some people

558
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,298
made the killer stuff less killer and

559
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,220
some people took the bad stuff and

560
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,019
thought they made it killer and it just

561
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,240
was like you know going in a weird

562
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:02,038
Direction because they had these strange

563
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,980
ideas like oh we need it to be stealth

564
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:07,019
it can't smell or we want it to look

565
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,700
Frosty but they didn't realize the resin

566
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,918
was in the heads and not the [ __ ]

567
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:15,000
stocks of the of the of the the

568
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,679
trichomes or you know so uh I mean

569
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,740
that's my take on it I don't think that

570
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,038
what we call Modern cannabis is nearly

571
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:25,319
as far displaced from traditional

572
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,779
cannabis as people think it is I just

573
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,759
think there's a lot of places where they

574
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,859
had stuff and they were happy with what

575
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,900
it was and they kept having it and there

576
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:37,678
was other places

577
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,019
where they had really crazy killer weed

578
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,538
and they just kept it that way and

579
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,220
different people over the years

580
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:45,658
um wound up with these different

581
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,120
different things from different places

582
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:51,960
and some people have the luck to get

583
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,339
something from Kandahar or to car or

584
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,500
like different places where there was

585
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:58,500
these really good things and then

586
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,359
Missouri you know Mazar or other people

587
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,700
you know got these other things and then

588
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,139
went oh this is you know Colombian and

589
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,080
it's like yeah that's not actually the

590
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,780
good Colombian it's you know and then

591
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,158
the name stick and it leads people on

592
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,558
all these Goose chases for all this

593
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,059
stuff but I think that all the best

594
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:17,099
stuff

595
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:20,220
is only a little bit different now than

596
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:23,219
it was way back I think

597
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,079
if you had the best stuff in 1983 and

598
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,058
you pulled it out now people would be

599
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,658
like oh yeah that's just as good as the

600
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:31,980
best stuff is right now and then

601
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:33,360
recombining things so so say you find

602
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,220
something like the black Affy that

603
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,979
doesn't look resinous

604
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,720
but it's Ultra potent and then you cross

605
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,419
it with something that looks very

606
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,720
resinous and is ultra potent and you add

607
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,580
the potency from the one into the one

608
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,798
that actually produces more resin and

609
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:51,960
now you have more of what was already

610
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,720
Ultra potent I think that's when you get

611
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,279
something like OG and sour and chem

612
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,440
where

613
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:00,119
you know you had you had the luck of

614
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,940
these combinations and I think that's

615
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:04,918
what the modern stuff really stepped it

616
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,538
up to was going okay well

617
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,460
you know and I think that's where the

618
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,558
magic of breeding is is going okay we

619
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,140
have this thing imagine if it doesn't

620
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,019
look resinous but it'll knock you on

621
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,659
your ass imagine if you could make that

622
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,460
same resin be produced in larger amounts

623
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,559
and then all of a sudden it's like oh

624
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,200
[ __ ] you know this is this this stuff's

625
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,119
really crazy so there's like a little

626
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,980
level up I think we did but I don't

627
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,918
think it's what people think it was I

628
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,900
think it's I think it's uh overrated a

629
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,200
lot as far as what what modern people

630
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:41,159
did I think that the Afghani people and

631
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,319
people in Pakistan Thailand Vietnam and

632
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:46,799
all these other places had already made

633
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:50,339
stuff that by today's standards would be

634
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:53,400
really [ __ ] good weed but um

635
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,079
you know people ReDiscover it in these

636
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Gene pools and they think it's different

637
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:58,798
because they did it now as opposed to

638
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,778
them and that's you know that's my take

639
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,240
on that

640
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:06,359
yeah what what a bunch of solid info

641
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,460
there I think um looking as we speak at

642
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:10,439
the uh erasing posts you talk about and

643
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,079
God you're right some of these plants

644
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:17,278
look almost exactly like Cherry Pie and

645
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:20,759
cookie sort of things it makes me think

646
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:23,038
are you excited or interested in

647
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:26,339
exploring some of this stock that

648
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,440
deepaks found and if you were are there

649
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:30,298
any of your own lines that you would be

650
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,919
interested in sort of melding together

651
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:34,619
with some of these

652
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,440
um you know land race afghans

653
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,819
yeah I'm really interested

654
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,759
um I've been looking at the stuff that

655
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:43,079
he's collecting right now in Kandahar

656
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:46,200
and to me

657
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:47,939
it looks like really what I've always

658
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,740
been looking for when I was wondering

659
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,120
like can you still get real Afghani

660
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,460
seeds and people

661
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,918
would always say no everything's gone

662
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,159
every Everything since after the Soviet

663
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,380
invasion is [ __ ] it's all been

664
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,960
brought in and everything's everything's

665
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,900
everything sucks now and I'm looking and

666
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,700
you even look just using critical

667
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,080
thinking you look at these areas and you

668
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,860
look at these people

669
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:17,460
and you go so you think these these

670
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:19,918
people really have these thousands of

671
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,259
years of tradition of of holding these

672
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,820
things and then someone showed up with

673
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:25,619
some [ __ ] and all of a sudden all

674
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:27,480
their [ __ ] just turned to [ __ ] I just

675
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,038
don't believe it and then you look at

676
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,380
the weed and you go

677
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,658
they didn't have anything to bring from

678
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,179
Russia or Amsterdam that would have been

679
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:38,340
this not to mention that even if they

680
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:40,259
did if you're familiar with breeding

681
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,119
with some of these types these things

682
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,339
are Ultra dominant some of these

683
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,439
afghanis like these afghanis could just

684
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:48,298
stomp on the outside genetics and turn

685
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,360
themselves back into what they were to

686
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:53,099
start with anyway because they're they

687
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,019
they that that's how they behave in a

688
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,639
gene pool you know

689
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,259
um they're like what I call the bullies

690
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,659
you know they just come in and they just

691
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,400
bully everything you're like okay go

692
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,140
ahead cross something with deep chunk

693
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,640
and see if you get something like what

694
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,038
you crossed with you're gonna have more

695
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,840
deep chunk do that for a few years and

696
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:12,298
you're just gonna be back to having it

697
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,519
again and um

698
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:17,038
I but I don't think that's the case I

699
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,359
think I think it's the case that that um

700
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,658
there's a lot of people who were

701
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,639
isolated there and I think that uh a lot

702
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,340
of people who went to try to ReDiscover

703
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,020
the old stuff went to little markets and

704
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,480
they got [ __ ]

705
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:33,119
um tourist [ __ ] seeds that weren't

706
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,940
really what was the real deal with the

707
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,399
real people and the real people are

708
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,620
probably pretty intimidating if you're

709
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,480
if you're not from there and they're

710
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,879
probably pretty hard to approach and you

711
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,860
have to have people who

712
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,440
um who could really access the right

713
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:52,319
people in the right areas and and get in

714
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,960
there you know and so uh

715
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,119
I think it's really crazy stuff and I so

716
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,679
I'm really excited to dig back into it

717
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,859
and I have stuff from him and a couple

718
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,038
other people who have collected uh from

719
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:08,038
over there uh like land race Legacy and

720
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,379
uh Afghan selections and you know I'm

721
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,599
gonna dig in there and see what's there

722
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,940
and I'm also excited about some of the

723
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:19,319
other stuff that Deepak did

724
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,278
which is like the uh the stuff like the

725
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,200
um

726
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,798
you know there's there's a couple other

727
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,580
ones like the low lab and the uh and the

728
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:31,859
uh Manipur and

729
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:33,898
a few other things because I look at

730
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:36,000
them and I know the background on what I

731
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:39,239
have a little bit and then I look at

732
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,619
these things and I go oh that seems like

733
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,919
maybe

734
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:47,579
there is some shared Heritage there and

735
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,159
so you know that's a really cool way to

736
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,199
um reinvigorate things without adding

737
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,799
something that is really completely

738
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,720
outside so I I do have some plans to dig

739
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:00,599
into those I think this coming year I'm

740
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,480
going to get into a lot of afghanis and

741
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:06,538
then a few other Oddball things too

742
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:10,200
and uh see what we can pull out of those

743
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:12,960
and then try to just get those out

744
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,899
um to a lot of different people

745
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,720
you know so that they can uh

746
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:19,798
you know so you can keep the gene pool

747
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,339
um

748
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,839
more diverse and and I think when I look

749
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,918
at some of the stuff it's like it has

750
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:31,859
what people what people want and maybe

751
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,778
if you do big big selections from them

752
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:36,119
you might be able to go okay well this

753
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:37,619
is still without hybrida there's a thing

754
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,939
that everybody does they get their hands

755
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:41,699
on some seeds

756
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,740
and then they feel like they're they're

757
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,960
going to be doing the wrong thing if

758
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,659
they make more seeds pure like they're

759
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,159
stealing and for me it's like and I'll

760
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,320
say this right now just for anybody

761
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,299
listening if anybody gets my seeds and

762
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,798
they like them and they want to make

763
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:57,778
more seeds don't feel like you're

764
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,179
stealing if you make more seeds that are

765
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:02,579
the exact same thing you don't always

766
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,559
have to hybridize everything when you

767
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:06,599
hybridize everything then you lose what

768
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,298
you started with so I try to put out

769
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:10,798
things that are fairly true breeding so

770
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:13,139
that if somebody gets their hands on

771
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,200
something they can make more pass them

772
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,919
out they can get you know they can they

773
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,558
can get circulated and you still wind up

774
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,140
having that preserved gene pool that's

775
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,418
that's not crossed with everything else

776
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,278
and I always kind of cross things

777
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,679
together

778
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,140
um with certain goals but it's not just

779
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,820
because I want to make it be different

780
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,440
than what I started with if I get

781
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:39,119
something and I already really like what

782
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,179
it is I want to make more of that pure

783
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,639
to have and to share and

784
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:46,559
um you know it it can be considered

785
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,340
unethical to make more of what someone

786
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:53,639
had and then just sell it because it's

787
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:55,740
like you're kind of undermining people's

788
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,840
um business that they have

789
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,538
but there's nothing wrong with making

790
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,519
more pure and handing those out and

791
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:04,558
sharing them and all and all that kind

792
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,058
of stuff and I myself personally don't

793
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,038
care if people make more of my same

794
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:09,720
seeds peer and just sell those I don't

795
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:11,879
give a [ __ ] like I tell people to do it

796
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,960
all the time like

797
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,720
um

798
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,940
you know that is how you keep having the

799
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,058
same breed

800
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,919
um around and not have it Go Go funky

801
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:24,418
because I've seen most of my favorite

802
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,520
things I've seen over the years they

803
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,020
disappeared and somebody will go oh I

804
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,700
have that and I'll be like oh yeah cool

805
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:32,099
what is they're like well I crossed it

806
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,200
with this and I'm like wow oh

807
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:35,879
that's cool but it's going to take a lot

808
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,100
of work to get back to where you started

809
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,899
so like for me I want to take those

810
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:42,480
things make them pure

811
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:44,459
hand those out and then take them and

812
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,919
maybe work them into what I have at the

813
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,319
same time but I don't want to just

814
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,899
always hybridize like hybridizing to me

815
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,220
is just getting away from

816
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:54,959
um

817
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,759
from having what you already had that

818
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,079
was good you know so I just want to

819
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,298
throw that out there because I notice

820
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,980
it's what happens people get something

821
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:03,240
from me and they're like yeah I made a

822
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,440
bunch of seeds and I'm like cool what'd

823
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,940
you do and they're like well I put it on

824
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,038
this I put it on that I put it on that

825
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,659
I'm like did you put it on a couple of

826
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:11,519
the females of the same thing and

827
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,039
they're like oh no no I didn't want to I

828
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,940
didn't want to be a biter and I'm like

829
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:20,038
that's cool but if somebody took my

830
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,259
stuff and made more pure I'd almost

831
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,599
rather have their selections back of the

832
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:26,278
same thing that they made different than

833
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:28,980
I might have made it but from the same

834
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:31,259
exact thing than the new hybrids because

835
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,620
as soon as you do that now you're back

836
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,359
to a whole new process again you know so

837
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,639
that's that's my plan with those kind of

838
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,959
land races I want to make more pure and

839
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,820
then I'll do some other stuff on the

840
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,919
side too but I really want to circulate

841
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:46,619
those things so we preserve them because

842
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,538
you've got to keep

843
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,459
um you've got to keep them around in

844
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:54,000
their in their original state so that

845
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:57,778
you you can have them because they're a

846
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,019
huge part of our human Heritage is our

847
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:03,240
is our plant uh the diversity of our

848
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:06,538
plant varieties and when you lose those

849
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,820
it's it's [ __ ] up you know

850
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:10,739
yeah sure and I mean if we go back to

851
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,000
something you mentioned a little earlier

852
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,598
with

853
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
the black Affy Hindu hybrid you used in

854
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,679
some of your crosses in the past do you

855
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,239
have access to those genetics still and

856
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,820
would that be some of the stuff you

857
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,918
might want to cross with these afghanis

858
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,419
well so here's what's interesting I have

859
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,559
a lot of seeds of the straight black

860
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:30,539
Affy

861
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,119
I have a lot of seeds of the Hindu cross

862
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:35,099
black Affy I have a lot of seeds of the

863
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,260
Hindu cross black athlete cross Hindu

864
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:39,359
back cross to the Clone which was what

865
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,820
right now I would love to plant some of

866
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,338
those plants had like this uh

867
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,559
almost like a gardenia smell to them but

868
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:49,858
with like a coffee skunk at the same

869
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:53,338
time to me like probably the best kind

870
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:55,440
of stuff that I ever made and that is

871
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:58,858
really similar to what wound up making

872
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,460
like root beer and jarrow

873
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:01,319
um

874
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,838
that's was the starting point was the

875
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:08,760
Hindu cross black Affy but those seeds

876
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:11,578
are still alive but not viable enough to

877
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,980
Sprout so

878
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:17,280
I've had a couple good leads on labs to

879
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,199
be able to do real tissue culture and I

880
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,599
talk about it again and again and I'll

881
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,358
keep on talking about it because

882
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,519
that's what we really all need is to get

883
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:28,980
somebody who can take a couple cells

884
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:31,980
living out of a seed turn them into

885
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,539
callus grow them into callus

886
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,639
take those just like you do with

887
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,099
mushroom mycelium take one plate of

888
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,598
callus make 100 plates of callus and

889
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,099
then start hitting them with hormones to

890
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,599
get roots and shoot so you can get

891
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:46,859
plants

892
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,900
to get back these original things and

893
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:50,699
mine

894
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,900
I know we're good because as soon as

895
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:54,419
they got to the point where they

896
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,519
wouldn't quite Sprout all the way I

897
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,320
stuck them in the fridge

898
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,559
and I've checked on them

899
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,079
and they're really good as far as being

900
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,358
alive but they don't have enough Vigor

901
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,800
to be able to grow as a normal plant and

902
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,500
some of these things if you do get them

903
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,320
to pop up they pop up but then they

904
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,059
don't have a meristem so they only they

905
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,039
come up and they have their seed leaves

906
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:19,259
and the seed leaves open and there's

907
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,940
nothing there and sometimes that happens

908
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,440
and you can leave them sitting there for

909
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,420
two or three months and eventually

910
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,240
they'll grow a branch even from under

911
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,280
the seed leaf or from the middle and it

912
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,139
just takes a really really long time and

913
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,180
if they'll do that it's worth doing that

914
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:34,920
with them but the ones I have will only

915
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:37,259
get a tail

916
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,300
and then they'll Peter out and I can't

917
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,060
get him to get past that point and so

918
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:45,240
I'm not going to waste him on that but

919
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:47,578
um I do have

920
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:49,379
um I do have like what I call root beer

921
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,480
and what I call jarrow and if you plan A

922
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,940
lot of them then you do get the

923
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,559
Throwbacks that are like I have a clone

924
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,780
right now that's a throwback to the

925
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,420
black Affy Hindu and it's one of my

926
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,760
favorites we smoked some fatties with my

927
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,320
buddies came by the other day not the

928
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,640
other day now at this point it's a

929
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,838
[ __ ] time warp it was probably a

930
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:10,500
month ago

931
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,460
but um we smoked it and after sitting

932
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,019
there for a while we got about

933
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,179
two-thirds through the joint and

934
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:17,519
everybody was like whoa this ain't

935
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:19,739
normal weed like we we got a funny high

936
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,679
right now this is some different [ __ ]

937
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:25,559
not to mention it's very tasty it's very

938
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:27,239
hearty just really really killer weed

939
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:30,119
and um

940
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:32,578
so like it there is that and so I can

941
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,220
take these killer afghanis and breed

942
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:37,680
with those throws that are like that but

943
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:41,338
there's a Trippy thing in my brain where

944
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:44,759
just because it's the same plant

945
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:47,639
the difference in in the actual makeup

946
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,640
of the genetics and the provenance and

947
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:52,858
the story and tracing it back like even

948
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,139
though I know I can pull AFI Hindu out

949
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:57,900
of jarrow I still want it without the

950
00:37:55,139 --> 00:38:01,139
sour diesel in the in the PK in it and

951
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,039
for me a lot of that is because

952
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:04,500
um

953
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:07,139
people assume that things like the root

954
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,300
beer are killer only because they have

955
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:11,279
the headband in them and the Hollywood

956
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,220
pure kush which are these famously

957
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,960
potent killer plants but what people

958
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:18,598
don't know is that if you had just

959
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,940
smoked the black Affy crossed with the

960
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,460
Hindu which kind of predates all that

961
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,700
other stuff and goes back to the 80s

962
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:30,119
when you smoke that that was just as

963
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:32,578
chokey and you know had the great high

964
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,800
and all that the plants just didn't get

965
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,240
as big and that's what led me to

966
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,920
hybridize them with these stretchier

967
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,139
things that didn't water down the

968
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,240
potency but they didn't necessarily

969
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:45,059
really add any potency it was already

970
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,559
really really dank at the point just

971
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,338
with the Hindu

972
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,159
um

973
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:54,358
so I I do still want to get those back

974
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:56,519
I'd rather work the pure Rafi and the

975
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:59,159
AFI Hindu

976
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:03,358
with these land races then pull out the

977
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:05,098
plants that match the description but in

978
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,319
reality aren't the same thing and that's

979
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,539
more it's more academic it's not going

980
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,460
to be a different product and it's not

981
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:13,380
even going to be more practical but it's

982
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,480
just a thing of being like oh this is

983
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,240
pure this is the pure [ __ ] it's a funny

984
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,639
uh it's a funny thing in the brain where

985
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,919
it just makes you makes you want that

986
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,719
because of the story and because of what

987
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,740
you know it is and I think a lot of

988
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:33,000
people kind of share that enthusiasm for

989
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:35,578
um for like purity of of of lineage and

990
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
provenance and and stuff like that it's

991
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:41,160
a it's a funny thing but I do

992
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,559
want to dig in and do those things but

993
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,019
in the meantime

994
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,219
um I'll definitely be doing some hybrids

995
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,159
with the things that are the later

996
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:52,519
crosses and I just released something

997
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,920
that was the What I Call special Indica

998
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:57,480
crossed with uh it was a ghost OG cross

999
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,838
special Indica across with special

1000
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,820
indica and I gave out some of those

1001
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:05,400
for people to dig through and find those

1002
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,920
old Affy types and what I call Big Blue

1003
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,619
and um

1004
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,539
you know but it just as soon as you put

1005
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:14,519
OG in things it's like everybody thinks

1006
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:16,679
it's good because it has OG in it and

1007
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,900
then there's no way to

1008
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:22,440
there's no way to explain how good the

1009
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,358
old stuff was when you've put OG in it

1010
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,099
um so like I really want to get back

1011
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:28,319
into the old old one so people can

1012
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:30,359
understand that better because they they

1013
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,039
the old stuff really is as good as the

1014
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,960
new stuff but

1015
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,519
how do you tell people that when the old

1016
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,960
stuff doesn't exist it's all across

1017
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,838
through the new stuff you know it's a

1018
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,358
funny uh a funny thing

1019
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,460
yeah certainly I think there's a lot of

1020
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:46,920
Merit to that idea you just referenced

1021
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,920
with people on this never-ending quest

1022
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,079
for the purest stuff and I mean speaking

1023
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,358
of the pure stuff I don't think I've

1024
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,280
ever seen as much demand for any one

1025
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:59,039
particular strain is what the public has

1026
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,260
for your root beer is there any chance

1027
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,838
people might ever see that in pure form

1028
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,599
or are you looking to do crosses with it

1029
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:10,679
the thing about the uh the thing about

1030
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:13,740
the root beer is that it's and this is

1031
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,539
this gets into a whole other

1032
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:18,598
a whole other thing

1033
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:21,960
so if you look at

1034
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:24,900
growing weed in general for me

1035
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:28,619
When I grow weed

1036
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:31,440
the best way for me to do it is to take

1037
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,500
live soil

1038
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,000
and put it outside under the sun

1039
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,420
and

1040
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,820
I can grow you

1041
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,200
500 pounds

1042
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,900
for probably

1043
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:49,259
two thousand dollars tops

1044
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,180
you know what I mean wow now people want

1045
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,380
to take

1046
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:54,299
and that's what I'm talking about like

1047
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,920
with overhead you know of course I'm not

1048
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,519
going to give it to you for that but if

1049
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:03,539
I was going to do it I could do that and

1050
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:06,780
people go to do that indoors and are

1051
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:10,139
already looking at huge power bills

1052
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,640
they're throwing away piles of cocoa or

1053
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:13,799
rock wool

1054
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,358
in most cases not that people don't grow

1055
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,160
soil indoor

1056
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,739
a lot of people also throw away their

1057
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,358
soil even if they do grow in soil

1058
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:24,059
I'm paying for all these Foods they're

1059
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:26,279
doing all this different stuff

1060
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:30,320
um even when you're in greenhouses the

1061
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,859
level of issues you face with pests

1062
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:37,140
humidity you're running dehumidifiers

1063
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:40,139
you're using supplemental Lighting in

1064
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:42,779
some cases a huge amount of stuff all

1065
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:45,598
basically to have something that people

1066
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,500
will be able to look at and go oh wow

1067
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,599
that's fancy and it's kind of ironic

1068
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,179
because you're going to literally light

1069
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,400
this [ __ ] on fire and throw it in a

1070
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:58,679
[ __ ] ashtray which is probably about

1071
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,780
the dirtiest [ __ ] thing in the world

1072
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:02,578
like if I'm frying on mushrooms or acid

1073
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,200
and I look at an ashtray with dirty

1074
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,599
roaches in it and [ __ ] I'm like that's

1075
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:08,098
that's the funkiest [ __ ] but you're

1076
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,039
taking this thing and you want it to be

1077
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:12,838
the most pristine and shiny and Frosty

1078
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,139
and it has to have all these

1079
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:17,940
all these things going on with it

1080
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:20,338
um

1081
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,019
and all said and done if you take

1082
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:25,440
something like root beer and you grow it

1083
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:28,800
indoor it doesn't even develop quite the

1084
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,858
type of resin and Funk that it does when

1085
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,980
you grow it outdoor something like Urkel

1086
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:36,598
even OG I feel like is really good

1087
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,579
indoor there's certain things that

1088
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,760
really indoor they kind of live up to

1089
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:46,800
their potential whereas outdoor they

1090
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:49,079
might be more potent and chokey and

1091
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,180
um have a little bit more of a richness

1092
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,440
to the smoke and the flavor but they're

1093
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:54,480
they're different

1094
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,980
um and they don't they don't get they

1095
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,440
never get this kind of bag appeal where

1096
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,079
you open a a pound of indoor Urkel when

1097
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,119
it's done well is so special and a pound

1098
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:04,859
of outdoor Urkle while it's really

1099
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,318
special if you can appreciate it it

1100
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:09,838
doesn't have the same impact and

1101
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,659
interesting uh profile that you get

1102
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,779
indoor so

1103
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:17,338
my point I'm getting at is that root

1104
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,780
beer is interesting because it's only

1105
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:21,539
really

1106
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:24,780
fit the way I bread it to be outdoor

1107
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:27,599
because I bred it outdoor and I selected

1108
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,300
it outdoor and

1109
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:35,400
it was the nastiest best most practical

1110
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:37,079
thing to be a large Plant outdoor and

1111
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,400
people when they buy seeds they

1112
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,640
generally want to be able to put them

1113
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,800
indoor outdoor and adapt whatever it is

1114
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:45,299
and I understand that because that's

1115
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,440
what's practical

1116
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:52,019
but root beer is a funny one because

1117
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,280
if I back cross to it endlessly and make

1118
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:56,219
it just be

1119
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,560
straight root beer it's really unstable

1120
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:00,000
inside and in depth and people have

1121
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,779
heard this again and again because I

1122
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,519
always [ __ ] say it but

1123
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,200
I have this thing where I almost don't

1124
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,858
even want to [ __ ] get it ready to be

1125
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,379
indoor because I almost feel like if

1126
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:14,818
people are that excited about it I

1127
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,318
should just leave it as Outdoors so

1128
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:18,659
maybe people will grow some [ __ ]

1129
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,940
outdoor and realize the outdoor is

1130
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:23,940
chronic if you have the genetics that

1131
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,960
are really really good outdoor

1132
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,358
um

1133
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,420
and so I might release it as an outdoor

1134
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:32,759
seed I'm getting all the time I get a

1135
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,880
little bit closer

1136
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,700
to not really wanting to have anything

1137
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,800
that is unreleased or that I keep to

1138
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:41,879
myself

1139
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,579
um

1140
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,579
but what's interesting is that

1141
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,659
it can seem it can seem greedy for

1142
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,039
people to look and go okay well you

1143
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:54,719
won't let it out because you just want

1144
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,259
to have it but there's a weird thing

1145
00:45:54,719 --> 00:46:00,659
that happens with value

1146
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:03,180
where like I've still never made

1147
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:07,318
anything off a root beer for myself

1148
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:09,059
but I've probably been able to bring in

1149
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:11,699
I mean I don't want to put a number on

1150
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:15,299
it but there's been a lot a lot of help

1151
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:18,118
and money that has gone to charity so

1152
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,859
far just by being able to leak out a

1153
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,680
little oh this is this cross with root

1154
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:25,500
beer this is that cross with root beer

1155
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:28,379
and it's a weird thing because

1156
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:31,858
if I ever release it for myself then

1157
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,800
that would undermine that because it

1158
00:46:31,858 --> 00:46:37,199
doesn't bring in as much

1159
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:40,140
but it's like it's almost better to

1160
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,939
leave it unreleased so that it can leak

1161
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:44,578
here and there as different things that

1162
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,800
can be more helpful for people even

1163
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,060
though I can't do a charity for myself

1164
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,880
really

1165
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:51,838
because I'm not that's not how that

1166
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,980
works

1167
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,619
but

1168
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,539
it's hard to give up that leverage of

1169
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:01,440
knowing that you have something of value

1170
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:03,358
when it can be really helpful

1171
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,780
um even if it's not helpful to yourself

1172
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,279
because for me like I don't like I look

1173
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,380
at it and I go yeah I could just release

1174
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,380
it if everybody has it I feel like

1175
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,940
pretty soon it won't be that like when

1176
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,800
cookies first came out you could sell a

1177
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,358
clone for five grand or a tray of clones

1178
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,280
for five grand at least

1179
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,920
and now people are like ah cookies

1180
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,720
whatever maybe if it's the best pack of

1181
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,059
work something and you auction it off

1182
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,219
maybe you get a few hundred bucks

1183
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,559
but it's still the same weed it was when

1184
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:32,879
it was five thousand a flat root beer

1185
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:35,460
has that little bit of hype and

1186
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,318
following and all that

1187
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:40,139
um

1188
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:42,179
it has this value and it has this

1189
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:45,480
leverage of people wanting it to where

1190
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:47,759
it makes that amount of money if I

1191
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,400
release it for myself nobody's gonna pay

1192
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,200
five thousand dollars a pack but if I

1193
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,420
release it for charity for other people

1194
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:56,399
people will pay way more than they pay

1195
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,139
for anything else I have so it's almost

1196
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,980
like if I let it out and I give it to

1197
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:04,679
everybody I lose the ability

1198
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:08,099
to have that leverage with it

1199
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:10,858
for it to have the power it has it's a

1200
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:12,539
weird it's a weird thing like

1201
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:14,338
because I didn't ever think I'd have

1202
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:16,318
anything worth [ __ ] people didn't even

1203
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:17,880
want to grow in my seeds in the 90s you

1204
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,519
know what I mean and I gave a lot of

1205
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,740
seeds to people in the 90s who grew them

1206
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:25,380
and made a lot of money

1207
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:27,419
but a lot of people then was only four

1208
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,760
or five people you know

1209
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,220
and

1210
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,480
now at this point people are like root

1211
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:35,279
beer root beer and there's root beer

1212
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,500
Madness and I'm like well I can release

1213
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,060
it but it'll just be another thing

1214
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,239
everyone has like cookies

1215
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:44,099
if I don't release it

1216
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:45,598
then it has this thing where it's like

1217
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:46,859
hey if somebody's really [ __ ] and I

1218
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,420
can help them by putting out a little

1219
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:50,578
bit of something crossed with root beer

1220
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,920
so I'm up in the air dude and I know

1221
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,780
it's a weird thing and the way my brain

1222
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,760
works is kind of like

1223
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,800
[ __ ] up because I overthink everything

1224
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,599
and I mean I'm sure you can hear the

1225
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,200
wheels turning just as I talk about it

1226
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:06,300
but that that's kind of like how I look

1227
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,639
at it is like I want everybody to have

1228
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,560
it I just want to release it and that

1229
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,358
way I know it's preserved and it's out

1230
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,400
there because it's really it's really

1231
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:16,920
good weed like it's very enjoyable it

1232
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,420
makes you feel good it grows crazy it's

1233
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,900
[ __ ] gorgeous

1234
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,940
uh the plants they grow really fast and

1235
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,338
and all that so for outdoor I think it's

1236
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,200
really good and I have like dude I have

1237
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:31,019
so many of the back cross three seeds

1238
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:33,059
now that I'm like okay this would be a

1239
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:35,159
really cool one to put out

1240
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:37,440
but I just look at it too where it's

1241
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:39,598
like okay if you put everything out then

1242
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,400
after a while

1243
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,480
um because I do a lot of the charity

1244
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,960
stuff

1245
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,079
it's like it's almost like well I would

1246
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,179
be able to benefit from it hugely but

1247
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,740
then I I try to figure out well what do

1248
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:54,539
I have that I could put in for this

1249
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,299
charity stuff that would still create

1250
00:49:54,539 --> 00:50:00,000
this kind of a buzz and this hype

1251
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,160
so it's [ __ ] weird you know

1252
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,039
um so I don't I don't know dude that's a

1253
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:07,379
huge run on [ __ ] which I'm totally

1254
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,739
probably at this point [ __ ] known for

1255
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,640
like [ __ ] Kevin JoJo or something but

1256
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:13,858
um

1257
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,480
you know it's my it's my take on it it's

1258
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:18,299
just it's a tricky it's a tricky thing

1259
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,159
this whole this whole hoarding hoarding

1260
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,019
versus whoring thing you know you don't

1261
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:22,739
really know

1262
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,300
um

1263
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:26,279
you don't really know what to do with

1264
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,318
stuff when you have something popular I

1265
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,420
don't have a million popular things I

1266
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,338
have tons of seeds but you see there's

1267
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:36,659
only Interest really in certain things

1268
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:38,818
so I uh I always try to measure it out

1269
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:40,858
and do the right [ __ ] and I don't

1270
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:42,539
[ __ ] know it gets at a certain point

1271
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:44,639
it's tiresome and I just want to be like

1272
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:46,259
dude everybody can have everything do

1273
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:47,940
whatever the [ __ ] you want with it and

1274
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,339
then I won't have to even think about it

1275
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:53,700
anymore you know but I also want to be

1276
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:56,880
like I want to use

1277
00:50:53,699 --> 00:51:02,039
the energy that's behind something to be

1278
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:04,380
the most helpful and not just to make a

1279
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,300
quick Buck you know it certainly does

1280
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,160
sound like it's a double-edged sword and

1281
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,859
I think the community is seeing a number

1282
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,379
of instances where you're trying to you

1283
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:15,598
know walk the line of as you so

1284
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,220
poetically said hoarding versus whoring

1285
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,338
which is definitely my new catchphrase

1286
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:22,439
it's brilliant I love it so for sort of

1287
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:24,480
the more aspiring breeders we might use

1288
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,700
root beer as an example because it's

1289
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,920
kind of what I've noticed this with if

1290
00:51:26,699 --> 00:51:31,019
someone did have some work that they had

1291
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,880
made and they were sort of proud of I

1292
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:35,880
noticed that like with root beer for

1293
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,099
example you had a bunch of projects

1294
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,858
already finished you know in the bank

1295
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:43,079
ready to go and so you were kind of one

1296
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:45,239
step ahead in that regard and then I

1297
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,220
noticed that there was a number of your

1298
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:49,379
sort of closer friends who had the root

1299
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:52,019
beer cut do you feel like that might be

1300
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,640
a good sort of duality of like you're

1301
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:56,400
getting it out there enough that people

1302
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:58,199
can hear about it and stimulate it

1303
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,059
um some interest in it but at the same

1304
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,259
time it's not you don't have to be too

1305
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,240
worried about giving it out because

1306
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,280
you're kind of a few steps ahead would

1307
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,899
you advocate for sort of an aspiring

1308
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,640
breeder who's made something and they're

1309
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,858
looking to get it a bit more popular or

1310
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,318
a bit more notoriety do you think that's

1311
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:16,759
kind of a route in which they could do

1312
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:20,219
that or how would you advise people

1313
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,700
so it's an interesting thing I mean I

1314
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:26,639
had that and I smoked it for a long time

1315
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:29,818
and it was pretty unknown and I knew it

1316
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,440
was really really really bomb because I

1317
00:52:29,818 --> 00:52:33,358
would try to smoke other [ __ ] and I'd

1318
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,700
wind up just putting out the joint and

1319
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:39,598
rolling up a lime one or a root beer you

1320
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:42,179
know and so I was like okay I know that

1321
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:45,119
it that it's really really good and

1322
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:47,419
I gave it to a friend of mine

1323
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,099
and I said you know

1324
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:52,559
you'd probably really like this what had

1325
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:54,059
happened was he had grown he had grown

1326
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,640
some of it crossed him and his brother

1327
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:58,980
had grown some of it crossed with the uh

1328
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,159
with the chemdog Special Reserve

1329
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,900
and he was like man he goes you know I

1330
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,539
had High Hopes but it just it wasn't

1331
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,700
that great and I'm like dude you it must

1332
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:11,400
not have been a good cross then

1333
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:13,558
try the Clone you know and if if you

1334
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,539
like it keep it for me so in case I lose

1335
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,460
it I can get it back you know

1336
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:19,739
so I gave it to him

1337
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,059
and he grew it

1338
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:23,879
um him and his brother and they were

1339
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:26,220
like yeah it's it's [ __ ] fire and

1340
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,920
he posted it and all of a sudden it was

1341
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:31,318
like everybody was like root beer and I

1342
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,599
was like huh I guess it's a really good

1343
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:36,719
name and it's really got a pretty color

1344
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,640
to it and it just it just kind of

1345
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:42,000
sparked imagination like you can't

1346
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:44,759
really predict what will be

1347
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,739
what everybody really latches on to it's

1348
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,599
like people who make songs

1349
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:50,219
you know they make an album and they go

1350
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,599
this is the hit and then it turns out

1351
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:52,980
this other song they thought was going

1352
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,960
to be

1353
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,818
you know it's gonna flop this turns out

1354
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,159
to be the one that really really is the

1355
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:01,079
hit and uh

1356
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:03,358
it wasn't that I didn't think it was

1357
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,920
that it was really really killer weed it

1358
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,078
was just that it was funny because no

1359
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,420
one had smoked the weed and they heard

1360
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,859
the name and they saw the picture and it

1361
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,800
was popular

1362
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:15,779
it was a strangest thing to me because

1363
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,240
had they all smoked the weed I would

1364
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,440
have understood that yeah you guys

1365
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,479
understand

1366
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,099
but it only took the name and the

1367
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:27,059
picture

1368
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:27,960
it's such a [ __ ] weird thing so like

1369
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,599
um

1370
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,539
it definitely is really really important

1371
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:37,140
that if you have something

1372
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:40,199
that you want to popularize you can't be

1373
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:41,400
the only one with it unless you're

1374
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:43,799
already

1375
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,559
really really well known

1376
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,920
and uh

1377
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:53,579
it was like this guy's account

1378
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,760
that was my friend uh Southern humble

1379
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:58,980
terp Farm

1380
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,660
he had an account that must have had 60

1381
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,900
000 followers or something at the time

1382
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:05,759
or 40 or something like that a lot

1383
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,519
and um

1384
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,559
it was just like once he posted it and

1385
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:12,420
said it was really good then all of a

1386
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,700
sudden it was really good

1387
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,400
and I was like wow that's crazy because

1388
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:19,139
I thought to myself had it not been

1389
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,639
really good I think people would still

1390
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:23,940
think it's really good

1391
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,500
but I also think that most people knew

1392
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,838
that if it wasn't good he wouldn't have

1393
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,940
said it was good you know it was like

1394
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:33,058
you know him and his brother had killer

1395
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:34,200
[ __ ] uh his brother makes really really

1396
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:36,420
killer

1397
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:39,659
uh live resin was one of the first

1398
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,300
people to have really crazy big fat jars

1399
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:46,139
of the of the best live libraries and

1400
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:48,300
figured out kind of the the the tricks

1401
00:55:46,139 --> 00:55:50,400
um to get the Terps to separate and

1402
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,460
everything that was a little bit ahead

1403
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,260
of the curve and um

1404
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,760
so

1405
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,559
so I think people kind of there was like

1406
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,680
a level of trust there and that helped

1407
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,660
but I think that you do have to be able

1408
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,838
to have things out there there's no way

1409
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:08,940
you could just have it and say it's good

1410
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:10,679
and everybody will believe you of course

1411
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,960
some people will believe you and of

1412
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,058
course people who know you in person and

1413
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,858
they've seen what you think is good now

1414
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:19,019
that's what I like to look at like if I

1415
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:21,000
know somebody and I know they only

1416
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:23,400
really like stuff that I like as well

1417
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,318
because it's all up to preference but if

1418
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,420
if that's the case then I'm like okay I

1419
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:28,679
gotta see it and then I'll believe it's

1420
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,079
killer just because they said it's

1421
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:33,719
really killer because I know we agree on

1422
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:36,839
certain stuff but um

1423
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:39,239
you gotta definitely let stuff out to an

1424
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:43,159
extent but like the root beer

1425
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:43,159
has only been grown by

1426
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,480
Southern Humboldt terp Farm in southern

1427
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,119
humble concentrates

1428
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,858
and skunk Tech

1429
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,940
and

1430
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:59,818
me nobody else has ever grown it

1431
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:01,318
and they've only grown it for one run a

1432
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:05,219
piece

1433
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:09,058
and for some [ __ ] reason the name the

1434
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:11,838
pictures it just got this mythology

1435
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:14,640
and it's really funny to me because

1436
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:16,199
coincidentally it really is like my

1437
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,480
favorite weed to smoke along with the

1438
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:22,078
lime one but it doesn't make any sense

1439
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,980
to me it's a really strange thing so

1440
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,200
um

1441
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,900
you know like that was only a little bit

1442
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:31,618
of circulation it's really really not it

1443
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:34,680
hasn't been out there and um

1444
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:36,599
you know so I you know I I'll I'll I'll

1445
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:39,598
tell you straight up

1446
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:40,500
you can do whatever you want in life in

1447
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,200
general

1448
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,960
and you can try as hard as you want and

1449
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,358
you can do all the right [ __ ] but if you

1450
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,838
don't have good fortune if if Good

1451
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:53,940
Fortune doesn't [ __ ] smile on you

1452
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:56,219
then

1453
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:59,338
it it doesn't [ __ ] matter how hard

1454
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:00,118
you try but you gotta try because if you

1455
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:02,818
don't

1456
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:05,220
then if Good Fortune Smiles on you you

1457
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:07,318
won't have [ __ ] to [ __ ] to [ __ ]

1458
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:09,719
display when the [ __ ] when the

1459
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:11,099
sunshine hits you you know so you got to

1460
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,939
do your best but it's really weird

1461
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:16,859
because I don't feel like uh

1462
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:18,539
you know I don't feel like everything

1463
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:20,400
that I did with you know whatever

1464
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:22,858
[ __ ] breed and root beer Yachts

1465
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,960
killer it's it's great I mean it is it's

1466
00:58:22,858 --> 00:58:27,058
not that it's not but at the same time

1467
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,179
it none of it makes sense to me like it

1468
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:31,019
doesn't make sense to me that

1469
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:34,019
um

1470
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:36,539
people think I'm any kind of a person to

1471
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:37,798
listen to about what's good or

1472
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:40,019
that

1473
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:43,318
if I bread it and I think it's the best

1474
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:45,119
like it's you know it [ __ ] means

1475
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:48,000
anything you know it's really trippy I

1476
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,079
just I think a lot of what works out for

1477
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,619
you has to do with whether or not

1478
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:57,960
you have the luck of it happening where

1479
00:58:55,619 --> 00:59:01,019
something gets a little bit of shine

1480
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,119
but you do have to

1481
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:05,219
do all the work and you have to just

1482
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,838
keep trying try and try and try and

1483
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:10,019
different things different flavors

1484
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:12,900
different crosses different moves

1485
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:16,259
sharing things with different people

1486
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:20,460
[ __ ] just trying your best to be okay

1487
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:23,339
and and you know being all right dude

1488
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,500
with some okay [ __ ] and then maybe

1489
00:59:23,338 --> 00:59:26,818
something takes off because you can

1490
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,219
listen to that right there with the root

1491
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:31,019
beer it's like what how is it popular

1492
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:33,358
like you're like yeah it's it's this

1493
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:35,280
it's one of the most I'm like oh [ __ ]

1494
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,199
nobody's even grown it nobody's smoked

1495
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,000
it for some reason there's just this

1496
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,798
mythology sir that's why I always joke

1497
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,980
there's there is no group here it's not

1498
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,838
a real thing it is it's real and it and

1499
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,639
I have seed that actually you can grow

1500
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:50,578
them and they'll all [ __ ] be root

1501
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:52,578
beer you know but

1502
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:52,579
um

1503
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:58,440
the facts don't really support the

1504
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,480
outcome like the the even though

1505
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,659
everything even though we know the weed

1506
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,900
is the [ __ ] the plant is the [ __ ]

1507
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:10,139
it's like but how do people know that

1508
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,579
why did it connect I have no idea dude

1509
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:13,920
it's just like people who make a hit

1510
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:16,440
song and they go I don't know we made it

1511
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,599
and everybody latched on and [ __ ]

1512
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,220
Jimi Hendrix made foxy lady and for some

1513
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,660
[ __ ] reason people thought that was a

1514
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:23,459
[ __ ] he didn't want to even [ __ ] play

1515
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:27,118
it at least the root beer I like it you

1516
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:28,858
know but um yeah but you you gotta you

1517
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,200
know you gotta shoot your shot and and

1518
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:33,480
do and do the work and then you know

1519
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:36,179
everything else I think kind of [ __ ]

1520
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,460
handles itself it all just pans out to

1521
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:40,618
be what it is it's that's a weird that's

1522
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,599
a weird thing that I wanted to dig into

1523
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:44,640
that so people really understand though

1524
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:46,680
it's not

1525
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:49,858
it's not about

1526
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:54,358
it's not all about just

1527
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:56,578
having perfectly executed plans and

1528
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:58,500
um all this it's just about trying

1529
01:00:56,579 --> 01:01:00,240
trying trying trying doing your best

1530
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,219
doing your best doing your best and then

1531
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:06,239
see what the [ __ ] happens because you

1532
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:08,459
can't there's no recipe other than

1533
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:11,159
um trying your best trying your best is

1534
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:14,159
the is the master key to

1535
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:16,699
[ __ ] anything working a little bit

1536
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:16,699
you know

1537
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:21,298
interesting stuff sounds like there's

1538
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,400
some formulation out there and while we

1539
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:25,858
may not know it it certainly seems like

1540
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:28,079
you know hard work good genetics and

1541
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:30,539
luck are certainly a bit of a mix in

1542
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,579
there it's interesting if we just jump

1543
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:35,338
back to a question we spoke about a

1544
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:38,460
couple questions back you mentioned how

1545
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:40,380
you know people will see headband or OG

1546
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,539
in the mix of the list of genetics and

1547
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:45,420
then all of a sudden it like gets them

1548
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:48,179
interested I was interested in asking

1549
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:51,180
you I've noticed you tend to work a lot

1550
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:53,578
with both ghost doji which I've seen in

1551
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:56,039
some of your more recent crosses as well

1552
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:58,559
as with the Skywalker OG which people

1553
01:01:56,039 --> 01:02:01,139
will probably remember is a big part of

1554
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,298
the skycard lacush would you say that

1555
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:04,980
these two are your favorite ogs and if

1556
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:07,318
you had to pick one or the other what

1557
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:10,199
would be your absolute favorite OG to

1558
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:12,119
work with within your projects

1559
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:14,879
okay so the original my original

1560
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:18,838
experience with OG which when I first

1561
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,980
got it I thought was the original OG

1562
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:22,440
um which is

1563
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:25,019
fully not true it's not even a pure OG

1564
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:28,920
but the Hollywood peer Kush is the one

1565
01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:30,659
that is the most present in my work and

1566
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,818
that's because I got it before I had

1567
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:35,399
anything else and I think I got it 2004

1568
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:36,239
2005.

1569
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,740
um

1570
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:39,739
now that one

1571
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,519
is

1572
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:46,399
um neat because you cross it with things

1573
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:49,259
and it doesn't

1574
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,059
uh crybaby Organics was talking about

1575
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:53,640
this on a post the other day there's

1576
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:56,400
certain plants that you use

1577
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:58,318
as a mother for seeds where when you

1578
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,880
cross to them

1579
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:02,400
it

1580
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,798
it adds something without taking

1581
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,380
something away

1582
01:03:03,798 --> 01:03:09,358
so for me using the pure kush was

1583
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:12,838
interesting because

1584
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,519
it doesn't it it it it doesn't it's not

1585
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:17,818
a bully

1586
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:20,400
um you cross with it and whatever male

1587
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:25,318
you hit it with most of your seeds come

1588
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:27,059
out smelling like the male side but

1589
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:29,279
um in the case of all the things that I

1590
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:32,040
used with it which were these squat

1591
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,599
indicas which tended to want to get Bud

1592
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:35,460
mold

1593
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:39,180
um they didn't yield a lot in a large

1594
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:41,639
pot I was growing medical Gardens where

1595
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:44,519
you could only have 25 plants you want

1596
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:48,239
them to be as big as they can get

1597
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:50,940
um it made things more rangy and it

1598
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,798
didn't dilute their potency and in some

1599
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:55,019
cases it added to their potency

1600
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:59,099
depending on what you were using

1601
01:03:55,019 --> 01:04:01,259
and so that was the one that I used that

1602
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:02,400
was

1603
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:04,619
um

1604
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,740
that was the prevalent one in my crosses

1605
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:10,920
now something like Sky cuddler Kush I

1606
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:13,500
took uh big red put it on Hindu clone

1607
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,880
put it on pure kush then I put it on

1608
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,579
Skywalker

1609
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,079
but I took that and I put it back on the

1610
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:21,119
pure kush again

1611
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:23,099
and

1612
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,140
I really like it

1613
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:26,700
the thing about the pure kush is that

1614
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:29,759
it's a finicky plant

1615
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:32,399
and something like Sky cuddler Kush has

1616
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,740
so much PK in it that if you grow it

1617
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,960
good and you know how to grow oh geez

1618
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:39,179
just like the pure kush clone the pure

1619
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,980
kush clone if you grow it well you get

1620
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:43,078
these huge buds

1621
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,358
that are caked in resin that are super

1622
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,579
dense that are super loud and when you

1623
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,159
smoke them you're like wow there's not

1624
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:52,859
anything else it it's literally the

1625
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:53,879
flower is more potent in your chest than

1626
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:57,119
most

1627
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:59,519
hash which I had never really

1628
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:02,280
seen before that except maybe on the

1629
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:04,199
black line or on the

1630
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,720
um Hindu AFI which were both things that

1631
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:09,179
I crossed to it to make what became line

1632
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:11,578
one and what I called OG coffee which

1633
01:05:09,179 --> 01:05:12,838
was the father of root beer and what I

1634
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:15,420
call jarrow

1635
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:16,199
and so

1636
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,818
um

1637
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:20,939
when you grow these things if you grow

1638
01:05:17,818 --> 01:05:22,619
them right they're amazing and you might

1639
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,720
not even know why you grew them right

1640
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,400
but they come out great you get these

1641
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,219
huge plants with huge colas and they're

1642
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,200
[ __ ] excellent and then people

1643
01:05:29,219 --> 01:05:32,519
[ __ ] them up and they don't know how

1644
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:33,899
they [ __ ] them up and I can't tell

1645
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:34,940
them how they [ __ ] them up other than

1646
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,500
maybe

1647
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:39,599
underwatering over watering like really

1648
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,940
hard for a few little rounds to where

1649
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,740
the metabolism of the plant gets [ __ ]

1650
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:47,639
up and then all of a sudden they have

1651
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:50,039
weed that's either larvae or light or

1652
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:52,139
it's just not quite right and you're

1653
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:54,659
like well I don't really know what to

1654
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:56,279
tell you because when you grow a normal

1655
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,739
soil mix

1656
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:01,260
and you don't [ __ ] with anything they

1657
01:05:58,739 --> 01:06:03,239
just have these plants that

1658
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,240
they just throw down

1659
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:08,039
but if you [ __ ] them up then you see

1660
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,019
that PK weirdness where all of a sudden

1661
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:11,759
you're like oh man these just don't

1662
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:14,280
they're not doing what I want them to do

1663
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,079
so it's a it's a weird thing that the PK

1664
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:19,079
brings to the table

1665
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:22,980
um the PK also brings a certain level of

1666
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:25,318
instability to the table which is the

1667
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:27,179
same deal if you grow them a certain way

1668
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:29,579
they're fine if you grow them another

1669
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:30,419
way once again which I can't really pin

1670
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:33,660
down

1671
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:37,380
it's like when I had the the Hindu

1672
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:38,219
the big red on the Hindu on the PK

1673
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,460
um

1674
01:06:38,219 --> 01:06:45,480
I call it OG cuddler or red Hindu Kush

1675
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:46,318
cause big red Hindu pure kush

1676
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,420
um

1677
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:50,038
people would grow them

1678
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,019
grow them indoor they're all perfect

1679
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:54,960
grow them outdoor they're all perfect

1680
01:06:52,019 --> 01:06:57,358
somebody grows a pack indoor or outdoor

1681
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,679
the whole pack has [ __ ] sexual

1682
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:01,139
instability

1683
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:02,460
you're like well there's already been a

1684
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:05,460
whole bunch of these have been grown

1685
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:08,460
perfectly fine and now these ones they

1686
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:11,460
freaked out so that's like OG crosses

1687
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:12,900
diesel crosses cookie crosses you'll

1688
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:16,019
talk to somebody they'll go oh those

1689
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,099
seeds are [ __ ] they're all Hermes and

1690
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:19,199
then you'll talk to somebody else

1691
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:21,780
another I agree with three or four packs

1692
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:23,399
they were all great so whatever it is

1693
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,960
that makes these things freak out it

1694
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,760
makes them freak out but it's something

1695
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,240
that's coming from

1696
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:32,039
in the case of like uh red Hindu Kush it

1697
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:35,279
was it was uh

1698
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:36,900
you know coming from that

1699
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,819
PK clone

1700
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,200
so the PK clone is this weird thing

1701
01:07:38,818 --> 01:07:43,079
because it either gives you the best

1702
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:46,679
thing ever or it gives you stuff that

1703
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:48,480
[ __ ] up on you and um the nature of how

1704
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:51,118
I grow is so simple that I don't ever

1705
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,880
see that I don't ever have plants that

1706
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,880
are [ __ ] awful unless I grow

1707
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,559
something that's really

1708
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,358
outlandishly shitty and you just know

1709
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:03,298
it's going to be really bad because it's

1710
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:04,920
a weird [ __ ] auto root or Alice or

1711
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:07,199
some [ __ ] that's like the only things I

1712
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,838
can remember that were really bad

1713
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:12,358
but um but the PK is a trip like that

1714
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:14,420
and that is the OG that really is the

1715
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:18,778
most prevalent in my work then the ghost

1716
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:21,420
I took the skyjaro which is jarrow

1717
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:24,060
um so that's Hindu

1718
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:26,460
crossed with a black Affy male and I

1719
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,739
called that black coffee at the time but

1720
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:31,319
that's a dead what I call the deadline

1721
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:34,318
it's not it's it's not out there

1722
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:37,620
anywhere so you know right now people

1723
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:40,440
like uh biovortex Black Dog crossed with

1724
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:42,358
coffee from Kaya at Green Source Gardens

1725
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:45,059
they have a black coffee I don't give a

1726
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:48,779
[ __ ] because my black coffee is a

1727
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:51,539
deadline it's only been used in

1728
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:53,279
um something that is later so I don't

1729
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:55,560
have a black coffee I had a black coffee

1730
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:58,679
but I don't use that anymore so that's

1731
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:01,140
the Hindu the AFI on the Hindu I crossed

1732
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:03,480
that with a Hollywood pure kush

1733
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:06,000
and then I put that on the sour diesel

1734
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:08,278
that made jarrow I took that I put that

1735
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,100
on the Skywalker the Skywalker I really

1736
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:13,080
liked it was stretchy it was vigorous it

1737
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:14,880
had the really clear OG smell different

1738
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:17,939
from the ghost where it was more

1739
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,039
chemical less Earth less skunk

1740
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:23,579
um I liked it I liked the shininess of

1741
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:26,278
it I like the Vigor of it and then

1742
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:27,778
um so I had that I had this guy jar I

1743
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:31,259
grew those those were killer they all

1744
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:34,020
came out like really nice OG and some OG

1745
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:36,238
plants breed more OG and some breed less

1746
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:38,759
pure kush is more transparent you don't

1747
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,678
get a lot of OG from it

1748
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:43,319
um you get a lot more of what the male

1749
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:45,060
side was Skywalker I got a lot of OG

1750
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,100
from it which leads me to believe it was

1751
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,859
more bottleneck it was probably a S2 or

1752
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,640
S3 or something like that

1753
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:52,920
um

1754
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,500
so

1755
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:58,380
that made the sky jarrow I took that and

1756
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,939
I put that on the ghost because I had

1757
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,840
grown

1758
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:04,979
um

1759
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:07,500
I had grown The Ghost s1s and they were

1760
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:09,419
really consistently all kind of an OG so

1761
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,399
I was like okay well I know that the

1762
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:13,440
ghost is throwing a lot of OG whereas

1763
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:15,719
the PK wouldn't have done that the PK

1764
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:18,178
throws a lot more plain stuff it throws

1765
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:19,920
some purples that are like lavender it

1766
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:24,060
throws these cotton candy type of things

1767
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:26,819
it's really nice but it's not allo G the

1768
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:29,400
ghost growing the S1 ferment was like

1769
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:30,859
okay you get a lot of the real OG

1770
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:34,198
so

1771
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:35,460
skydrawal was all OG basically with a

1772
01:10:34,198 --> 01:10:38,698
little you know a little bit different

1773
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:41,100
not not all the loudest

1774
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:42,658
um and a little bit more Vigor longer

1775
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:45,659
canes

1776
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:47,219
um a little faster finishing and then I

1777
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:49,319
put that on the ghost to make the ghost

1778
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:51,899
cross Sky jarrow because everybody

1779
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:54,599
wanted like a Kush seed that would be

1780
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:58,019
vigorous and better than a OG clone as

1781
01:10:54,600 --> 01:11:00,000
far as how it does in your garden so

1782
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,739
um so I did that and that was The Ghost

1783
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,319
and then I also did the Ghost with the

1784
01:11:01,738 --> 01:11:07,559
lime pop those came out really nice I

1785
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:10,579
like those a lot I handed them almost

1786
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:14,280
all out as testers

1787
01:11:10,579 --> 01:11:16,738
and then I lost the Line Pop Mail

1788
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:18,539
so I had very few of the seeds left back

1789
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:21,479
to continue the lime but I went ahead

1790
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:24,600
and did that and this year I kept that

1791
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:26,339
going to the f2s but

1792
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,140
I gave them all almost all out as

1793
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,420
testers so I figured if everybody grew

1794
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,460
them and they were great then I could

1795
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,319
take the lime Pop Mail I had as a clone

1796
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,760
and I could put it back on The Ghost and

1797
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,639
I could produce those and that could be

1798
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,619
one thing that I kind of had as one of

1799
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,860
my my Staples because it was such a nice

1800
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:46,019
weed when I grew it um Outside Inside

1801
01:11:43,859 --> 01:11:47,819
It's a little bit unstable so it's going

1802
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,860
to keep getting worked

1803
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,479
um hopefully by F3 F4 I can have

1804
01:11:49,859 --> 01:11:54,539
something that's nice and I'll put that

1805
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:57,539
back out but um

1806
01:11:54,539 --> 01:12:01,079
the ghost is killer to me it's the real

1807
01:11:57,539 --> 01:12:04,920
heavy [ __ ] OG the real deal real OG

1808
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:07,079
Kush Skywalker is a little bit more a

1809
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,920
little bit lighter of a high a little

1810
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:10,738
bit

1811
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,658
bigger hardier of a plant I really like

1812
01:12:10,738 --> 01:12:17,000
it it makes these really big pretty

1813
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:19,379
seeds it's kind of neat and then the PK

1814
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,960
really brings

1815
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:23,640
a lot of potency

1816
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:25,260
and it breeds a little bit more

1817
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,239
transparently which I really like

1818
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:30,539
because I'm most the time I'm not trying

1819
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:32,939
to breed an OG in seed form I'm trying

1820
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:34,738
to use what's good about the OG and Tack

1821
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:36,419
it on to what I already have on the male

1822
01:12:34,738 --> 01:12:37,079
side

1823
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:41,880
um

1824
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:44,579
and so that's cool and the PK unlike a

1825
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,199
lot of OG's it drops Hash a little bit

1826
01:12:44,579 --> 01:12:49,559
better

1827
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:51,658
um because of its uh what's in it as

1828
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,120
opposed to where the OG is

1829
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:56,399
fairly greasy it'll drop some hash but

1830
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:59,039
the PK drops hash closer more like a

1831
01:12:56,399 --> 01:12:59,939
Bubba so that's the

1832
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:01,619
um

1833
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:03,839
no that's the reason for there being a

1834
01:13:01,619 --> 01:13:09,000
lot of PKS that was the first one I had

1835
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:11,279
and I believed it to be really old pure

1836
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,100
OG based on the way the weed was

1837
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:16,380
when I got it but later on kind of found

1838
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,600
out that it's not uh you know it

1839
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:21,600
actually has other stuff in it

1840
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:24,000
wow what a detailed breakdown of what

1841
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,060
sort of each of the ogs you work with is

1842
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,300
bringing to the table in your crosses

1843
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:32,880
since we last spoke uh it feels as

1844
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,860
though the backstory is behind the OG

1845
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,800
cush itself have been fleshed out a fair

1846
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:40,019
bit more with TK Origins kind of coming

1847
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:42,119
out of the shadows and explaining his

1848
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:44,760
story the thing I wanted to ask you

1849
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:46,979
about was that a lot of people might be

1850
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:49,260
aware that he speaks about how he was

1851
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:51,359
growing a strain called Emerald Triangle

1852
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:53,420
and he suspects the male involved in the

1853
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:56,880
pollination was probably a Hindu Kush

1854
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:58,980
when he was pushed to give some sort of

1855
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,859
guess about what this Emerald Triangle

1856
01:13:58,979 --> 01:14:03,899
strain was he frequently says probably

1857
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:07,139
some sort of Hindu Kush sort of thing

1858
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:10,500
and it makes me wonder could you believe

1859
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:13,199
that like or do you believe that OG Kush

1860
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:16,738
is possibly just some sort of Hindu in

1861
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:19,559
Cross if we are to if if what TK origin

1862
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:21,059
says is correct could you say that or do

1863
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,880
you have a suspicion that maybe there's

1864
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:26,159
some other genetics in the mix

1865
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:31,140
okay so there's there's an interesting

1866
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:34,738
thing at play here that uh

1867
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:35,340
this is a this is a multi-layered thing

1868
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:39,178
um

1869
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:40,980
so Hindu Kush okay Hindu Kush

1870
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:43,679
I've always kind of wondered about this

1871
01:14:40,979 --> 01:14:44,879
Hindu Kush is a region

1872
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:49,619
um

1873
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:54,079
within that region are tons of different

1874
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:58,198
micro regions where different

1875
01:14:54,079 --> 01:15:00,300
uh strains would have come from

1876
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:00,960
so

1877
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:06,239
um

1878
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:09,000
I always wondered what is Hindu Kush and

1879
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:10,379
there was a sacred seeds Hindu Kush that

1880
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,158
came out

1881
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:15,840
marketed as being skunky in the early

1882
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:18,779
80s

1883
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,779
and there was

1884
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:20,779
um

1885
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:27,658
originally Neville had a uh

1886
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:29,039
this is where it's hard to kind of sift

1887
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:32,399
through

1888
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:36,000
originally Neville had a Northern Lights

1889
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:37,079
one in the Northern Lights two

1890
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,899
um

1891
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:42,000
I believe Greg McAllister says the

1892
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:45,000
further towards the one you go the pure

1893
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,399
more pure The Afghani is

1894
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,840
and

1895
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:52,399
um

1896
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,400
so there's a Trippy thing so

1897
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,960
Northern Lights one then would have been

1898
01:15:55,500 --> 01:16:01,020
just straight straight broadleaf

1899
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:03,119
gnarliness uh Northern Lights too would

1900
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,739
have been two based on everybody's

1901
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:06,420
descriptions of what those were at the

1902
01:16:04,738 --> 01:16:07,738
time

1903
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:10,399
um

1904
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:13,559
now Neville had those

1905
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:15,359
originally he marketed those

1906
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,460
I believe

1907
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:21,000
and

1908
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:21,899
this is this is info from seed banks

1909
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,600
that

1910
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:26,698
um I have the catalogs and I've read

1911
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:30,719
about them but this was brought up again

1912
01:16:26,698 --> 01:16:34,619
by by my buddy uh not so dog

1913
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:37,439
and he pointed out something which was

1914
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:41,698
pretty interesting that

1915
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:43,799
in one year Neville has Northern Lights

1916
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:47,939
with the description

1917
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:50,820
uh Northern Lights too I think maybe one

1918
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:55,079
and in the following year

1919
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:57,299
now it is I believe Scentsy seeds don't

1920
01:16:55,079 --> 01:16:59,100
you know don't take that as the gospel

1921
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,900
because it could have still been his own

1922
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:04,440
thing but I believe what happened was

1923
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:07,319
when he shifted his stock from seed bank

1924
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:07,979
to Sensi seed bank

1925
01:17:07,319 --> 01:17:11,099
um

1926
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:14,158
the names changed and so what was

1927
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:16,500
originally Northern Lights to

1928
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:19,259
and once again this is just how I

1929
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:21,179
remember it and I never put too much

1930
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:24,539
into really remembering the details of

1931
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:26,600
it because I know I can access that

1932
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:26,600
um

1933
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,800
it changed from Northern Lights to being

1934
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:33,599
labeled as Hindu Kush

1935
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:36,420
so

1936
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:38,880
apparently there's a Hindu Kush

1937
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:40,380
as a strain and like I said before it's

1938
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,000
a region so there would have really been

1939
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:44,100
a lot of things but what we would have

1940
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,460
had in California labeled as Hindu Kush

1941
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:49,380
or Florida labeled as Hindu Kush would

1942
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:51,980
have either been Hindu Kush from sacred

1943
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:54,900
seeds in like 83.

1944
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:57,599
or it would have been Hindu Kush which

1945
01:17:54,899 --> 01:18:01,920
was Northern Lights renamed as Hindu

1946
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:06,060
Kush by Scentsy seeds or by seed bank in

1947
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,199
which would have been more like 8687 I

1948
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:10,560
believe

1949
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:13,259
now in terms of seeds the these time

1950
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,940
frames these are right next to each

1951
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:18,659
other you know like

1952
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:20,759
someone who got cookies in 2016 or 2013

1953
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:23,399
and [ __ ] cookies you know but

1954
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,480
somebody who got those two things back

1955
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:25,920
then

1956
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:27,839
seems like it probably would have been

1957
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,600
two different things because I don't

1958
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,400
think the Hindu Kush sacred seeds had is

1959
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:36,120
the same as the Hindu Kush that Neville

1960
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:38,158
had I think Neville knew that this heavy

1961
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:42,179
Afghani type would have been from the

1962
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:44,158
Hindu Kush region and instead of calling

1963
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:45,779
it Northern Lights because he at that

1964
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:47,519
point had had the Northern Lights number

1965
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:48,979
five and stuff that was a little more of

1966
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:52,140
a hybrid type

1967
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:54,539
he had named the ones that were closer

1968
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:57,420
to being a pure Afghani type as being

1969
01:18:54,539 --> 01:18:58,920
Hindu Kush probably because Hindu Kush

1970
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,199
sounds different than Afghani and

1971
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:03,380
Afghani number one was out at the time I

1972
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:03,379
believe

1973
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:08,399
um so anyway

1974
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,980
that is all to say

1975
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:13,979
that

1976
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:15,959
when I have my Northern Lights and I

1977
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:19,559
started breeding it

1978
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:21,779
in the mid 90s

1979
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:24,780
um originally

1980
01:19:21,779 --> 01:19:26,639
before I had actually made seed I

1981
01:19:24,779 --> 01:19:29,099
started seeing these ones that would pop

1982
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,360
out in the compost pile when it would

1983
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:33,480
seed itself

1984
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:34,198
and the seeds would get thrown away

1985
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:37,799
um

1986
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:39,439
that my uh my dad

1987
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,699
at the time

1988
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,079
was every once in a while I'd be like

1989
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:44,519
oops something got [ __ ] up all right

1990
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:45,658
there's some seated stuff all right it

1991
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,940
gets pulled out when it gets trimmed

1992
01:19:45,658 --> 01:19:49,500
they get thrown in the compost pile

1993
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:51,539
now

1994
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:54,479
George would have a plant in the compost

1995
01:19:51,539 --> 01:19:55,920
pile pretty much every year and they'd

1996
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:57,599
be these really nice things they'd be

1997
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,940
just pretty much like the Clone but they

1998
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,739
were very Indica they seemed a little

1999
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:03,479
more broadly when you groom from seed

2000
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:05,099
than when they did from clone which I

2001
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:08,459
think is kind of typical of plants in

2002
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:10,560
general uh the first big fan Leafs that

2003
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:12,420
come up on an immature plant before it

2004
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,179
Sexes they really want to get Big And

2005
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:17,039
Chunky and fat because I think probably

2006
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:20,520
they're trying to do their best to

2007
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:22,019
really get a [ __ ] head start

2008
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,000
um

2009
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:27,080
so

2010
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,300
I think the northern lights that we had

2011
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:32,760
would have probably been like a Northern

2012
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:35,340
Lights five cross Northern Lights too or

2013
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:36,900
something the plant itself to me was not

2014
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,619
what I would consider to be a pure

2015
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:43,259
broadleaf as a clone it was

2016
01:20:39,619 --> 01:20:44,399
very very similar looking to an OG Kush

2017
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:47,640
clone

2018
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:51,599
so when I made things like when I bred

2019
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:53,340
through the jarrow or skyjaro

2020
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,199
Etc

2021
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:57,360
I would look for these things that were

2022
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:00,359
like the Northern Lights we had and it

2023
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:01,500
was very dark dark green the leaves they

2024
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:03,539
were shiny

2025
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:06,840
they

2026
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:08,460
would usually have five or seven

2027
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:11,360
um leaflets

2028
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:11,359
never more

2029
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,780
um

2030
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:18,899
they had crazy the the Clone itself it

2031
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:21,719
had crazy amounts of resin on it it was

2032
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:23,819
resin that liked to fall off like an

2033
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:26,939
Afghani

2034
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:28,559
um the potency was just insane

2035
01:21:26,939 --> 01:21:33,000
definitely right up there with something

2036
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:34,020
like an OG or a sour or a chem

2037
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,779
um

2038
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:38,760
and

2039
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:40,460
you know I kind of had this structure

2040
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:44,340
that was

2041
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:45,779
uh you know fairly thin stem not what I

2042
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:48,659
would normally consider to be a straight

2043
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:51,658
Afghani but Afghanistan has a really

2044
01:21:48,658 --> 01:21:52,259
diverse gene pool I'm just saying that

2045
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:54,599
um

2046
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:58,159
the Northern Lights we had wasn't like a

2047
01:21:54,600 --> 01:22:01,560
Bubba now something like a Bubba

2048
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:03,539
is exactly

2049
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,340
I mean almost

2050
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:09,119
impossible to tell the difference

2051
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:12,179
between good bubba and good

2052
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:15,960
Hindu which we had around here which we

2053
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:18,480
called Hindu Hindu and the guy who had

2054
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:21,539
it the most around here was my buddy Jay

2055
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:23,639
Law and Jayla

2056
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:25,979
he

2057
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,659
had this Hindu clone that he called

2058
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:31,079
Hindu Hindu

2059
01:22:27,658 --> 01:22:35,879
and it was [ __ ] bomb and it was like

2060
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:37,619
Bubba but more visibly white and frosty

2061
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:40,560
um it had that same kind of a thing

2062
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:42,539
where it had this smell that was like a

2063
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:46,199
coffee

2064
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:46,198
Earth soap

2065
01:22:46,979 --> 01:22:51,178
I don't know it's a really trippy trippy

2066
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:53,399
thing almost had like a plant latex

2067
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:55,940
smell to it a little bit like um like

2068
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:59,339
when you break open like milkweed or

2069
01:22:55,939 --> 01:23:02,399
dandelions or

2070
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:06,000
real cocaine which I personally have

2071
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:08,579
never done but which I have seen in you

2072
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,560
know certain situations where people had

2073
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:11,880
it and I was curious about what it looks

2074
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,780
like

2075
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,060
um

2076
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:18,000
it just never was my thing I tasted it

2077
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:20,580
made me angry I never really tried it

2078
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,679
again uh

2079
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:25,920
I had a toothache one time I put it on

2080
01:23:22,679 --> 01:23:28,260
that real effective but it has something

2081
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:31,500
like that that plant latex thing that's

2082
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:33,239
hard to describe and so anyway this is

2083
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:35,340
all just digging in to kind of give an

2084
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:36,779
idea of a backstory of all this kind of

2085
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:39,179
stuff

2086
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:41,279
so

2087
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:43,859
um also it really liked to drop resin

2088
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:47,059
like my clone did but they were very

2089
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:52,319
different and then in about

2090
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:57,360
2003 I would say my buddy

2091
01:23:52,319 --> 01:24:01,259
uh Big L used to like to come up and

2092
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:04,738
grab weed from people in Mendo

2093
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:07,079
to take to LA and he would buy the Hindu

2094
01:24:04,738 --> 01:24:10,459
from the Hindu clone and he would sell

2095
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:14,460
it in LA as Bubba

2096
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:17,640
and he would get major top dollar for it

2097
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:21,000
like unheard of [ __ ] but because it was

2098
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:22,920
Bubba and the people who wanted it knew

2099
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,260
their [ __ ] but they still were like yeah

2100
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,940
this is Bubba but it wasn't Bubba

2101
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,100
it was Hindu

2102
01:24:26,939 --> 01:24:33,238
the back story on the Hindu it turns out

2103
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:36,360
before Jay Lau got it it went to his

2104
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:37,738
buddy up there and Leggett

2105
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:41,460
and

2106
01:24:37,738 --> 01:24:43,379
the person who gave it to him it turns

2107
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:46,319
out was a friend of mine who was an

2108
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:50,159
older lady who's probably about 65 70.

2109
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:52,079
really cool lady and she said she got it

2110
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:55,679
from a guy named Frank

2111
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:59,579
who had a heroin problem who lived here

2112
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:04,199
where I live and that was around 84 or

2113
01:24:59,579 --> 01:25:05,519
85. now I believe that because it was so

2114
01:25:04,198 --> 01:25:07,919
long back

2115
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:11,460
she had actually mixed it up and it was

2116
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:14,460
probably a little bit later because I

2117
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:17,819
personally think that she got it from

2118
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:20,100
Frank and that Frank probably got it

2119
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:23,158
from

2120
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:26,820
Neville once the Northern Lights name

2121
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:30,000
had been changed to Hindu Kush in 86 or

2122
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:33,179
87 or whatever now if you

2123
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,880
if you get something

2124
01:25:33,179 --> 01:25:39,359
30 some years ago

2125
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:43,380
it's really easy to think you got it 32

2126
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:47,819
years ago instead of 34 years ago or 36

2127
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:50,340
years ago instead of 39 years ago so I

2128
01:25:47,819 --> 01:25:52,439
think that what we called Hindu Kush up

2129
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:54,779
here which is the same as Bubba

2130
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:56,759
was probably from that seed bank release

2131
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:59,579
which was Northern Lights after it had

2132
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:01,260
been changed to be called Hindu Kush

2133
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:03,420
and

2134
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:07,500
that

2135
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:09,658
Bubba Kush is almost the same thing and

2136
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,579
if you hear the story that people tell

2137
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:12,899
about the earliest Bubba Kush they say

2138
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:14,460
they think it was a Northern Lights

2139
01:26:12,899 --> 01:26:18,179
cross

2140
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:20,698
and if you hear the description from

2141
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:22,440
Origins TK who I've talked with a lot

2142
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:24,839
because at one point I almost wondered

2143
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:27,299
if the Emerald Triangle had been the

2144
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,819
Clone that we had that my mom popped

2145
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:32,400
because she popped it in 89

2146
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:35,179
but he said that the Emerald Triangle

2147
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:38,638
they had had since probably about

2148
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:40,079
87 which would make it impossible that

2149
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,300
it was that clone

2150
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:44,340
and why would my crazy ass think that it

2151
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:48,179
could have been our clone was only the

2152
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:51,300
fact that when I bred with things

2153
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:53,699
from OG and I was looking for OG I had

2154
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,159
really good luck finding males that

2155
01:26:53,698 --> 01:26:58,979
would throw OG by looking for the same

2156
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,839
look as our Northern Lights clone but

2157
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:01,979
Northern Lights had been very consistent

2158
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:04,440
so

2159
01:27:01,979 --> 01:27:06,718
I wouldn't be surprised if what he's

2160
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:09,479
calling Hindu Kush

2161
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:11,279
is what is in fact Northern Lights and

2162
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:13,138
never was taking Northern Lights and

2163
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:15,599
calling it Hindu Kush

2164
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:18,119
and what he used could have actually

2165
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:22,079
been Northern Lights cross Northern

2166
01:27:18,119 --> 01:27:24,300
Lights and that OG Kush could be

2167
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:26,279
Northern Lights cross Northern Lights

2168
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:29,159
which I have been saying since long

2169
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:32,579
before his story ever popped up

2170
01:27:29,158 --> 01:27:35,039
I've been saying that I believed

2171
01:27:32,579 --> 01:27:39,539
OG Kush to be

2172
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:42,300
some type of a cross of Northern Lights

2173
01:27:39,539 --> 01:27:47,039
so

2174
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:47,039
I don't really know exactly

2175
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,120
um

2176
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,719
the real stories of whatever everything

2177
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:57,599
is the reason why I believe Origins TK

2178
01:27:54,719 --> 01:28:00,000
after talking to him was that he doesn't

2179
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,940
put any ego on it

2180
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,520
he doesn't say oh well I took it and I

2181
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:07,559
grew a thousand plants and they were all

2182
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,500
pretty shitty but I found a crazy one

2183
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,179
and I did this and I did that he's like

2184
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,500
oh no dude I grew some [ __ ] and there

2185
01:28:12,179 --> 01:28:14,819
was like these couple seeds and then

2186
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,920
there's [ __ ] [ __ ] and it just

2187
01:28:14,819 --> 01:28:20,039
happened and all the stories that I've

2188
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:23,100
ever heard of the best stuff seem to

2189
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:24,840
come out of stories like that that are a

2190
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:29,639
little bit more random

2191
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:30,480
a little bit less self-involved

2192
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:32,400
um

2193
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:33,959
usually if someone has an elaborate

2194
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:35,638
story that makes them look like a

2195
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:39,060
mastermind

2196
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:41,699
you know it kind of makes you seem like

2197
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:45,360
you're probably full of [ __ ]

2198
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:47,939
and if you say that you just had a happy

2199
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:49,920
accident that's seems to be kind of

2200
01:28:47,939 --> 01:28:55,559
where stuff comes from more often than

2201
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:58,920
not and uh so that's why I

2202
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,300
I give his story

2203
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:03,300
um

2204
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:05,699
some air time in my brain of going okay

2205
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:10,500
well let's see what that means if this

2206
01:29:05,698 --> 01:29:12,960
means this and that means that and uh

2207
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:14,760
all of the all of the details kind of

2208
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,579
add up and that's the reason why I go on

2209
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:20,340
such a big cluster [ __ ] convoluted story

2210
01:29:17,579 --> 01:29:22,439
of this and that and this so that you

2211
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:25,319
can kind of picture how it looks in my

2212
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:26,698
head with my experience because

2213
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:30,059
um

2214
01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:32,899
it it does all it does all make sense to

2215
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:36,000
an extent and

2216
01:29:32,899 --> 01:29:39,479
I'm like somebody needs to make a meme

2217
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,279
of me with a stupid face with the

2218
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:43,439
letters where it's Capital small case

2219
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:45,539
Capital small case and it says

2220
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:49,460
everything and it says Northern Lights

2221
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:53,219
is in everything because I'm the dumbass

2222
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:56,279
who at this point does think that it

2223
01:29:53,219 --> 01:30:00,480
isn't everything because I believe that

2224
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:03,359
at some point cookies has Bubba in it I

2225
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:05,698
believe that at some point OG has Hindu

2226
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:08,939
and Northern Lights which it turns out

2227
01:30:05,698 --> 01:30:12,599
are probably the same thing

2228
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:14,819
um I think that Sour Diesel has it I

2229
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,800
think chemd has Northern Lights in it

2230
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:19,859
somewhere

2231
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:23,219
um and I have my Northern Lights oil can

2232
01:30:19,859 --> 01:30:25,679
which is oaxacan Afghani on our Northern

2233
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:27,539
Lights clone not crossed to the Northern

2234
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:30,000
Lights several times

2235
01:30:27,539 --> 01:30:31,500
and anybody who's had a lot of chem can

2236
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,939
smell what I'm pulling out of those

2237
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,439
seeds now

2238
01:30:32,939 --> 01:30:37,619
and

2239
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:39,479
without it seeming like it is chem

2240
01:30:37,619 --> 01:30:41,340
because it has different it has

2241
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:43,439
different aspects to the kind of the

2242
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:45,480
resin and the way the resin looks under

2243
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:48,178
a loop and all that I'd like to kind of

2244
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:50,099
I should probably get into somebody to

2245
01:30:48,179 --> 01:30:52,139
Gene test it like

2246
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:54,000
even though five of us is full of [ __ ]

2247
01:30:52,139 --> 01:30:57,179
they have they probably have the bigger

2248
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,520
Gene uh the bigger bigger uh database

2249
01:30:57,179 --> 01:31:00,119
right now to look at genes

2250
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,880
um

2251
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:07,139
it's very there's a lot of what I call

2252
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:09,179
Hot garbage that's like the chemd smell

2253
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:12,119
um it's in there from that Northern

2254
01:31:09,179 --> 01:31:14,158
Lights and uh

2255
01:31:12,119 --> 01:31:15,840
you know I don't know it's it's a really

2256
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:18,299
interesting thing but that but but but

2257
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,500
with that whole story

2258
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,320
um

2259
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:26,039
in my delusion at one point

2260
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:28,559
talking to Origins TK I had been like

2261
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:31,198
well Emerald Triangle

2262
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:35,699
[ __ ] I live in the Emerald Triangle

2263
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:38,759
late 80s who had clones in the late 80s

2264
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:40,919
I remember in 94.

2265
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:44,039
I brought a clone to my buddy OG

2266
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:45,960
foundation's farms and most of the old

2267
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:48,119
timers from the neighborhood who had had

2268
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:51,658
dank [ __ ] starting all the way back in

2269
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:54,059
the 70s even the 60s going into the 80s

2270
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:56,879
when what we wound up getting from from

2271
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:57,960
those old timers

2272
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,359
um

2273
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:02,760
everybody came to see what what does a

2274
01:32:00,359 --> 01:32:04,979
plant look like from clone and this was

2275
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:06,840
94 you know

2276
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:08,698
and uh

2277
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:12,420
it was a Northern Lights clone and we

2278
01:32:08,698 --> 01:32:15,539
had had it since 89. and my point to

2279
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:18,420
that is that most people had never seen

2280
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:22,560
a clone I'd only ever seen two clones

2281
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:25,679
by the time I was 15. one

2282
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:28,260
maybe by the time I was 14 one was the

2283
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:30,840
purple one and Leggett the other one was

2284
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:32,820
Northern Lights that my mom took and at

2285
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:34,739
that point everybody else popped seed

2286
01:32:32,819 --> 01:32:36,960
every every time because what a lot of

2287
01:32:34,738 --> 01:32:39,718
people don't realize these days is in

2288
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,939
those days you didn't have to have a bag

2289
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:43,980
of weed that was all one thing

2290
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:45,299
so you would have a bag of weed and you

2291
01:32:43,979 --> 01:32:48,359
would be like oh look there's a purple

2292
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:50,579
bud there's a green bud there's a leafy

2293
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:52,759
bud there's a hard bud and those pounds

2294
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:54,859
that's how pounds looked all the way

2295
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:58,020
until

2296
01:32:54,859 --> 01:33:01,079
2002 or 2003 it didn't [ __ ] matter

2297
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:04,320
until Urkel hit and then all of a sudden

2298
01:33:01,079 --> 01:33:07,439
everything had to be all one clone

2299
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:10,259
all in one bag the way people had been

2300
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:13,138
used to indoor all the way until that

2301
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:16,260
point you only saw pounds that were all

2302
01:33:13,139 --> 01:33:18,500
one thing if they were indoor an indoor

2303
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:23,100
all the way until

2304
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:25,738
95 96 maybe out right into there indoor

2305
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:28,020
was always worth less than outdoor

2306
01:33:25,738 --> 01:33:30,359
because everybody got it and they're

2307
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:33,600
like it's cool but you don't get high as

2308
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:36,479
long the flavor's not as deep it doesn't

2309
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,340
look quite right it's too bright it

2310
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:41,698
looks all white it doesn't have that

2311
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:44,460
real [ __ ] look and so indoor was like

2312
01:33:41,698 --> 01:33:48,359
a bad thing all the way until the late

2313
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:50,399
90s most people don't know that and the

2314
01:33:48,359 --> 01:33:52,380
only time it was different was maybe if

2315
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:53,759
you were in a place where there wasn't

2316
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:56,279
outdoor

2317
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,139
so weed was just weed and if it was

2318
01:33:56,279 --> 01:34:00,000
chronic it was chronic so you know

2319
01:33:58,139 --> 01:34:02,760
people in the mid 90s of course who were

2320
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,679
buying like indoor diesel or whatever it

2321
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,900
was yeah they're you know they're

2322
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:08,579
they're buying that and it's and it's

2323
01:34:06,899 --> 01:34:10,319
super high dollar ten twelve thousand

2324
01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:14,880
dollar pounds on the east coast and [ __ ]

2325
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:18,059
but in California if weed was worth 36

2326
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:21,719
outdoor indoor was worth 32. it was

2327
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:24,179
always worth less to have indoor weed

2328
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:26,819
all the way to a point and as soon as

2329
01:34:24,179 --> 01:34:29,219
indoor really caught in caught on it was

2330
01:34:26,819 --> 01:34:31,979
only a matter of time before outdoor had

2331
01:34:29,219 --> 01:34:34,380
to follow the indoor Trend which was to

2332
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:36,658
be growing all one thing and having all

2333
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:38,279
one thing in a bag and then all of a

2334
01:34:36,658 --> 01:34:42,000
sudden that's how it was

2335
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:44,759
but back in the days it wasn't really it

2336
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,340
wasn't really like that it was all just

2337
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:49,800
a mix in a bag you know

2338
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:51,360
so um

2339
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:53,579
I don't know where the [ __ ] I went with

2340
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:56,698
this now I'm I'm I'm I'm a [ __ ]

2341
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:58,500
Stoner trailing off but uh but this is

2342
01:34:56,698 --> 01:35:00,119
all true it's all true even if I don't

2343
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:02,100
know what I'm talking about even when I

2344
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:03,238
even when I lie you know

2345
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:06,539
um

2346
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:09,959
but no that's that's amazing I mean you

2347
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:12,359
covered both you know the the OG the

2348
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,100
Northern Lights the Hindu the indoor

2349
01:35:12,359 --> 01:35:16,619
outdoor just so many things in that

2350
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:18,120
answer I think I've got to ask you a

2351
01:35:16,619 --> 01:35:19,859
bunch of follow-ups on that but I mean

2352
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:23,340
the first one is do you think that that

2353
01:35:19,859 --> 01:35:25,738
change in like outdoor being worth more

2354
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:27,300
to suddenly end or being worth more do

2355
01:35:25,738 --> 01:35:30,299
you think that was because of Like

2356
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:33,539
Rappers and people talking about it and

2357
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:35,820
maybe even a growing focus on the

2358
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:37,738
Aesthetics of the plant which I'm

2359
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:39,479
guessing maybe at the time indoor

2360
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:41,218
started to out Edge it or do you think

2361
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:45,059
it was other factors

2362
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:47,279
well so I mean I I I spaced out on what

2363
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:48,900
I was talking about there but

2364
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:50,639
um I realized what I was talking about

2365
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:53,158
was

2366
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:54,960
um the reason why clone weed from clones

2367
01:35:53,158 --> 01:35:57,179
became popular

2368
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:00,060
right so the reason weed from clones

2369
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:03,480
became popular was because of because of

2370
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:07,159
indoor and I think indoor became popular

2371
01:36:03,479 --> 01:36:11,039
because people were growing from clones

2372
01:36:07,158 --> 01:36:13,679
and so when you got indoor at a certain

2373
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:15,479
point people were growing if they were

2374
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:17,399
growing indoor they were growing a clone

2375
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:19,198
because indoor was more sketchy to grow

2376
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:20,759
from seed because if you grew from seed

2377
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:22,919
indoor they're all you might have

2378
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,980
different heights some of them might be

2379
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:27,619
unstable whatever happened right but if

2380
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:30,419
you grew from a clone that was proven

2381
01:36:27,619 --> 01:36:34,079
like that purple clone or that Northern

2382
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:36,600
Lights clone then it was like okay now

2383
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:39,179
you have a predictable crop it'll all

2384
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,159
have an even canopy it'll all finish the

2385
01:36:39,179 --> 01:36:43,800
same day you know electricity is

2386
01:36:41,158 --> 01:36:45,420
expensive you need to know exactly what

2387
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,460
you're doing like indoor was a different

2388
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:50,579
game so clones

2389
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:52,619
started to have this advantage and so I

2390
01:36:50,579 --> 01:36:55,380
think at a certain point that's why

2391
01:36:52,619 --> 01:36:58,319
clones became popular

2392
01:36:55,380 --> 01:37:00,659
and then once that happened what people

2393
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:02,639
started to realize was when you buy

2394
01:37:00,658 --> 01:37:04,979
indoor

2395
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:08,760
the whole bag is the same [ __ ] weed

2396
01:37:04,979 --> 01:37:12,419
so if you really like a pound of indoor

2397
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:15,360
diesel you like it and that is something

2398
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:18,119
you can get that's more like a branded

2399
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:20,639
product whereas before it was like oh

2400
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:23,639
you want a soda here's a [ __ ] soda

2401
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:27,239
but once indoor came in it was like okay

2402
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:29,039
you want a Coca-Cola get a Coca-Cola but

2403
01:37:27,238 --> 01:37:31,019
before that when you'd have your your

2404
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:31,920
garden would be done and you'd be like

2405
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:33,780
oh

2406
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,158
oh there's that one all right go ahead

2407
01:37:33,779 --> 01:37:36,719
and pull out a little bit of that and

2408
01:37:35,158 --> 01:37:38,279
swap it out with this right here because

2409
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,560
we want to stop that was the good one

2410
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:43,079
you know and it wasn't like this stuff

2411
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,780
wasn't so particular weed was worth so

2412
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:48,179
much money that it wasn't like uh

2413
01:37:45,779 --> 01:37:49,619
in a lot of cases you couldn't you know

2414
01:37:48,179 --> 01:37:51,239
years later it was like I started

2415
01:37:49,619 --> 01:37:53,219
smoking 10 pounds a year or something

2416
01:37:51,238 --> 01:37:54,839
you know because it was like you could

2417
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:56,399
just take whatever you want and go okay

2418
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:58,380
we want this one this one do that

2419
01:37:56,399 --> 01:37:59,939
separate but originally it was so

2420
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:02,760
valuable that you'd be like all right

2421
01:37:59,939 --> 01:38:05,460
well the odds and ends after all is said

2422
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:07,440
and done we'll we'll put that aside and

2423
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:09,779
if it weighs a quarter pound

2424
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:11,519
then maybe we can dig through the pounds

2425
01:38:09,779 --> 01:38:13,619
and find the ones we want and we'll take

2426
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:15,719
this stuff and we'll swap it back in and

2427
01:38:13,619 --> 01:38:18,179
wind up with a quarter pound we really

2428
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:21,179
want instead of the one we're left with

2429
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:23,399
but um but I think that part of what

2430
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:25,800
popularized indoor was the fact that

2431
01:38:23,399 --> 01:38:28,019
When people grew indoor it was all one

2432
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:30,239
thing and when you buy something and

2433
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:32,340
it's more predictable

2434
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:34,979
um I think that's kind of a value-added

2435
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:37,380
product where you're like okay well

2436
01:38:34,979 --> 01:38:39,299
you know it was cool to get a sack of

2437
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:42,060
weed great but then you're like I really

2438
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:44,279
like that one and so

2439
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:46,080
the fact that people weren't doing that

2440
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:48,000
outdoor because outdoor people were

2441
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:49,679
growing off from seed unless you were

2442
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,479
like the people who were getting clones

2443
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,579
from us back in the day who were growing

2444
01:38:51,479 --> 01:38:54,658
Northern Lights

2445
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:57,179
um

2446
01:38:54,658 --> 01:38:59,819
you know it's I think I think that had a

2447
01:38:57,179 --> 01:39:02,520
big influence with being something that

2448
01:38:59,819 --> 01:39:05,698
you knew what you were getting exactly

2449
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:08,880
and I think indoor it's one thing

2450
01:39:05,698 --> 01:39:10,439
outdoor it's mixed and I think that had

2451
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,039
a big

2452
01:39:10,439 --> 01:39:13,619
um

2453
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:16,198
I think that had a big a big role in

2454
01:39:13,619 --> 01:39:18,779
kind of dividing the markets and making

2455
01:39:16,198 --> 01:39:21,599
indoor be something that was more sought

2456
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:24,899
after and then of course people figured

2457
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:28,320
out how to grow indoor really well

2458
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:29,759
um in Mass believe it or not a lot of I

2459
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:31,619
mean right now still a lot of indoor

2460
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,360
sucks don't get me wrong I'm a lot of

2461
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:35,399
[ __ ] Outdoors a lot of outdoor sucks

2462
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:37,979
I'm not saying you know like indoors

2463
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:40,859
worse than outdoor but

2464
01:39:37,979 --> 01:39:43,079
in all the way through the 90s A lot of

2465
01:39:40,859 --> 01:39:44,519
times if you saw indoor it would be

2466
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:46,319
people would be like all right we need

2467
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:48,000
to get it out to get the next run and so

2468
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:49,619
what does that mean let's cut a little

2469
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,460
early

2470
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:53,158
um

2471
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,079
it's handled it's all green trimmed and

2472
01:39:53,158 --> 01:39:58,198
handled a lot so they can get it out the

2473
01:39:55,079 --> 01:40:00,960
door it's dried a lot faster because we

2474
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:03,359
need to get rid of it and so

2475
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:06,260
like at a certain point when people

2476
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:09,539
started doing connoisseur level indoor

2477
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:12,900
that really I think helped to drive up

2478
01:40:09,539 --> 01:40:16,560
the value of indoor and I think as funny

2479
01:40:12,899 --> 01:40:18,839
as it is that that happened

2480
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:21,980
in places where there was less weed

2481
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:25,199
faster because people

2482
01:40:21,979 --> 01:40:28,259
valued it more highly and would have

2483
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:31,559
less and so would handle it better and I

2484
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:35,579
think that's where like East Coast

2485
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:38,520
indoor being so [ __ ] good in the 90s

2486
01:40:35,579 --> 01:40:39,719
was the deal where the people who are on

2487
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:41,940
the East Coast who were the real

2488
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:44,520
connoisseurs happen to be growing indoor

2489
01:40:41,939 --> 01:40:46,799
and the people on the west coast in the

2490
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:49,800
90s who were the real connoisseurs were

2491
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:52,739
growing outdoor and the people who were

2492
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:56,699
growing weed on the in the indoors on

2493
01:40:52,738 --> 01:40:59,698
the west coast in the 90s were more

2494
01:40:56,698 --> 01:41:01,678
uh were more concerned about it as a

2495
01:40:59,698 --> 01:41:04,079
product and so we're kind of just

2496
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:07,800
busting it out busting it out you know

2497
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:11,279
and I think that that kind of uh

2498
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:13,139
I think that that kept it that kept it

2499
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:15,300
not being as good of a thing and then

2500
01:41:13,139 --> 01:41:18,779
when people started like okay let's

2501
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:19,920
really do really nice indoor

2502
01:41:18,779 --> 01:41:22,738
um

2503
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,359
then then it stepped it up a lot you

2504
01:41:22,738 --> 01:41:26,039
know and I think that's I think that's

2505
01:41:24,359 --> 01:41:28,079
that's part of the dynamic and that's

2506
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:30,779
not to say that's the answer to all of

2507
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:35,300
it but I those those are things that I

2508
01:41:30,779 --> 01:41:37,819
noticed and looking in you know uh

2509
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:40,739
retrospectively like the the difference

2510
01:41:37,819 --> 01:41:44,158
and how the East Coast had this really

2511
01:41:40,738 --> 01:41:46,559
killer mid 90s indoor and I'm not saying

2512
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:49,500
that the people I know didn't have it

2513
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:52,619
then it was just that

2514
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:55,560
in like 1993 you were almost better off

2515
01:41:52,618 --> 01:41:57,719
saying if you have really nice indoor

2516
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:59,520
just being like yeah this is killer this

2517
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:03,719
is killer outdoor and you'd get a better

2518
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:06,480
price you know because people were used

2519
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:09,300
to it being that

2520
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:12,539
um indoor in the derogatory sense where

2521
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:14,940
you go dude it's just like not you know

2522
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:16,920
and I still see that kind of indoor

2523
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:20,158
from people where I'm just like I don't

2524
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:22,260
really know what you did but you know

2525
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:23,279
and then the insane indoor that you see

2526
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:25,440
that you're like this is the greatest

2527
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:27,118
weed on earth a lot of people have that

2528
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:30,419
but it would typically be like the lady

2529
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:33,299
with one light or the lady with three

2530
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:35,340
lights or the dude with eight lights or

2531
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:38,600
whatever and those would be the ones

2532
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:41,219
that you'd be like whoa holy [ __ ] like

2533
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:43,020
man and that that was the stuff that

2534
01:42:41,219 --> 01:42:44,639
that you that you look at and you go

2535
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:47,940
this should be worth more than outdoor

2536
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:51,060
but because it wasn't the norm

2537
01:42:47,939 --> 01:42:55,618
it it didn't um

2538
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:58,440
it didn't represent itself enough and so

2539
01:42:55,618 --> 01:43:00,238
there was like it's like you know kind

2540
01:42:58,439 --> 01:43:02,460
of like a boutique market like people

2541
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:03,539
who know they want these three pounds

2542
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:05,460
from this lady

2543
01:43:03,539 --> 01:43:07,618
that only has three pounds every two and

2544
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:09,539
a half months you know people who know

2545
01:43:07,618 --> 01:43:11,039
but at the same time if people are just

2546
01:43:09,539 --> 01:43:12,719
looking for a bunch of indoor they're

2547
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,939
like yeah my price is this for this and

2548
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:17,520
it's this for that and you know outdoor

2549
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:19,979
was more valuable all the way until at

2550
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:22,739
least the mid 90s for sure

2551
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:24,118
yeah I mean that totally makes sense the

2552
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:26,879
way you describe it it's really

2553
01:43:24,118 --> 01:43:28,799
interesting to hear how things kind of

2554
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,719
changed in the Emerald Triangle from

2555
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,880
outdoor to indoor and I mean obviously

2556
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:34,800
Outdoors still very possible and I love

2557
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,199
the little anecdote about you know the

2558
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:40,320
old lady with the three lights I mean

2559
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:42,658
speaking of uh I'd love to if you're

2560
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:44,698
willing to chat about

2561
01:43:42,658 --> 01:43:46,618
um some history from your mum if

2562
01:43:44,698 --> 01:43:49,319
possible because when I talk to the real

2563
01:43:46,618 --> 01:43:50,880
heads like Bodhi and Mr Bob Hemphill and

2564
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:52,859
stuff they always tell me they're like

2565
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,560
man you want to know a real OG of the

2566
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:58,500
Emerald Triangle mean Gene's mom she was

2567
01:43:55,560 --> 01:44:00,719
laying some groundwork did she ever tell

2568
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:03,118
you any cool stories about like you know

2569
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:05,760
bud from yesteryear that she was able to

2570
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:07,259
smoke or like sort of the way she and

2571
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,579
her friends used to do things back in

2572
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:11,280
the day

2573
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:14,819
well so it's interesting you know my my

2574
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:16,679
mom it my mom is not somebody who I

2575
01:44:14,819 --> 01:44:19,859
would say is

2576
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:21,359
uh there's a there's a funny thing and

2577
01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:24,539
I've kind of addressed this a little bit

2578
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:26,880
because of of people being full of [ __ ]

2579
01:44:24,539 --> 01:44:28,800
and not really understanding the reality

2580
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:32,520
of of uh

2581
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:34,619
of things you know people go oh

2582
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:37,139
well you're you're [ __ ] second

2583
01:44:34,618 --> 01:44:40,439
generation so you just had it all handed

2584
01:44:37,139 --> 01:44:42,480
to you and blah blah blah it's like just

2585
01:44:40,439 --> 01:44:45,059
to break down the reality of it is

2586
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:46,379
honestly my generation was the first

2587
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:50,219
ones

2588
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:51,600
and not even you know unfortunately not

2589
01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:54,000
even me but

2590
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,219
my generation was the first people who

2591
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,020
realized how to actually make money off

2592
01:44:56,219 --> 01:45:01,500
a weed

2593
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:03,540
um my mom's generation was like they

2594
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:07,500
would grow a little bit and it was

2595
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:08,880
almost impossible to have anything and

2596
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:11,279
if

2597
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:14,279
you know it was all a learning process

2598
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:16,559
so the deer would eat your crop the

2599
01:45:14,279 --> 01:45:19,439
rip-offs would take your crop

2600
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:22,560
you know the neighbors would take your

2601
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:24,359
crop [ __ ] your crop would be done and

2602
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,639
someone would pull the [ __ ] Windows

2603
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:28,439
off your [ __ ] house and take your

2604
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:29,460
crop

2605
01:45:28,439 --> 01:45:32,099
um

2606
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:35,219
you know my mom's not somebody who's

2607
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:38,760
ever made any of her money like she she

2608
01:45:35,219 --> 01:45:39,719
didn't she's not like a a big

2609
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:42,300
um

2610
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:44,819
a big farmer who made money off of weed

2611
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:47,760
and [ __ ] you know it was like she tried

2612
01:45:44,819 --> 01:45:50,219
to survive working you know other jobs

2613
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:53,280
and and and trying to have a couple

2614
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:54,239
plants so that maybe she could

2615
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:56,039
um

2616
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:58,439
so that she could be a little bit more

2617
01:45:56,039 --> 01:46:00,238
normal in the country because here

2618
01:45:58,439 --> 01:46:03,178
there's not

2619
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:05,939
uh there's not a lot of opportunity you

2620
01:46:03,179 --> 01:46:09,539
know my mom trimmed other people's weed

2621
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:13,079
my mom washed dishes uh she she opened

2622
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:16,979
the first recycling center in this area

2623
01:46:13,079 --> 01:46:18,800
and you know barely made a tiny bit of

2624
01:46:16,979 --> 01:46:20,459
money off of that

2625
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:22,320
uh

2626
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:24,899
so

2627
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:27,420
you know the the the the the the first

2628
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:29,939
gener the first generation of people who

2629
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:31,440
were the real who were the real people

2630
01:46:29,939 --> 01:46:35,399
who really

2631
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:38,399
figured things out they they didn't get

2632
01:46:35,399 --> 01:46:39,658
to really reap the rewards of all this

2633
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:40,819
[ __ ]

2634
01:46:39,658 --> 01:46:42,479
um

2635
01:46:40,819 --> 01:46:46,019
so

2636
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:48,059
you know when when people say like oh

2637
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:50,460
whatever you know your [ __ ] your parents

2638
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:51,420
were Ballers and grew weed and [ __ ] you

2639
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:54,118
know

2640
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:56,219
they don't understand that there was no

2641
01:46:54,118 --> 01:46:58,939
uh

2642
01:46:56,219 --> 01:47:03,840
there was no

2643
01:46:58,939 --> 01:47:07,198
coolness there was no oh I grow weed I'm

2644
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:10,440
Mr cool I'm gonna have a brand I'm gonna

2645
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:12,238
look fancy I'm gonna be [ __ ] you know

2646
01:47:10,439 --> 01:47:15,059
people are gonna kiss my ass because I

2647
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:17,218
got some [ __ ] weed and all this [ __ ]

2648
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:19,739
that [ __ ] people come in carpet bag

2649
01:47:17,219 --> 01:47:21,719
and trying to [ __ ] do their little

2650
01:47:19,738 --> 01:47:22,618
[ __ ] with you know

2651
01:47:21,719 --> 01:47:27,600
um

2652
01:47:22,618 --> 01:47:30,139
his [ __ ] was rough it wasn't anything

2653
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:34,679
it wasn't anything that you would do

2654
01:47:30,139 --> 01:47:36,840
because it's your dream and all this

2655
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:39,239
[ __ ] [ __ ] with these Jokers you know

2656
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:42,840
it was basically

2657
01:47:39,238 --> 01:47:44,698
um survival and it was risking your ass

2658
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:48,420
knowing that

2659
01:47:44,698 --> 01:47:51,299
you might be [ __ ] up and you might be

2660
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:53,819
you might be destroying your [ __ ]

2661
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:56,400
chances of having a a good life by

2662
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:57,899
taking these risks but at the same time

2663
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:01,019
you're putting yourself out there

2664
01:47:57,899 --> 01:48:03,118
because you don't know what else to do

2665
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:05,580
and there really isn't anything else to

2666
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:07,759
do because you live in a place where

2667
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:11,579
it's nice

2668
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:14,880
and you know it's safe for your kids

2669
01:48:11,579 --> 01:48:16,859
because you're in the country and you

2670
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:20,880
have a lot of different opportunities

2671
01:48:16,859 --> 01:48:25,139
for the things that we as a species do

2672
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:28,199
really well with but we as a society

2673
01:48:25,139 --> 01:48:30,060
you know it wasn't really any of the

2674
01:48:28,198 --> 01:48:32,279
stuff that most people get the benefits

2675
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:36,600
of who live in places where things are

2676
01:48:32,279 --> 01:48:38,939
nice it was the woods and uh

2677
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:41,460
you know it's a Trippy [ __ ] thing so

2678
01:48:38,939 --> 01:48:43,919
I gotta throw that out there because of

2679
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:45,480
how people like to perceive things and

2680
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,819
these people I'm talking about are not

2681
01:48:45,479 --> 01:48:49,559
Bodhi and these guys because they

2682
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:52,618
understand that they know they know what

2683
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:56,719
the [ __ ] up you know but um

2684
01:48:52,618 --> 01:48:59,399
but the trippy thing is that uh

2685
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:01,560
my mom the first thing I can remember

2686
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:05,039
her talking about that was really really

2687
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:06,780
stand out was the was what they called

2688
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:10,579
the Missouri

2689
01:49:06,779 --> 01:49:15,000
which was weed from Mazar in Afghanistan

2690
01:49:10,579 --> 01:49:18,479
and uh she said it was big big tall

2691
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:20,579
[ __ ] plants but then they budded with

2692
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:22,799
these huge

2693
01:49:20,579 --> 01:49:25,079
fat [ __ ] Buds and it was just the

2694
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:29,100
most gorgeous [ __ ] and they grew it in a

2695
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:30,179
creek bed out in Woodman Canyon and it

2696
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:33,420
had a

2697
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:34,500
it had these big

2698
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:38,158
um

2699
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:39,600
these big beautiful buds on it that she

2700
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:42,059
said were just they had never seen

2701
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:45,300
anything like it and it was just so

2702
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:49,320
[ __ ] incredible and they grew it for

2703
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:50,880
a year or two this is like 84.85 or 85

2704
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:55,319
86

2705
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:57,739
and then in making the seeds at some

2706
01:49:55,319 --> 01:50:01,559
point the wrong one got picked

2707
01:49:57,738 --> 01:50:02,519
and my dad my my stepdad

2708
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:04,260
um

2709
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:05,880
who I don't like to really call my

2710
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:08,699
stepdad but that's just for

2711
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:11,520
technicalities but my my dad who I grew

2712
01:50:08,698 --> 01:50:14,219
up with my mom's boyfriend

2713
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:16,739
um he said that at a certain point it

2714
01:50:14,219 --> 01:50:18,960
just turned into lettuce weed and it

2715
01:50:16,738 --> 01:50:20,399
really wasn't anything that all of us

2716
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:23,460
all of a sudden it was like well you

2717
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:26,460
can't grow this [ __ ] and they lost it

2718
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:28,380
and they were super bummed and then he

2719
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:31,260
started growing what he got from his

2720
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:35,279
buddy Charlie which was oaxacan Afghani

2721
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:36,719
which he later gave to

2722
01:50:35,279 --> 01:50:39,118
um our buddy Ted

2723
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,880
who who passed away

2724
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:44,039
um years ago now

2725
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:46,579
and Ted ended up giving it to this other

2726
01:50:44,039 --> 01:50:50,939
guy who was out there in the canyon

2727
01:50:46,579 --> 01:50:53,579
and he was the one Ted and his worker

2728
01:50:50,939 --> 01:50:55,439
who's this other guy they would get

2729
01:50:53,579 --> 01:50:57,539
clones from my mom which was the

2730
01:50:55,439 --> 01:51:01,439
Northern Lights all the way starting in

2731
01:50:57,539 --> 01:51:03,779
like maybe 92 or 91 and they grew him

2732
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:05,479
and then he would grow it and he would

2733
01:51:03,779 --> 01:51:07,738
back cross it

2734
01:51:05,479 --> 01:51:08,698
to his

2735
01:51:07,738 --> 01:51:11,399
um

2736
01:51:08,698 --> 01:51:13,738
to his oaxacan Afghani which he called

2737
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:16,019
the oil can and the soil depending on

2738
01:51:13,738 --> 01:51:17,519
what it smelled like and he back crossed

2739
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:21,179
and back crossed and bat crossed and

2740
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:23,520
that's what my buddy ended up taking and

2741
01:51:21,179 --> 01:51:25,020
giving it to our other buddy who bred it

2742
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,159
a couple times gave it back and that's

2743
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:28,020
what we call

2744
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:29,579
p-o-g

2745
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:32,580
or

2746
01:51:29,579 --> 01:51:33,840
uh Northern Lights oil can and that's

2747
01:51:32,579 --> 01:51:35,760
what that that's what that actually

2748
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:38,699
comes out of so that's like tracing it

2749
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:42,840
back going back to whatever 87 or

2750
01:51:38,698 --> 01:51:46,618
something when George got that and uh

2751
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:49,199
then you know like uh my mom wasn't like

2752
01:51:46,618 --> 01:51:50,698
a heavy smoker or anything but I mean

2753
01:51:49,198 --> 01:51:52,379
some of the special stuff I remember

2754
01:51:50,698 --> 01:51:54,719
seeing was like when she took me up

2755
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:56,699
there to leg it to that lady's house

2756
01:51:54,719 --> 01:52:00,960
and uh

2757
01:51:56,698 --> 01:52:03,138
I saw that perp not purple and then um

2758
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:07,618
you know the various things but really

2759
01:52:03,139 --> 01:52:10,380
after 89 the Northern Lights was like

2760
01:52:07,618 --> 01:52:13,738
our workhouse plant our Workhorse plant

2761
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:17,760
and that was what was around all the way

2762
01:52:13,738 --> 01:52:20,359
really until uh the mid 90s

2763
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:25,619
we moved to Hawaii

2764
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:27,779
we came back and it was still around but

2765
01:52:25,618 --> 01:52:29,639
I had some other stuff we were we were

2766
01:52:27,779 --> 01:52:33,238
doing other stuff

2767
01:52:29,639 --> 01:52:34,800
and uh then

2768
01:52:33,238 --> 01:52:37,559
I thought it was gone all the way till

2769
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:40,380
like 2004 2005 and then I talked to my

2770
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:42,300
buddy down in Healdsburg and he was like

2771
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:43,618
yeah no we still got we still got those

2772
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:45,659
and I was like oh I want to get them

2773
01:52:43,618 --> 01:52:47,579
back and then he brought him to me and

2774
01:52:45,658 --> 01:52:50,099
it turned out he thought I wanted the

2775
01:52:47,579 --> 01:52:50,899
the dirt big bud

2776
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:52,679
um

2777
01:52:50,899 --> 01:52:54,359
and

2778
01:52:52,679 --> 01:52:55,800
he didn't know that I wanted the

2779
01:52:54,359 --> 01:52:57,599
northern lights so I got the dirt big

2780
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:00,000
but I seeded it and that's what the Pina

2781
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:03,600
comes out of but he had the Northern

2782
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:06,658
Lights still at that point and I talked

2783
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:08,880
to him that was probably in

2784
01:53:06,658 --> 01:53:10,379
maybe July or something because I

2785
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,300
remember I seated those plants they were

2786
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:15,420
still small and they were done so I had

2787
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:18,000
to be fairly late in the year and then I

2788
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:19,679
ended up talking to him

2789
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,939
when he gave me those and telling them

2790
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:22,319
you know I'd like to get those other

2791
01:53:20,939 --> 01:53:24,899
ones he was like cool cool we'll figure

2792
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:26,519
it out and that winner down in Sonoma

2793
01:53:24,899 --> 01:53:31,439
County in Healdsburg the Russian River

2794
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:33,840
flooded and his buddy had a trailer

2795
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:35,579
where they kept their moms and it was

2796
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,619
just a mom operation where they would

2797
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:40,260
get all their clones out of

2798
01:53:37,618 --> 01:53:42,059
and the whole [ __ ] trailer washed

2799
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:44,760
away in the [ __ ] flood down the

2800
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:47,580
Russian River and they lost it all and

2801
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:50,039
that was so that was like the the one

2802
01:53:47,579 --> 01:53:51,779
real the one plant that my mom really

2803
01:53:50,039 --> 01:53:55,139
kept

2804
01:53:51,779 --> 01:53:57,059
um was gone at that point and she had

2805
01:53:55,139 --> 01:53:59,340
already not had it for like 10 years but

2806
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:01,440
they had it and that was just like this

2807
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:03,239
huge tragedy and to this day it's like

2808
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:04,979
every time someone says they have a

2809
01:54:03,238 --> 01:54:07,138
Northern Lights clone I'm always like oh

2810
01:54:04,979 --> 01:54:09,059
well what's it look like because

2811
01:54:07,139 --> 01:54:10,618
that's what I was getting into when I

2812
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:12,360
trailed off and I forgot what I was

2813
01:54:10,618 --> 01:54:14,759
talking about earlier was that the

2814
01:54:12,359 --> 01:54:17,099
Northern Lights was really one of the

2815
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:20,460
only things you would see around that

2816
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:23,820
was a clone and I saw the exact same

2817
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:27,060
clone we'd come back from Chico I saw it

2818
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:29,759
come back from up further north

2819
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:31,560
um it circulated a lot because back then

2820
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,420
it was like oh if somebody wants clones

2821
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:34,920
they would get something that was

2822
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:37,260
already grown from clone they knew was

2823
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:39,658
good indoor and then once people got

2824
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:42,840
those they would mother them up and they

2825
01:54:39,658 --> 01:54:45,420
would they would sell clothes and so it

2826
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:48,480
kept it really limited because clone you

2827
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:50,579
know clone cloning

2828
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:53,579
um it wasn't really a popular thing to

2829
01:54:50,579 --> 01:54:55,319
do and uh I know I know different people

2830
01:54:53,579 --> 01:54:57,300
did kept a couple clones all over

2831
01:54:55,319 --> 01:54:59,340
because there's clones from the 90s

2832
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:01,980
but

2833
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:04,560
cloning became much more popular in the

2834
01:55:01,979 --> 01:55:07,259
2000s than it when the late the late 90s

2835
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:10,440
than it was in the 80s and the early 90s

2836
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:11,940
so I like think probably someone still

2837
01:55:10,439 --> 01:55:13,919
must [ __ ] have it out somewhere

2838
01:55:11,939 --> 01:55:16,079
because it's such a good plant but I've

2839
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:19,440
never been able to find it but that was

2840
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:21,960
like really my uh my mom's thing that

2841
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:24,419
she found that was really really good

2842
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:26,399
and other than that you know

2843
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:28,319
um

2844
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:30,118
really the only ones I can really

2845
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:33,179
remember her talking about was that

2846
01:55:30,118 --> 01:55:36,000
original Missouri and and then knowing

2847
01:55:33,179 --> 01:55:37,618
that that Northern Lights and she got

2848
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,420
that Northern Lights and a manila

2849
01:55:37,618 --> 01:55:42,719
envelope that just said Northern Lights

2850
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:47,940
seed bank on it and she got those in in

2851
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:51,420
89 when we lived where the uh area 101

2852
01:55:47,939 --> 01:55:53,219
where the emerald cup started now is and

2853
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:55,139
then we moved and we had this little

2854
01:55:53,219 --> 01:55:57,658
shed and she used to just have like you

2855
01:55:55,139 --> 01:55:59,819
know a little a little thing with like

2856
01:55:57,658 --> 01:56:02,579
two 400 watt lights or something like

2857
01:55:59,819 --> 01:56:06,359
that and uh it just basically kept us

2858
01:56:02,579 --> 01:56:08,698
from [ __ ] starving you know so uh

2859
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:11,579
that that whole era was a lot different

2860
01:56:08,698 --> 01:56:13,019
and some people had had the magic pieces

2861
01:56:11,579 --> 01:56:14,819
of property where you wouldn't get

2862
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:17,520
busted and you could grow a lot of weed

2863
01:56:14,819 --> 01:56:19,500
and some people made a lot of money but

2864
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:22,020
um it was hard and it was a completely

2865
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:23,939
different thing than people think of it

2866
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:25,980
as and some people thought a good tricks

2867
01:56:23,939 --> 01:56:29,158
and some people you know were able to do

2868
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:33,839
[ __ ] my mom was a single mom she had two

2869
01:56:29,158 --> 01:56:35,759
kids and uh you know her whole uh her

2870
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:38,039
whole thing was just you know putting

2871
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:41,039
putting everything on the line to be

2872
01:56:38,039 --> 01:56:43,859
able to do that [ __ ] she got busted in

2873
01:56:41,039 --> 01:56:45,238
1982 with a couple small plants on the

2874
01:56:43,859 --> 01:56:47,339
back porch

2875
01:56:45,238 --> 01:56:50,698
because her roommate started a big

2876
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:53,819
argument with the [ __ ] landlord and

2877
01:56:50,698 --> 01:56:57,178
the landlord called the cops because he

2878
01:56:53,819 --> 01:57:01,618
knew there was weed and uh you know she

2879
01:56:57,179 --> 01:57:04,560
got locked up in 1982 and probably

2880
01:57:01,618 --> 01:57:07,019
my earliest memory is driving behind

2881
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:09,960
with this lady Joey

2882
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:11,639
in the car looking at my mom waving at

2883
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:13,739
me from the back of a cop car on a

2884
01:57:11,639 --> 01:57:16,500
[ __ ] dirt road you know

2885
01:57:13,738 --> 01:57:19,439
so uh

2886
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:24,899
not you know not the uh

2887
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:26,579
not the Glorious [ __ ] hand-me-down

2888
01:57:24,899 --> 01:57:29,219
um

2889
01:57:26,579 --> 01:57:30,960
you know type of lifestyle that people

2890
01:57:29,219 --> 01:57:33,359
want to make it out to be when they just

2891
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:36,118
show up here to try to [ __ ] make a

2892
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:39,118
quick buck and during the [ __ ] 2 15

2893
01:57:36,118 --> 01:57:42,359
year and then talk down on on on me for

2894
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:43,859
being uh you know the dude who just

2895
01:57:42,359 --> 01:57:45,839
[ __ ] grew up with everything because

2896
01:57:43,859 --> 01:57:48,960
I was from Mendo you know

2897
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:51,420
yeah wow what a powerful story about

2898
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:53,639
what mums will go through to follow

2899
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:55,380
passion and put food on the table and

2900
01:57:53,639 --> 01:57:58,139
you know major props to your mum for

2901
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:59,520
that and it's I guess yeah continuing on

2902
01:57:58,139 --> 01:58:01,859
what you said that's a bit of a bummer

2903
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,420
that people assume that just because

2904
01:58:01,859 --> 01:58:05,339
you're second generation that everything

2905
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:06,840
was given to you it's based on that

2906
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:08,219
story you could almost argue it's the

2907
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:10,679
opposite like things are probably a bit

2908
01:58:08,219 --> 01:58:12,300
harder in fact yeah well it's it's

2909
01:58:10,679 --> 01:58:13,679
pretty what it is is it's projection

2910
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:16,860
because they showed up and everything

2911
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:19,800
was easy as [ __ ] and so they look at me

2912
01:58:16,859 --> 01:58:21,479
and they go oh well you know you things

2913
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:24,480
must have been so easy for you because

2914
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:27,539
you showed up even sooner and I'm like

2915
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:29,759
yeah you showed up after the drug war

2916
01:58:27,539 --> 01:58:33,539
had pretty much [ __ ] disappeared for

2917
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:36,719
most people and I showed up and turned

2918
01:58:33,539 --> 01:58:39,539
[ __ ] you know two years old my mom

2919
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:42,060
got arrested and four years old [ __ ]

2920
01:58:39,539 --> 01:58:44,340
you know Camp campaign against marijuana

2921
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:46,260
planting started

2922
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:49,079
and uh

2923
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:51,119
you know it's a [ __ ] real different

2924
01:58:49,079 --> 01:58:52,800
thing you know I got buddies who you

2925
01:58:51,118 --> 01:58:55,198
know used to

2926
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:57,000
used to go to school you know or used to

2927
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:58,799
go to their house and I was like oh you

2928
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,618
know where's your dad like oh my dad

2929
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:03,840
he's he's uh you know he's hiding in

2930
01:59:01,618 --> 01:59:06,598
Mexico or where's your dad oh he's gonna

2931
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:09,659
be in jail for [ __ ] couple years or

2932
01:59:06,599 --> 01:59:12,480
you know [ __ ] whatever it is you know

2933
01:59:09,658 --> 01:59:14,759
like oh your pop had to had to [ __ ]

2934
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:17,759
log his property and he's still gonna do

2935
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:19,920
six years or whatever it is you know and

2936
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:22,380
then dudes show up and [ __ ] make a

2937
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:26,579
bunch of easy money and then wanna want

2938
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:28,500
to talk [ __ ] to to us like we're the you

2939
01:59:26,579 --> 01:59:29,819
know we had everything handed to us on a

2940
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:32,819
platter and I'm like you guys didn't

2941
01:59:29,819 --> 01:59:34,979
even you guys didn't even [ __ ] earn

2942
01:59:32,819 --> 01:59:37,259
earn [ __ ] they didn't make their bones

2943
01:59:34,979 --> 01:59:38,879
doing [ __ ] they just showed up carpet

2944
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:40,800
bagging and then talk a bunch of [ __ ]

2945
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:44,520
you know so

2946
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:46,679
yeah yeah totally that's a bummity here

2947
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:49,560
and hopefully this can help shed some

2948
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:51,359
light on that sort of fallacy something

2949
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:53,400
I definitely took away from that story

2950
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:55,439
that I thought was interesting was how

2951
01:59:53,399 --> 01:59:58,138
you know this amazing Northern Lights

2952
01:59:55,439 --> 02:00:00,658
that your mum came across came from some

2953
01:59:58,139 --> 02:00:03,060
seed stock from like a seed bank I think

2954
02:00:00,658 --> 02:00:05,039
a lot of people including myself in the

2955
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:07,760
past have made the mistake of assuming

2956
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:10,679
that all of this sort of mythical

2957
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:13,679
strains and seeds that existed around

2958
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:15,960
that area in that time were like all

2959
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:18,239
from like brothers of eternal love and

2960
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:20,579
all that sort of Mythology do you think

2961
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:22,618
that Trope kind of gets played out a

2962
02:00:20,579 --> 02:00:24,599
little too much and some of it is a bit

2963
02:00:22,618 --> 02:00:26,759
less exciting in its Origins and it's

2964
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:28,199
just like good stock from a seed bank or

2965
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:30,179
do you think that the brothers of

2966
02:00:28,198 --> 02:00:32,399
eternal love did in fact contribute a

2967
02:00:30,179 --> 02:00:33,300
lot to the genetics in the scene at that

2968
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:37,079
time

2969
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:39,659
I mean I assume they did I don't really

2970
02:00:37,079 --> 02:00:41,219
um I don't really know too much but I

2971
02:00:39,658 --> 02:00:43,379
can tell you there's an interesting

2972
02:00:41,219 --> 02:00:46,139
thing where we

2973
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:47,940
I mean imagine back in the day we first

2974
02:00:46,139 --> 02:00:50,460
got interested in weed it was the mid

2975
02:00:47,939 --> 02:00:54,178
90s me and my buddies are like 14 or 15

2976
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:56,279
right like as a parent I look at I look

2977
02:00:54,179 --> 02:00:58,980
at you know kids I look at my

2978
02:00:56,279 --> 02:01:00,539
nine-year-old and I go yeah you tell

2979
02:00:58,979 --> 02:01:02,339
them things but you don't tell them

2980
02:01:00,539 --> 02:01:04,979
everything right it's just a natural

2981
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:07,199
thing to be like yeah these stories

2982
02:01:04,979 --> 02:01:09,000
aren't for you to walk around holding

2983
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:10,859
they it might be kind of heavy

2984
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:14,039
especially in our day when things were

2985
02:01:10,859 --> 02:01:15,238
still really considered criminal and you

2986
02:01:14,039 --> 02:01:17,880
know you don't you don't want to tell

2987
02:01:15,238 --> 02:01:19,618
your kids like all this heavy duty [ __ ]

2988
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:21,118
that you know they can't tell anybody

2989
02:01:19,618 --> 02:01:23,098
you're like that that's just a

2990
02:01:21,118 --> 02:01:24,479
disservice in a sense you know

2991
02:01:23,099 --> 02:01:26,699
so

2992
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:30,059
talking to my buddy

2993
02:01:26,698 --> 02:01:32,759
um OG Foundation Farms a while back

2994
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:34,440
he's he's telling me you know I'm

2995
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:37,320
talking to him about like some different

2996
02:01:34,439 --> 02:01:39,598
strains and he's like yeah you know I

2997
02:01:37,319 --> 02:01:40,679
was talking to uh I was talking to so

2998
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:44,460
and so

2999
02:01:40,679 --> 02:01:46,500
and uh you know he was he was not well

3000
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:48,719
and I wanted to know some stories and he

3001
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:51,359
was of that older generation and so I

3002
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:53,340
started kind of you know talking to him

3003
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:55,259
and digging a little bit to try to you

3004
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:57,179
know just kind of learn more and knowing

3005
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:58,800
that now it's two grown grown men

3006
02:01:57,179 --> 02:02:01,440
talking and [ __ ]

3007
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:03,599
so he started opening up and saying more

3008
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:05,698
more of the stories

3009
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:08,719
and he ended up saying that like things

3010
02:02:05,698 --> 02:02:10,919
like what I call what I call uh dirt

3011
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:13,800
which is

3012
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:15,658
um which is an old Afghani

3013
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:19,320
he's like yeah you know well that came

3014
02:02:15,658 --> 02:02:22,618
from that came from so and so uh

3015
02:02:19,319 --> 02:02:24,479
the computer guy and we're like oh yeah

3016
02:02:22,618 --> 02:02:26,098
yeah yeah you know like back in the day

3017
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:27,718
they had told us oh he was the guy who

3018
02:02:26,099 --> 02:02:29,460
brought the stuff back and we knew that

3019
02:02:27,719 --> 02:02:32,219
and and that had been told to us in the

3020
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:34,020
mid 90s he goes yeah but you know what

3021
02:02:32,219 --> 02:02:36,960
you guys didn't know because it's kind

3022
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:39,360
of crazy was that he also was one of the

3023
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:42,000
guys who was letting them out in the

3024
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:43,439
back of the valley make a lot of acid

3025
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,658
back there

3026
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:48,539
my buddy was like oh really and he goes

3027
02:02:45,658 --> 02:02:50,939
yeah you know the the guys who did who

3028
02:02:48,539 --> 02:02:52,979
did the sunshine acid they they used to

3029
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:55,559
make a lot of that Sunshine acid was

3030
02:02:52,979 --> 02:02:58,678
done out there in the back of the valley

3031
02:02:55,560 --> 02:03:02,520
like oh well that's interesting

3032
02:02:58,679 --> 02:03:05,099
you know he's telling him and he goes uh

3033
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:08,219
he goes yeah you know they they right

3034
02:03:05,099 --> 02:03:10,619
then around that time 84 or 83 or

3035
02:03:08,219 --> 02:03:13,920
whatever you know whatever it was

3036
02:03:10,618 --> 02:03:15,359
those seeds showed up and they told kind

3037
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:17,399
of the ladies around here who were

3038
02:03:15,359 --> 02:03:21,059
growing their like little yard patches

3039
02:03:17,399 --> 02:03:22,679
and stuff like hey grow this and and

3040
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:24,480
we'll give you twice what you're getting

3041
02:03:22,679 --> 02:03:26,158
now for your other [ __ ] and you'll have

3042
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:27,178
a lot more weed and it finishes really

3043
02:03:26,158 --> 02:03:29,339
quick

3044
02:03:27,179 --> 02:03:31,380
and that was kind of the introduction of

3045
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:32,639
like The Afghani like what we call dirt

3046
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:34,560
you know

3047
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:37,980
and uh

3048
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:39,780
so interestingly enough as much as I

3049
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:41,879
don't want to be the guy who jumps on me

3050
02:03:39,779 --> 02:03:44,099
like oh well the stuff I have it it came

3051
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:46,199
from mold too like it's like it just

3052
02:03:44,099 --> 02:03:47,819
turned out that really they did have a

3053
02:03:46,198 --> 02:03:49,500
hand they kind of had their hand in a

3054
02:03:47,819 --> 02:03:51,840
lot of Pies because it turned out that

3055
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:55,139
the computer guy had actually got his

3056
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:56,639
seed from Bull and

3057
02:03:55,139 --> 02:03:58,560
um

3058
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:00,840
and that they had been they had been

3059
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:04,139
batching up sunshine back his place in

3060
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:06,420
the in the mid 80s uh or the early 80s

3061
02:04:04,139 --> 02:04:08,819
or whenever I don't know that the that

3062
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:13,679
the the acid and the I don't know the

3063
02:04:08,819 --> 02:04:15,960
time frame but that in the same area

3064
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:18,300
um was these things going on you know

3065
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:20,939
which was really interesting and then he

3066
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:23,340
said yeah then we took we took these big

3067
02:04:20,939 --> 02:04:27,479
things of seed and we put them inside

3068
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:30,360
the tire of our car and we and we we

3069
02:04:27,479 --> 02:04:33,539
filled up the tires and we we actually

3070
02:04:30,359 --> 02:04:36,420
drove me and your dad me and my buddy's

3071
02:04:33,539 --> 02:04:38,399
Dad we drove to Mexico and we took these

3072
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:40,380
seeds down there and that was the year

3073
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:42,000
that Mexican weed the price doubled on

3074
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:43,859
Mexican weed too because all of a sudden

3075
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:47,099
it was this chunky beautiful weed

3076
02:04:43,859 --> 02:04:49,679
instead of reinstreaming and uh that was

3077
02:04:47,099 --> 02:04:52,020
really interesting to me just to hear

3078
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:53,579
you know these kind of trippy stories

3079
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:55,500
and if you talk to people in Humboldt

3080
02:04:53,579 --> 02:04:59,219
they have the same kind of stories where

3081
02:04:55,500 --> 02:05:03,060
you know whatever 78 they these guys got

3082
02:04:59,219 --> 02:05:05,039
it and then 82 these guys got it and you

3083
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:07,020
know as a younger person I would have

3084
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:08,880
thought oh that's a big span of time but

3085
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:10,560
now I know like the course of six or

3086
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:13,679
eight years or whatever it's [ __ ]

3087
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:14,820
nothing you know it's really a trip so

3088
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:17,039
uh

3089
02:05:14,819 --> 02:05:19,439
I can't downplay what they did because

3090
02:05:17,039 --> 02:05:22,859
it turns out that even stuff that I I

3091
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:25,979
use came came from them you know and uh

3092
02:05:22,859 --> 02:05:27,839
I don't really think that that adds any

3093
02:05:25,979 --> 02:05:28,678
value I think the plants have their own

3094
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,219
value

3095
02:05:28,679 --> 02:05:33,300
of whatever their value is you know

3096
02:05:32,219 --> 02:05:34,920
um

3097
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:38,099
but uh

3098
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:40,199
I do think that um

3099
02:05:38,099 --> 02:05:43,260
you know I think there's certain

3100
02:05:40,198 --> 02:05:45,779
it was a very very very small world and

3101
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:47,579
to this day it's still a very small

3102
02:05:45,779 --> 02:05:49,679
world as soon as you get before the

3103
02:05:47,579 --> 02:05:51,779
internet I was talking to somebody today

3104
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:54,480
and he goes man I have the Sauer cut in

3105
02:05:51,779 --> 02:05:56,639
2003 I got it out branscom I never got

3106
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:57,959
another one like it

3107
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:59,579
um and I was like oh it's probably the

3108
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:01,800
same one we had because I think I got

3109
02:05:59,579 --> 02:06:03,539
mine like 2004 or something and it's a

3110
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,520
small area and there's not a lot of

3111
02:06:03,539 --> 02:06:06,960
people and stuff and he goes oh do you

3112
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:08,580
know so-and-so and I'm like yeah I grew

3113
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:11,460
up with his little brother you know and

3114
02:06:08,579 --> 02:06:13,260
and he has some killer you know sfv

3115
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:15,599
diesel seeds now and

3116
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:18,239
he's like oh yeah that's what he was

3117
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:20,159
talking about last time I saw him and

3118
02:06:18,238 --> 02:06:21,718
his brother must have continued it or

3119
02:06:20,158 --> 02:06:23,819
whatever and I'm like yeah you know like

3120
02:06:21,719 --> 02:06:26,039
it's somebody drops a name and you're

3121
02:06:23,819 --> 02:06:28,500
like yeah they I used to

3122
02:06:26,039 --> 02:06:30,300
I I pulled my groin muscles sledding

3123
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:33,238
down his Hill when I hit a [ __ ] stump

3124
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:36,719
under the snow you know like in 1988

3125
02:06:33,238 --> 02:06:37,559
1989 you know like that's my boy you

3126
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:41,039
know

3127
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:42,960
so it's it's it's trippy like the uh

3128
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:44,698
things really are a small world so

3129
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:46,920
somebody like Brotherhood of eternal

3130
02:06:44,698 --> 02:06:48,419
love who brought in a lot of stuff

3131
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:50,399
you know how many people were

3132
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:52,319
circulating it back then it was it was

3133
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:54,479
like almost like

3134
02:06:52,319 --> 02:06:56,279
um it was almost like you you might be

3135
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:58,738
ruining your life anytime you hand

3136
02:06:56,279 --> 02:07:01,259
somebody some seeds or or a bag of weed

3137
02:06:58,738 --> 02:07:02,819
back then that might be it for you you

3138
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:05,039
might be doing 12 years you might be

3139
02:07:02,819 --> 02:07:07,079
doing seven years you know like you

3140
02:07:05,039 --> 02:07:09,599
didn't [ __ ] know back then it was it

3141
02:07:07,079 --> 02:07:12,779
was sketchy as [ __ ] so the people who

3142
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:15,060
were like that they were

3143
02:07:12,779 --> 02:07:17,759
um they were pushing the boundaries they

3144
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:19,440
weren't normal [ __ ] guys now you can

3145
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:21,780
be a normal guy and have all kinds of

3146
02:07:19,439 --> 02:07:23,579
different stuff and you know whatever it

3147
02:07:21,779 --> 02:07:27,059
is what it is and sure there's a risk

3148
02:07:23,579 --> 02:07:29,340
factor there but you figure you could

3149
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:31,080
probably work it out back then it was

3150
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:34,139
like no if you were in the 80s or the

3151
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:36,118
90s it was like you

3152
02:07:34,139 --> 02:07:37,500
you know that'd be like right now if

3153
02:07:36,118 --> 02:07:39,779
you're gonna oh I'm just gonna smuggle

3154
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:41,579
to Japan that's like how it was just to

3155
02:07:39,779 --> 02:07:44,158
[ __ ] tell people in California you

3156
02:07:41,579 --> 02:07:47,639
had weed you know

3157
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:49,559
yeah wow different time different time

3158
02:07:47,639 --> 02:07:53,159
indeed and all of that really

3159
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:55,260
interesting stuff something that I kind

3160
02:07:53,158 --> 02:07:57,359
of wonder about a bit is often you hear

3161
02:07:55,260 --> 02:08:00,060
about people reminiscing about strains

3162
02:07:57,359 --> 02:08:02,460
that used to exist and maybe they don't

3163
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:05,039
exist anymore maybe they exist just in

3164
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:07,800
sort of like an S1 of the original sort

3165
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:09,599
of thing and this all comes to the

3166
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:11,940
foreground because you mentioned sour

3167
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:15,179
there for the longest time I've had the

3168
02:08:11,939 --> 02:08:17,460
suspicion that the fabled sour you hear

3169
02:08:15,179 --> 02:08:19,980
people talk so fondly about particularly

3170
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:23,099
the East Coast guys who you know really

3171
02:08:19,979 --> 02:08:26,279
just got swept up in the sour sort of

3172
02:08:23,099 --> 02:08:29,039
fandom do you feel like the sour that

3173
02:08:26,279 --> 02:08:30,539
they talk about is that one still around

3174
02:08:29,039 --> 02:08:33,658
or do you think they're just working

3175
02:08:30,539 --> 02:08:36,960
with their swans or it's just a case

3176
02:08:33,658 --> 02:08:38,759
that you know back in the day it was the

3177
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:40,560
best there was and now there's better

3178
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:42,000
but they still think like looking back

3179
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:43,679
that what they had was better like

3180
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,139
because you hear this sort of idea

3181
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:48,000
Expressway with a lot of strains do you

3182
02:08:46,139 --> 02:08:49,920
think people lose the originals or it's

3183
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,939
just like rose shaded glasses looking

3184
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:54,359
back

3185
02:08:50,939 --> 02:08:56,399
no I think people have the originals but

3186
02:08:54,359 --> 02:08:59,158
so many people don't and think they're

3187
02:08:56,399 --> 02:09:01,079
The Originals that it's hard to make

3188
02:08:59,158 --> 02:09:04,559
sense of what's what

3189
02:09:01,079 --> 02:09:07,439
like I think that pip from souvenir

3190
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:10,139
seeds because I've seen crosses that he

3191
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:10,979
made with his sour

3192
02:09:10,139 --> 02:09:14,579
um

3193
02:09:10,979 --> 02:09:16,979
I think he has the real Sour

3194
02:09:14,579 --> 02:09:22,019
um there's a certain thing about it you

3195
02:09:16,979 --> 02:09:25,559
smell it it's skunky it's gassy it's got

3196
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:27,840
a thing to it that's like that that's it

3197
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:30,119
you know like you just know that's it

3198
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:32,099
it's

3199
02:09:30,118 --> 02:09:34,098
um it's so much like the super skunk

3200
02:09:32,099 --> 02:09:38,340
that

3201
02:09:34,099 --> 02:09:41,639
you just kind of know like uh

3202
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:43,800
that's [ __ ] sour and then you see a

3203
02:09:41,639 --> 02:09:46,199
lot of people sour and you go yeah you

3204
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:48,719
know that just doesn't have it and then

3205
02:09:46,198 --> 02:09:50,098
there's even ones that are not like I

3206
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:51,960
haven't seen his salary I've just seen

3207
02:09:50,099 --> 02:09:53,639
what came from it but I can still tell

3208
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:55,980
it came from the real [ __ ] sour

3209
02:09:53,639 --> 02:09:58,319
because it's just too it's so much more

3210
02:09:55,979 --> 02:10:00,479
sour than everything people think is

3211
02:09:58,319 --> 02:10:03,299
really sour and it's a cross you know

3212
02:10:00,479 --> 02:10:06,238
you're like all right well this guy has

3213
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:08,719
you know even if it wasn't even if it

3214
02:10:06,238 --> 02:10:10,459
wasn't the exact plant

3215
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:13,920
the

3216
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:15,719
phenotype of it it's like that's it you

3217
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:17,940
know what I mean like it's it's got to

3218
02:10:15,719 --> 02:10:20,219
be it it's like if uh

3219
02:10:17,939 --> 02:10:22,198
I don't know it just

3220
02:10:20,219 --> 02:10:26,279
it's just it it's just the weed you know

3221
02:10:22,198 --> 02:10:28,439
it's it's it's skunky ass weed and it

3222
02:10:26,279 --> 02:10:31,019
um and that's really what it should be

3223
02:10:28,439 --> 02:10:34,319
like like the real real sour stuff that

3224
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:36,780
I originally had it was skunky and

3225
02:10:34,319 --> 02:10:39,118
metallic and earthy and it smelled like

3226
02:10:36,779 --> 02:10:43,319
coffee and it smelled like super skunk

3227
02:10:39,118 --> 02:10:46,019
and it has like this cushiness to it

3228
02:10:43,319 --> 02:10:50,219
that's not OG but the same thing you

3229
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:54,000
like about OG it has some of that and it

3230
02:10:50,219 --> 02:10:57,420
drops resin and

3231
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,219
um it gets you high immediately and you

3232
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:02,579
feel it in your head

3233
02:10:59,219 --> 02:11:03,599
and it tastes a certain way and

3234
02:11:02,579 --> 02:11:05,158
um

3235
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:07,079
they're just certain there's certain

3236
02:11:05,158 --> 02:11:09,839
things that sour is you know and then

3237
02:11:07,079 --> 02:11:12,179
there's certain things that not sour

3238
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:16,079
where you're just like you that's just

3239
02:11:12,179 --> 02:11:17,699
not sour you know and um I think it's a

3240
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:19,380
type of weed

3241
02:11:17,698 --> 02:11:22,500
and

3242
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:24,719
in my opinion if you can find the exact

3243
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:26,880
same type of weed I really don't give a

3244
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:29,639
[ __ ] if it's the same plant or not if

3245
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:32,340
it's the same type of weed what do we

3246
02:11:29,639 --> 02:11:35,279
care you know what I mean like not to

3247
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:37,440
say that um not to downplay provenance

3248
02:11:35,279 --> 02:11:38,340
and all that like I I care about it

3249
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:41,879
myself

3250
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:44,099
but like the reality of all of it is is

3251
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:46,560
like what's in your bag the reason why I

3252
02:11:44,099 --> 02:11:50,099
want these particular plants is because

3253
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:51,659
they really are that kind of weed and if

3254
02:11:50,099 --> 02:11:53,460
you get a plant and someone says it's

3255
02:11:51,658 --> 02:11:56,098
sour and you grow it and you don't wind

3256
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:58,260
up with that weed that you expected and

3257
02:11:56,099 --> 02:12:00,719
you know what that really is it's

3258
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:04,800
different then it's different but even

3259
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:07,198
if the Clone was different than what

3260
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:10,079
it was supposed to be and it's actually

3261
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:12,779
a one-off or an S1 or a cross or

3262
02:12:10,079 --> 02:12:14,579
whatever for the sake of having the weed

3263
02:12:12,779 --> 02:12:16,019
it's the same [ __ ] weed you got it

3264
02:12:14,579 --> 02:12:17,939
right there the only thing that's

3265
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:20,580
different that's the same that's that's

3266
02:12:17,939 --> 02:12:22,799
you know phenotype and that's

3267
02:12:20,579 --> 02:12:24,899
you know bulk phenotype or gross

3268
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:27,659
phenotype where it's like they that that

3269
02:12:24,899 --> 02:12:29,460
all that it's all the one thing even if

3270
02:12:27,658 --> 02:12:30,719
it's a different plant

3271
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:33,899
and then

3272
02:12:30,719 --> 02:12:37,260
you know genotype Wise It's like well if

3273
02:12:33,899 --> 02:12:39,658
it breeds different then it's different

3274
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:42,060
um so it's a different genotype but it's

3275
02:12:39,658 --> 02:12:43,019
the same phenotype

3276
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,820
um

3277
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:46,860
that's like a weird that's where you

3278
02:12:44,819 --> 02:12:49,439
start to get into that funny genotype

3279
02:12:46,859 --> 02:12:50,819
phenotype confusion where people don't

3280
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:52,379
know what's what

3281
02:12:50,819 --> 02:12:55,019
it's like well you can have the same

3282
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:58,260
phenotype and go it's sour this is sour

3283
02:12:55,020 --> 02:13:00,659
that's sour now if you S1 both of those

3284
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:03,179
plants that are both exactly like sour

3285
02:13:00,658 --> 02:13:05,460
and one throws a bunch of [ __ ] that's

3286
02:13:03,179 --> 02:13:07,260
not sour and the other throws all sour

3287
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:09,000
that's where you have your different

3288
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:11,760
genotype you know that's where it

3289
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:13,560
actually counts in the conversation as

3290
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:16,320
far as people like cloning something and

3291
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:18,179
being like Oh don't call it a phenotype

3292
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:20,578
call it a genotype it's like well every

3293
02:13:18,179 --> 02:13:21,960
plant is a genotype and a phenotype but

3294
02:13:20,578 --> 02:13:24,059
what are we talking about here because

3295
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:25,618
you might not be even talking about

3296
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:27,300
something where you need to even use

3297
02:13:25,618 --> 02:13:31,019
those words just call it a [ __ ] plant

3298
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:33,000
or a type or a throw or you know what I

3299
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:35,400
mean but that's that's where it really

3300
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,920
comes down to it for me is like

3301
02:13:35,399 --> 02:13:40,019
if I want to smoke it I only need the

3302
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:43,980
phenotype but if I'm going to breed it

3303
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:46,020
and say it's the original and I'm and

3304
02:13:43,979 --> 02:13:47,578
and and that's what's going to get

3305
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:50,340
preserved and that's what's going to get

3306
02:13:47,578 --> 02:13:51,899
spread and you know the provenance and

3307
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:54,420
all that that's when you need that

3308
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:57,779
genotype it needs to be what's inside of

3309
02:13:54,420 --> 02:14:01,078
it that it actually possesses for its

3310
02:13:57,779 --> 02:14:03,238
progeny that's when genotype counts you

3311
02:14:01,078 --> 02:14:06,299
know and uh

3312
02:14:03,238 --> 02:14:08,158
so you know like I said it is it is it

3313
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:10,020
really do people really have it I don't

3314
02:14:08,158 --> 02:14:12,598
know but if people have it and it really

3315
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:14,880
breeds that way where things come out of

3316
02:14:12,599 --> 02:14:17,219
it that are the real deal like that's

3317
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:17,840
all you really need

3318
02:14:17,219 --> 02:14:20,819
um

3319
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:22,500
but you know I mean the coolest thing is

3320
02:14:20,819 --> 02:14:24,420
if you know like somebody's like yeah I

3321
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:26,939
popped the seed and this is the real one

3322
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:29,639
it's always been in my hands and you

3323
02:14:26,939 --> 02:14:32,519
know but um other than that there's

3324
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:34,859
really no way to verify a cut without

3325
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:36,840
having it without being able to go I

3326
02:14:34,859 --> 02:14:39,359
gave it to someone so they never got

3327
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:41,578
another thing similar to it they gave it

3328
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:43,920
to so and so that person never got

3329
02:14:41,578 --> 02:14:45,539
another thing similar to it they gave it

3330
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:47,880
to this guy he never had something

3331
02:14:45,539 --> 02:14:50,760
similar to it then you can get it back

3332
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:52,800
and know it's that but if you gave a

3333
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:54,840
sour if you popped the sour from seed

3334
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:57,179
and you gave it to this guy and he's

3335
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:59,099
like yeah I had it and then I bred it

3336
02:14:57,179 --> 02:15:01,500
and I kept this one and it was like sour

3337
02:14:59,099 --> 02:15:03,719
but it was even bigger so I kept that

3338
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:05,639
one but I kept the original but then at

3339
02:15:03,719 --> 02:15:07,560
one point I think I mixed them up like

3340
02:15:05,639 --> 02:15:10,440
you've already lost it you've lost your

3341
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:12,360
provenance and you don't really know you

3342
02:15:10,439 --> 02:15:15,118
don't really know [ __ ] because you could

3343
02:15:12,359 --> 02:15:17,039
have a plant that the phenotype's

3344
02:15:15,118 --> 02:15:19,738
exactly the same

3345
02:15:17,039 --> 02:15:21,420
but it ain't actually the same genotype

3346
02:15:19,738 --> 02:15:23,339
because a different [ __ ] plant you

3347
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:24,179
know so

3348
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:26,460
um

3349
02:15:24,179 --> 02:15:28,679
yeah I don't know it's all it's all it's

3350
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:30,179
all interesting interesting thing the

3351
02:15:28,679 --> 02:15:33,840
whole sour thing because there's so many

3352
02:15:30,179 --> 02:15:36,179
sour cuts and then was the one I got in

3353
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,980
the early 2000s was it ever the real one

3354
02:15:36,179 --> 02:15:39,840
I don't know but it's what I consider

3355
02:15:37,979 --> 02:15:42,059
the real one and when I see people with

3356
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:44,219
something that's like that or that has

3357
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:46,320
tons of that super skunk smell that I

3358
02:15:44,219 --> 02:15:48,118
knew from the super skunk that my buddy

3359
02:15:46,319 --> 02:15:49,738
got from his buddies back

3360
02:15:48,118 --> 02:15:51,779
because he had it before and then he got

3361
02:15:49,738 --> 02:15:54,118
it back from his buddies in Arcada

3362
02:15:51,779 --> 02:15:56,460
in the late 90s that's the super skunk I

3363
02:15:54,118 --> 02:15:58,559
know to be skunky and I don't even know

3364
02:15:56,460 --> 02:16:00,239
is that the super skunk that that

3365
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:03,599
everyone else is talking about when they

3366
02:16:00,238 --> 02:16:05,459
talk about the the mass or the the six

3367
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:07,078
or I don't [ __ ] know I just know

3368
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:09,239
that's the one that I know and when I

3369
02:16:07,078 --> 02:16:10,920
smell really good diesel if it smells

3370
02:16:09,238 --> 02:16:12,598
like that then I think of it as being

3371
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:14,940
real diesel you know and that's what the

3372
02:16:12,599 --> 02:16:17,279
LA Kush Headband that's what the real

3373
02:16:14,939 --> 02:16:19,859
Sour they have that smell from that

3374
02:16:17,279 --> 02:16:21,599
super skunk and the difference between

3375
02:16:19,859 --> 02:16:24,059
them and super skunk is super skunk

3376
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:27,060
tasted great smelled great it wasn't

3377
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:29,880
really that gnarly a weed but it was

3378
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:32,579
really tasty and enjoyable the real good

3379
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:34,799
headband and sour were like

3380
02:16:32,579 --> 02:16:36,840
the sour would get you really high and

3381
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:38,759
it was clear the headband would just

3382
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:40,558
[ __ ] you up like you could get really

3383
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:41,939
high off of that weed

3384
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:45,718
um if you didn't have a real strong

3385
02:16:41,939 --> 02:16:47,460
tolerance to those kinds of weed and um

3386
02:16:45,718 --> 02:16:50,419
you know those are those are the cool

3387
02:16:47,459 --> 02:16:50,419
ones to me

3388
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:54,540
oh yeah

3389
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:55,800
that's interesting you you bring all

3390
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:58,559
that up because I mean a lot of it

3391
02:16:55,799 --> 02:17:01,259
obviously really valid points and on the

3392
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:03,239
topic of like strains that people may or

3393
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:06,659
may not have and you reference the skunk

3394
02:17:03,239 --> 02:17:09,119
in there I noticed on a recent CSI

3395
02:17:06,659 --> 02:17:11,638
Humboldt Post of all things seeing as

3396
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:14,219
we've already referenced old inspector

3397
02:17:11,638 --> 02:17:15,959
um that there was a post about roadkill

3398
02:17:14,218 --> 02:17:17,699
skunk and I noticed a comment you left

3399
02:17:15,959 --> 02:17:20,339
there saying that the skunkiest thing

3400
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:22,679
you had smelt in a while was a strain

3401
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:24,478
Called Death coast and I actually hadn't

3402
02:17:22,679 --> 02:17:26,099
come across that one at all can you tell

3403
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:29,218
me a little bit about that one so that's

3404
02:17:26,099 --> 02:17:34,079
one that comes from those seeds that um

3405
02:17:29,218 --> 02:17:36,839
that uh souvenir seeds made and

3406
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:38,939
um you know I grew it I have my what I

3407
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:40,978
call grape lime skunk which I'm not

3408
02:17:38,939 --> 02:17:43,079
gonna say is roadkill skunk but that's

3409
02:17:40,978 --> 02:17:43,799
the one that like

3410
02:17:43,079 --> 02:17:46,439
um

3411
02:17:43,799 --> 02:17:48,840
you know like I don't not to like just

3412
02:17:46,439 --> 02:17:52,859
put it out there just like as a as a

3413
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:55,319
name drop but like skunk VA had the

3414
02:17:52,859 --> 02:17:58,859
skunk back in the day for a long time

3415
02:17:55,319 --> 02:18:02,099
grew it knew what it was and he said

3416
02:17:58,859 --> 02:18:04,439
that the grape lime skunk had that smell

3417
02:18:02,099 --> 02:18:06,179
in it with other smells of course which

3418
02:18:04,439 --> 02:18:08,159
is what I think too

3419
02:18:06,179 --> 02:18:10,920
but that it was the closest he'd smell

3420
02:18:08,159 --> 02:18:11,898
since he had smelled that stuff in the

3421
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:13,500
90s

3422
02:18:11,898 --> 02:18:15,840
and

3423
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:20,459
um so I had that

3424
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:22,500
I had a cut that is supposed to be Death

3425
02:18:20,459 --> 02:18:26,098
Star whether it is or not I don't know

3426
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:31,200
but it's very very skunky

3427
02:18:26,099 --> 02:18:33,960
um I had Sour Diesel cut I had some Sour

3428
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:35,820
Diesel back cross twos that I got from

3429
02:18:33,959 --> 02:18:38,339
skunk Tech that were popped from Karma

3430
02:18:35,819 --> 02:18:40,439
seeds I had

3431
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:43,739
um some other stuff you know some pretty

3432
02:18:40,439 --> 02:18:46,679
funky stuff and breaking down taking the

3433
02:18:43,739 --> 02:18:48,659
seeds out of the death Coast was like

3434
02:18:46,679 --> 02:18:50,579
burnt garlic

3435
02:18:48,659 --> 02:18:54,299
burnt rubber

3436
02:18:50,579 --> 02:18:58,019
coffee onion skunk

3437
02:18:54,299 --> 02:18:59,938
just funky super skunk

3438
02:18:58,019 --> 02:19:01,800
as much as I can remember it just

3439
02:18:59,939 --> 02:19:04,200
smelled like super skunk to me like what

3440
02:19:01,799 --> 02:19:06,420
I call what like what I called pissy

3441
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:08,099
pungent back in the day

3442
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:11,219
um but a little different but like

3443
02:19:08,099 --> 02:19:12,898
really really what I know to be what I

3444
02:19:11,218 --> 02:19:16,199
ever smelled that was what I ever

3445
02:19:12,898 --> 02:19:19,199
thought was the skunkiest weed you know

3446
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:21,380
um and so that I believe was a death

3447
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:25,320
star crossed Sour Diesel

3448
02:19:21,379 --> 02:19:29,098
or it might have been a Scentsy Star

3449
02:19:25,319 --> 02:19:31,500
Cross Sour Diesel the remake of the

3450
02:19:29,099 --> 02:19:34,019
Death Star Cross but it's one of those

3451
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:36,659
and um

3452
02:19:34,019 --> 02:19:40,380
it was nasty and then I got some weed

3453
02:19:36,659 --> 02:19:43,859
from from the same guy and it was what

3454
02:19:40,379 --> 02:19:46,799
he calls Rubber City and the Rubber City

3455
02:19:43,859 --> 02:19:49,680
I believe is the Death Star across with

3456
02:19:46,799 --> 02:19:52,799
the sour I think the death Coast is the

3457
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:55,139
sourcross Scentsy star so the Rubber

3458
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:58,139
City I think is three-quarter sour and

3459
02:19:55,139 --> 02:20:00,000
the and the death Coast is half but I'm

3460
02:19:58,139 --> 02:20:02,340
not sure about that but that's that's

3461
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,939
how I remember it I don't know

3462
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:08,398
it might be the opposite but um it's

3463
02:20:05,939 --> 02:20:10,859
it's uh

3464
02:20:08,398 --> 02:20:13,199
it's just it's it's skunky like it's

3465
02:20:10,859 --> 02:20:16,079
just the skunkiest [ __ ] like if you want

3466
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:17,159
skunky stuff and I I haven't

3467
02:20:16,079 --> 02:20:19,020
um

3468
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:23,520
I don't know I haven't seen other stuff

3469
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:23,520
that I that I would say really

3470
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:29,399
smells like skunk and I haven't grown

3471
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,840
everybody's so-called skunk but when I

3472
02:20:29,398 --> 02:20:32,939
ask people when they're growing it out

3473
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:35,760
kind of everybody's like oh so-and-so

3474
02:20:32,939 --> 02:20:38,700
said it's skunky it's not skunky and I'm

3475
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:41,040
like okay well there there you go they

3476
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:44,280
said it's not skunky like you seem

3477
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:46,560
you know CSI on that he's like I don't

3478
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:48,899
know if there's a way to make him stunky

3479
02:20:46,559 --> 02:20:50,639
but they ain't skunky so I don't you

3480
02:20:48,898 --> 02:20:51,659
know I don't really know

3481
02:20:50,639 --> 02:20:53,398
um

3482
02:20:51,659 --> 02:20:56,039
you know I don't know what to make of

3483
02:20:53,398 --> 02:20:57,959
all that but uh but that that stuff is

3484
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:59,580
that's bomb like I would recommend if

3485
02:20:57,959 --> 02:21:01,739
people want something skunky get those

3486
02:20:59,579 --> 02:21:04,139
and then I think people have this weird

3487
02:21:01,739 --> 02:21:07,799
thing of

3488
02:21:04,139 --> 02:21:09,840
of wanting like something to appear

3489
02:21:07,799 --> 02:21:14,099
that's going to be

3490
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:15,600
like literally smell like a dead skunk

3491
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:17,340
and I just someone I don't know I've

3492
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:19,079
seen thousands and thousands of plants

3493
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:20,520
and for back in the day when skunk was

3494
02:21:19,079 --> 02:21:22,859
really common and we didn't even really

3495
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:25,800
think much of it and I didn't ever

3496
02:21:22,859 --> 02:21:27,960
really smell anything that was more like

3497
02:21:25,799 --> 02:21:30,719
a dead skunk than like super skunk or

3498
02:21:27,959 --> 02:21:32,699
death Coast or you know like this grape

3499
02:21:30,719 --> 02:21:36,420
lime skunk thing that I have which I

3500
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:40,079
would say is is way not as skunky as

3501
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:42,120
death Coast but which is it has another

3502
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:45,420
little Dimension to it which is kind of

3503
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:47,420
this wet dog

3504
02:21:45,420 --> 02:21:47,420
um

3505
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:52,500
coffee thing that I get from when I

3506
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:55,500
smell a real

3507
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:58,559
skunk spray like I I had a house where

3508
02:21:55,500 --> 02:22:00,959
there was a there was a place where like

3509
02:21:58,559 --> 02:22:02,398
some some wiring got off of one of the

3510
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:04,739
holes and I had a skunk go under my

3511
02:22:02,398 --> 02:22:06,719
house and spray my house twice it's like

3512
02:22:04,739 --> 02:22:09,059
I'm very familiar with a [ __ ] skunk

3513
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:10,438
you know what I mean I've I've been in a

3514
02:22:09,059 --> 02:22:13,079
car

3515
02:22:10,439 --> 02:22:15,659
that went over a skunk that was an old

3516
02:22:13,079 --> 02:22:17,818
car that was pretty rickety and it

3517
02:22:15,659 --> 02:22:20,159
sprayed us directly under the car and

3518
02:22:17,818 --> 02:22:23,398
like your eyes burn and there's certain

3519
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:25,859
smells and like those particular smells

3520
02:22:23,398 --> 02:22:28,019
there's these certain aspects

3521
02:22:25,859 --> 02:22:30,960
um and mine I wouldn't say is the

3522
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:33,420
intense like dead skunk like that but it

3523
02:22:30,959 --> 02:22:35,519
it has some it has those things that I

3524
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:36,318
think make up

3525
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,939
um

3526
02:22:36,318 --> 02:22:40,978
that smell but I'm still I'm still not

3527
02:22:38,939 --> 02:22:42,180
like this is the [ __ ] roadkill skunk

3528
02:22:40,978 --> 02:22:43,858
I don't even know what that is I never

3529
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:46,500
saw anything called roadkill skunk in

3530
02:22:43,859 --> 02:22:48,659
the 90s I saw a lot of [ __ ] weed but

3531
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:51,359
I didn't see everything

3532
02:22:48,659 --> 02:22:52,859
um but I you know I I question a little

3533
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:57,600
bit this whole

3534
02:22:52,859 --> 02:23:00,960
uh I questioned the whole

3535
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:03,059
you know hunt for it a little bit and

3536
02:23:00,959 --> 02:23:05,639
think that um

3537
02:23:03,059 --> 02:23:09,199
weed smells a lot skunkier to you when

3538
02:23:05,639 --> 02:23:09,199
you don't have very much weed you know

3539
02:23:09,299 --> 02:23:13,679
yeah definitely definitely I mean

3540
02:23:11,818 --> 02:23:15,719
there's a lot of a lot of different

3541
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:17,939
angles we could work that one from but

3542
02:23:15,719 --> 02:23:20,959
I'm glad you brought it up that the uh

3543
02:23:17,939 --> 02:23:23,040
the grape lime skunk of yours I remember

3544
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:25,079
still to this day you know being at

3545
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:27,240
Emerald cup and you gave me that bud to

3546
02:23:25,079 --> 02:23:29,398
smell and I took it over to skunk VA and

3547
02:23:27,239 --> 02:23:31,439
we both immediately agreed that was the

3548
02:23:29,398 --> 02:23:34,079
most insane skunk Turks we'd ever smelt

3549
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:36,239
in a long time do you have any plans to

3550
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:39,120
try to lock that one down in seed form

3551
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:41,459
at all I mean whether it be just you

3552
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:43,859
know to do the f1s which was what I kind

3553
02:23:41,459 --> 02:23:45,719
of smelt or to Line work it to back

3554
02:23:43,859 --> 02:23:48,239
cross it anything sort of like that up

3555
02:23:45,719 --> 02:23:49,978
your sleeve also I had that one and it

3556
02:23:48,239 --> 02:23:52,318
was funny because I only had one plan of

3557
02:23:49,978 --> 02:23:54,119
it and it was this gorgeous plant so I

3558
02:23:52,318 --> 02:23:57,659
ran through a bunch more

3559
02:23:54,120 --> 02:24:00,420
and uh I found some nice ones so I let

3560
02:23:57,659 --> 02:24:03,059
out a little bit of f2s of those from a

3561
02:24:00,420 --> 02:24:05,879
nice grape skunky one

3562
02:24:03,059 --> 02:24:08,340
um with a lot of the great Funk to it

3563
02:24:05,879 --> 02:24:11,059
and then from those same males that I

3564
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:11,059
pulled out of those

3565
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:15,239
um I put those back on the lime one and

3566
02:24:13,559 --> 02:24:17,279
I put out a little bit of that as lime

3567
02:24:15,239 --> 02:24:19,260
one bat cross because it was lime one

3568
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:21,899
cross grape soda skunk was what the

3569
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:24,359
grape lime skunk

3570
02:24:21,898 --> 02:24:29,398
um clone was that you smelled

3571
02:24:24,359 --> 02:24:31,979
so I took its brother and put that back

3572
02:24:29,398 --> 02:24:35,219
on two twin brothers actually

3573
02:24:31,978 --> 02:24:37,079
and put that back on the line one

3574
02:24:35,219 --> 02:24:39,239
um for line one back cross so that

3575
02:24:37,079 --> 02:24:41,760
wasn't so much shooting for the skunk

3576
02:24:39,239 --> 02:24:42,898
side as it was shooting for more of the

3577
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:43,559
lime

3578
02:24:42,898 --> 02:24:46,978
um

3579
02:24:43,559 --> 02:24:49,818
and then I did

3580
02:24:46,978 --> 02:24:52,318
uh I made f3s

3581
02:24:49,818 --> 02:24:54,299
with everything that I got that was real

3582
02:24:52,318 --> 02:24:57,978
stable out of those so I think there's

3583
02:24:54,299 --> 02:25:01,139
maybe eight of those

3584
02:24:57,978 --> 02:25:05,459
uh three different males done separately

3585
02:25:01,139 --> 02:25:07,858
in that breeding one of them that was

3586
02:25:05,459 --> 02:25:11,279
just very loud skunk plant the whole

3587
02:25:07,859 --> 02:25:12,780
plant just smelled really really skunky

3588
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:15,420
um two more that smelled a little bit

3589
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:17,600
more like the original grape lime skunk

3590
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:21,780
clone that you saw

3591
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:25,020
so I took that original grape lamb skunk

3592
02:25:21,780 --> 02:25:26,819
clone that you saw I crossed it

3593
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:29,399
with

3594
02:25:26,818 --> 02:25:30,719
three different males separately so

3595
02:25:29,398 --> 02:25:31,799
there's three different lines back

3596
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:35,159
crossed

3597
02:25:31,799 --> 02:25:38,539
I made f3s with three different males

3598
02:25:35,159 --> 02:25:38,539
separately so there's

3599
02:25:38,639 --> 02:25:43,920
um I guess maybe there's 10 lines of it

3600
02:25:41,579 --> 02:25:46,859
in F3 now

3601
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:49,680
eight of which are with my favorite male

3602
02:25:46,859 --> 02:25:52,318
two of which are with the

3603
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:55,979
the females that matched the other two

3604
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:57,239
males I kept most closely

3605
02:25:55,978 --> 02:25:59,340
um

3606
02:25:57,239 --> 02:26:02,280
and that's just an attempt to do that

3607
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:04,380
and I gave those actually to skunk VA

3608
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:07,640
because he said he'd pop them and I know

3609
02:26:04,379 --> 02:26:07,639
he knows skunk chirps

3610
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:12,920
um so

3611
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:16,500
you know we'll see if he finds anything

3612
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:18,898
and uh you know if he doesn't cool and

3613
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:21,299
if he does right on

3614
02:26:18,898 --> 02:26:24,898
and

3615
02:26:21,299 --> 02:26:27,719
um I had the f2s

3616
02:26:24,898 --> 02:26:29,279
I had a lot of them everything that

3617
02:26:27,719 --> 02:26:31,818
didn't smell where the whole plant

3618
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:35,460
didn't smell like a skunk

3619
02:26:31,818 --> 02:26:38,639
I gave them to one of my buddies and he

3620
02:26:35,459 --> 02:26:41,639
put them in like 200 gallon pots

3621
02:26:38,639 --> 02:26:43,439
and I think I gave him

3622
02:26:41,639 --> 02:26:46,639
30 of them

3623
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:46,639
maybe 25

3624
02:26:47,219 --> 02:26:50,938
and I went out and checked on them when

3625
02:26:49,139 --> 02:26:53,398
they were really chunky

3626
02:26:50,939 --> 02:26:55,260
and some of them had butt some colas

3627
02:26:53,398 --> 02:26:58,260
that were like damn near like loafs of

3628
02:26:55,260 --> 02:27:00,059
bread you know they were huge [ __ ]

3629
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:01,500
colas where you're like that's got to be

3630
02:27:00,059 --> 02:27:03,600
rotten but they weren't because it just

3631
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:05,159
has really the grape and the line both

3632
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:08,100
have great mold resistance because

3633
02:27:05,159 --> 02:27:08,760
they're based on Old gorilla strains you

3634
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:10,920
know

3635
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:12,960
and um

3636
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:16,260
out of those

3637
02:27:12,959 --> 02:27:18,059
25 that I thought wouldn't be skunky

3638
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:19,520
there were

3639
02:27:18,059 --> 02:27:22,799
probably

3640
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:25,140
five or seven

3641
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:28,259
that were like really skunky like whoo

3642
02:27:25,139 --> 02:27:30,719
[ __ ] that's skunky bud you know and um

3643
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:32,760
then out of the ones that I kept

3644
02:27:30,719 --> 02:27:35,879
that were the ones that I really liked

3645
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:38,700
the most which I think was 10 of them

3646
02:27:35,879 --> 02:27:42,239
out of mind was the same deal probably

3647
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:43,500
the same only the same ratio which means

3648
02:27:42,239 --> 02:27:45,420
that

3649
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:47,398
the whole plant smelling like a skunk

3650
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:48,840
doesn't necessarily determine whether or

3651
02:27:47,398 --> 02:27:50,398
not the flower is going to smell like a

3652
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:52,680
skunk that's kind of [ __ ] just keep

3653
02:27:50,398 --> 02:27:55,818
track of because some strains the stem

3654
02:27:52,680 --> 02:27:57,720
rub means a lot and some it means less

3655
02:27:55,818 --> 02:28:01,199
so

3656
02:27:57,719 --> 02:28:03,000
um that means that just because the

3657
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:06,540
males I kept are skunky doesn't mean

3658
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:09,620
they'll necessarily throw skunk but

3659
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:13,140
I back cross now

3660
02:28:09,620 --> 02:28:15,300
to the one you smelled and then I'll

3661
02:28:13,139 --> 02:28:17,279
plant that and out of those I'll find

3662
02:28:15,299 --> 02:28:19,340
something that's the closest to it and

3663
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:22,500
I'll back cross to it again

3664
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:25,859
and what I'd like to see is that the bat

3665
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:28,040
cross has more of that plant in it than

3666
02:28:25,859 --> 02:28:33,000
the f2s

3667
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:35,280
and if it doesn't then

3668
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:37,020
I'll try another bat cross but if it

3669
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:39,020
doesn't increase at that point then it's

3670
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:41,819
kind of an indication that that plant

3671
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:44,040
doesn't like to breed true

3672
02:28:41,818 --> 02:28:47,239
it could also mean that I'm just not

3673
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:47,240
picking the right males

3674
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:52,318
um but it's pretty you know like you

3675
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:53,880
want to see when you back cross to

3676
02:28:52,318 --> 02:28:56,939
something that the frequency of that

3677
02:28:53,879 --> 02:28:58,920
type goes out fast and if it doesn't

3678
02:28:56,939 --> 02:29:00,898
then it makes you

3679
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:04,260
know that you're probably better off

3680
02:29:00,898 --> 02:29:06,539
going f2f3 F4 rather than going back on

3681
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:09,180
a back cross

3682
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:11,520
um so you know that's my experimentation

3683
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:13,439
with it at this point people are growing

3684
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:16,620
out the back cross people are growing

3685
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:17,280
out the f3s

3686
02:29:16,620 --> 02:29:19,979
um

3687
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:22,500
and you know we'll see what works out of

3688
02:29:19,978 --> 02:29:24,599
it and the cool thing is I have the

3689
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:27,540
Clone you know so I have a plant that

3690
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:29,640
smells like that weed I just uh you know

3691
02:29:27,540 --> 02:29:31,979
I'd like to see it in seed form I'm not

3692
02:29:29,639 --> 02:29:34,019
going to take that not going to take

3693
02:29:31,978 --> 02:29:38,039
that and say oh yeah you only have to

3694
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:40,079
grow six six [ __ ] uh

3695
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:42,120
packs to get one that smells like this

3696
02:29:40,079 --> 02:29:43,859
and then put skunk on the label that's

3697
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:45,479
like doesn't make any sense I'll call I

3698
02:29:43,859 --> 02:29:47,818
can call it grape lime skunk you need a

3699
02:29:45,478 --> 02:29:48,719
grape lime and skunk but

3700
02:29:47,818 --> 02:29:50,639
um

3701
02:29:48,719 --> 02:29:52,799
you know if it can get to the point

3702
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:54,599
where it's skunky skunky that would be

3703
02:29:52,799 --> 02:29:55,978
that would be cool and then I took that

3704
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:58,380
too and I crossed it with a death star

3705
02:29:55,978 --> 02:30:01,500
because the Death Star was really skunky

3706
02:29:58,379 --> 02:30:02,938
almost as skunky as the death coast and

3707
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:05,520
uh

3708
02:30:02,939 --> 02:30:08,340
out of that there might be more skunk

3709
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:10,560
but for me I feel like that's cheating a

3710
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:12,359
little bit because it's using super

3711
02:30:10,559 --> 02:30:15,600
skunk from the diesel

3712
02:30:12,359 --> 02:30:17,818
and I what I want to do is bring skunk

3713
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:19,979
out of the old

3714
02:30:17,818 --> 02:30:22,379
um Afghani stuff that's in the grape and

3715
02:30:19,978 --> 02:30:24,840
the lime

3716
02:30:22,379 --> 02:30:27,659
um just it's more of a kind of like a

3717
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:30,000
challenge uh but in the meantime I don't

3718
02:30:27,659 --> 02:30:31,619
mind doing doing a cheat and just seeing

3719
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:33,239
if that will make it work too you know

3720
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:34,800
because they both if they both have it

3721
02:30:33,239 --> 02:30:36,420
coming from both sides you might get a

3722
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:38,938
lot more of it should get a quarter

3723
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:40,500
taken to two things that have it in

3724
02:30:38,939 --> 02:30:42,898
there

3725
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:44,579
um but that's not necessarily true

3726
02:30:42,898 --> 02:30:46,619
because it might not be frequent but all

3727
02:30:44,579 --> 02:30:49,859
in the gene prayer but we'll find out so

3728
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:51,540
that's the that's the uh

3729
02:30:49,859 --> 02:30:53,059
um that's where I went with that this

3730
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:56,399
time

3731
02:30:53,059 --> 02:30:57,898
sure and I mean a question which kind of

3732
02:30:56,398 --> 02:30:59,760
stems off what you were just talking

3733
02:30:57,898 --> 02:31:01,858
about but I'll make it a little more

3734
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:04,139
hypothetical so that hopefully it makes

3735
02:31:01,859 --> 02:31:06,120
it easier to answer let's just say

3736
02:31:04,139 --> 02:31:09,119
someone out there who's listening has

3737
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:11,460
managed to find themselves uh they've

3738
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:13,380
made a cross and they've final hunted

3739
02:31:11,459 --> 02:31:15,599
the seeds and they find one plant in

3740
02:31:13,379 --> 02:31:17,339
those seeds which is totally unlike the

3741
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:21,180
mother or the father you know like let's

3742
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:23,219
say mum's mango dad's OG it's blueberry

3743
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:25,139
you know like it's just really left of

3744
02:31:23,219 --> 02:31:27,059
field to both parents and you you're

3745
02:31:25,139 --> 02:31:28,858
really not sure what traits are coming

3746
02:31:27,059 --> 02:31:31,920
from what parent because it's just that

3747
02:31:28,859 --> 02:31:36,239
really unique sort of phenotype would

3748
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:37,799
would you try to Line work that or back

3749
02:31:36,239 --> 02:31:39,780
cross it like how would you go about

3750
02:31:37,799 --> 02:31:42,000
trying to lock in that super super

3751
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:43,620
unique phenotype would it be trial and

3752
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,079
error or do you think for those super

3753
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:48,420
like one in a thousand phinos it's

3754
02:31:46,079 --> 02:31:50,579
probably actually not very easy to get

3755
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:53,159
that into then a seed form

3756
02:31:50,579 --> 02:31:54,780
well some people won't like to hear that

3757
02:31:53,159 --> 02:31:56,459
the way that you really want to do

3758
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:58,620
things like that is you want to take

3759
02:31:56,459 --> 02:32:00,659
that blueberry plant

3760
02:31:58,620 --> 02:32:03,780
and self it

3761
02:32:00,659 --> 02:32:05,818
find the same exact plant again even if

3762
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:07,560
it was out of one out of a thousand when

3763
02:32:05,818 --> 02:32:10,019
you self it it should be a little more

3764
02:32:07,559 --> 02:32:12,659
frequent than one out of a thousand

3765
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:15,300
then you want to grow those out find the

3766
02:32:12,659 --> 02:32:17,459
plant that's the same again

3767
02:32:15,299 --> 02:32:21,119
and

3768
02:32:17,459 --> 02:32:22,679
if you have to self that one again every

3769
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:24,300
time you self you're going to lock it

3770
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:26,398
down more and more

3771
02:32:24,299 --> 02:32:28,139
and then

3772
02:32:26,398 --> 02:32:30,239
you know you can take that blueberry

3773
02:32:28,139 --> 02:32:34,680
plant and take a male out of the same

3774
02:32:30,239 --> 02:32:38,639
cross and go and and and and agreed to

3775
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:41,159
that and you know make your make your F3

3776
02:32:38,639 --> 02:32:43,439
and then take your F3 mail that you

3777
02:32:41,159 --> 02:32:44,520
think is the closest to the blueberry

3778
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:47,040
plant

3779
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:48,720
put it back on the blueberry and then

3780
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:49,560
hope you get some blueberries out of

3781
02:32:48,719 --> 02:32:51,779
that

3782
02:32:49,559 --> 02:32:54,478
and then

3783
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:57,420
out of those seeds find the one that's

3784
02:32:54,478 --> 02:32:59,159
the closest once again and go back and

3785
02:32:57,420 --> 02:33:01,379
then if you see that you're starting to

3786
02:32:59,159 --> 02:33:03,180
get more blueberries every time you can

3787
02:33:01,379 --> 02:33:06,358
just continue black you can continue

3788
02:33:03,180 --> 02:33:08,939
back Crossing to the blueberry

3789
02:33:06,359 --> 02:33:11,040
you know until you want until it winds

3790
02:33:08,939 --> 02:33:12,960
up being you know really frequent and

3791
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:15,060
you just get a lot of blueberry in there

3792
02:33:12,959 --> 02:33:16,379
then at that point would be where it

3793
02:33:15,059 --> 02:33:18,719
would be better to breed It Forward

3794
02:33:16,379 --> 02:33:20,818
because you you you're basically

3795
02:33:18,719 --> 02:33:23,099
targeting in you know you're getting it

3796
02:33:20,818 --> 02:33:26,398
to the point where there's more and more

3797
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:27,059
and more of this one thing that you want

3798
02:33:26,398 --> 02:33:29,219
um

3799
02:33:27,059 --> 02:33:31,978
and then

3800
02:33:29,219 --> 02:33:34,139
you know if that if that didn't work at

3801
02:33:31,978 --> 02:33:35,459
all then like I said you know selfing it

3802
02:33:34,139 --> 02:33:39,059
is really

3803
02:33:35,459 --> 02:33:40,978
the best way because if you get one out

3804
02:33:39,059 --> 02:33:44,519
of a thousand is blueberry then you self

3805
02:33:40,978 --> 02:33:48,119
it and you get one out of whatever that

3806
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:51,899
next time but you find that one this out

3807
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:54,420
of the s1s and you self that one and you

3808
02:33:51,898 --> 02:33:57,299
find that same one out of the S2 by the

3809
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:58,859
time you make the S3 or the S4 you're

3810
02:33:57,299 --> 02:34:01,139
going to have something where that's

3811
02:33:58,859 --> 02:34:02,880
what it has they're just mostly all

3812
02:34:01,139 --> 02:34:06,299
blueberry right

3813
02:34:02,879 --> 02:34:07,619
so then at that point you might be

3814
02:34:06,299 --> 02:34:09,318
better off

3815
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:14,880
Crossing

3816
02:34:09,318 --> 02:34:17,219
to the S3 or the S2 or the S1 you might

3817
02:34:14,879 --> 02:34:20,279
be better back Crossing to that lots of

3818
02:34:17,219 --> 02:34:22,438
times because it might be a lot more

3819
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:24,899
um true breeding you know

3820
02:34:22,439 --> 02:34:28,079
and uh you know there's just a question

3821
02:34:24,898 --> 02:34:30,059
of finding those those right things and

3822
02:34:28,079 --> 02:34:32,398
I mean as far as like modern breeders

3823
02:34:30,059 --> 02:34:34,318
would look for they'd look for whatever

3824
02:34:32,398 --> 02:34:36,478
those genes are

3825
02:34:34,318 --> 02:34:38,398
and just go okay we're just gonna test

3826
02:34:36,478 --> 02:34:40,799
this plant and see if it's the right one

3827
02:34:38,398 --> 02:34:42,719
test a thousand males and find the one

3828
02:34:40,799 --> 02:34:45,059
that actually has those same genes and

3829
02:34:42,719 --> 02:34:47,340
that's how you would do it if you were

3830
02:34:45,059 --> 02:34:50,299
like a real

3831
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:53,280
um you know a real

3832
02:34:50,299 --> 02:34:57,539
breeder in the in the most advanced

3833
02:34:53,280 --> 02:35:00,359
sense of of the of the of the you know

3834
02:34:57,540 --> 02:35:01,740
discipline or the job

3835
02:35:00,359 --> 02:35:05,460
um

3836
02:35:01,739 --> 02:35:07,139
but you know in reality if you were

3837
02:35:05,459 --> 02:35:08,938
somebody like if you were big

3838
02:35:07,139 --> 02:35:10,858
Agriculture and you want this crop to

3839
02:35:08,939 --> 02:35:12,300
get ready and you want to be able to go

3840
02:35:10,859 --> 02:35:14,040
okay we're going to get this into seed

3841
02:35:12,299 --> 02:35:15,599
form as quick as possible you would self

3842
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:18,180
self self

3843
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:20,640
so you would you would you would make

3844
02:35:18,180 --> 02:35:23,040
the S1 then you would find the exact

3845
02:35:20,639 --> 02:35:24,779
same plant may be improved ideally

3846
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:26,640
definitely you don't want to settle for

3847
02:35:24,780 --> 02:35:29,040
one that's not you don't want to settle

3848
02:35:26,639 --> 02:35:31,260
for one that's worse and then you want

3849
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:34,140
to take that S1 and you want to sell fit

3850
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:36,719
and then you want to find one of the S2s

3851
02:35:34,139 --> 02:35:39,478
that maybe is a little bit improved or

3852
02:35:36,719 --> 02:35:42,059
maybe a lot improved if you can and then

3853
02:35:39,478 --> 02:35:43,858
you want to make the S3 and then you

3854
02:35:42,059 --> 02:35:46,500
know by the time

3855
02:35:43,859 --> 02:35:48,960
you get something to be in like you know

3856
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:51,180
five generations seven generations of

3857
02:35:48,959 --> 02:35:53,099
selfing that's what they're really

3858
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:56,700
talking about when they tell you about

3859
02:35:53,100 --> 02:36:00,420
our true inbred line there's different

3860
02:35:56,700 --> 02:36:03,720
ways to to to Define an inbred line or

3861
02:36:00,420 --> 02:36:05,939
an IBL but like in the most true true

3862
02:36:03,719 --> 02:36:08,398
sense it would be like selfing for

3863
02:36:05,939 --> 02:36:10,380
several generations and then you could

3864
02:36:08,398 --> 02:36:13,799
get to the point where you basically had

3865
02:36:10,379 --> 02:36:16,500
clone in seed form where the plant would

3866
02:36:13,799 --> 02:36:19,079
be exactly the same now if you just bat

3867
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:21,180
cross seven times and the plant you were

3868
02:36:19,079 --> 02:36:23,459
back Crossing to doesn't ever want to be

3869
02:36:21,180 --> 02:36:25,318
super it doesn't want to be the only

3870
02:36:23,459 --> 02:36:27,959
thing in the mix anyway because it

3871
02:36:25,318 --> 02:36:31,379
already has a it's coming from a diverse

3872
02:36:27,959 --> 02:36:33,299
gene pool then you sometimes will make

3873
02:36:31,379 --> 02:36:34,920
it work but it's more likely that you

3874
02:36:33,299 --> 02:36:36,858
won't and you'll want what you'll wind

3875
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:38,818
up with is

3876
02:36:36,859 --> 02:36:41,340
the same

3877
02:36:38,818 --> 02:36:44,719
gene pool that came from just coming

3878
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:46,978
back again and again as if it's an S1

3879
02:36:44,719 --> 02:36:48,799
s1s aren't really consistent back

3880
02:36:46,978 --> 02:36:51,179
crosses aren't necessarily consistent

3881
02:36:48,799 --> 02:36:53,459
s1s are very consistent if they came out

3882
02:36:51,180 --> 02:36:55,318
if that you take an S1 out of something

3883
02:36:53,459 --> 02:36:57,719
that's already super consistent yeah

3884
02:36:55,318 --> 02:37:00,959
then you get what people think an S1 is

3885
02:36:57,719 --> 02:37:03,179
but that's not the case when you when

3886
02:37:00,959 --> 02:37:05,699
you S1 something from a really

3887
02:37:03,180 --> 02:37:08,100
inconsistent gene pool or where you back

3888
02:37:05,700 --> 02:37:10,979
cross to one plant from a really

3889
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:12,899
inconsistent gene pool unless you get

3890
02:37:10,978 --> 02:37:14,938
lucky and all the traits that you wanted

3891
02:37:12,898 --> 02:37:16,260
from that plant happen to be dominant

3892
02:37:14,939 --> 02:37:18,540
and then it doesn't matter if it was

3893
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:20,219
inconsistent because dominant traits are

3894
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:23,100
just going to want to pop out frequently

3895
02:37:20,219 --> 02:37:25,559
you know more than other stuff but you

3896
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:27,540
have to kind of you have to kind of play

3897
02:37:25,559 --> 02:37:29,519
with them to know exactly what the

3898
02:37:27,540 --> 02:37:32,819
individual is you're working with to

3899
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:35,100
know if it's just gonna throw everything

3900
02:37:32,818 --> 02:37:37,978
you want like you might back cross back

3901
02:37:35,100 --> 02:37:41,100
cross back cross and then turns out well

3902
02:37:37,978 --> 02:37:43,500
now you've just made a super consistent

3903
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:46,140
strain but it has one thing locked in

3904
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:50,159
you can't get rid of like it's sexually

3905
02:37:46,139 --> 02:37:51,719
unstable or it's prone to a disease you

3906
02:37:50,159 --> 02:37:53,818
hadn't even maybe you didn't even have

3907
02:37:51,719 --> 02:37:55,500
that disease and now you get it you go

3908
02:37:53,818 --> 02:37:58,799
[ __ ] the whole population gets it

3909
02:37:55,500 --> 02:38:00,420
whereas that the s1s from that plant

3910
02:37:58,799 --> 02:38:03,358
might not even have that because you

3911
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:05,159
still have some variety so like

3912
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:06,840
you know I don't know there's there's a

3913
02:38:05,159 --> 02:38:08,818
lot of different

3914
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:10,340
a lot of different ways to go with it

3915
02:38:08,818 --> 02:38:12,420
and that's what's so trippy about

3916
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:15,000
anytime you want to work with something

3917
02:38:12,420 --> 02:38:17,939
is you don't you don't necessarily know

3918
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:18,600
what's the best way to do it

3919
02:38:17,939 --> 02:38:20,880
um

3920
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:22,439
without trying so that's why it's really

3921
02:38:20,879 --> 02:38:25,099
good if you're going to work with things

3922
02:38:22,439 --> 02:38:28,200
to work with things you really like

3923
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:29,939
because if you're going to wind up

3924
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:31,920
having a lot of failures you want to

3925
02:38:29,939 --> 02:38:34,620
have failures on your way to something

3926
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:36,420
that means something instead of having a

3927
02:38:34,620 --> 02:38:38,040
bunch of failures on your way to

3928
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:40,260
something where even if it works perfect

3929
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:42,240
you don't even you know not even going

3930
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:45,000
to Value it that much you know if you

3931
02:38:42,239 --> 02:38:47,100
want to work with your favorite stuff so

3932
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:48,898
if you [ __ ] up or you waste time or you

3933
02:38:47,100 --> 02:38:51,420
do the wrong thing and now you have to

3934
02:38:48,898 --> 02:38:53,358
start over you're still excited you know

3935
02:38:51,420 --> 02:38:55,859
because if you're just following

3936
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:58,559
whatever you're trying to chase you're

3937
02:38:55,859 --> 02:39:01,439
trying to make rks because rks is hot

3938
02:38:58,559 --> 02:39:04,680
right now you know you know let rks pop

3939
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:06,420
up for 10 years and see if it stays

3940
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:09,720
popular after a while people will go

3941
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:12,540
that's good but it's you know it's

3942
02:39:09,719 --> 02:39:13,799
actually not really I mean and then in

3943
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:16,080
back in the day

3944
02:39:13,799 --> 02:39:18,000
a lot of stuff was skunky and we didn't

3945
02:39:16,079 --> 02:39:19,680
even we weren't even that excited about

3946
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,680
it unless it was like what I said like

3947
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:25,020
the pissy pungent or the the super skunk

3948
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:26,880
where it actually smokes good and

3949
02:39:25,020 --> 02:39:30,780
translates just smelling like a skunk

3950
02:39:26,879 --> 02:39:33,000
not necessarily anything it doesn't it

3951
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:34,920
the weed also has to be enjoyable and

3952
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,219
have a good high and taste good and Burn

3953
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:41,520
Right and hopefully grow good and yield

3954
02:39:38,219 --> 02:39:45,179
well and you know like I like what is

3955
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:46,739
rks rosin tastes like you might [ __ ]

3956
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:49,620
taste like nothing nobody even knows

3957
02:39:46,739 --> 02:39:52,020
there's a whole new generation of uh of

3958
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:52,560
of uses for stuff so

3959
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:54,420
um

3960
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:56,219
you know make sure you like something

3961
02:39:54,420 --> 02:39:59,359
before you go [ __ ] chasing it because

3962
02:39:56,219 --> 02:39:59,358
everyone's talking about it
