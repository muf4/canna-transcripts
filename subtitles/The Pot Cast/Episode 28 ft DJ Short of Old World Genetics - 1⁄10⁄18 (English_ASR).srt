27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,880
the blue strain himself dj short thank

28
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,359
you so much for joining us

29
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,438
thank you for having me hello

30
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,879
so first question we've been starting

31
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,519
the show off with recently what have you

32
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,438
been smoking on recently

33
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,679
oh goodness um

34
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:31,839
i've had some r d things um

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:35,280
their labels to me are fx1 fx3 fx4

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,600
and there's a a new variety

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,840
a tentatively named happy [ __ ] well

38
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,839
that's actually its

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,118
name the mother um

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,079
and it's the offspring of that which i

41
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,920
think i'll be calling new dawn i

42
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,639
like it a lot uh the reason i'm calling

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,640
it it's called happy [ __ ] the mother

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,519
is because it makes you purr

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,879
it's it's definitely a feline reference

46
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,359
and i know that there are other

47
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,438
connotations to the term and it's a bit

48
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,200
controversial and i just decided to go

49
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,118
forward with it anyhow

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,479
the release the first release will have

51
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,318
a different name but in the lineage

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,040
will be you know the mother is happy

53
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,799
[ __ ] and the father is the f4 blueberry

54
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,959
uh dad

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,760
um so she'll she'll get introduced that

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
way but but that's her story uh the the

57
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,120
label

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,480
i have in mind is the cheshire cat

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,879
grinning happy [ __ ] on top um it makes

60
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,238
you purr underneath and then what were

61
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,799
you thinking

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,878
because it gets a lot of reaction so why

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
not you know pt barnum knew about

64
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,799
advertising

65
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,719
yeah the marketing twist i think what's

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,519
most interesting about all that is

67
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,919
i think uh your son jd maybe posted a

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
photo of that fx one not just even an

69
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,719
hour or two ago i was looking at it

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
that's an interesting one because we've

71
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,439
got a lot of people who are really

72
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,318
interested

73
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,479
in um you know your new coming lines

74
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,399
what what made you use that um

75
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,840
terminology like the fx1 what does that

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,158
stand for exactly is it just kind of

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,120
arbitrary or does it mean something yeah

78
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,519
it was from a past labeling much of

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
which was experimental and works in

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,080
progress

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,760
um f is used was usually floral

82
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,840
x

83
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:22,639
referred to um high resin content

84
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,799
uh and it just happened to be part of

85
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,279
its label there was more to it than that

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,920
but for simplicity's sake that's what

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,680
these particular plants got labeled uh

88
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,639
for example the happy [ __ ] label was

89
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,799
1-7

90
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,518
um

91
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,319
there's two more numbers on that but 1-7

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,719
is the main envelope i keep going to

93
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,878
so so that was that was their

94
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,000
initial

95
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,359
labeling and name as they

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,158
um

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,680
produce as i'm able to sample the

98
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,878
various things then they develop a name

99
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,519
yeah um

100
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,719
and the like for example the fx1

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,400
um i'm wanting to call newberry i like

102
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,519
this strain a lot too it's very

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,280
anti-anxiety the mother on that one is

104
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,039
blue heaven

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,519
or a new uh version same parent stock

106
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,000
that the original blue heaven came from

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,280
uh just found another one

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,040
and it's wonderful anti-anxiety it's

109
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,359
very pleasant

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,439
comfortable functional

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
smoke very potent

112
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,560
but

113
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,560
clear-headed

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,160
certain med people that have very

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,160
serious debilitations really liking this

116
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,120
strain because it makes them feel more

117
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,880
comfortable in their bodies and so that

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,240
that's you know kind of what i was

119
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,279
shooting for and success um so far so

120
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
good

121
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,039
that's exciting to hear because i think

122
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,800
blue heaven and kind of the offspring of

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,319
that have been some of the most sought

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,240
sought-after things from the research

125
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,759
i've done but before we get into that

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,639
i'd love for you to take me back what

127
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,680
was your first experience with cannabis

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,600
oh god yeah we're going way back

129
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
uh very early 70s

130
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,519
1971

131
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,918
basically and and uh the first few times

132
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,519
i smoked nothing happened that was kind

133
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,959
of the case for

134
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,519
uh most people

135
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,959
back in the day it took me six

136
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,279
six tries

137
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,000
before i finally uh

138
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,079
had my experience and that was with a

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,478
variety i remember it well it was called

140
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,758
mexican flower top it was basic

141
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,478
commercial

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,960
sativa running around at the time

143
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,680
decent quality um

144
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,079
more more buds i mean

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,800
one of the myths about

146
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,478
the great sativa of yore you know well

147
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
not myths but

148
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:56,318
truth in advertising and just to get the

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,319
whole story most of it was bunk right i

150
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,360
mean the huge loads of it that came in

151
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,560
in 100 ton loads we called it dirt weed

152
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,800
uh

153
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,478
we then the smaller loads that came from

154
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,319
smaller importers people like the

155
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,800
brotherhood of eternal love and and

156
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,199
other or similar organizations

157
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,680
uh focused by far more on quality

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,120
smaller quantities maybe 10 tons at the

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,319
most whereas

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,160
the larger sativa loads back in the day

161
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
were a hundred tons

162
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,759
uh so the attention to detail and

163
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,800
quality wasn't always up to par

164
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,319
on on on most of that variety so once

165
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,439
you had your connections established

166
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,879
it was

167
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,038
relatively simple

168
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,079
at certain times to find

169
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,800
uh much better uh quality over others so

170
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,240
that mexican flower top it was just very

171
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,680
very interesting very visual

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,680
quite dissociative time distorting

173
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,759
colorful

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,478
and and most enjoyable again i was all

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
of

176
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,120
14 years old

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,720
at the time but

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,079
uh had many uh revelations epiphany on

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,240
on that particular day

180
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,758
wow i think that's kind of the uh the

181
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,680
experience all of us are hoping for

182
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,800
in regards to the bowl stock or the

183
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,560
brotherhood of eternal love it's

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,079
interesting you mention that because it

185
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,399
seems as though as we've done more and

186
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,399
more shows they keep coming up as a

187
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,000
constant reference and a lot of people

188
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,198
say that if they could pick any stock

189
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,598
from throughout history if they could

190
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,960
get their hands on some boat excuse me

191
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:33,918
if they get some hands on some bowl

192
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,758
stock

193
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,680
that's kind of what they'd be thinking

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
did you ever you know i think you kind

195
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,280
of alluded that that mexican stuff came

196
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,360
possibly through those links did you

197
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,719
ever find any seeds or was it not like

198
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,160
that because i think a lot of people

199
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,039
think that the weed would have had seeds

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,479
in it

201
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,439
sure sure and way back um

202
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,639
it's kind of hard to to decipher

203
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,560
that far back once

204
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,280
7273 and i was really in uh you know

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,879
purchasing herb on a regular basis

206
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:08,478
uh establishing my own networks um yeah

207
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,720
i mean you go with what you appreciate

208
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,279
the most and and

209
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,520
working with uh some of these groups

210
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,638
back in the day that that was just the

211
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,839
overall

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,319
um uh feeling and if your appreciation

213
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,560
was sensed that kind of put your place

214
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,598
in in the network

215
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
um of things one of the things i used to

216
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,560
do

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,120
way back when was whenever i would get a

218
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,360
hold of something that was in my opinion

219
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,000
quite superior i would

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,680
practice extreme discipline and always

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,639
hold on to some and for whatever

222
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,799
occasion in the future be at a party at

223
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:51,360
a festival or something and meet someone

224
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:54,399
else who has something of equal interest

225
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,039
it it was very beneficial to then go oh

226
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,679
well hey i've got some of this

227
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:03,199
and that that that connection right

228
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,559
there i think did more to further my

229
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,800
place

230
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,679
in that um

231
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:12,000
food chain um than than probably

232
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,120
anything else because then you have a

233
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
rapport

234
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,360
and then when that person and if they're

235
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,240
particularly if they're a dealer runs

236
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,639
into something of of quality they want

237
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
to impress you know you because you

238
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,639
impress them

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,080
so you're you're you're on the list then

240
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,080
so to speak

241
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,759
and then it worked out well and i should

242
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,920
mention too you know there's a lot of

243
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,799
talk the brotherhood of eternal love yes

244
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,639
they were a group that was more out

245
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,838
there you know they were outspoken as to

246
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,399
who they were but there were many such

247
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,560
organizations

248
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,120
and they were many were loosely

249
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,079
affiliated to one another that that

250
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,799
whole distribution chain just like any

251
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,800
is is is a fascinating subject in and of

252
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,199
itself

253
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,958
yeah wow so i think the thing which

254
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,399
grabs my curiosity the most out of all

255
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,719
of what you said is

256
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,120
i think a lot of people off the top of

257
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,800
their head would say that you know in

258
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,879
their minds you you climbed that

259
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,879
hierarchy that food chain pretty quickly

260
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,360
because a lot of people can think back

261
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,759
to hearing you as a kind of like a

262
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,600
leader figure in the very early days and

263
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,838
so i guess what i'm interested in is in

264
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
your opinion how long did it take before

265
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,959
you felt like you were starting to get

266
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,880
somewhere in the community and you could

267
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,119
start to kind of pull some strings and

268
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,240
have a bit of influence

269
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,879
yeah given the political climate here in

270
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,560
the states you know i mean i i love to

271
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:39,360
brag i survived nixon reagan bush one

272
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,838
bush ii the the we should start an

273
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,800
organization we have a veteran a veteran

274
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,279
of uh foreign wars vfw i've always

275
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:50,000
started a veteran of domestic wars

276
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,120
um that many of us endured

277
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,120
as well

278
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,879
um it was laying low

279
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,278
all the way up until um the early 90s i

280
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,039
went to amsterdam for my first time in

281
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,559
in 93

282
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,759
in an attempt to

283
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:08,559
connect there kind of haphazardly did

284
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,759
uh didn't get a ball rolling there until

285
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,958
the mid mid 90s late 90s really things

286
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:18,000
started to take off for me

287
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,159
i can say in retrospect that i knew

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,159
these days were coming

289
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,519
back in the early 80s

290
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,759
i began my breeding work in earnest

291
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,560
about 1978

292
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,519
7

293
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:35,119
after moving to eugene oregon from the

294
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,720
detroit michigan area

295
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,560
and

296
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,600
it just blossomed from there

297
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,799
so you know as far as as breed work that

298
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,959
would have been 78 79 as far as

299
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,838
really introducing into the community

300
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,319
not really until the late 90s i did an

301
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,279
article for high times i think the first

302
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:02,000
reference to the name dj short i think

303
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:05,200
it was 98 1998 that article came out

304
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,039
wow but i mean i certainly think i've

305
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
found some references before that just

306
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,519
from people for example in the oregon

307
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,479
area who you'd given clones to because

308
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,240
oh

309
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,000
yeah so that that's an interesting one i

310
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
wanted to talk about because

311
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,200
you know i mean we're probably gonna end

312
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
up having to go back here but something

313
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,959
i really always admired about you

314
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,560
specifically was that

315
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,319
there seemed to be at least from what i

316
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,319
could gather you were you were willing

317
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
to give out um you know some cuts to

318
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,399
people and the more i trace it back the

319
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,039
more i think that really helped progress

320
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,799
the scene in a lot of ways did you did

321
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,559
you give out your early blueberry cuts

322
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,919
knowing that it would be so beneficial

323
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,199
and have the effects it has or was it

324
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,559
more of just like you're just helping

325
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,480
people out

326
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,278
yeah again

327
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,360
it's the it's the family mentality the

328
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,759
brotherhood we're the grateful dead

329
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,079
really i mean uh the the the the mantra

330
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,919
is share the love

331
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,799
and spread the love

332
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,599
and i had no problem ever

333
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,559
doing that because by the time i had

334
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,879
something in clone form i already had

335
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,559
seed stock that was you know the next

336
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,360
level to work on

337
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,479
and to me it just it was it was a

338
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,000
benefit to get those things out there

339
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,320
um but then i didn't have to worry about

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,200
that anymore

341
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,720
and i did i sold a lot of clones gave

342
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:31,120
away clones traded and sold many from

343
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,040
1978 until 1987. i know

344
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,799
a lot of those went down to northern

345
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,480
california too

346
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,000
that early version of blueberry

347
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,320
incidentally

348
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,360
it was an autoflower

349
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,600
but it majorly produced and

350
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,839
people people really liked it its name

351
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,800
wasn't blueberry

352
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,800
back in the 80s its name back in the 80s

353
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,799
the primary name was the kind

354
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,639
and and and the way that worked is you

355
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,440
know

356
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,759
all of us in the industry were working

357
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
on various things and those various

358
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,360
things of course you know to pay the

359
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,919
bills you have to sell a lot of these

360
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,320
things some being better than others

361
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,240
you learn from your clientele when they

362
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,360
come back and they go no no man what you

363
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,278
had last week the kind man the kind

364
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,680
um and and it was

365
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,240
relative you know easy to dial in for

366
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,958
from that point getting getting feedback

367
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,360
from people i i did a lot of interesting

368
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,838
things um

369
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,680
there was a band in in eugene i used to

370

one-man psychedelic jam band at any rate

381
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,159
i would go to these shows in the 80s and

382
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,360
i'd have these various types of pot with

383
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,198
me or

384
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,240
bring one at a time but try different

385
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,639
ones and and during the break during the

386
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,959
the you know in between sets take the

387
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,278
band out and get them stoned and then

388
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:14,679
come back and see and the second set it

389
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:17,519
was always better i i i rarely you know

390
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:19,198
experimented with things i only did that

391
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,198
type of experimentation with things that

392
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,679
i was pretty certain

393
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,759
would you know fit the bill and they did

394
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,399
and and steve remembers this i've known

395
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,480
him for almost 40 years now and and he's

396
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,039
in his mid-60s like i said if you're in

397
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,560
eugene mulligan's pub tuesdays steve

398
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,439
eibach you won't regret it he's on

399
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:40,239
youtube too i-b-a-c-h

400
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,199
and and a treasure an absolute musical

401
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,600
treasure

402
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,078
so yeah it was it was those kinds of

403
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
things seeing how you can influence a

404
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,039
party

405
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,719
show up at a party break something out

406
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,039
the party's kind of dead when you get

407
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,639
there and an hour two later it's like

408
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,759
whoa that that that did something

409
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,560
um

410
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,919
but always it's the

411
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,719
you know

412
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,799
people ask me how how do i judge herb or

413
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
or i should say um

414
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,120
yeah how do i charge primarily by the

415
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
effect of the finished product

416
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
so many people i see one of the big

417
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,920
mistakes that i

418
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,958
witness

419
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,198
contemporary breeders today and growers

420
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,198
is they fall in love with the plant

421
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,000
and the structure of it and the smell of

422
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,639
it

423
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,440
and you've got to wait

424
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,320
and see how that thing performs how it

425
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,279
smokes how it feels in my body and over

426
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,278
a period of time

427
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,239
so yeah it takes a bit of time to

428
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,000
determine the burnout factor and and

429
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,360
those types of things

430
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
but um

431
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,079
that to me is the how how i the primary

432
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,480
means i judge herb is by smoking the

433
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:53,198
finished product and and

434
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
paying attention and taking notes

435
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,078
yeah hey man the amount of people who

436
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,440
i've spoken to who say that that's their

437
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,039
opinion and they got it straight from

438
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
you it's like it's kind of a bit

439
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,558
mind-blowing but let's just take a step

440
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,880
back so you mentioned you started

441
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,399
growing what i would love to know is

442
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
when did you decide to start breeding

443
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,360
and how did you acquire the initial

444
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,360
stock to do so

445
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:21,360
from the get-go i mean i wanted to grow

446
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,759
and breed from the time i was a teenager

447
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,399
uh i and there were seeds and everything

448
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:29,279
back then those those major those big

449
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,360
boatloads of the colombian bunk weed and

450
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,599
various mexican bunkweeds that were in

451
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,199
such mass quantity for some reason i

452
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,439
don't know if it was pressure

453
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,038
heat steam whatever they did to it they

454
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,519
wouldn't sprout

455
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,519
um either that we were completely inept

456
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,599
couldn't figure it out

457
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,160
things like where we would smoke out by

458
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,480
the patio you would notice one spring

459
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,798
that a plant came up between the cracks

460
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,200
and the patio blocks and you'd get a

461
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,679
little spoon and dig it up and put it in

462
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,960
a cup and stick it somewhere and

463
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,798
and try and to get it going

464
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
um

465
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,639
it was then uh

466
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,519
from there a desk lamp

467
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,600
one of those just just a a lamp on the

468
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,279
desk put the little

469
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:17,038
plant in the cup

470
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:19,359
i finally in in it was in 1977 i have

471
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,599
photos of these plants actually

472
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,159
uh that were finally getting to sprout

473
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,599
as well i had a story in my book about

474
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,200
not being able to sprout it was finally

475
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:31,599
some hawaiian and this little uh

476
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,240
toy that came within a cereal box that

477
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,879
was a seed sprouter a little plastic

478
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,519
dome with a uh

479
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,360
piece of sponge in the bottom of it and

480
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,400
i wet that thing and put a whole butt in

481
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,399
there and a whole bunch of

482
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,919
roots shot out and it's oh here we go

483
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,440
planted a bunch of those put them under

484
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,080
the desk lamp

485
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,480
um i finally got a four foot set of

486
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,159
fluorescent lights hung them at the foot

487
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,360
of my bed

488
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,120
um

489
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,599
and mind you

490
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,798
in this day there wasn't any place you

491
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,839
could go

492
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:11,679
and buy pots and dirt

493
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,759
um it just wasn't there you know it

494
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,559
didn't exist back in the day and i had

495
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,079
to modify waste baskets i got metal

496
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,678
waste baskets

497
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:24,960
used an old pop can opener along the

498
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,280
bottom to do drainage got gravel out of

499
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,480
my driveway for the drainage in the

500
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,440
bottom and dirt from the backyard

501
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,240
um

502
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,480
that's how that went put these plants

503
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,960
under these lights no timing on it had

504
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,279
no idea what flowering cycle was they

505
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,240
grew six feet tall

506
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,440
um

507
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,440
lanky sativa

508
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,918
and it wasn't until

509
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,759
that i moved to oregon and it was in

510
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,640
that interim that i had learned you know

511
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,440
read mel frank's books and ed rosenthal

512
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
and

513
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,279
a few others of of the time

514
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,440
and

515
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,279
had it figured out oh dark cycle light

516
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,320
cycle okay

517
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,918
had a

518
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,839
little duplex i lived at in eugene

519
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,919
set up a bathroom in a bedroom

520
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,599
fluorescent lights again this was before

521
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,600
metal highlights

522
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:20,319
and and just went went nutty um by then

523
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,839
there were there were places in eugene

524
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:26,158
to get soil but it was bulk it was like

525
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:29,359
from rexius so i'd have to line the

526
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,120
trunk of my old chevy with plastic and

527
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,759
go down to the rexia's place and they

528
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,439
would load it in with a front loader

529
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,240
in the back of my

530
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,480
car

531
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,279
shortly thereafter though i mean it it

532
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,360
started picking up this is 78 the

533
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,720
highlights metal highlights

534
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,879
high hid lighting showed up

535
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,079
79 they were really commercially

536
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,799
available

537
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,119
and then there was soils and fertilizers

538
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,119
and pots and those various things that

539
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,599
agribusiness already had

540
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,678
which then got distributed to

541
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,759
our community and things started taking

542
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,440
off

543
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,480
it was very

544
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,360
successful for a lot of people

545
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,798
throughout the 80s due to you know the

546
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:17,359
political climate was so oppressive

547
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,359
the risk was very great

548
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,599
if you got caught

549
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,359
but it was

550
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:24,480
relatively simple to

551
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,199
um

552
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,480
circumvent those

553
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,319
problems and and be successful

554
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,279
luck had something to do with it i'm

555
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,480
sure

556
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,480
uh

557
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,440
but yeah so it was about 80 81 things

558
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,599
really went boom you know high times was

559
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,440
advertising the various grow systems and

560
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,439
things and the indica genes

561
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,320
had shown up

562
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,240
okay and so one of the questions that

563
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,839
was sent in a few times by the guests

564
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,679
was they were wondering if you could

565
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:59,918
give us a little information on how you

566
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,919
initially came by the oregon purple tie

567
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,879
yeah well i was growing out these sativa

568
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,000
doing selections from them

569
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,039
i had my hands in a number of projects i

570
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,440
was helping various people set up their

571
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:18,720
uh grows doing some outdoor things

572
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,279
in the woods uh but had a nice selection

573
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,400
to uh witness

574
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,079
made my my selections uh one of which

575
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
was the highland thai which was the

576
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,639
juicy fruit

577
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,558
the other two were the chocolate thai

578
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,480
and the oaxacan

579
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:38,720
uh both of which i liked a lot

580
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,120
even what i was growing in oregon you

581
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,038
know i'm not talking even about the the

582
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,399
land race stock that that

583
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:50,558
it came from but but the grown out stock

584
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,360
in oregon um the both well no the the

585
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,839
oaxacan was was well behaved it was a

586
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,558
very symmetric plant

587
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,720
she didn't misbehave too terribly in

588
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,158
terms of hermaphroditism

589
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,679
and the

590
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,440
chocolate tie

591
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,640
on the other was the exact opposite it

592
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,038
was just

593
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,120
no different meristem every week she

594
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,640
grew all over the place

595
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,798
um

596
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,240
terribly hermaphroditic

597
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,158
um

598
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,759
in clusters though that were somewhat

599
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,600
easy to deal with

600
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,359
and it just so happened that i had a

601
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,439
whole bunch of oaxacan pollen

602
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,678
had done an indoor harvest on that while

603
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,720
the outdoor was flowering

604
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,240
and applied that to this chocolate thai

605
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,679
plant which then became the um oregon

606
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,120
purple tie

607
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,720
that was 1979

608
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,918
that that was done

609
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,360
uh it was 1980 that the

610
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,520
oregon purple tie was first grown out

611
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,719
clone a lot of clones of that went out

612
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,879
as well

613
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,240
um

614
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,320
and

615
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,278
it was working with the indica at that

616
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,319
time too is when that showed up but yeah

617
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,599
that's the

618
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,639
purple tie when i grew her out

619
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:11,119
um

620
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:14,000
most of the phenotype from her were

621
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,079
uh workable were were um

622
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,440
you know they passed the muster

623
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,399
and so uh got a good

624
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,798
uh

625
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,720
clone stock of her going i have some a

626
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,839
picture of her as well but only in

627
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,839
vegetative state outdoors again

628
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,918
there's not many photos there wasn't

629
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,959
digital photography back in that day

630
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,480
most of my photos are from polaroids

631
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,480
that a friend of mine would have a

632
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,798
polaroid and i'd have enough money to

633
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,558
buy a pack of film and and have them

634
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,038
come over and

635
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,519
still have that evidence so

636
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,599
yeah yeah those polaroids are seriously

637
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,599
some of the most cool little uh strain

638
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,599
history stuff we can get so something i

639
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,678
did wanted to ask you kind of answer is

640
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,519
i've seen a few people very limited i

641
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,120
think snow hi is the one who comes to

642
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,918
mind and he he breeds with the oregon

643
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,278
purple tie so yeah i wanted to ask is it

644
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,640
still out there you kind of answered

645
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,038
that

646
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,480
you know good question the the the name

647
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,000
got it's it's its place has its hype it

648
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,079
remains to be seen

649
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,599
i can say this i can attest to this it

650
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:20,960
was a while ago now um my goodness

never reconnected with him i think we

673
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,038
shared emails a few times but it just

674
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,119
when it's it's passing away

675
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,359
i know this is the case though i know

676
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,918
that there are people out there

677
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:19,199
that still have these things um

678
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,679
especially

679
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,080
people that kept it quiet

680
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,240
you know and then we're really low key

681
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:29,918
and i think the same can be said for the

682
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:34,079
land races for places like oaxaca and

683
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:36,880
thailand and burma and india nepal

684
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,278
um that there are still i like to think

685
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,880
in my mind of a grandmother you know and

686
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,558
she's got her garden she's going not

687
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,880
just vegetables but she's got her herb

688
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,558
in there and her goal growing her herbs

689
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,640
not really for money she might trade

690
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,960
some of it for something or

691
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,720
you know sell a little bit of it but her

692
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,640
primary goal is to grow what her

693
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,120
grandmother grew

694
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,559
and the way that went since antiquity is

695
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,798
you know you spread your seed in the

696
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,798
garden and the plants come up and then

697
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,960
come fall you harvest

698
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,639
and out of one you know one of those

699
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,079
plants is your favorite

700
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,480
and that plant that was a favorite

701
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,798
that's the seeds you use for next year

702
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
and on and on and on and after thousands

703
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,480
of years

704
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,079
i mean you know people in

705
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,278
these

706
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:24,480
antiquity areas these um

707
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:27,119
land race areas um

708
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,919
have thousands of years on us in in in

709
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,398
terms of experience with this plant i

710
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,200
think we still have a lot to learn from

711
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,519
them

712
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,399
as well and and getting they're still

713
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,398
there

714
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:43,119
i i not the ariane method of of strain

715
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:45,439
hunters but aryan's all right i don't

716
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,119
he's an upfront guy and i'm okay with

717
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,558
what he does but you're not gonna get to

718
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,158
the quality you're going to get to the

719
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,000
quantity

720
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,320
through the strain hunters method if you

721
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,960
want the quality you've got to learn the

722
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,639
language learn the culture devote some

723
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,278
time of your life

724
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,919
go to that area gain the trust of those

725
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,319
people like the brotherhood said spread

726
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,159
the love which in the case of the people

727
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,079
there is money or the things that they

728
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,039
need in that area

729
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,599
um

730
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,679
and and establish your contacts i know

731
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,038
they're still there i know they're still

732
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,679
there

733
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,519
yeah wow that's kind of inspiring

734
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,600
so just to loop back onto something you

735
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,839
mentioned a while ago something i really

736
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,359
enjoy about your mindset is a lot of

737
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,038
breeders these days will look at a

738
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,119
project especially after they've grown

739
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,359
out the testers and they'll say it's

740
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,199
either good or bad but just when you

741
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,678
referenced the purple tie you said it's

742
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,679
workable and it made me realize you see

743
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,679
things in more of like shades of grey

744
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,278
than black and white do you feel like

745
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,440
that's something that's missing where

746
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:47,200
people are just going to go it's good or

747
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,519
it's bad or should people look to work

748
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,679
things a bit more in the way you have

749
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,679
yeah

750
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,360
definitely you know we could use some

751
00:28:53,839 --> 00:29:01,119
improvement in in in that capacity

752
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:02,719
um again bearing in mind to

753
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,798
go

754
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,798
and it's hard to do because we fall in

755
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,879
love with the plants right you've got a

756
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,038
plan you got a garden going you got 20

757
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,240
different varieties in there and some

758
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:16,079
are just they stand out um

759
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,359
that's as a plant

760
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,119
um

761
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,879
and whatever relationship you have as a

762
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,798
grower with that plant that's great how

763
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,120
that carries over into the commercial

764
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,200
world and how other people are going to

765
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,239
appreciate that plan i don't think can

766
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,480
be fully ascertained until we

767
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,000
at least subjectively

768
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,839
test that herb now i do have

769
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,440
five objective criterion that i'll make

770
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,079
notes of and i can go over them real

771
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,320
quickly it's on set how long

772
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,158
does it take to

773
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,240
fully feel the effect of the product is

774
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,640
it a quick onset or a long onset does it

775
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,759
take an hour does it take five minutes

776
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,960
duration how long does the effect last

777
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,679
um

778
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,720
ceiling if i continue to smoke more and

779
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,200
more does my experience expand more or

780
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,720
do i just get stuck in this one you know

781
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,880
a heavy-hitting indica you just sink

782
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,960
more into the couch

783
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,440
the fourth one and this is an important

784
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,880
one and this takes time i call it

785
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,120
tolerance threshold or burnout

786
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,200
you know after a week of smoking this

787
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,798
continually is something i want to

788
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,558
return to

789
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,759
um and does it still have the same

790
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:31,278
effect and then finally this is another

791
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:34,000
time issue is shelf life when it sits in

792
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,960
a jar for a year for two years or for

793
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,640
three years does it improve in quality

794
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,480
so with those five objective um analyses

795
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,640
the sixth one being and this is just an

796
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,038
overall would be potency

797
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,759
uh which is just the general potency of

798
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,919
uh but for me it's more desirability i

799
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,158
think you know a lot of people are

800
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,200
if it messes you up a whole bunch they

801
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,840
feel that's a success whereas for me i'm

802
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,080
more into a clarity clear

803
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,079
and that's harder to dial in

804
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,119
messing yourself up on something super

805
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,119
potent that's easy

806
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,679
so a kind of a common reference we've

807
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,480
had in the show is how some of the

808
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,919
strains from years gone by seem to lack

809
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,839
kind of what you refer to as like a

810
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,919
ceiling whereby you know you can smoke

811
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,839
more and the experience gets greater you

812
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,440
kind of go to a new place

813
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,918
commonly it said that a lot of our

814
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,519
modern hybrids don't have this they do

815
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,600
have a ceiling and you're kind of very

816
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,120
limited in the feeling where do you

817
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,959
think this comes from because i've been

818
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,319
thinking about it a lot and it's like

819
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,798
do you think that it's just something

820
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,319
about being a land race that it or like

821
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:39,759
you know being more closer to that end

822
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:42,079
of the spectrum it allows you to have a

823
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,278
more interesting experience or because

824
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,240
it's just yeah i'm trying to figure out

825
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,558
where does this ceiling come from yeah

826
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,319
definitely related to

827
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,599
land race

828
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,480
phenomenon

829
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,398
i mean i release my my seed stock is

830
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,200
pretty much f5s

831
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,599
that's five generations from the land

832
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,720
race which are the p ones then we have

833
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:07,918
our f1s f2 so on and i did that for a

834
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,038
reason and um i wanted to establish

835
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,640
enough

836
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,278
um

837
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,278
of the characteristics to you know

838
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,440
market it as whatever it's called

839
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,079
blueberry flow whatever

840
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,000
but also to leave enough of that land

841
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,240
race variance in there so that people

842
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,119
have a few generations left

843
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,839
to play with it i did an article in

844
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,879
o'shaughnesses not long ago uh and it

845
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:36,798
was calling for a new classification of

846
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,320
cannabis where we have indica and sativa

847
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,359
and root or alice and if we're going to

848
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:44,158
use those criterion i said why not let's

849
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,158
use cannabis indoor

850
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,399
um in the indoor environment which is

851
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,360
primarily high intensity discharge

852
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,759
lights

853
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,479
relatively limited soil space although

854
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,440
that's you know growing more

855
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,839
um

856
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,278
and but the the plants tend to acclimate

857
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,519
to that environment they acclimate to

858
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,880
whatever environment they are

859
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,839
in

860
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,960
um

861
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,079
so

862
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,240
um

863
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,960
that indoor environment i think

864
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,640
you know we we can't replicate the the

865
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,360
tropical environment

866
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,799
there are too many variables or are just

867
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,199
are too many

868
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:20,398
uh variables just uh going on in that

869
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,200
environment

870
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,119
um that are we're limiting in that

871
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,360
indoor environment and by in my opinion

872
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,599
it's about the eighth generation out

873
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,000
um tenth for sure by the tenth

874
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:36,000
generation you are seeing this

875
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,599
very likeness between strains i noticed

876
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,558
this for the first time when i was in

877
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,678
europe

878
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,678
uh back in the 90s back in europe in the

879
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,440
90s

880
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,759
pretty much all they had were sodium

881
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,798
lights high intensity

882
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,240
sodium lights they didn't have many

883
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,558
metal highlights so it was more the

884
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,558
orange spectrum and

885
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,879
it was there that i noted because i used

886
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:59,278
mainly uh highlights i really liked that

887
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,480
blue spectrum a lot more and it allowed

888
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:04,319
me to differentiate that the sodiums

889
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,240
were bringing out the sour

890
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,278
and the highlights were bringing out the

891
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,519
sweet

892
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,239
it it seemed to me and i experimented

893
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:15,199
several times to my satisfaction yeah

894
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,918
that's pretty much the case right now uh

895
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:21,519
i'm really liking these uh ceramic metal

896
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,319
highlights the 315 and the 630s

897
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,599
and on the blue end

898
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,440
4200 kelvin

899
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,679
in that range

900
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,280
really in the bud room especially the

901
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,878
last few weeks they bring out the suite

902
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,879
yeah wow that's that's interesting

903
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,480
because i've always used metal halides

904
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,639
based on the recommendation of a few

905
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,240
kind of people and i always noticed that

906
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,919
yeah my harvest do tend to be quite

907
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,678
sweet so there you go i can attest to

908
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,239
that one myself

909
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,878
something we got a few questions from

910
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,358
the fans for was they were interested in

911
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,118
the afghani that you used to cross to

912
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,878
the purple tie to create the initial

913
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,640
flow line because i think a lot of

914
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,039
people maybe assume that it was like a

915
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,799
very pure afghany and maybe very

916
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,880
desirable what were your recollections

917
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,800
of it

918
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,280
yes it it was um and when it showed up

919
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,359
it came to me

920
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,040
late 1979 i don't think i started

921
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:19,358
growing it until early 1980

922
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,599
in bag seed form

923
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:24,319
was grown in northern california so just

924
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,079
one generation but they kept it strictly

925
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,559
indica

926
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:32,079
i had a connection with

927
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,759
the dealer and the manicurist who um

928
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,119
we again we were sharing genetics so

929
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,560
they didn't have a problem with me

930
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,800
getting seeds they were trying to keep

931
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,519
those off the market point being is i

932
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,200
had a small number of these seeds about

933
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,719
50 of them um and i was able to you know

934
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,598
procure a male

935
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,919
uh

936
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,079
so first and foremost they were unlike

937
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,440
anything we had at the time they were

938
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,039
stout

939
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,200
uh

940
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,239
very symmetric very uniform looked like

941
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,519
little christmas trees very large leaves

942
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,319
green

943
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,679
they didn't go purple at all

944
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,680
thick stems

945
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,199
and they smelled like a dead skunk under

946
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,838
the house

947
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,960
very musky

948
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:17,039
odor um large bulbs calyx are not calyx

949
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,639
i'm sorry trichome

950
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,039
it's really where we started to see

951
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,358
trichomes sativa don't have

952
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,519
a lot of glandular stock trichomes

953
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:29,119
sativa do have

954
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:31,280
uh more cystolithic hairs that secrete

955
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,440
oils directly onto the surface of the

956
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,000
leaf they're not in a sheath

957
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,159
like our our trichome is is is in a

958
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,440
sheath and that's you know the indica

959
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:41,519
genetics

960
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,519
um i would then

961
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,559
was fortunate enough to have indica

962
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,920
pollen

963
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:50,000
that i took both to the um purple tie

964
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,960
that i had going at the time and the

965
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,320
highland oaxacan or juicy fruit tie

966
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,720
um and uh i did the cross both ways

967
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,359
because i had female indicas as well but

968
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,679
i wasn't as interested in in in that

969
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,199
line the sativa pollen to the indica i

970
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,879
was much more interested in the indica

971
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:12,399
pollen to the sativa um so yeah that

972
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,480
indica was very unique but it was also

973
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,200
god awfully boring

974
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,920
and you know we we fell in love with it

975
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,358
initially because it was not a novel

976
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,440
and unique

977
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,400
and it made manicuring easy oh and it

978
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,079
was done in eight weeks right i mean i

979
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,838
was dealing with sativas that never

980
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,000
finished sometimes 18 20 22 week

981
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:37,358
sativa

982
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,119
and manicuring was just a nightmare it

983
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:40,960
had no bag appeal

984
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,280
uh whereas this indica was something

985
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,240
different and it you know put you on the

986
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,880
couch it was very sedate

987
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,479
which was unlike the things of the times

988
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,400
and

989
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,280
that that novelty

990
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,680
was its hype and it became very popular

991
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,519
and in my opinion overly popular there

992
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,719
was an article in high times i think it

993
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:05,519
was 83 maybe 82 the cover of the

994
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,838
magazine is a picture of an indica bud a

995
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:10,000
great big indica

996
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,599
finished bud black background with a

997
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,800
large large red circle slash over the

998
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,359
bud and the words ban the bud

999
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,839
and uh it was written by

1000
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,679
an author when by the name of our

1001
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:25,838
i was thought was um

1002
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,319
robert clark but i asked him about it

1003
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:31,199
and he denies that it was him

1004
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,359
uh at any rate the article went on to

1005
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,239
say that these indica genetics were

1006
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,960
polluting the gene pools in the land ray

1007
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,799
sativa areas because those people then

1008
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,199
the farmers in those regions thought

1009
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,720
that's what we wanted

1010
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,838
and to this day you're seeing

1011
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:50,000
ramifications of that in jamaica when

1012
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,239
you see pictures of those squat little

1013
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,719
indica bushes on the mountainsides in

1014
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,519
jamaica to me that's just sad

1015
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,118
that's just sad jamaica was making 18

1016
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,400
foot wispy

1017
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,920
willow

1018
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,400
um

1019
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,920
wonderful sativas still can and i'm sure

1020
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,720
they still do

1021
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,800
but it's it's what the market bears

1022
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,759
so um

1023
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,839
yeah that that that was the indica i

1024
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,040
don't have seeds of that

1025
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:21,679
replicating it i think could be done

1026
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,440
i just asked myself why and i look at

1027
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:24,399
the list of things i have to do and say

1028
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,599
there's no

1029
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,639
things i'd

1030
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,039
rather do than resurrect the indica um

1031
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,960
i'm sure it's still in afghanistan with

1032
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,279
all the soldiers going back and forth

1033
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,280
the states here i hear a rumor of a lot

1034
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,680
of kandahar and

1035
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,079
and various uh things that are supposed

1036
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:45,118
to be around but i haven't i haven't um

1037
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,880
personally smelled that dead skunk under

1038
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,320
the house indica

1039
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
yet

1040
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,000
yeah that's interesting because that's

1041
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,240
you you referenced it perfectly the

1042
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,599
kandahar is around and um

1043
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,399
we've been talking a lot on the show

1044
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,000
about how the uh the roadkill skunk as

1045
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,320
people refer to it is most likely

1046
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,440
actually an afghani and not not really a

1047
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,760
skunk

1048
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,519
but um what i'm really interested in

1049
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
about that is when you first created the

1050
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,719
flow line did you pop some of those

1051
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,160
seeds immediately or did they kind of

1052
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,838
sit on the shelf for a minute and you

1053
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,598
had some other things to do

1054
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,480
oh yeah they sat on the shelf for a

1055
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,880
minute and had many other things to do

1056
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,079
again politically it was it was a

1057
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,039
wretched era i mean just surviving those

1058
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,560
days was was an effort

1059
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,679
um

1060
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,799
and so as i

1061
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,799
glum up along

1062
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,039
place to place

1063
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:42,559
one of the terrible things in the 80s

1064
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,920
for me was i would get my act together

1065
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,039
have a place

1066
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,039
you know find a rental

1067
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,719
establish my grow get it going get some

1068
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,720
r d going get some nice

1069
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:58,799
you know revenue

1070
00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:01,358
uh generation potential going and then

1071
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,599
you get an eviction notice

1072
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,239
and this was just ongoing and ongoing

1073
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,000
and ongoing and it was um terrible it

1074
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,000
was it was manipulated

1075
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,239
i kind of witnessed this firsthand in my

1076
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,760
opinion the whole housing bubble on the

1077
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,679
west coast

1078
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,680
was primarily fueled by pot growers

1079
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,719
and i saw this firsthand when i moved in

1080
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,639
78 it was a breeze there were rentals

1081
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:27,679
everywhere

1082
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:27,679
the place was just in

1083
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,358
economic shambles in in that capacity

1084
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:36,159
but it was very easy to rent anywhere

1085
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,519
the i think real estate

1086
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,399
industry

1087
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,280
realized who we were and capitalized on

1088
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,440
us

1089
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,079
in that you know it wasn't too difficult

1090
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,599
to figure out who's growing what where

1091
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,119
you just kind of go by the property and

1092
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,440
can figure that out

1093
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,519
and then it starts with inspections oh

1094
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,159
we need to do an inspection well there's

1095
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:59,519
one you know and again during reagan and

1096
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:02,318
bush one these were very trying times

1097
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,599
you did not you know mess with with any

1098
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,000
of this so

1099
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,480
um then the house goes up for sale and

1100
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,639
of course you can't qualify to buy it so

1101
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,679
here you are out on the rental market

1102
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,879
again

1103
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,358
and so

1104
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,280
the rentals are drying up there's none

1105
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,799
they're going down to very few and i'm

1106
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,000
showing up to this one where there's an

1107
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,880
appointment

1108
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,960
and there's 200 people there you know as

1109
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,599
they have a specific time on a weekend

1110
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,400
to show up and here's 200 people

1111
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,480
50 of us are growers and i recognize us

1112
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,519
all in the crowd and we're vying for the

1113
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,240
house one of us will get it because we

1114
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,960
always pay on time we always pay in cash

1115
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:43,439
and starting in those days we paid 15 to

1116
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,159
25 percent more

1117
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,039
that inflates the value of the property

1118
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:53,279
that justifies mortgage rates

1119
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:55,519
you know uh and mortgages and and

1120
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,119
that's just how that whole whole thing

1121
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,199
went um

1122
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,519
finally i got out of that out of the

1123
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,399
eugene area it was just uh impossible

1124
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,920
went out to drier climbs the east side

1125
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,880
of the state where things were a lot

1126
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,400
cheaper

1127
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,240
um

1128
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,599
and i think that's still the case today

1129
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,519
there are certain places eastern

1130
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,880
california eastern oregon eastern

1131
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:16,318
washington

1132
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,318
um

1133
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,838
nevada

1134
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:22,239
and and who knows what's going to be

1135
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,199
opening up next i mean idaho would be

1136
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,879
nice

1137
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,399
utah

1138
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,559
but

1139
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,519
stranger things have happened

1140
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,759
yeah

1141
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,519
so at what point did you kind of feel a

1142
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,280
bit more comfortable in oregon like i

1143
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,759
guess it was after those turbulent years

1144
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,200
with nixon and bush one and whatnot

1145
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,960
yeah you know i mean um clinton got in

1146
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,838
things things back down a little i was

1147
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,800
traveling a lot and it was just very

1148
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:51,599
apparent and very obvious you could see

1149
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,760
i would take a trip uh you know five six

1150
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,920
hours on the freeway and you would see

1151
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,760
five or six cars pulled over on the side

1152
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,880
of the road everyone out of the car all

1153
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,200
the contents out police digging through

1154
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,440
um this was just constant and that

1155
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:10,559
finally abated it backed off about 92

1156
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,400
91 92 in my opinion were the worst years

1157
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,279
those were the driest

1158
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,400
years everybody had difficulties

1159
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,160
surviving that that era

1160
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,838
it was rough and you know i think the

1161
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,838
whole country was ready for a change

1162
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,920
which is why things happen things

1163
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:28,239
lightened up california

1164
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,838
began to lighten up the whole medical

1165
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:35,919
scene there it was 96 i think

1166
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:38,719
prop 215 it was 94 that dennis perrone

1167
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,800
was making waves and and people were

1168
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,719
talking about it anyhow

1169
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,960
so you know we kind of were coming out

1170
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,799
of the closet at that time and yeah i

1171
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,039
did feel more comfortable then

1172
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,079
especially after going to europe and

1173
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:55,679
amsterdam uh europe was miles ahead of

1174
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,880
us at the time so was canada for a brief

1175
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,159
spell there

1176
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,000
um

1177
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,318
and i took you know advantage of both

1178
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
those places as much as i could

1179
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,679
yeah before we jump into that because we

1180
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,039
do have a few questions i just wanted to

1181
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,199
loop back

1182
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,880
when we you mentioned you made those

1183
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,960
flow seeds initially when you crossed

1184
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,760
you know the afghani to the uh purple

1185
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,159
tie

1186
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,480
was was that the point when you could

1187
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,399
kind of sense that you know the the

1188
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,000
blueberry line was locked in it or was

1189
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,720
it still further yet

1190
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,318
yeah still further yet so those uh the

1191
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:30,000
purple tie that the um

1192
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,440
juicy fruit tie

1193
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,159
and those afghan those would be

1194
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,000
considered the pea ones the seeds from

1195
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,159
those um

1196
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,400
thais and oaxacan

1197
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:43,199
those are the f1 seeds

1198
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,599
those seeds were uniform they were

1199
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,439
identical they all looked alike

1200
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,480
from what i've seen in pictures i always

1201
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,318
related them to lebanese plants because

1202
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,280
lebanese are kind of in between indica

1203
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:58,159
and sativa long spear-shaped buds

1204
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,359
complete cacophony of odor they had

1205
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,519
every smell in the book a little color

1206
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,440
variation but i think that may have had

1207
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,759
something more to do with placement in

1208
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,920
the room i was using various colored

1209
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,640
bulbs at the time so that that might

1210
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,838
have had something to do with it um

1211
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,519
and i just for you know honesty's sake

1212
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,838
here truth in in

1213
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:21,199
the whole advertising cruising story i

1214
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:24,159
did not know

1215
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:27,439
what i was doing at the time it was just

1216
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:30,799
unfolding and i was witnessing so i grew

1217
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,639
out these f1s again they were all

1218
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,400
quite similar they had incredible

1219
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:35,598
potency liked them a

1220
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,800
great deal

1221
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,559
and then crossed a few of those

1222
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,680
and it was in and around this time it

1223
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,880
was about 1983 that i finally got a hold

1224
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,559
of robert clark's book marijuana botany

1225
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,838
which i think they might even published

1226
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,799
in 83

1227
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:56,559
um and then i was able to go oh

1228
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:59,039
oh that's that's what i'm doing um and

1229
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,519
it was then okay so you have these f1s

1230
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,559
you take any two of the f1s male female

1231
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:07,920
cross them um grow those seeds out in

1232
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:11,358
the f2 line that's where the variance

1233
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,680
shows up so then it's in that f2 line

1234
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:16,318
that i start to see let's say for

1235
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,358
blueberry it's a berry mother a berry

1236
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,800
father

1237
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,400
you cross them out to f3

1238
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,800
you should see

1239
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,079
at least 50 percent hopefully 25 to 50

1240
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,880
percent of the progeny sporting that uh

1241
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,760
phenotype you then take the best example

1242
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,960
male female the berry in the f3 out to

1243
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,800
an f4

1244
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,599
and um

1245
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,119
what i do then is those f4s the seeds i

1246
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,480
make from them which are the f5s are the

1247
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,280
ones um that i sell now when i'm playing

1248
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,800
around it's when i started sprouting the

1249
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,480
f2s

1250
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,119
was when i went

1251
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,719
oh my god and

1252
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,880
that was my great epiphany time um and

1253
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:59,838
that would have been early 80s

1254
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,680
um

1255
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,039
80 81

1256
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,440
um

1257
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,358
82 on just just all the way on from

1258
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,200
every crop i grew from from that point

1259
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:10,799
every time i sprouted seeds i saw

1260
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,759
something new

1261
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,800
um there's an example when i give my

1262
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,720
class

1263
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,640
i didn't know this at the time again

1264
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,279
i've since researched and what i was

1265
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:23,440
witnessing i think is something

1266
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,160
referred to in biology called

1267
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:30,079
transgressive segregation

1268
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:33,118
and transgressive segregation refers to

1269
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,200
two very different p1's

1270
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,640
very different uh

1271
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,598
crossing them to make f1s that are

1272
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:41,440
uniform i use an example

1273
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,599
of dogs it's easier for us to wrap our

1274
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,760
head around dogs

1275
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,160
and say if you could cross a chihuahua

1276
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,200
to a great dane the smallest dog to the

1277
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:53,358
biggest dog and the joke goes you know

1278
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,399
hopefully the great dane is the mother

1279
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,759
um

1280
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,920
but then those would represent your p1s

1281
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,599
your f1s from that crossing would be

1282
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,760
something right in between them like a

1283
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,800
pit bull boxer

1284
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,000
very uniform in structure

1285
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,720
and any two of those f1 dogs those

1286
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,519
boxer-like dogs that you cross will then

1287
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:18,000
give you puppies that if transgressive

1288
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,400
segregation comes into play you will see

1289
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,119
examples larger than the great dane and

1290
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,079
smaller than the chihuahua so you see

1291
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,000
things beyond what the original

1292
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,720
uh land race

1293
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,880
uh

1294
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,759
and that that's what i witnessed that's

1295
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,200
exactly what i witnessed flo presented

1296
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,839
herself

1297
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,519
and again i go by the effect of the

1298
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:42,159
finished product and when i smoked that

1299
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:45,199
plant it was just like whoa hello you're

1300
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:48,480
a day brightener really focused very

1301
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:51,279
motivational but unique she is extremely

1302
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,719
unique smokes like a sativa looks like a

1303
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,440
sativa

1304
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:57,358
grows like a sativa but is done in seven

1305
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,119
and a half weeks

1306
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,279
and in my opinion

1307
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:05,680
the only real difference between indica

1308
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:08,240
and sativa is flowering time

1309
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,919
huh that's that's a going to ruffle some

1310
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:12,479
feathers

1311
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,240
no i like that and so what do you

1312
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,240
because this is something i've spoken to

1313
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,919
a few people about especially bodhi

1314
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,159
because he's got a lot of experience

1315
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,519
with land races and he said to me

1316
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,279
i found a hindu kush with the exact same

1317
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,400
terpene profile

1318
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,640
as a haze

1319
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,358
and when i got them tested they had

1320
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,519
similar numbers for thc and whatnot and

1321
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,598
yet the highs are obviously totally

1322
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,199
different and so we're kind of sitting

1323
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,359
there going what is it you know we've

1324
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,960
got this plant that smells the same the

1325
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,119
numbers are about the same the only

1326
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,358
difference is the flowering time and so

1327
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,200
yeah like how do you what do you think

1328
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:51,920
is ultimately the cause of the

1329
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,279
perceptual feeling of a sativa versus an

1330
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,079
indica

1331
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,800
ah that's a big big question a big big

1332
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:02,000
subject and it is something that is so

1333
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:05,359
big i think we are going to set the

1334
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,519
tenets of science on its ears

1335
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,639
because what we're talking about here

1336
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:12,079
are the subtleties of a non-linear

1337
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:13,838
dynamic

1338
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,519
all right and i've discussed this with a

1339
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:17,279
number of people all right we know about

1340
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,440
thc you've got your graph here's your

1341
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,440
thc right there's your cbd right there

1342
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,280
and your other minor cannabinoids in

1343
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,119
between and all along are all these

1344
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,880
other little things going

1345
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,640
we're gonna find that it's one of these

1346
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,318
little toots that it's if up here and

1347
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,920
this other little toot is right over

1348
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,079
there oh

1349
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,838
that does this regardless of what the

1350
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,680
big ones are doing up here it's those

1351
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:38,799
little ones and those ratios between

1352
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,078
them now

1353
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,119
how

1354
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,400
the complexity to map that

1355
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,720
is

1356
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:51,039
unfathomable but we got to start

1357
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:53,279
somewhere right now i have some ideas

1358
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,358
one of which has to do with a cup we

1359
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,440
came up with an idea for a cup

1360
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:02,078
that would only utilize one strain

1361
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,599
one strain one clone particularly i mean

1362
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,160
you could expand it out to be seed as

1363
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:09,359
well but really to to dial this in and

1364
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,639
to to use this both as a as a cup and an

1365
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,960
experiment

1366
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,679
one mother cloned give the growers a

1367
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,720
year two years give them two years

1368
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:20,399
they all come back to this cup and we

1369
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,598
analyze then what each and every one of

1370
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,200
them did because we've already heard the

1371
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,800
story

1372
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:26,399
you take a mother plant you can take 12

1373
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,960
cuts off of it give it to 12 different

1374
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,920
people and get 12 different things back

1375
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,720
well

1376
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,358
let's do that let's analyze the things

1377
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,118
that come back and then ask the growers

1378
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,279
what did you do different

1379
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,720
you know and maybe then we can start

1380
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,200
parsing out

1381
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:46,639
some of the cause and effect as to what

1382
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:50,318
this is now myself what my goal

1383
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:53,279
is to replicate the experiences i had

1384
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:55,838
from those original land races

1385
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,359
not the seeds i grew here but

1386
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,279
those products that came from the

1387
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,000
brotherhood of eternal love and those

1388
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,440
other groups from oaxaca

1389
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,920
and and thailand and india and nepal

1390
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,760
kashmir afghanistan

1391
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,440
morocco lebanon

1392
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,440
um

1393
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,559
they're they we haven't got to that

1394
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,400
magic yet we're we're

1395
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,319
and and i hate to always hate to burst

1396
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,880
people's bubbles when i talk about this

1397
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:24,000
but in in where we're at now you're in

1398
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,200
australia you said it's a little

1399
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,519
different you have more you have a

1400
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,519
better opportunity in australia i think

1401
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,318
in terms of replicating a sativa

1402
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,679
environment than we do here um in in the

1403
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:35,838
states

1404
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:38,318
but i always i tell people domestically

1405
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:43,039
here in the states we will never equal

1406
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:45,119
that equatorial sativa we can't however

1407
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,199
we're getting very close to making a

1408
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,119
great hash and i think that's what we

1409
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,439
need to be focusing on in areas like

1410
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,358
this which is what the afghans did which

1411
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,720
is what the moroccans did and the

1412
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:59,199
lebanese did for thousands of years

1413
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,519
and they have a product that when you

1414
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:03,919
smoke it and it's done right

1415
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:06,800
by the the people of sincere interest

1416
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,599
there you will see the difference i can

1417
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,760
only talk about it now i can't er

1418
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,838
you have to experience it you know it's

1419
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,839
like a psychedelic you can only talk

1420
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,920
about it so much but there is a

1421
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,400
difference and these differences i think

1422
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,440
are very subtle things

1423
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,200
um my my favorite herb was the highland

1424
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,159
oaxacan

1425
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:30,480
like i said and it i think tested out

1426
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,239
back in the day at seven percent thc

1427
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,079
which all the stuff was maxing out at

1428
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:37,598
the most potent stuff they tested in the

1429
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,440
day was maui wowie at 10

1430
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,080
um so there's something else going on

1431
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,318
there and it's in these subtle

1432
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:46,639
[Music]

1433
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:47,838
ratios of these various minor

1434
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:48,960
elements

1435
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:50,880
that we

1436
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,159
need to parse out

1437
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,838
and and and figure this out but you know

1438
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,759
hey we got our work cut out for us

1439
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,960
plenty to do there it's a wild open

1440
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,319
frontier i i find it fascinating

1441
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,720
yeah okay so

1442
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,039
do you really dabble much in the whole

1443
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,759
concentrate scene outside of hash or are

1444
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:12,400
you primarily just a hash guy

1445
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,799
oh what do you mean by that like are you

1446
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,680
into like bhos and the distillates and

1447
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,960
all that

1448
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:21,199
yeah okay yeah yeah um i think people in

1449
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,599
afghanistan and morocco were as well

1450
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:25,439
they use various solvents and pressure

1451
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,519
cookers and things for for some of their

1452
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,838
products and they have for for a long

1453
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,920
long time um

1454
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:35,599
yeah any way

1455
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,680
we can make this stuff in a pure form

1456
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,599
i know a lot of people are uptight about

1457
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,000
solvents and and various things like

1458
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,640
that but if it is done right if people

1459
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,960
pay attention to detail and you can tell

1460
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,719
by testing the finished product

1461
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,400
whether or not there's anything harmful

1462
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:51,598
in there or not

1463
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,358
um

1464
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,920
by all means

1465
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:59,440
separate out and let's start isolating i

1466
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,798
i right now the isolation of individual

1467
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,400
terpenes

1468
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:06,079
is another

1469
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,519
just fascinating subject my god and and

1470
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,640
we have here

1471
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:09,440
uh

1472
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,078
a

1473
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,318
substance that can provide so many of

1474
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,280
these on on a commercial basis if need

1475
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:19,920
be once we're left alone and can do what

1476
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,040
we want in that regard

1477
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,639
so just to loop back to flow one of the

1478
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,759
questions that got submitted by a few

1479
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:28,078
different guests and i was a bit

1480
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,319
interested in this one myself what is

1481
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,039
the exact definitional difference

1482
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:35,279
between flow and temple flow is temple

1483
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:37,679
flow just your keeper flow

1484
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,319
no it was just a name i was banning

1485
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:43,118
about at the time temple was a reference

1486
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:46,400
to nepalese temple hash

1487
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:49,280
um the flow mother the same one that

1488
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:53,599
incidentally is still alive today

1489
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,480
um she sprouted in 1991 so 20 27 years

1490
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,240
old

1491
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,838
um

1492
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:02,000
that was her appeal uh again this sativa

1493
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,400
looking plant with uh

1494
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,838
finishes in seven and a half weeks

1495
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,079
um and uh the resin from her and and her

1496
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,440
overall appeal

1497
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,760
it was

1498
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,400
in the line of uh the best smoke i've

1499
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:19,440
ever smoked was nepalese temple ball

1500
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,559
right up there followed closely by um

1501
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,559
kashmiri cheris

1502
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:28,239
followed closely by some of the afghan

1503
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:31,280
from the late 70s and early 80s

1504
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:34,000
the brotherhood afghan

1505
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,000
and those those

1506
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,119
herbs meant to be

1507
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:44,480
consumed as hash i think as concentrate

1508
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:47,920
very rare occasions for for for doing

1509
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:52,639
flour smoking flour and only

1510
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,639
sativa flour i think in that capacity

1511
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:58,400
mainly something to mix with the uh

1512
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,240
concentrate other than tobacco

1513
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,559
um

1514
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:05,039
but yeah i think it's it's uh

1515
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,440
concentrates is is what we're shooting

1516
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,920
for now the flow

1517
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,079
she just had that appeal she reminded me

1518
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,920
the most of the temple ball that's where

1519
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,720
the name temple flow uh came from uh flo

1520
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,838
also has two connotations floral and

1521
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,358
fluorescent

1522
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:25,358
um and she she possessed both

1523
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,519
characteristics fluorescent was a look

1524
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,358
to the plant and

1525
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,559
kind of in the feeling

1526
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:35,039
um that sharp

1527
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,400
sharpness that say a fluorescent bulb

1528
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:38,639
has

1529
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,599
that that type of light

1530
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,598
and floral very floral

1531
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:47,440
flowery

1532
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,440
appeal to her in her terpenes

1533
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:52,639
they're all testing most of my things

1534
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,119
test high in beta carophyllene

1535
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,519
and mercine

1536
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,358
and i have some test results somewhere

1537
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:01,280
from these latest ones

1538
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:02,880
some odd things in there

1539
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,720
i'm still

1540
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,000
parsing this out myself and learning

1541
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:07,838
about

1542
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,280
various terpenes

1543
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:11,279
terpenes too are

1544
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:16,960
when you have a pure terpene and you mix

1545
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:19,440
it with another terpene depending on the

1546
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:22,960
amount the ratio between the two

1547
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,119
terpenes you can create an entire

1548
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,838
um

1549
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:30,559
array of flavors

1550
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:32,880
the adding a little oxygen here a

1551
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,760
hydrogen there

1552
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:38,400
just changes things

1553
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,280
a lot i think they start they all start

1554
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,920
with the rose smell giranol and it's

1555
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,720
built on from there to make lemons and

1556
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,400
oranges and fruits and woods and

1557
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,239
and um

1558
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,720
again a fascinating subject

1559
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:54,639
which i think is a great place for us

1560
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,959
for human beings to begin learning about

1561
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,199
non-linear dynamic will be in these

1562
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,358
terpenes and the sense of smell

1563
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:03,919
sense of smell in the brain just is

1564
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:06,558
another is a fascinating subject it's

1565
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,200
very closely associated with memory

1566
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,119
widely dispersed throughout the central

1567
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,639
nervous system

1568
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,519
and also

1569
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:17,920
very highly associated with cannabinoid

1570
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:21,679
uh receptors

1571
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,000
yeah yeah 100 so something i've said to

1572
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:25,598
people in the past is that it's exactly

1573
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,599
what you just said with the terpenes is

1574
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,838
that terpenes at even at different

1575
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,079
concentrations can have different smells

1576
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:33,920
so like the the possible array you can

1577
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:35,839
get is almost exponential but the

1578
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,880
question i have is do you think it's

1579
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,719
possible

1580
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,720
given you know the right genetics being

1581
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:43,118
aligned and whatnot that cannabis can

1582
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,639
create any smell

1583
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,240
possibly

1584
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:48,400
i've you know i postulate i've wondered

1585
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:51,598
about this for a long time and i think

1586
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:55,920
about other species of plant that have

1587
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:57,838
as wide an array cacophony of odor as

1588
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,240
cannabis and the only other family i can

1589
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:03,279
think of is mint

1590
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:05,679
there's there's a wide variety of men

1591
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,559
and i would think that through selective

1592
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:09,759
breeding and just in my own experience i

1593
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,880
have

1594
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,040
my god

1595
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,640
and hazes you know these and i have so

1596
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,960
many hazes that i've had to put on the

1597
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,879
shelf because their commercial potential

1598
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,880
is low especially through the eras we've

1599
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,559
been through we needed the bag of peel

1600
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,920
but i have them labeled i know what they

1601
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,880
are every flavor of haze

1602
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,159
every

1603
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,200
every imaginable flavor um it's boggled

1604
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:34,000
my mind

1605
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:36,078
um there was a smell i think i referred

1606
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,599
to it either in my book or in an article

1607
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:41,680
since then i called it um

1608
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,200
ethnic holiday

1609
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,838
there was ethnic holiday and then there

1610
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,759
was funeral parlor

1611
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:50,400
both of which i mean ethnic holiday for

1612
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,839
me i came from an east european family

1613
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,000
so when i would go to say christmas the

1614
01:01:53,838 --> 01:02:00,318
smells in that household between the

1615
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:03,199
foods and the tobaccos and the colognes

1616
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:05,440
and the alcohols and the christmas tree

1617
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:06,798
and just everything going on

1618
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,240
and then the memory and it's great

1619
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:10,000
because when i start playing around with

1620
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:12,719
these herbs squeeze a button smell it

1621
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,960
yeah remember my grandma's house says oh

1622
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:18,000
ethnic holiday yeehaw

1623
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,240
funeral parlor is heavy on the lily and

1624
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,838
formaldehyde

1625
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:23,279
that's good i like that

1626
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:25,119
funeral parlor

1627
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,440
some some names just just are

1628
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,720
appropriate

1629
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,960
so

1630
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:33,358
last little step in this whole journey

1631
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,000
can you take us from flow to blueberry

1632
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,598
how did that little transition happen

1633
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,280
well it wasn't really a transition they

1634
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,318
they were parallel

1635
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,599
you know along they developed side by

1636
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:44,558
side yes

1637
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,798
um

1638
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:50,960
i have notes

1639
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:52,318
my notes are are are wretchedly um i

1640
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,039
understand them

1641
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:56,719
they were a work in progress you know i

1642
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,680
different experiments with different

1643
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:00,159
things

1644
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:02,399
initially like when i started seeing

1645
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:05,838
these things in my f2s i started

1646
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,639
labeling them i would assign each plant

1647
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,920
two

1648
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,960
capital letters that's where the fx came

1649
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,559
from

1650
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,480
um there were w w was for wide leaf b

1651
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,680
was for berry

1652
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:22,240
or blueberry um

1653
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:23,759
they had you know o for orange the

1654
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,759
things things like that a lot of them

1655
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,280
were flavors others were a structural

1656
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,760
phenomenon or how much resin they were

1657
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,079
putting out so i would take the two most

1658
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,920
prominent traits

1659
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,920
assign those two letters and that would

1660
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,720
be the label to that plan

1661
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,358
the next generation then would be two

1662
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:43,919
capital letters by two capital letters

1663
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:45,440
whatever the cross happened to be i

1664
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,119
always you know got in the habit of

1665
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,440
doing the female first in the male

1666
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,640
second just to have consistency

1667
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,639
throughout

1668
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:54,960
um and then you know when you go to the

1669
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:58,400
next generation of course you have two

1670
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,519
letters by two letters by two letters by

1671
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,160
two letters it starts getting

1672
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:04,639
complicated and so i experimented with a

1673
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:06,960
bunch of these different numeric

1674
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,000
labeling systems i have one it works for

1675
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,199
me

1676
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,400
um but i can go back in and kind of

1677
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:14,078
identify

1678
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,000
certain things i've got this will be put

1679
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,839
to the test in the not too distant

1680
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,400
future when i go back and search for

1681
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,358
certain things like a cherry variety

1682
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,760
or

1683
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:27,279
say a very sweet orange or a sweet cedar

1684
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,920
haze

1685
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,079
and and see if i can actually go back in

1686
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,720
the catalog through my notes and and

1687
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,400
find i'm pretty confident i can getting

1688
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:38,798
them to sprout growing them out the

1689
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,880
whole nine yards then

1690
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:43,440
looking forward to doing that

1691
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,798
in the not too distant

1692
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,639
i think everyone's looking forward to

1693
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,960
you doing that

1694
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:50,639
um so at this point when you had you

1695
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,880
know the flow and the blueberry running

1696
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,118
parallel you're developing them

1697
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,798
was this the point when you realized you

1698
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,318
were really onto something and did you

1699
01:04:56,798 --> 01:04:59,838
have to kind of make a choice between

1700
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,599
the two in terms of which one you want

1701
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:03,519
to put forward more or did it just work

1702
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,200
itself out like that in the end

1703
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,440
no it just worked out like that

1704
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:09,038
blueberry of course

1705
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,480
she was the one that has the most

1706
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:15,359
commercial appeal out of the two flow

1707
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,240
was almost a counterpart to blueberry

1708
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:20,480
now mind you again my primary focus is

1709
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:22,479
on satisfying my own head

1710
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,480
and through those ears through those

1711
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,719
years um

1712
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,280
the combination of smoking blueberry and

1713
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:32,000
flow to me was the closest i would get

1714
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,920
to smoking the highland oaxacan

1715
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,559
so it was a blending of those two herbs

1716
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:42,559
and just for my own satisfaction i kept

1717
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:44,400
those plants that i most enjoyed smoking

1718
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,359
and that you know just turned out to be

1719
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,559
what other people enjoyed as well i get

1720
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,038
uh you know [ __ ] how did you come up

1721
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,680
with the blueberry how did you do this i

1722
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,960
always go to this one term the term is

1723
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:56,000
healing

1724
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,159
healing

1725
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,519
blueberry it's the one that best helped

1726
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:02,798
me heal

1727
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:04,400
to feel right in my body right and over

1728
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:06,719
time um

1729
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,160
and flow did the same thing and they

1730
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:12,159
both had equal merit in my mind

1731
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,480
to be perfectly honest flow i think had

1732
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:17,038
a little bit more merit for me

1733
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,880
personally but blueberry had more

1734
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,839
commercial potential

1735
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,480
so you know that that that saved her

1736
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:26,078
place in the veg room so to speak in the

1737
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,000
in the mother room

1738
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,359
uh to keep her going and it's always

1739
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,960
been that what what do you have the

1740
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:34,719
space for and and whatnot

1741
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,960
yeah it's it's really interesting you

1742
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,239
mention that because i've you know like

1743
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,240
many people grown out a pack of

1744
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:42,078
blueberry before unfortunately i didn't

1745
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:45,519
find my keeper but what i did really

1746
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:47,359
find was that a lot of the the feeling

1747
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:49,838
of the high very much encompassed that

1748
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:51,279
healing aspect you said and i it really

1749
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:53,038
caught me off guard you know i wasn't

1750
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,720
expecting that especially of plants that

1751
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,640
finished so early and that was another

1752
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,759
thing i wanted to mention did you

1753
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,279
purposely

1754
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,920
keep that in mind because i've noticed

1755
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,760
blueberry finishes so stably early it's

1756
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,880
really yeah

1757
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:10,319
yeah it is it was intentional

1758
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:13,039
it was very utilitarian

1759
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:16,719
for the era

1760
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:19,119
if i do it over again it won't be as

1761
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:21,199
much as a factor as a matter of fact i

1762
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,200
you know i'm beginning now

1763
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:26,318
seeing the how

1764
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:28,719
commercial acceptance of auto flowers

1765
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:32,000
um and i think that there are certain

1766
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:35,038
uh subtle quality traits that may only

1767
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,079
be present in an autoflower line

1768
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,960
um

1769
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:42,720
so things like that and again that's our

1770
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,880
job to be looking for this it it it just

1771
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,279
fascinates me to no end that i can go

1772
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,358
online i go and look to other growers

1773
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,559
look to other people see what other

1774
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:51,759
people are doing

1775
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,200
when i

1776
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:57,839
released um blueberry and flow seeds um

1777
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,838
initially

1778
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,920
not so much the flow seeds the flow

1779
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:04,798
seeds came from one mother but the

1780
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,760
blueberry the uh

1781
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:07,519
blue

1782
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,839
uh blue heaven

1783
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:11,679
and the blue

1784
01:08:08,838 --> 01:08:13,679
moonshine initially those seeds that i'd

1785
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:16,880
sent to europe and that i

1786
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:20,960
and had gone to mark emery

1787
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:23,199
um had several mothers and several

1788
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,679
different male contributors they weren't

1789
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:28,719
from a single line there was variance in

1790
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:30,560
there i did that intentionally now the

1791
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,719
finished product was going to be

1792
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,880
blueberry or blue moonshine but some

1793
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:37,600
leaned more sativa some leaned more

1794
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:41,119
indica what i wanted to see

1795
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:45,039
was to utilize the grow reports from the

1796
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:48,238
community before it was in 1998 then

1797
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:51,920
that i decided on a stretch indica

1798
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:54,718
a female and that f4 blueberry dad and

1799
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,039
that was by you know again the the

1800
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,039
number of responses that that people

1801
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,759
were posting online in terms of oh this

1802
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:04,079
is what you know what i prefer had my my

1803
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,479
best luck here but there was a lot of

1804
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:08,158
variance in those seeds i think that

1805
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:11,439
might have something to do with this

1806
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:14,719
phenomenon when you hear pre-98

1807
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,599
pre-98 this p98 that is

1808
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,000
i

1809
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,838
released a wide variance of genetics up

1810
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,319
to

1811
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:25,039
and then beginning in 98 it was one

1812
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,798
mother one father and since that time

1813
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:29,119
it's been one mother and one father of

1814
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:31,439
blueberry for my stables now as far as

1815
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:33,519
what other people dutch passion soccer

1816
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:36,000
mother whomever is doing with blueberry

1817
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,440
i have no idea i'm not involved with

1818
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,640
those at all

1819
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:41,039
um

1820
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,079
so who knows it's it's anybody's guess

1821
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:44,079
there

1822
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:46,719
wow so many avenues in which we could

1823
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:48,479
jump into from there yeah yeah there's a

1824
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,759
lot of information

1825
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,358
all right i'll try to not miss them all

1826
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,279
let's go to the first one what i've

1827
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,880
noticed is some of these lines you

1828
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,000
referenced you know the blue moonshine

1829
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,760
blue haven these more variant lines

1830
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,439
some of them to me seems like they've

1831
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,400
amassed the biggest cult following of

1832
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:04,719
them all

1833
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:07,119
do you ever notice that and do you ever

1834
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,800
kind of get pressured to bow into it and

1835
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:11,519
maybe re-release them yourself or it's

1836
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,279
just not on your horizon so to speak

1837
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,040
yeah yeah and and i could i do have

1838
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:16,880
another version of blue moonshine right

1839
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:19,279
now i have this blue heaven going she

1840
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,119
completely satisfies that i need to

1841
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:24,000
smoke the offspring i haven't tested her

1842
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,238
fully yet the seed might qualify to be

1843
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,800
called blue heaven if it smokes you know

1844
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:30,718
the the bud from that seed smoke such i

1845
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,800
haven't been able to test it yet uh it

1846
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:35,279
has the smell it has the appeal and i

1847
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:38,480
like the name newberry so i might just

1848
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:40,000
go that route um but

1849
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,399
they again

1850
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,960
space and time and as it presents itself

1851
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:45,839
and as we're able to lock some of these

1852
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,439
in

1853
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,480
um yes by all means and i have copies of

1854
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:52,639
everything

1855
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:54,319
absolutely everything i've ever released

1856
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,840
and the parent stock and the parent

1857
01:10:54,319 --> 01:11:00,479
stock to that and so all the way back to

1858
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:03,440
the p1s i'm been holding off

1859
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:05,839
specifically a number of reasons

1860
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:08,158
the main one being that the industry in

1861
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,600
my opinion right now is just far too

1862
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:12,879
unstable

1863
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:16,000
it's you know the the the moneyed

1864
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,800
interests are playing their hand right

1865
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,600
now

1866
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,560
that adds a lot of confusion

1867
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,800
their

1868
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,560
things you the price just the price of

1869
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,480
of of the herb what it ends up being

1870
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,760
these things run through

1871
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:34,718
all sorts of cycles and phases and so

1872
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:36,719
i'm kind of sitting that out until

1873
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:39,039
in essence you know what will happen in

1874
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,640
the future is a lot of these grow spaces

1875
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:42,560
and all their equipment are going to

1876
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,560
become available from some of these

1877
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,000
companies that go bankrupt pennies on

1878
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,520
the dollar

1879
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,119
and so i'm just waiting for a nice

1880
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,880
little space to show itself you don't

1881
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:52,719
want to do this in the midst of the

1882
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,719
legalization frenzy

1883
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,359
you can when things go up to you know

1884
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:59,279
hundreds of dollars a square foot for

1885
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,198
warehouse space that used to go for

1886
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:02,960
pennies a square foot because people are

1887
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:04,879
trying to capitalize on this it's

1888
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,600
impossible to work

1889
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,400
in that environment and then the legal

1890
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,800
you know

1891
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,719
situation that once

1892
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,480
i get established somewhere how do i

1893
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,760
protect myself

1894
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:18,079
how do i

1895
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,360
you know these things are remain to be

1896
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:21,679
seen

1897
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:24,880
uh once that happens though i'm looking

1898
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,960
forward i i put out this uh

1899
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,199
thing i just sort of wrote it not too

1900
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,800
long ago i just shared it among

1901
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:32,479
certain few people had to do with a

1902
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,239
gofundme

1903
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:36,718
and it was raising a bunch of money to

1904
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:38,718
do a gofundme for me too

1905
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,198
grow out i had a bunch of i was going to

1906
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:43,119
do everything under one of them

1907
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:45,599
all the way back to my p1's but then i'd

1908
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:47,519
whittle that down so no just f4s and f5s

1909
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,679
everything i've released absolutely

1910
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,719
everything i have released

1911
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,158
you know including the parent stock um

1912
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,079
all the way back

1913
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:57,679
and grow it all out it would be a few

1914
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:00,000
thousand plants

1915
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,640
and then do an open pollination every

1916
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,800
male every female in there just boom

1917
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,199
um hit them all up make a few million

1918
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,800
seeds sell them for two bucks a piece to

1919
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:09,919
the people that invested in the gold

1920
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,199
fund me

1921
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,760
and then give people the opportunity to

1922
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:18,319
you know you we would have verification

1923
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,079
you got these genetics from this here's

1924
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:22,719
all my notes going all the way back we

1925
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:26,640
can verify these genetics and then we

1926
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:28,399
establish sort of like an akc for dogs

1927
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,360
for pedigree

1928
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:34,960
for establishing standards for lines all

1929
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:36,960
these types of things but also to allow

1930
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,600
the community access to all these

1931
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,439
genetics i have on an equal basis when i

1932
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,360
planned it out it was like you couldn't

1933
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:46,559
invest more than four percent of

1934
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:49,439
whatever the gofundme would be you can

1935
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,199
only buy as much seed as you invested in

1936
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:53,359
you can either trade in your investment

1937
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,599
or keep your investments stable and

1938
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:57,439
purchase the seed at two dollars a piece

1939
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,000
in doing so just the

1940
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:01,279
the production of the seed would fund

1941
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,119
the entire

1942
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:06,559
operation

1943
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,880
um and it would take maybe two years

1944
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,880
uh three at the most we wanna really be

1945
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,840
thorough it'd be three years guaranteed

1946
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,279
to be able to make enough seed to

1947
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,079
satisfy you know the world market on

1948
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:18,079
this

1949
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:21,279
um and then

1950
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,800
go to one of these failing uh grow-ops

1951
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,639
and say well here let us lease your

1952
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,079
space for a couple hundred thousand

1953
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,920
dollars a year

1954
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:30,238
instead of having to go in and invest

1955
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,319
millions of dollars buying something and

1956
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:35,279
i just that's kind of lining up i see it

1957
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:37,279
happening uh just i'm waiting it's just

1958
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:39,840
waiting

1959
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:41,359
no i agree it seems like

1960
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,679
some of the people who jump in too early

1961
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,399
get punished especially financially

1962
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,920
so

1963
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:50,559
just to clarify uh the blue heaven line

1964
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,319
that is essentially just like a very

1965
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,320
anti-anxiety

1966
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,359
phenotype of the blueberry

1967
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:56,960
correct

1968
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:59,119
correct fantastic yeah because i think

1969
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,560
that's that's the one which from what

1970
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:02,559
i've been able to research has the

1971
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,320
biggest kind of following and push for

1972
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,239
it to come back because i think as you'd

1973
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,960
be aware already people think of

1974
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:10,799
blueberry as a very anti-anxiety line so

1975
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,158
to have what you would consider to be

1976
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,000
you know the pinnacle of that it's just

1977
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:15,759
kind of the next level right

1978
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,760
yep exactly

1979
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,880
exactly and it's subtle that's the thing

1980
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,960
about it there are subtleties i i i like

1981
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,199
to the analogy i like to use with the

1982
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,359
cannabis industry where it's at right

1983
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:29,198
now is it's like cooking

1984
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:31,519
and it's like chefs

1985
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:32,719
and all of our contemporary breeders of

1986
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,080
today

1987
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:39,198
are like chefs who have just discovered

1988
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:41,439
the spice rack right and then what is

1989
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,439
the include oh put a bunch of this in

1990
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:46,079
and put a bunch of this in and they get

1991
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:47,359
all of these again cacophonies of things

1992
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:49,679
together

1993
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:53,198
and what i found in my experience is

1994
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:56,399
that when we then isolate those uh

1995
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:58,719
special flavors and and again the ratio

1996
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:00,000
to other flavors is what makes a true

1997
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,079
delicacy

1998
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,600
in that analogy

1999
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,640
yes i agree

2000
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,880
certainly sometimes less is more as well

2001
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,960
so just to loop back on what you

2002
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,359
mentioned a minute ago you said you're

2003
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,520
not too sure what uh dutch passion or

2004
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:18,238
saga martha doing with the blueberry we

2005
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:20,000
did get some inquiry what was you know

2006
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:22,158
without going into any details you don't

2007
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,679
want to what was the situation with

2008
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:25,679
dutch passion because obviously they

2009
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,000
released some of your lines for a while

2010
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,920
and then that kind of split what's kind

2011
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,079
of your recount of generally what

2012
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,840
happened there

2013
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:35,519
yeah

2014
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,800
um i can't

2015
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,719
i don't know i guess i could say they

2016
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,520
ripped me off but not really because he

2017
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,800
paid me the minimum amount i i think he

2018
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,679
could have

2019
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,320
i was again due to political

2020
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,239
uh

2021
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:52,079
circumstances i was under a barrel there

2022
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,359
was nothing i could do

2023
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:56,319
um

2024
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:59,359
i had to take whatever i could get

2025
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:01,599
uh i had just left sagar mada who

2026
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:03,359
didn't really that he

2027
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,640
i got ripped off by sagramatha that i

2028
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,960
can say

2029
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:09,520
very very plainly and clearly

2030
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,359
um i did get my seed collection back

2031
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,120
took that over to dutch passion had a

2032
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:14,960
deal going with them

2033
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:16,880
uh which should have gone on in

2034
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,239
perpetuity

2035
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,119
uh forever

2036
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:23,839
but uh hank being a dutch businessman he

2037
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:25,359
is just decided one day that oh you know

2038
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,039
let's not don't take this personally

2039
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:29,279
it's only business but i don't feel i

2040
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:31,119
should have to pay you any more

2041
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,279
and and you know

2042
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:35,359
gave me uh we spread it out it was a

2043
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:37,198
kind of a large payment the deal i had i

2044
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,119
don't mind sharing this it was i think

2045
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:40,799
30 cents a seed

2046
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:45,119
i was getting a euro on but he was

2047
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:47,039
producing 100 000 seeds a year so

2048
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,640
from my perspective that's kind of what

2049
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:50,479
i want i set up a few of those in

2050
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,400
different places and then i'm i'm all

2051
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:55,198
set but that has to go on

2052
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:57,439
for a while i did visit some lawyers in

2053
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:00,158
amsterdam at the time and they all just

2054
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:02,079
gave me the shrug shoulder and sorry

2055
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:05,679
you're a little too early for this and

2056
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:05,679
there's nothing we can do for you

2057
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:10,238
and i know

2058
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,119
that hank has made a considerable amount

2059
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:14,559
of money

2060
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:15,920
i maybe 60 000 euros is what i got

2061
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,600
totally

2062
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,960
uh from the whole

2063
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,760
whole deal

2064
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,198
over the course of what uh seven eight

2065
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,840
years

2066
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:28,238
um no not even that

2067
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:30,640
long and and

2068
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:33,119
the main thing i wanted when i left what

2069
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,119
was important me see hank was uh

2070
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:37,359
registering the names of blueberry with

2071
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:40,880
the benelux market bureau

2072
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:42,319
and that's where he needed my help

2073
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,840
proving this was my intellectual

2074
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:46,639
property and i have all of this

2075
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,640
paperwork i have every letter so a push

2076
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,199
ever comes to shove i mean i've got all

2077
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:53,440
this evidence here to go but litigation

2078
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,559
to me is it's a big waste of

2079
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,439
energy

2080
01:18:54,560 --> 01:19:00,800
you know to avoid it as much as possible

2081
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:02,238
um but he wanted this because of uh

2082
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,679
sagramatha

2083
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:05,039
at the time when he was registering

2084
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:08,239
blueberry

2085
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:10,238
you know the benelux market viewers

2086
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:12,158
solicits anyone that's using that

2087
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:14,718
trademark and says oh is this okay

2088
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:16,399
tony's lawyer said no hank wrote to me

2089
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,520
says hey send me all the information

2090
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:19,519
you've got proving this is your

2091
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,560
intellectual property it's a stack of

2092
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,159
papers that are almost an inch thick um

2093
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,440
hank gets that a few months later i get

2094
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:27,599
an email oh

2095
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,000
excellent my attorney says with the

2096
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,560
information you said that this is proof

2097
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,800
positive and we have 999 to one chance

2098
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,719
of winning the case

2099
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:40,159
that information got submitted to tony's

2100
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:42,239
lawyer at sacramento who then quit

2101
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:45,039
on tony because i think it was apparent

2102
01:19:42,238 --> 01:19:46,479
in in that paperwork that no buddy this

2103
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:47,600
isn't yours

2104
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:51,359
um

2105
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:53,199
and so when i then left dutch passion my

2106
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:54,880
primary concern was well hank will

2107
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:56,960
getting my seed collection back which i

2108
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,920
did and number two

2109
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,840
to have the rights to those names in the

2110
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,039
european market and i have that in

2111
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,880
writing

2112
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:07,198
so

2113
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:10,480
you know i i got with the important

2114
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:11,439
thing i i to me the losses

2115
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:13,599
are

2116
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,759
nowhere near as important as staying

2117
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:19,039
focused on what's in the future because

2118
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,360
that's by far more valuable yeah

2119
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:23,198
and so i guess the the one kind of

2120
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:24,158
question i have remaining on that topic

2121
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:26,479
is

2122
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,799
a lot of people will commonly say that

2123
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:31,198
over the years it's common for dutch

2124
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,279
companies to lose parents and to not

2125
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:35,198
even say anything and still offer seeds

2126
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,719
and quality deteriorates

2127
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:38,079
do you think that a similar thing may

2128
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,920
have occurred with the stuff they're

2129
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:41,119
offering you know in the blueberry lines

2130
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,119
and whatnot

2131
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:46,079
yeah i'm almost positive i don't have

2132
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:47,760
firsthand knowledge but i did hear from

2133
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:49,439
a number of people i've connected well

2134
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,960
enough in the community there people

2135
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:52,719
that did work for

2136
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,359
uh growing in in some of these

2137
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:57,119
communities i like dutch passion i think

2138
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,960
was uh

2139
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:00,960
contracting soma

2140
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,439
to grow some of their things and and

2141
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:06,000
various other people in in that

2142
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:08,879
amsterdam grow scene but yes they lose

2143
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,399
their things all the time um and then

2144
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,920
just try to replicate them i think with

2145
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:15,119
mine they probably just bought a pack of

2146
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,880
seeds and took it from there but i don't

2147
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:18,158
have first-hand uh

2148
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,199
knowledge

2149
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:20,960
okay

2150
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,599
so just as a little change of scenery i

2151
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,560
wanted to ask you do you really keep

2152
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,480
track on any of the strains that are

2153
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,400
made with blueberry that start to gain a

2154
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:32,158
lot of traction and do you view that as

2155
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:33,759
like just a positive thing for blueberry

2156
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:36,000
like so i guess the two poster childs

2157
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,199
would be blue dream for one obviously

2158
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,119
and you know you kind of addressed that

2159
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:40,799
with your version of it but the other

2160
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:42,719
one for me a personal note my favorite

2161
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,800
strain is the blue magoo and i don't

2162
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,158
know if you really know much about that

2163
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,840
but there's actually a bit of a rumor

2164
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:50,238
that you made that i don't think it's

2165
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:52,159
true but i'd love to hear you know your

2166
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,678
kind of thoughts on how do you view the

2167
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,759
strains that you know like kind of half

2168
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:58,158
blueberry and really take off and do you

2169
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,600
follow that at all

2170
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:01,039
no

2171
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,760
you know

2172
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:07,039
it's like a car wreck when you go by you

2173
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,039
got to kind of look at it

2174
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,039
as as far as the the blue magoo in

2175
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,120
particular i don't know about that one

2176
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:15,279
blue dream

2177
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:18,719
it's great hype

2178
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:21,439
you know i mean it that doesn't hurt

2179
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:24,158
um at all i can i tried replicating the

2180
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:26,399
blue dream with as your haze it was a

2181
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:28,879
kind of the same cross but

2182
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,000
so much of this is based on hype

2183
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,960
right

2184
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,679
something new comes along it catches

2185
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,719
people's fancy and and for whatever

2186
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,920
reason

2187
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:42,158
it has that that marketing aspect to it

2188
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,520
that people just glom onto

2189
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:44,960
um

2190
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,960
blue dream

2191
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,840
the name you know

2192
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:52,639
the name game is is so

2193
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:55,039
prevalent in in the industry

2194
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:58,000
i'd hope that we would be able to

2195
01:22:55,039 --> 01:23:00,639
progress beyond that uh keep it as sort

2196
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,039
of a uh you know a

2197
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,480
fun little entertainment

2198
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:07,039
thing but

2199
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:08,799
yeah i think that's that's uh uh a lot

2200
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:10,960
of what going on now i did not

2201
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:13,199
if i did make the blue magoo it's

2202
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,800
without my knowledge uh someone else

2203
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:17,119
came up with a show one time i was

2204
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:20,560
selling clones out of a place in san

2205
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:22,079
francisco cmh or something see i don't

2206
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,960
remember the name of it they had a giant

2207
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,960
buddha statue in their lobby they ended

2208
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,520
up closing early

2209
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,119
um one of the nicer scenes too it had

2210
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,880
on-site consumption and it was right

2211
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:34,880
there in the city and they were selling

2212
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,560
clones and a bunch of them uh they they

2213
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,239
closed then and and that went on their

2214
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,719
way i never heard from anyone until one

2215
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:42,238
day i met a show it was an emerald cup

2216
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:44,079
and a fella comes up and says you know i

2217
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:45,759
worked there and i worked in their clone

2218
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:47,679
room and i just want you to know that

2219
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,119
they took that blueberry and they

2220
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,560
crossed it i forgot what the heck they

2221
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:51,840
said they crossed it with and i forget

2222
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,080
what he said it made but it was

2223
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,920
something like bubba kush or

2224
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:59,439
or big kush or

2225
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,279
one of the big name brand strains

2226
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:03,198
again

2227
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:06,319
think grateful dead

2228
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:07,359
grateful dead family

2229
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,238
to me

2230
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:12,559
it's it's a minor incidental

2231
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:14,559
having this competition out there

2232
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,520
compared to

2233
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:20,239
the prize that yet awaits

2234
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,520
um so that's what i'm going to focus on

2235
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:23,359
now

2236
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,679
um what we're talking about is

2237
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:27,920
intellectual property rights

2238
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,760
right and and you know there's a lot of

2239
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,279
law that's already established in that

2240
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,600
regard

2241
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:36,800
i just the same thing for me is as it is

2242
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,840
for tomatoes would be great

2243
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:42,960
i'm concerned as we all should be about

2244
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,480
major conglomerates you know

2245
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,520
people with a little too much control

2246
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,678
and influence trying to take over this

2247
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,800
one of my biggest concerns moving

2248
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:52,880
forward

2249
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:55,600
has been for a while now that i'm going

2250
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:58,079
to be doing my work in a legal uh

2251
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:01,679
environment and to someday get a cease

2252
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:05,359
and desist order from you know a

2253
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:06,960
major corporation and i you know just so

2254
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:09,839
your listeners know it used to be

2255
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:12,158
monsanto now it's bears it's just you

2256
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,520
know for for reference sake in those

2257
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:15,519
regards but there are other other

2258
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:18,880
corporations doing this as well people

2259
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:22,000
within the cannabis industry so you know

2260
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:25,840
how do i best go about protecting myself

2261
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,479
in this and and and i'm i'm open to uh

2262
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:30,719
many possibilities so we'll we'll see

2263
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:33,198
where that goes

2264
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:37,520
yeah well one possible solution to that

2265
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:39,279
problem i've heard is that if people get

2266
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,920
basically their work within the public

2267
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:44,479
domain it can restrict the ability for

2268
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,319
people to patent copyright those things

2269
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:48,479
and specifically i think we've heard

2270
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:50,960
that phylos is one avenue in which this

2271
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,479
can happen do you know much about phylos

2272
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,800
and would you consider doing that if it

2273
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:59,039
was the case yes i do i've met them a

2274
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,760
while ago i think when they were

2275
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:03,600
getting going mowgli and sham

2276
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,960
nissan

2277
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,480
and

2278
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,880
i i

2279
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,919
years ago this was presented to me at

2280
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:14,159
hempfest in seattle by mowgli that

2281
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,520
his intent was to do what he was calling

2282
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:18,079
an open

2283
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,560
cannabis project it's like an open

2284
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:23,519
source software thing but applied to

2285
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:25,760
cannabis genetics which i wholeheartedly

2286
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,760
agree with and i think is probably the

2287
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,920
best way to go if things have been

2288
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,560
released commercially they are out there

2289
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,880
how best to deal with this i think is to

2290
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,000
make this public domain and in that

2291
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,840
capacity that protects me i think you

2292
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,639
know from getting that cease and desist

2293
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,440
letter

2294
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:46,079
at least one one way in which to do that

2295
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:48,319
now as far as where philos is right now

2296
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:51,279
i know they're providing the service as

2297
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:54,960
our other companies where you can have

2298
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:57,119
your genetics identified and then you

2299
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,399
know associated with your name or

2300
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:00,559
company

2301
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:03,839
that at least gives you some legal

2302
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:06,800
uh foothold in in this this whole thing

2303
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:08,719
as it unfolds but i i really i don't

2304
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,600
know where these companies are now for

2305
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:15,279
example um philos was supposed to be

2306
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:17,199
doing the cannabis genome project

2307
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:19,198
which they're not anymore and i don't

2308
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:21,599
know why i don't know why this went to a

2309
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:23,519
company in colorado once i start getting

2310
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,039
some answers to this you know it'll

2311
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,639
it'll become

2312
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:29,279
more clear

2313
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:31,199
in the meantime i do trust what they're

2314
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:33,119
doing i i do

2315
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:36,559
agree with this open

2316
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:39,519
cannabis project um there's a woman her

2317
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,400
name is is beth i was on a panel with

2318
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,719
her

2319
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:44,799
at hempfest i meant to have her card and

2320
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:47,119
contact information she's actually doing

2321
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:49,039
this right now this this open

2322
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:51,920
uh cannabis

2323
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:54,000
project i can find that information

2324
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:59,119
and and send it to you

2325
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:02,238
uh but she is uh being in earnest um

2326
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:04,079
attempting to make this a reality so

2327
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:05,519
hopefully you know

2328
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:08,000
with with

2329
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,320
agreeance people like myself

2330
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:15,479
we could we can make that happen and

2331
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:15,479
then move move forward from that point

2332
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,760
yep yep

2333
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,920
so just to jump off the whole legal

2334
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,079
downer one of the questions i wanted to

2335
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,840
ask you is in your opinion what

2336
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:31,920
differentiates flow from

2337
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:34,319
f13 oh yeah f13 was from the floral line

2338
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,079
the flow line

2339
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:39,439
and f13

2340
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:41,359
was simply the label of that plant i was

2341
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:43,519
doing we were down to the final

2342
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:45,198
selections i had 12 jars i was up in

2343
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,440
vancouver bc they brought them over to

2344
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:49,839
me and i'm going through those jars and

2345
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:52,238
that one that was f13 every time i went

2346
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:54,800
to said oh my hello

2347
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:59,599
she had an immediate very very immediate

2348
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:01,279
effect with the long-term uh onset uh

2349
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,039
and it was just special see i could tell

2350
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:04,880
right away you're a

2351
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:07,519
you're a party

2352
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,719
um waiting to happen um and i looked at

2353
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,520
so we're gonna call this and i looked at

2354
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:14,639
the label it said f13 i see f nice

2355
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:18,320
letter 13 nice number why not and that's

2356
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:22,000
what what got its label so it is a more

2357
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:24,799
uh direct relative to flow and i can see

2358
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:28,719
how it's it's more psychedelic i love

2359
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:31,279
the uh description jason king gave f13

2360
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:33,840
out of the compliment jason king gave

2361
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:36,800
f13 when he said smoking f-13 is like

2362
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,600
smoking a grateful dead show

2363
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,840
so

2364
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:42,000
i mean that that in terms of psychedelia

2365
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,920
that's a pretty high compliment and it's

2366
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,399
it's what it does though it's like flow

2367
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:49,119
flow is motivational and focused whereas

2368
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:50,399
f13 is more psychedelic

2369
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:53,599
focused

2370
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:55,839
yeah wow and so this is kind of maybe a

2371
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,760
bit of an odd question but

2372
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,279
do you like flow more than blueberry

2373
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,199
because what's weird is when i talk to

2374
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:03,198
people about this especially like the

2375
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:05,198
big name breeder friends i talk to all

2376
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:07,198
of them have this real memorable story

2377
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:09,678
about smoking flow and they're like oh

2378
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:10,879
there's something about flow you know do

2379
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:12,480
you think it's like a little bit of the

2380
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,279
unsung hero

2381
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:17,198
it is it is and she

2382
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:19,439
you know she doesn't have a lot of bag

2383
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:20,799
appeal she's got a bit more of that

2384
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:25,359
musky

2385
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:27,840
uh temple ball hashy f uh aroma to her

2386
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:29,839
she is nowhere near couch locked so

2387
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,600
couch like people that smokers what is

2388
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,000
this [ __ ] get it away from me they they

2389
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,679
don't understand i can't enter her in

2390
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,238
cups because she's got one of the

2391
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:40,560
slowest come ons it's 45 minutes to an

2392
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,399
hour before you're fully

2393
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,639
you know appreciating what this herb

2394
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:45,839
does and it has a four to five hour

2395
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,760
effect

2396
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,520
and in terms of you know yeah i'm

2397
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,960
trapped on a desert island i gotta pick

2398
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,040
one strain and smoke for the rest of my

2399
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,520
life it would probably be flow over

2400
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,719
blueberry i think so

2401
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,719
there you go

2402
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:00,639
so one question we had sent in by our

2403
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,158
good friend mass medical strains he said

2404
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,319
you know he actually in one of the

2405
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:06,079
previous interviews he recounted his

2406
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:07,359
little awesome story with flo from when

2407
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,000
he was younger he said it was really

2408
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:11,920
impactful but he's packed a few pops of

2409
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,679
flow and he said basically he's had

2410
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,600
trouble finding the keeper he's looking

2411
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,359
for and he wanted to know do you think

2412
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,960
it's a little bit of a harder plant to

2413
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:20,319
wrangle indoors does it do a bit better

2414
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,800
outdoors or do you think he should be

2415
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:24,880
able to do a ride indoors with it

2416
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:26,719
that's a good question um i know she

2417
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,039
likes outdoors

2418
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:32,560
she likes to trail along you can bend

2419
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:35,359
her god 20 30 feet sometimes she'll vine

2420
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,679
along put out side branches too that you

2421
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:38,559
can uh put wherever you like

2422
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,319
um

2423
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:42,000
and it it kind of depends on what people

2424
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:46,399
are looking for too you have to realize

2425
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,920
she's those seeds are the flow my flow

2426
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:50,399
clone is the mother and it's the

2427
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:53,440
blueberry that's the father so you're

2428
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:54,799
seeing a bit of blueberry influence in

2429
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:58,479
that seed line

2430
01:31:54,800 --> 01:32:01,279
the i will say this both the f4 flow and

2431
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:03,839
the f4 blueberry mother cuts are

2432
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:06,399
available they are out commercially

2433
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:08,159
available i've been trying to establish

2434
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:10,238
some place that i could tell you to go

2435
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:12,638
and get them but that hasn't happened

2436
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:14,479
yet they kind of floated out you know

2437
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:16,000
and it sometimes a place succeeds

2438
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:18,319
sometimes it doesn't

2439
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,039
uh but they are out there i'll say that

2440
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:22,399
much i do know jd has some in eugene

2441
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,198
there's some in both southern and

2442
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:28,399
northern california right now as well

2443
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:30,479
and once they are well established where

2444
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:32,319
they're at i believe they will be

2445
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:34,238
commercially available and i can send

2446
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:35,439
you somewhere to get them but they are

2447
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:37,759
the f4

2448
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:39,599
mother flow and blueberry and the reason

2449
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,119
i did that you know people said we're

2450
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,199
amazed why'd you release your mother's

2451
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:45,359
stock oh my god i said well there's been

2452
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:46,960
enough seeds that the good

2453
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:48,880
representation of her should be out

2454
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:51,039
there somewhere to begin with but mainly

2455
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,560
this is the main thing i want people to

2456
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:56,158
know what my

2457
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:58,159
version my idea of blueberry and flo are

2458
01:32:56,158 --> 01:32:59,599
and the best way to do that is through

2459
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:01,679
their mother plant

2460
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,920
and then here you go and they've they've

2461
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:06,239
held you know flo even though she's 27

2462
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:10,399
years old um

2463
01:33:06,238 --> 01:33:12,079
98 so what 20 years for the uh blueberry

2464
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:13,279
mother and father and hasn't lost

2465
01:33:12,079 --> 01:33:15,519
anything

2466
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:17,439
in that time

2467
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,520
you just sprung a good question to mine

2468
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:21,479
for me in that time you know they're

2469
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,520
very old cuts have you noticed any

2470
01:33:21,479 --> 01:33:25,359
deterioration at all you know people

2471
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,800
sometimes reference genetic drift do you

2472
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:29,519
believe in that

2473
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:33,679
um it might exist um and if it does it

2474
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:36,000
doesn't for these two uh 20 years on now

2475
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:38,880
they're not the same mother in the same

2476
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,039
pot and i do have a rejuvenation method

2477
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,560
i like to uh

2478
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:44,479
suggest to people

2479
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,239
recommend and that's taking you know

2480
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:48,959
mother i've been working with all winter

2481
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:51,279
and taking her in april may whenever you

2482
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,760
can get her outside take her outside

2483
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:55,920
dump her out of the pot cut those roots

2484
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,360
right off take anything that is not a

2485
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,840
bright white root even when you're

2486
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:02,559
transplanting small things anything

2487
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,319
that's wrapped tight or discolored pull

2488
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,280
right off the plant will love you for it

2489
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,719
she will immediately put out new roots

2490
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:10,800
and then you put that plant in the

2491
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:13,359
ground april may

2492
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:15,360
she rejuvenates comes back through one

2493
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:17,198
leaflet three leaflets five leaflets

2494
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:20,238
seven nine however many she's supposed

2495
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:22,719
to have uh late july

2496
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:24,399
early august take that cut take a bunch

2497
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:26,319
of cuts off of her and that's your

2498
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:29,198
mother plant through

2499
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:31,519
uh the winter again and then that's that

2500
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:33,599
that tends to rejuvenate

2501
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,840
bring these back i've also heard that

2502
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:38,480
tissue culturing

2503
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:41,520
numerous times where you re-culture the

2504
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:44,638
culture like 13 times is supposed to

2505
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:47,199
bring a plant back to an absolute state

2506
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,960
of health and vigor

2507
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:51,039
so a common theme that i've noticed

2508
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,760
within your breeding work is that you

2509
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:55,840
tend to do inbreeding within your own

2510
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,159
lines mixing them together as opposed to

2511
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,000
bringing in external things especially

2512
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:01,118
bringing in say like hype of the month

2513
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,520
strains

2514
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:05,198
do you ever consider bringing in more

2515
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,719
external things or are you just more

2516
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:08,158
content to work within your own

2517
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:10,639
creations

2518
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:11,519
yeah i have

2519
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:13,279
more

2520
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:15,440
in my library than i'm going to be able

2521
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:16,639
to get to in my lifetime

2522
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:18,879
um

2523
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:21,199
four 500

2524
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:23,840
different varieties i have maybe a

2525
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:25,118
hundred things that i've never sprouted

2526
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,880
yet

2527
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:30,559
again a big enough space with time

2528
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,000
that that can happen

2529
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,960
pretty quickly

2530
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,679
one thing that's been happening for me

2531
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:39,679
is i've been acquiring some land race

2532
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:41,840
genetics

2533
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,600
i've only sprouted one out to kind of

2534
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,000
test their authenticity and they're

2535
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:48,639
they're definitely unique and real

2536
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,560
uh character a person that i met

2537
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:52,319
um

2538
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,480
and it's it's kind of a funny story i

2539
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:56,880
met him in michigan at the high times

2540
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:59,359
cup he came up i have some seeds i have

2541
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:01,520
some seeds from cashmere and from and he

2542
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:03,359
showed them to me and i looked at the

2543
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:06,800
seeds and i was

2544
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:08,719
stunned and impressed i recognized them

2545
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,800
and i go oh

2546
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:11,679
these are quite very tiny they were tiny

2547
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:15,360
dark

2548
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:17,279
uh solid color no striping

2549
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,439
um and various there were a couple he

2550
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:21,759
had four like different things uh i gave

2551
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:23,678
him like 400 for those

2552
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,520
but we established a rapport and i've

2553
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,600
been seeing him at various shows and

2554
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,199
he's been giving me a number of

2555
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:33,199
different things i have

2556
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:36,799
maybe 50 different land races now from

2557
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:38,960
way back in india nepal thailand south

2558
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,000
america africa

2559
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,920
um

2560
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,920
just a lot of places i think he even has

2561
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:47,520
some things from australia indonesia

2562
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,600
and they're all different they're all

2563
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:52,239
some of the seeds are huge some of them

2564
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:54,480
are tiny

2565
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:56,479
i sprouted out some turkish

2566
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,638
i didn't grow them long enough

2567
01:36:56,479 --> 01:37:00,638
i was in an r d project had to take them

2568
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:03,359
down in eight weeks they probably should

2569
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:05,679
have gone 12. pass some on though to

2570
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,599
some friends who are growing those out

2571
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:10,639
uh interesting

2572
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:13,760
aroma i gave it i called it um

2573
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:15,440
new running shoes and cologne

2574
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,159
it kind of smelled like so you know

2575
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:20,638
unique things going on there

2576
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:22,238
i'm looking forward to sprouting those

2577
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:25,600
out um

2578
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:29,359
and then kind of redoing i would also

2579
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,360
really like i have a bunch of my f1s

2580
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:32,880
now i've never frozen them

2581
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:35,118
um

2582
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,719
never refrigerated either i've just kept

2583
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:38,559
them in a dark place

2584
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,319
on occasion

2585
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,000
in the past i've gotten them to pop and

2586
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:44,399
put a tail out but that's as far as they

2587
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,238
went they'd succumb to mold or mildew i

2588
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:47,679
did not have the time or space to deal

2589
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:48,559
with them but i have a couple hundred of

2590
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:50,960
them

2591
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,520
and if i can just get a small handful of

2592
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,719
those to sprout

2593
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,840
which i'm sure

2594
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:59,520
given modern technology will we can we

2595
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,239
can pull off

2596
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:05,440
all i need is a male and a female and i

2597
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:08,959
can do the whole thing all over again

2598
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:11,198
from scratch only this time knowing full

2599
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:13,039
well what i'm what i'm looking for and

2600
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:15,359
isolating

2601
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:17,439
in in those ways in an environment

2602
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:18,639
that's number one big enough and safe

2603
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:22,158
enough

2604
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:24,400
um to to to do this so that's what i

2605
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:26,960
would like to do but as far as any work

2606
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:29,920
hybridized work no

2607
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:34,239
last time i did anybody else's hybrid

2608
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:36,079
work was back in uh good god the 80s

2609
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:37,599
and i regretted it every time i said why

2610
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:40,000
did i do this

2611
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,320
no i've got other things i need to focus

2612
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
on and

2613
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:45,359
again people fall in love with plants

2614
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,639
structure of the plant they like them to

2615
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:48,238
get big

2616
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:50,079
they like colors

2617
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:52,718
flavors but but

2618
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:54,960
that finished product how does it smoke

2619
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,920
how does it smoke and and that that

2620
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,039
takes

2621
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,840
some some effort and some focus

2622
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:01,760
so

2623
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,760
just to touch on the land races for a

2624
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,600
moment if you did

2625
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,440
say pop through them and you had a good

2626
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,520
germination rate which would be the one

2627
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:12,238
you'd be most wanting to work with first

2628
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:13,920
if you could only pick one

2629
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:16,799
again you know

2630
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:19,118
that would present itself

2631
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,600
with its with its smoke with the flower

2632
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:23,359
the concentrate or the finished product

2633
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,119
how does that finished product make me

2634
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:26,960
feel and

2635
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:29,198
it could come from anywhere

2636
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:32,079
one thing i'd never gotten to that i was

2637
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:34,960
always interested was equatorial african

2638
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:38,238
and i have some from another person a

2639
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,600
guy i met who is from ghana he's born

2640
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:41,839
there

2641
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,960
and grew up there and he's now here in

2642
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,639
the states

2643
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:49,359
and uh he had access to some ghani's

2644
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:51,118
genetics that i have as well i also have

2645
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:53,279
some things from togo

2646
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:55,920
i'd be interested in in kenya as well

2647
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,279
anything equatorial the the black

2648
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,560
african

2649
01:39:57,279 --> 01:39:59,920
um

2650
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,800
land race

2651
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,719
i think would have some interesting uh

2652
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,039
aspects to it now another thing going

2653
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:09,760
into the future is going to be testing

2654
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:12,238
of course and that's how

2655
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,079
scientists do it that's how the lab or

2656
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:15,279
the the grow in mississippi the

2657
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:17,439
government

2658
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:19,840
uh grow that's in mississippi they go

2659
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:20,960
strictly by you know

2660
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,480
where the

2661
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,719
plant came from

2662
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:28,399
crossing it to itself and then

2663
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:30,719
testing the the finished product

2664
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:33,198
and and that's going to guide where a

2665
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:34,880
lot of things go i think also answer a

2666
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:37,759
lot of questions

2667
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:41,199
thcv cbdv

2668
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:44,560
uh cbg i think is another hot item right

2669
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:47,198
now i'm noticing it in a happy [ __ ] has

2670
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:48,320
some one percent cbg

2671
01:40:47,198 --> 01:40:49,678
um

2672
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:53,198
and there's something about i was

2673
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:56,639
reading um some article about cbg

2674
01:40:53,198 --> 01:41:00,399
with beta-carothylene and that is some

2675
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:02,159
um very unique recessive

2676
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:03,118
genotype

2677
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:05,039
um

2678
01:41:03,118 --> 01:41:06,238
so that that's going to i think

2679
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:08,479
influence

2680
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:10,879
the way a lot of things are going to go

2681
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:12,638
what what's what's going to be in demand

2682
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:16,239
again when we're on a level playing

2683
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:20,159
field and when we can offer this as a

2684
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:22,479
legitimate marketable pharmaceutical

2685
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,638
uh botanical

2686
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:27,039
things are going to change right

2687
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:29,039
say a terpene becomes popular and some

2688
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:30,479
company just needs bucket loads of this

2689
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:32,719
terpene

2690
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:35,039
uh well if you have the strain that's

2691
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:37,520
really putting out high in that terpene

2692
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:39,760
it puts you ahead of the game and

2693
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:41,520
uh things like that and these things are

2694
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,960
that they're going to unfold

2695
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:47,600
so as far as you know which area

2696
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:49,039
highland tie

2697
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,679
the area

2698
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:54,000
myanmar used to be called burma i think

2699
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:57,279
there's still a burma too

2700
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,039
but up there that that high

2701
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:02,000
northern laos

2702
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:03,600
the golden triangle

2703
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,760
any place that

2704
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,840
poppies do well

2705
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:10,960
wine tobacco

2706
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,560
cannabis seems to do well there too

2707
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:15,039
actually there is one other thing i

2708
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:18,159
could add in regards to testing the

2709
01:42:15,039 --> 01:42:20,079
testing of cannabis and how

2710
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:22,799
in regards to the testing of cannabis

2711
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:24,639
what we lack in their industry right now

2712
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,119
is a standard

2713
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:30,400
a standard for testing what's going on

2714
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:33,198
is people are in essence concentrating

2715
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:36,238
or isolating the most potent parts of

2716
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:40,079
their uh plant in order to determine its

2717
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:42,238
its potency and overall chemical nature

2718
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:44,960
and i just wanted to pass on that what i

2719
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:46,559
plan to do when i do work in the future

2720
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:49,279
for my own

2721
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:52,400
um analysis of these things is i want to

2722
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:55,279
take near maturity you know right right

2723
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:57,519
near harvest a an entire

2724
01:42:55,279 --> 01:43:00,960
live branch

2725
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:03,520
stem leaves buds and all get that bone

2726
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:05,840
dry and then test that grind it up into

2727
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:09,360
a powder and test that powder randomly

2728
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:11,440
which will then let me know the

2729
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:14,000
exact specific potency and

2730
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:17,919
characteristic of what's in these whole

2731
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:20,479
plants as opposed to just these isolated

2732
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:22,960
uh very resinous areas i mean if you're

2733
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:24,799
going to test that way then then just

2734
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,399
test for concentrate

2735
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,639
right if you're going to concentrate

2736
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:30,879
then then concentrate

2737
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:32,880
other than that i want to know what's in

2738
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:35,679
that whole plant including shade leaves

2739
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,199
stems things like that even roots i mean

2740
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,639
there's some interesting things going on

2741
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:40,799
in roots so

2742
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:43,039
that's another thing to take into

2743
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,560
consideration and to look at in the

2744
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:46,479
future

2745
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,320
yeah certainly that it raises an

2746
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:50,559
interesting question in my mind because

2747
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:53,439
i was reading the other day that one of

2748
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:55,600
the common reasons um that samples in

2749
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:57,198
california had failed over the past year

2750
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,199
not the most common reason but it was

2751
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:00,158
one of the common reasons was that it

2752
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:02,719
said

2753
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,079
homogeneity among sample

2754
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:06,000
and i thought

2755
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:07,600
is that is that like what i think it is

2756
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,760
where they're saying that you know they

2757
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,039
took samples from different parts of the

2758
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,239
tree or whatever and it was all

2759
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:13,679
homogeneous and they were like there's

2760
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:15,439
something up here there should be some

2761
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:17,199
variation is that is that kind of what

2762
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:19,279
they were getting at do you think

2763
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:21,118
i don't know but when you do isolate

2764
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:23,679
down to very specific parts of the

2765
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:24,960
flower you're going to find similarities

2766
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:26,319
across

2767
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,639
samples

2768
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:28,639
um

2769
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,880
it's

2770
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:32,560
um

2771
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,560
i don't know it's just it's it's another

2772
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:37,119
fascinating subject we need

2773
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:39,039
um this the standardization back when

2774
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:41,039
the government used to test you know in

2775
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:42,079
the 60s and 70s they would just take a

2776
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:44,000
random

2777
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:46,319
bloop out of whatever

2778
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,238
um they were dealing with

2779
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:50,559
which is part of the reason why i think

2780
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:52,079
you know the highest thc percentages we

2781
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:55,360
were seeing back then was about seven

2782
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:56,880
percent 10 i think on the maui

2783
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:58,880
was the highest

2784
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,880
um back in the day but it's also

2785
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,400
indication that there's other things

2786
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,560
going on there

2787
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:07,118
um other things to look for

2788
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:08,560
other cannabinoids other terpenes and

2789
01:45:07,118 --> 01:45:10,639
and

2790
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,520
got a lot of work cut out for us

2791
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:13,199
yeah

2792
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,199
i think maybe a better way of phrasing

2793
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:17,599
what i was asking was

2794
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:19,678
like i i commonly hear people say that

2795
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,800
you know buds at the top of the plant

2796
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,399
will have

2797
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,920
maybe a little bit lower levels of

2798
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:25,439
cannabinoids than ones that say the

2799
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:28,079
shoulders of the plants because you know

2800
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,000
they're not copping and so i guess it

2801
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:31,600
does come down to like yeah where are

2802
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,679
people taking these samples from

2803
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,280
specifically and i guess your your

2804
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,960
solution addresses that problem or is

2805
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:39,118
that what you're trying to do

2806
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,960
yeah exactly and then just just for a

2807
01:45:39,118 --> 01:45:42,559
side note there back in the day my

2808
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,198
favorite buds on the plant where those

2809
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,719
little popcorn things way deep inside

2810
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:49,678
that weren't getting

2811
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:52,000
uh upset or or you know too much

2812
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,800
exposure to light or air

2813
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,600
um they were the most interesting and

2814
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,279
and

2815
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,560
there's all the all over the plant

2816
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:00,399
there's interesting things going on but

2817
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:04,480
yeah taking a whole branch

2818
01:46:00,399 --> 01:46:06,719
leaves stems and all gives me a much

2819
01:46:04,479 --> 01:46:08,638
better understanding of how that whole

2820
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:10,079
plant is reacting especially to the

2821
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:13,440
plant next to it

2822
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:16,800
when i test them all in that way

2823
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:18,799
then i can really begin to uh

2824
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:22,239
suss some of this stuff out

2825
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:24,800
so as far as you know which area

2826
01:46:22,238 --> 01:46:28,638
highland tie

2827
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:31,279
the area myanmar used to be called burma

2828
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:34,560
i think there's still a burma too

2829
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:36,319
but up there that that high

2830
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:39,280
northern laos

2831
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:40,799
the golden triangle

2832
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:42,960
any place that

2833
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,800
poppies do well

2834
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,760
wine tobacco

2835
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,119
uh cannabis seems to do well there too

2836
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,440
yeah that's that's an interesting

2837
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:54,479
analogy i never quite thought of

2838
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:56,479
i do know however and it was brought up

2839
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:58,479
that uh you've got a

2840
01:46:56,479 --> 01:47:00,799
neat little story about when you got to

2841
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:02,479
smoke some black african weed would you

2842
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,520
mind telling us that one

2843
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:08,479
yeah it's probably the strongest

2844
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,920
herb i'd ever encountered and it was

2845
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:13,599
straight herb

2846
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:15,760
it looked terrible it it and tasted

2847
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:18,320
like you know the stuff you find in a

2848
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,320
gutter that dried up just that

2849
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:23,840
vegetative basic

2850
01:47:20,319 --> 01:47:25,439
rotten molded vegetative mass black

2851
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:27,920
dry crumbly

2852
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:31,118
tasted like leaves

2853
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:34,880
didn't didn't have a particular

2854
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:37,439
flavor so to speak kind of sagey

2855
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:38,840
pin joint a pin joint and stuff between

2856
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:42,000
four

2857
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:44,079
adult-sized people man and it was like

2858
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,880
almost like dmt

2859
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:49,439
a cartoon you just

2860
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,639
points of reality you became different

2861
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:53,759
references

2862
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:55,039
uh lasted a while

2863
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,960
i never

2864
01:47:55,039 --> 01:47:59,039
possessed any other than in a rolled

2865
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:01,760
joint form

2866
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:03,439
i did get to roll the joints you know

2867
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,920
saw from the bags on more than one

2868
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:08,479
occasion it was two occasions that i had

2869
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,960
access i think i smoked it three times

2870
01:48:08,479 --> 01:48:12,718
uh same thing every time

2871
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,079
we were doing pcp at the time you know

2872
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:16,239
it was one of the drugs that was

2873
01:48:14,079 --> 01:48:18,399
available and we had one with our pcp in

2874
01:48:16,238 --> 01:48:19,759
here but no it was it was pot it was

2875
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:23,759
straight pot

2876
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:24,719
uh very dream dream state just just

2877
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,520
you

2878
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:29,039
reality shifted and and you just looked

2879
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,960
at life differently completely

2880
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:33,760
differently for that for that whole time

2881
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:35,920
it was giddy very goofy you couldn't

2882
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:39,760
help but laugh

2883
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,760
real tight you know cheek muscle

2884
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:46,400
a bit overwhelming

2885
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:48,158
and uh

2886
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:50,879
what's a dissociative

2887
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:53,679
in in that regard where you know it

2888
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:56,560
could evoke paranoid thinking

2889
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:59,760
all the things associated with uh the

2890
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:03,039
heavy psychedelic dose but yeah it was

2891
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:05,119
impressive um herb and everything i've

2892
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:07,519
read about all the people i've talked to

2893
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:09,759
that have had you know seen the similar

2894
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:12,000
thing had the same experience people

2895
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,599
have had reports of levitation and

2896
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,880
there's all kinds of silly things on

2897
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:17,599
this herb

2898
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:21,440
um i'd love to get some more i saw a

2899
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:22,880
weird television thing years ago as in

2900
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:24,399
head of michigan this was still in the

2901
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:26,639
70s and it was some kind of a

2902
01:49:24,399 --> 01:49:28,479
documentary thing it was in black and

2903
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:30,239
white maybe i just had a black and white

2904
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:31,519
tv back in the day i'm not sure and

2905
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:33,279
these guys were going around all these

2906
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,840
different hash places and just

2907
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:37,039
documenting it they showed afghanistan

2908
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:40,000
where they had

2909
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:43,039
mules or donkeys up on the press

2910
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,920
and how they squeezed it out and

2911
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:47,118
this black goo was coming out the edges

2912
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,319
shiny

2913
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:50,799
um

2914
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:51,759
but they went to these pygmies in in

2915
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,320
kenya

2916
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:57,280
and the the herb plants just look like

2917
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:59,279
hedges giant bushes out in the bush they

2918
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:01,679
were they were the bush

2919
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:03,840
and these pygmies these little pygmy

2920
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:06,239
people were rubbing it hand rubbing it

2921
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:08,239
and putting it in a big chillum

2922
01:50:06,238 --> 01:50:11,598
and smoking it up but again you could

2923
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:12,638
see on on that video the the

2924
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:14,960
sheen

2925
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:16,639
to that hash how sticky it was and how

2926
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:20,399
high they got

2927
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:23,118
and it wasn't like a pro it was a

2928
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:25,118
not a pro hash thing it was an anti-drug

2929
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:26,719
kind of documentary where they were just

2930
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:30,238
showing all this

2931
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:32,319
hash production um but it would i know

2932
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:34,000
that's the stuff i'm after put it that

2933
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:37,279
way

2934
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,520
yeah wow and at curiosity where were you

2935
01:50:37,279 --> 01:50:42,559
when you're able to try it

2936
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:44,960
in the detroit area again uh guided from

2937
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:46,960
a cousin my cousin the drummer

2938
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:49,439
do you think it was import or grown in

2939
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:52,399
the states no it was import it was

2940
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:55,118
african weed um

2941
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:57,118
he was a jazz musician he taught jazz

2942
01:50:55,118 --> 01:51:00,559
drumming as a matter of fact and he had

2943
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:02,559
those connections in the detroit area

2944
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,639
in that regard for history i don't know

2945
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:08,800
if you're familiar with a book called um

2946
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:11,800
really the blues by mesmesro

2947
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,800
m-e-z-z-m-e-z-z-r-o-w

2948
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:16,719
i believe his name is spelled um

2949
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:19,039
fascinating read i don't know why it's

2950
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:20,399
not required reading um

2951
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:23,118
in college i think it's even out of

2952
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:25,279
print he wrote this in the 40s

2953
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:26,880
he was a pot dealer in

2954

2962
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:50,960
the jazz musicians the golden leaf

2963
01:51:47,439 --> 01:51:53,279
uh book has a bunch of amazing

2964
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,520
it's it's it's just a fascinating read

2965
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:58,079
they used to call pomez

2966
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:59,679
um in in his honor

2967

um

2968
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:04,800
but this this african herb it goes back

2969
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,719
quite a ways burrows the same thing it

2970
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:08,800
was growing in mexico and he went down

2971
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:12,000
to mexico to grow some of it

2972
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,440
the gold that that oaxacan uh was along

2973
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,840
those lines

2974
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:19,678
uh that had a very frankincense uh cedar

2975
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:20,960
candy cedar

2976
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:26,158
incense

2977
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:28,000
smell flavor uh catholic church incense

2978
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:30,638
very much

2979
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,319
and again just uh

2980
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:34,960
enlightening now that stuff was very

2981
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:37,118
pleasurable see the african

2982
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:40,079
that was more it's like dmt it was more

2983
01:52:37,118 --> 01:52:41,759
serious whereas the golds were by far

2984
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:43,039
more pleasurable

2985
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,760
powerful

2986
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:47,920
um another herb that would got

2987
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:48,639
uncomfortable at times any of the island

2988
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,039
or

2989
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:53,279
jamaican hawaiian

2990
01:52:51,039 --> 01:52:55,599
could be far too potent

2991
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:57,039
sometimes

2992
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:59,279
yeah wow

2993
01:52:57,039 --> 01:53:01,760
this is all just like i never would have

2994
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:04,960
thought so i mean something we have

2995
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:07,520
heard before is that uh the the golds as

2996
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:10,158
you referenced were were like you know

2997
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:12,400
very popular do you think that at the

2998
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:14,000
time people were aware of what they were

2999
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:17,439
getting or do you think like they kind

3000
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,439
of took it a bit for granted

3001
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:24,319
my ilk my my crowd we knew and when you

3002
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:26,960
stumbled upon the good [ __ ] when there

3003
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:30,238
was all that dirt weed going around

3004
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:32,158
uh we would pool our resources and buy a

3005
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:33,359
quantity try and get enough to get a

3006
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:35,118
pound

3007
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:38,079
um get a much more reasonable deal it

3008
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:42,000
was like 250 dollars a pound

3009
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:43,840
uh used to be geez 90 a kilo

3010
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,520
uh in bricks

3011
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:48,719
um but generally i think i was paying

3012
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:50,639
about 200 to 300 per pound

3013
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:52,719
for for the top shelf

3014
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:55,440
stuff whereas the more commercial things

3015
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:56,960
were probably 150 a pound

3016
01:53:55,439 --> 01:53:59,359
um

3017
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:01,679
so yeah we would pool our resources and

3018
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:03,920
buy the good [ __ ] and then have it for a

3019
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:06,239
while sell however much

3020
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,679
we knew about it um for sure i think

3021
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:08,638
it's like wine

3022
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,520
right

3023
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,279
uh

3024
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:13,040
good wine

3025
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:16,079
even you don't have to be a connoisseur

3026
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:17,198
or a wine expert to just know what you

3027
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:19,118
like

3028
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:22,000
and generally speaking when people are

3029
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:23,839
introduced to what is classified as good

3030
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,238
wine they tend to smack their lips and

3031
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:30,319
go oh that's wonderful

3032
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:32,079
um and it's it's very similar with herb

3033
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:34,479
yep yep you just kind of gravitate

3034
01:54:32,079 --> 01:54:36,639
towards what you like

3035
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:38,718
and it's not just the flavor it's then

3036
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:39,520
the accompanying feeling that goes with

3037
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:42,000
it

3038
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:43,760
whereas wine generally tends to have you

3039
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,158
know you drink enough of it the same

3040
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,159
feeling

3041
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:50,560
so

3042
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:52,159
old time moonshine this is

3043
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,159
kind of an indica dominant strain you

3044
01:54:52,158 --> 01:54:56,399
released in the past which didn't really

3045
01:54:54,158 --> 01:54:58,319
have any apparent relationships to the

3046
01:54:56,399 --> 01:55:00,399
blue family and the thing which strikes

3047
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:02,319
my interest about this is

3048
01:55:00,399 --> 01:55:03,839
you know obviously not really related to

3049
01:55:02,319 --> 01:55:05,679
a lot of other stocks so the first thing

3050
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:08,560
i started to wonder is how many of these

3051
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:09,920
types of projects or you know kind of

3052
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,520
strains do you have in your library

3053
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:13,440
where they are actually just you know

3054
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,080
kind of unrelated

3055
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:19,519
that's a good question um the old time

3056
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:21,039
moonshine was part of what went on up in

3057
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:22,360
canada

3058
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:26,479
in

3059
01:55:22,359 --> 01:55:26,479
2004 around then

3060
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:33,118
someone with a nice big house set up

3061
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:35,199
600 plants was able to dedicate the

3062
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:36,880
space to do an r d

3063
01:55:35,198 --> 01:55:38,719
and then a seed run

3064
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:40,639
uh from that r d

3065
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:42,319
uh it was the biggest

3066
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:45,199
that i got to

3067
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:47,118
you know witness firsthand of

3068
01:55:45,198 --> 01:55:49,198
my my personal

3069
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:50,158
stock being grown out

3070
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:51,279
and

3071
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:54,158
these were things that presented

3072
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:57,039
themselves uh old time moonshine was one

3073
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:58,638
of them that was in i think a blue

3074
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:01,679
moonshine

3075
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:02,639
designated uh stock

3076
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:05,359
i

3077
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:07,520
can't i don't it really wasn't that in

3078
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:08,719
invi i mean i put my hands on it saw it

3079
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,159
smoked it

3080
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:11,118
um

3081
01:56:10,158 --> 01:56:14,000
but

3082
01:56:11,118 --> 01:56:16,000
i it wasn't that personally involved um

3083
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,399
i'm trying to recall if she was strictly

3084
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,760
green if she had the purples in her or

3085
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:24,238
not i do know that in the final analysis

3086
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:26,000
again my primary concern was the smoke

3087
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:28,479
and how did things smoke and in that

3088
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,279
capacity it passed the muster

3089
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:32,079
to

3090
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:34,559
be of the potency to qualify for a

3091
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:37,439
moonshine uh they actually came up with

3092
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:40,320
the name old-time moonshine uh assigned

3093
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:41,919
that to it there was only one plan all

3094
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:43,679
right it was a big plant

3095
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:46,960
uh that went to seed

3096
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:48,800
and i think there were about 1600 seeds

3097
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:50,800
on that and this was back when seeds

3098
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,119
were in 10 packs so it was only about

3099
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:54,560
160 packs

3100
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:57,679
of those seeds

3101
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:59,440
and like any release you know there's an

3102
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:00,719
initial sale because people are

3103
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:03,519
interested

3104
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:06,000
and you gotta wait for smoke reports and

3105
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:07,920
and things to come in for sales to pick

3106
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,719
up after that initial

3107
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,760
well

3108
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:12,960
the

3109
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,639
old time moonshine just kind of

3110
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,000
moved along you know as we sold our

3111
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:19,118
little bit

3112
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:22,079
over time then i think high times did a

3113
01:57:19,118 --> 01:57:24,880
piece on it and jason king

3114
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:26,880
did something on it that really

3115
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,039
set the hype again

3116
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:31,118
there was a surge in buying of those

3117
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:32,399
seeds and they sold out

3118
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:34,559
all right

3119
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:37,118
um so there were no more of them and

3120
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,800
that kind of adds to the hype

3121
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:39,679
in a big way

3122
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:42,000
um

3123
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:45,039
now again this was

3124
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,359
mid late 2000's

3125
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:50,079
right after the marc emery bust in and

3126
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:52,559
around the time of the heaven stairway

3127
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:53,920
bus people were on edge people were

3128
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,400
looking to

3129
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:58,719
you know seed hoarding was a big

3130
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:01,598
phenomenon right then

3131
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:03,840
and someone who had bought two packs of

3132
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:06,000
those old-time moonshine

3133
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:07,840
put them on one of the auction boards

3134
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,158
that was left probably on gypsy nirvana

3135
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:12,400
site at that time i forget where

3136
01:58:10,158 --> 01:58:14,960
uh on an auction and they got a thousand

3137
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:19,039
dollars a pack

3138
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:21,198
yeah in a 10 seat pack and that then i

3139
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:22,800
think just fueled the hype

3140
01:58:21,198 --> 01:58:24,158
a whole bunch more

3141
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,039
um

3142
01:58:24,158 --> 01:58:27,679
so

3143
01:58:25,039 --> 01:58:29,279
from my perspective you know that that's

3144
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:30,639
what happened with old time moonshine

3145
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:33,118
now

3146
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:35,118
re-releasing that i passed some of that

3147
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:38,479
stock on again to

3148
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:41,039
both my son and some people in michigan

3149
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:42,319
growing that out now and great success

3150
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:44,719
they're loving it

3151
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:46,960
it's passing the muster so we might see

3152
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:48,960
that again

3153
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:52,000
but in terms that's kind of that's what

3154
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:53,760
happened with it and that's how hype

3155
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,719
works

3156
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:58,880
yeah no i get that and so there's this

3157
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:00,639
kind of interesting prevailing mindset

3158
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:03,920
in the community whereby

3159
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:05,520
if someone stops offering a strain not

3160
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,719
because you know they think it's bad and

3161
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,400
it shouldn't be offered but for whatever

3162
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,000
reason they're no longer offering it

3163
01:59:08,399 --> 01:59:11,359
generally speaking if someone else

3164
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,118
begins to offer it it's kind of

3165
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:14,880
considered okay

3166
01:59:13,118 --> 01:59:16,559
how do you feel about the fact that

3167
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,719
mosca does that with the old time

3168
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,960
moonshine

3169
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:22,800
it's

3170
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:24,239
it should be

3171
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,400
the way it is

3172
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:29,039
for tomatoes

3173
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:32,079
all right whatever laws there are for

3174
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,840
tomatoes and tomato seeds what burpee

3175
01:59:32,079 --> 01:59:36,158
goes through

3176
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,920
and i mean from my perspective you look

3177
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:39,529
at it like this use tomatoes as an

3178
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:41,359
analogy i go into

3179
01:59:39,529 --> 01:59:42,719
[Music]

3180
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:46,639
public domain

3181
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:48,719
stock and i work just heritage

3182
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,000
strains and i come up with a tomato that

3183
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:51,359
is small

3184
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,359
it's blue

3185
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:55,679
and it has a taste like a blueberry and

3186
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:58,319
they're blueberry tomatoes

3187
01:59:55,679 --> 02:00:01,440
and i market them as both blueberry

3188
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:04,158
tomatoes you know leasing that

3189
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:06,960
rights to whomever or i sell seeds of

3190
02:00:04,158 --> 02:00:08,719
blueberry tomatoes now if i lease that

3191
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:11,198
out to burpee or whomever and they're

3192
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:12,800
selling blueberry tomatoes

3193
02:00:11,198 --> 02:00:15,359
can you know

3194
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,239
and they're they're doing it for a while

3195
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:18,960
and

3196
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:22,319
either for whatever reasons crop failure

3197
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:25,039
uh supply is much higher than demand

3198
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:26,960
they cannot supply the market for a

3199
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:28,960
given period of time for whatever reason

3200
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:31,118
does that give the general public the

3201
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:34,079
right to buy a pack of

3202
02:00:31,118 --> 02:00:36,000
blueberry tomato seeds and then offer

3203
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:37,439
them on the market

3204
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:40,639
legally no

3205
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:43,359
from my understanding and you know all i

3206
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:45,279
care about is exactly whatever the hell

3207
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:47,439
it is for tomatoes

3208
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:48,960
well let's do that for herb

3209
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:51,598
and that's something

3210
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:54,000
for the lawyers to work out for me it's

3211
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:56,000
a it's an incidental it's it's a

3212
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,279
distraction really

3213
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,399
um

3214
02:00:57,279 --> 02:00:59,359
and

3215
02:00:58,399 --> 02:01:02,079
you know

3216
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:03,759
i mean i i i come from this

3217
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:05,599
kind of open source

3218
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:07,440
place where

3219
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:08,560
i i do believe that

3220
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:11,039
even

3221
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:13,280
given intellectual property rights that

3222
02:01:11,039 --> 02:01:14,719
all intellectual property is is public

3223
02:01:13,279 --> 02:01:17,519
domain

3224
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:20,800
once it's published once it's out there

3225
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:23,520
uh and the analogy i like to use is like

3226
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:26,000
it's a big pond right and in that pond

3227
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:27,599
are these fish and that fish is the

3228
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,439
information

3229
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:32,400
uh you could use einstein all right

3230
02:01:29,439 --> 02:01:34,638
einstein made the right fishing tackle

3231
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:38,000
the right gear and he caught e equals m

3232
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:40,159
c squared now einstein caught it right

3233
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,800
but he gave it to the world and here you

3234
02:01:40,158 --> 02:01:45,759
go here's the equals m c squared

3235
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:48,719
i think in fairness that the way

3236
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:51,039
it would go forward is that

3237
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:52,639
fine everyone can take em equals mc

3238
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:55,519
squared and run with it

3239
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:58,239
but if you start making money off of it

3240
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,760
you owe something to einstein

3241
02:01:58,238 --> 02:02:02,638
right or

3242
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,880
back to the pond one or the other

3243
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:07,039
you know as long as that cycle is

3244
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:09,520
completed hey this is completely

3245
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:13,118
sustainable right

3246
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:14,560
but when people then you know take

3247
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:16,479
um

3248
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:18,960
claim rights

3249
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:21,919
to things then that gets murky and then

3250
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:24,158
litigation gets complicated and and it

3251
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:25,840
becomes a serious waste of time energy

3252
02:02:24,158 --> 02:02:27,519
and money

3253
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:29,840
um

3254
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:29,840
you know

3255
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:34,319
yeah yeah no i i get yeah it brings up

3256
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:35,520
this interesting concept because there's

3257
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:37,920
currently

3258
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:41,199
this topic in the community of

3259
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:44,399
you know what level of uh onus is there

3260
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:46,719
on people to reach out and maybe ask for

3261
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:47,598
permission before using a strain and a

3262
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:50,319
cross

3263
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:52,319
and that's that's kind of to me it's a

3264
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:54,479
bit of a no-brainer especially if you're

3265
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:56,319
crossing two different strains i feel

3266
02:02:54,479 --> 02:02:57,839
like it gets very confusing when yeah

3267
02:02:56,319 --> 02:03:00,479
when you say you're doing an f2 of

3268
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:02,000
someone's work and that's why i prefaced

3269
02:03:00,479 --> 02:03:04,638
it with that initial bit because like

3270
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,238
the thing i notice is for example tom

3271
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:08,719
hill he's not around anymore and there

3272
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:10,559
are a lot of people who eff to his lines

3273
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:12,079
and if he was around that would be like

3274
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:13,840
such a no-no

3275
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:15,439
but the fact he's not around people

3276
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:18,400
almost view it as like you're doing a

3277
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:20,960
community service so i i just i'm so

3278
02:03:18,399 --> 02:03:22,799
intrigued by how you know the mindset

3279
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,639
around this all works because it's like

3280
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,639
under just these minor little tweaks in

3281
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:28,079
the situation there's just like a total

3282
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:29,760
flip on whether people support the

3283
02:03:28,079 --> 02:03:31,359
concept or not and then in your

3284
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:34,320
situation yeah like you're still around

3285
02:03:31,359 --> 02:03:36,238
so it kind of raises the question of did

3286
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:37,679
you did you not did you stop releasing

3287
02:03:36,238 --> 02:03:39,279
it because maybe you didn't want it out

3288
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:41,599
there things like that or what i think

3289
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:43,679
about at least yeah what old

3290
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:47,440
no like i said there was one plant there

3291
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:48,560
were 1600 seeds 160 packs which were

3292
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:51,279
enough

3293
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:53,119
to to make that that hype happen but to

3294
02:03:51,279 --> 02:03:54,960
finish up on the on the pond and the

3295
02:03:53,118 --> 02:03:57,439
fish analogy

3296
02:03:54,960 --> 02:04:00,000
the pond and the fish belong to

3297
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:02,238
everybody right even though einstein

3298
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,118
caught e equals m c squared with his

3299
02:04:02,238 --> 02:04:06,559
fishing thing it still belongs to

3300
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:09,279
everybody

3301
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:11,199
and the only time it gets murky the only

3302
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:12,078
thing that needs to be regulated and i

3303
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:15,198
think

3304
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:17,118
this this is a big picture thing legally

3305
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:18,559
to me the most dangerous substance on

3306
02:04:17,118 --> 02:04:20,639
the face of the earth that needs to be

3307
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,840
regulated is money

3308
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:24,560
period

3309
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:26,880
and once we get a grip on that i think

3310
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:29,440
you know society will do fine

3311
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:31,520
but we're not controlling money and

3312
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:33,678
we're allowing that concept of the

3313
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:36,239
golden rule being that those with the

3314
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:38,960
gold make the rules

3315
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:40,158
and historically that's never worked out

3316
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:44,880
well

3317
02:04:40,158 --> 02:04:47,920
and it won't this time either and i it's

3318
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:50,000
unfortunate that the levels of suffering

3319
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,960
you know it can happen as a result of

3320
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,279
that

3321
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:55,599
but again upon the fish belong to

3322
02:04:53,279 --> 02:04:56,960
everybody but you have to give credit to

3323
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:59,199
whomever

3324
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:00,399
wrestled out that fish from the pond in

3325
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:02,158
the first place

3326
02:05:00,399 --> 02:05:03,920
and and

3327
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:05,598
take care of that and things work

3328
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:06,960
themselves out

3329
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:09,920
yeah

3330
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:12,000
so just as a quick little wrap up was

3331
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,599
the great crush of kind of a similar

3332
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,880
nature to the old-time moonshine where

3333
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:16,719
it was kind of something you offered for

3334
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,599
a bid and now it's kind of gone or was

3335
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:21,599
there a little bit of a different

3336
02:05:17,599 --> 02:05:24,078
backstory on that one um it was a

3337
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:27,360
blueberry line blueberry leaning but had

3338
02:05:24,078 --> 02:05:30,078
a much more grape flavor and was very

3339
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:31,839
productive just 15 20 sometimes 25

3340
02:05:30,078 --> 02:05:33,279
percent more

3341
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:34,639
on the plant with the same amount of

3342
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:37,359
quality

3343
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:40,000
we are it is re-released right now in

3344
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:42,479
what we call a throwback form where

3345
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:44,319
we've taken a bunch of the grape crush

3346
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:46,879
seeds grown them out done a proper

3347
02:05:44,319 --> 02:05:50,238
selection for the mother and then just

3348
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:52,319
use the f4 blueberry dad who's he's got

3349
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:54,158
merit all the way around

3350
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:55,039
and those seeds are doing the exact same

3351
02:05:54,158 --> 02:05:57,039
thing

3352
02:05:55,039 --> 02:06:00,238
in terms of production and the grape

3353
02:05:57,039 --> 02:06:03,599
flavor so they are around um

3354
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:06,319
i don't know if my son is still

3355
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:08,239
continuing them uh he he's got a lot on

3356
02:06:06,319 --> 02:06:11,439
his plate right now and once again it's

3357
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:13,279
space and time i need to have a meeting

3358
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:14,839
with him here soon to see what he does

3359
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:18,479
have and doesn't have

3360
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:20,078
um anything i have released can be

3361
02:06:18,479 --> 02:06:22,479
released again

3362
02:06:20,078 --> 02:06:24,158
it will be seen again at some point in

3363
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:26,158
time

3364
02:06:24,158 --> 02:06:28,399
fantastic so i mean just as a little

3365
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:30,000
curiosity point i

3366
02:06:28,399 --> 02:06:30,960
this could be a silly question excuse me

3367
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,078
if it is

3368
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:35,679
were you the creator of skywalker

3369
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:37,679
or did they did dutch passion do that

3370
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:39,760
just with your work they just did that

3371
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:42,639
with my work and that was kind of after

3372
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:45,119
the fact after i had left uh being there

3373
02:06:42,639 --> 02:06:46,800
i never got anything for that one

3374
02:06:45,118 --> 02:06:48,399
um

3375
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:49,360
yeah that was just a little one i needed

3376
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:52,000
to slow down i didn't know where to

3377
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:54,238
start that one yeah and i i'm glad you

3378
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,479
did because that's one of those that few

3379
02:06:54,238 --> 02:06:59,359
people really know about and that that

3380
02:06:56,479 --> 02:07:01,439
was my genetics the things that i'd left

3381
02:06:59,359 --> 02:07:03,279
um up up with dutch passion i don't know

3382
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:05,919
if he worked any other genetics in with

3383
02:07:03,279 --> 02:07:08,158
that but i do know that mine were uh

3384
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:10,480
responsible at least in the initial

3385
02:07:08,158 --> 02:07:12,799
um description of them

3386
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:14,319
yeah i was able to try some in the

3387
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:16,960
states and it was

3388
02:07:14,319 --> 02:07:18,158
incredible quality and and of all i can

3389
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:20,399
assume

3390
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:22,319
i think that this particular cutting was

3391
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:24,719
kind of tapping more into kind of the

3392
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:26,319
flow side of things because

3393
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:28,239
it just everything people have ever told

3394
02:07:26,319 --> 02:07:30,559
me about flow it's just what this and it

3395
02:07:28,238 --> 02:07:31,759
was given to me as purple skywalker and

3396
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,960
i was like what do you mean purple like

3397
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:35,199
it just happens to be purple and they're

3398
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:37,920
like no this cut it's like and it looked

3399
02:07:35,198 --> 02:07:41,519
kind of like that stacked calyx foxtail

3400
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:42,960
photo of flow so yeah again i i yeah i

3401
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,920
love that one so i was always curious

3402
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,599
but um

3403
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:48,319
something i wanted to ask you though is

3404
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:51,119
given your work is so

3405
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:53,198
extensively worked generation wise how

3406
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:54,559
do you feel about the fact that you know

3407
02:07:53,198 --> 02:07:57,279
a lot of the current breeders are

3408
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:58,719
releasing f1s these days do you

3409
02:07:57,279 --> 02:08:00,880
you know do you have any opinions on

3410
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:03,920
that or where do you sit

3411
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:06,078
um again it's it's not something i

3412
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:08,639
really have the time

3413
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:11,679
uh more energy to focus on

3414
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:13,199
i i my only contact with what other

3415
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:16,480
people are doing in the industries is

3416
02:08:13,198 --> 02:08:19,118
when i attend shows and i happen to walk

3417
02:08:16,479 --> 02:08:20,839
around and notice i know that right now

3418
02:08:19,118 --> 02:08:22,639
there is a

3419
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:24,719
huge

3420
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:27,359
surge of

3421
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:28,480
new genetics companies

3422
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:30,719
uh

3423
02:08:28,479 --> 02:08:32,799
a lot of them seem to be

3424
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:35,198
banding together you know sharing booth

3425
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:38,320
space and and

3426
02:08:35,198 --> 02:08:40,399
kind of distribution in in that way

3427
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:43,198
um

3428
02:08:40,399 --> 02:08:45,359
a lot though they they it's genetics

3429
02:08:43,198 --> 02:08:48,000
companies i mean basically just pick up

3430
02:08:45,359 --> 02:08:51,198
any recent issue of high times and flip

3431
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:54,800
through who has the most full-page ads

3432
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:56,799
kind of gives you an indication of who's

3433
02:08:54,800 --> 02:09:00,880
you know spending money on what that

3434
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:02,320
also and um booth spaces at at these

3435
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:03,679
events

3436
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:06,479
some of those booths are hundreds of

3437
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:08,800
thousands of dollars uh worth of space

3438
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:10,078
and and people and

3439
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:11,920
um

3440
02:09:10,078 --> 02:09:13,920
but there there's your indicator you

3441
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:16,399
know just follow the money

3442
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:18,719
yeah okay and so do you feel it's

3443
02:09:16,399 --> 02:09:21,598
possible to remain relevant within the

3444
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:23,760
scene without engaging strongly in you

3445
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:25,199
know advertising and social media and

3446
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:27,520
stuff because i think that for the most

3447
02:09:25,198 --> 02:09:28,719
part you could look at your own brand

3448
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:30,800
and say there's a little bit of that

3449
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:32,399
going on where you know it's still doing

3450
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:34,079
very well yet you're not you know like

3451
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:35,759
one of these people who's posting up

3452
02:09:34,078 --> 02:09:38,158
stuff every day and trying to like

3453
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:40,639
everyone's comments and stuff

3454
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:42,719
yeah i and i'm not i mean this whole

3455
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:44,319
social media

3456
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:47,359
phenomenon

3457
02:09:44,319 --> 02:09:49,759
it's a new thing and it kind of boggles

3458
02:09:47,359 --> 02:09:51,679
my mind i think the the the platforms

3459
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:54,800
themselves don't

3460
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:58,840
worry me so much as how

3461
02:09:54,800 --> 02:10:03,520
quickly people embrace this as

3462
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:05,039
normal um and it's not it it's only just

3463
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:06,639
begun

3464
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:08,800
so again

3465
02:10:06,639 --> 02:10:11,679
it remains to be seen i think it's far

3466
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:13,840
too early to tell i think now right now

3467
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:15,599
in this in this day and age and in this

3468
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:17,679
market yes

3469
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:19,920
in the states especially i would imagine

3470
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:21,039
so in europe canada probably australia

3471
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:23,840
too

3472
02:10:21,039 --> 02:10:26,000
to be um very active

3473
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:29,520
in in these um

3474
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,198
on these platforms um

3475
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:32,639
it's uh for me again it's it's an

3476
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:35,919
incidental

3477
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:38,000
um i need to focus on finding those

3478
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:39,199
things that make me feel good when i

3479
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,399
smoke them

3480
02:10:39,198 --> 02:10:42,719
and

3481
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:44,238
so in that capacity i've got my work cut

3482
02:10:42,719 --> 02:10:47,520
out for me

3483
02:10:44,238 --> 02:10:50,799
um but for other people yeah i i see it

3484
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:52,960
all the time the competition is fierce

3485
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:55,279
it really is and if it were

3486
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:57,599
fair i mean if people played fair that'd

3487
02:10:55,279 --> 02:10:59,198
be one thing but people don't and it's

3488
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:00,319
been going on for going on for a long

3489
02:10:59,198 --> 02:11:03,439
time

3490
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:05,679
where people use um certain bulletin

3491
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:10,799
boards or whatever

3492
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:12,078
to tout one brand and you know uh praise

3493
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:15,039
another

3494
02:11:12,078 --> 02:11:18,479
um supposedly in in this completely

3495
02:11:15,039 --> 02:11:21,198
sincere way but that's not the case it's

3496
02:11:18,479 --> 02:11:22,559
all marketing strategies and things it

3497
02:11:21,198 --> 02:11:24,960
was to say when i was a kid growing up

3498
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:27,119
was tv in commercials and we had to

3499
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:29,760
learn you know oh god yes this is how

3500
02:11:27,118 --> 02:11:32,158
they're trying to affect us

3501
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:34,960
and hopefully some of us will see

3502
02:11:32,158 --> 02:11:36,559
through it and learn from it and and you

3503
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:39,840
know be able to progress

3504
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:42,880
beyond i'm hoping at some point some day

3505
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:46,560
just the merit of the herb itself

3506
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:48,560
is going to be what what

3507
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:51,119
guides its future

3508
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:53,039
uh with the the good smoke you know and

3509
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:54,158
that was that was it in the brotherhood

3510
02:11:53,039 --> 02:11:56,078
days

3511
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:58,479
right i mean when it was the good smoke

3512
02:11:56,078 --> 02:12:01,198
demand supply and demand and people

3513
02:11:58,479 --> 02:12:02,718
knowing what they like and and wanting

3514
02:12:01,198 --> 02:12:04,479
what they like

3515
02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:06,719
and seeking it

3516
02:12:04,479 --> 02:12:09,198
yeah for sure

3517
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:10,800
so something i did want to ask you is

3518
02:12:09,198 --> 02:12:13,279
what was it that caused you to go back

3519
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:15,760
to the drawing board and to rework the

3520
02:12:13,279 --> 02:12:18,559
blueberry sativa line and to ultimately

3521
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:21,920
kind of derive the vanaluna and the koko

3522
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:25,440
kush from it oh sure um

3523
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:27,440
the blueberry sativa or what came to be

3524
02:12:25,439 --> 02:12:30,158
known as blue satellite

3525
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:33,118
that was work i did with breeder steve

3526
02:12:30,158 --> 02:12:35,598
and uh british steve was another

3527
02:12:33,118 --> 02:12:38,479
canadian originally who then went to

3528
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:42,239
europe uh first to switzerland

3529
02:12:38,479 --> 02:12:45,198
um had quite a few successes there but

3530
02:12:42,238 --> 02:12:46,959
had a nasty habit of burning his bridges

3531
02:12:45,198 --> 02:12:49,598
and ended up

3532
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:51,679
leaving switzerland um and going to

3533
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:54,078
spain and kind of doing the same thing

3534
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:55,359
there accomplishing a lot

3535
02:12:54,078 --> 02:12:58,639
quite a bit

3536
02:12:55,359 --> 02:13:01,118
um i went over there took genetics with

3537
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:02,480
me and and that's where we came up with

3538
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:03,920
with those

3539
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:07,359
um

3540
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:10,000
at that point in time it was my my next

3541
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:11,598
blueberry was out flow was out

3542
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,279
this is what has to be next this

3543
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:16,960
blueberry sativa

3544
02:13:13,279 --> 02:13:19,359
and once that was out then you know um

3545
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:20,800
i came back i was working on my own

3546
02:13:19,359 --> 02:13:22,000
things really didn't work out up in

3547
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,880
canada

3548
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,319
uh

3549
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:30,000
so that was like 0.506

3550
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:32,158
that i did the coco cushion van aluna

3551
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,118
from similar lines

3552
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:36,559
um matter of all exactly the same lines

3553
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:38,960
as um

3554
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:42,239
the blue satellite

3555
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:45,039
interesting and so do you think that the

3556
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:47,839
vana luna has kind of gone on to get its

3557
02:13:45,039 --> 02:13:49,840
own cult following in the way that flo

3558
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:51,920
almost has because i find the

3559
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:54,159
variegation is undeniably something

3560
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:56,800
which just really draws people to her

3561
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:58,719
yeah i i would uh have to agree that's

3562
02:13:56,800 --> 02:14:01,119
another one of my favorites actually

3563
02:13:58,719 --> 02:14:03,840
probably more so than blueberry and it i

3564
02:14:01,118 --> 02:14:05,920
describe as being comfortable it's just

3565
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:08,239
plain comfortable makes you comfortable

3566
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:10,840
so for again pain management it was it

3567
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:13,439
was wonderful in that capacity very

3568
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:15,199
clear-headed um coco cush the same thing

3569
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:17,279
although coco cush had a little bit more

3570
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:19,678
of a wild ride to it i called it a

3571
02:14:17,279 --> 02:14:22,000
little bit more like a roller coaster

3572
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:24,239
um

3573
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,158
so

3574
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:28,959
what was the question in relation to

3575
02:14:26,158 --> 02:14:30,719
that vanna luna and coco kush

3576
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,279
well basically i was just wondering do

3577
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:35,439
you find that um there is a bit of a

3578
02:14:33,279 --> 02:14:36,800
cult following for vanna lewis oh i

3579
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:38,399
would hope so

3580
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:40,159
i would hope so

3581
02:14:38,399 --> 02:14:42,399
uh same with you know flow it took a

3582
02:14:40,158 --> 02:14:44,319
long time i was sitting there going god

3583
02:14:42,399 --> 02:14:47,118
i really wish flo well

3584
02:14:44,319 --> 02:14:51,519
flo again uh breeder steve

3585
02:14:47,118 --> 02:14:54,960
breeder steve recognized flo in 1996

3586
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:56,719
it won the cannabis cup in europe for

3587
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,158
cannabis culture magazine because

3588
02:14:56,719 --> 02:15:00,880
breeder steve was sent over there to

3589
02:14:58,158 --> 02:15:03,198
cover the cannabis cup he sampled all

3590
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:06,319
the varieties that were entered

3591
02:15:03,198 --> 02:15:09,598
and at the time i had been bringing my

3592
02:15:06,319 --> 02:15:11,920
seed getting my seed there in the bud

3593
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:13,199
because to me that was the way to ensure

3594
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:15,440
number one

3595
02:15:13,198 --> 02:15:19,279
authenticity it's in vacuum sealed in

3596
02:15:15,439 --> 02:15:21,439
bud and then number two i have smoke and

3597
02:15:19,279 --> 02:15:24,319
seeded smoke is it's got a special

3598
02:15:21,439 --> 02:15:26,719
characteristic to it um

3599
02:15:24,319 --> 02:15:28,719
and it was some of that seated flow that

3600
02:15:26,719 --> 02:15:30,639
when breeder steve was there we broke it

3601
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:32,319
out rolled up some joints he looks at me

3602
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:34,159
he says this is the best thing i've

3603
02:15:32,319 --> 02:15:38,479
smoked here

3604
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:40,399
so yeah he recognized it in 1996 but for

3605
02:15:38,479 --> 02:15:42,319
anything connoisseur you know it it

3606
02:15:40,399 --> 02:15:44,319
takes a while i think

3607
02:15:42,319 --> 02:15:45,679
for for for it to catch on even if it's

3608
02:15:44,319 --> 02:15:47,039
supposed to

3609
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:48,960
because i don't know

3610
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:52,319
some things get too popular and it sort

3611
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:54,800
of waters them down sometimes too

3612
02:15:52,319 --> 02:15:56,559
yeah no i agree

3613
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:58,239
last little question about the vannaluna

3614
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:59,119
and the leaf variegation i wanted to ask

3615
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:01,198
you is

3616
02:15:59,118 --> 02:16:03,279
had you ever noticed anything about that

3617
02:16:01,198 --> 02:16:05,118
and it did like ever relate to the plant

3618
02:16:03,279 --> 02:16:06,479
because the reason i ask is

3619
02:16:05,118 --> 02:16:08,078
two reasons one

3620
02:16:06,479 --> 02:16:09,759
i've bred a plan which is kind of near

3621
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:11,599
and dear to my heart and it does it and

3622
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:13,039
i haven't really noticed too much effect

3623
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:14,560
except for like you know kind of an

3624
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:15,599
aesthetic appeal which i think a lot of

3625
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:17,520
people like

3626
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:19,440
but on the other end of the spectrum a

3627
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:22,159
really commonly highly regarded cut

3628
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:25,118
within the states the chem dog d

3629
02:16:22,158 --> 02:16:27,279
it does varigation and people uh kind of

3630
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:28,880
view it as like a negative thing and so

3631
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:30,238
i'm wondering where do you see do you do

3632
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:34,239
you think it's purely aesthetic or does

3633
02:16:30,238 --> 02:16:36,638
it play a role um well i think i know

3634
02:16:34,239 --> 02:16:40,959
where it comes from

3635
02:16:36,638 --> 02:16:43,679
and it comes from uh mainly the thai

3636
02:16:40,959 --> 02:16:46,478
uh both chocolate thai and island thai

3637
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:48,799
which in my opinion were subjected at

3638
02:16:46,478 --> 02:16:51,279
some time in their lineage to

3639
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:53,518
what is called a colchicine

3640
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:56,159
regimen

3641
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:59,040
colchicine is a toxic substance it's a

3642
02:16:56,159 --> 02:17:01,679
medicine used to treat gout

3643
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:03,679
it is also um

3644
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:04,960
oh what do you call it when you mix up

3645
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:07,040
genetics

3646
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:07,839
it's a modulator i believe

3647
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:09,439
yep

3648
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:10,159
and uh

3649
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:14,318
the

3650
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:16,239
theory goes you take many seeds

3651
02:17:14,318 --> 02:17:17,920
soak them in culture scene only a few of

3652
02:17:16,239 --> 02:17:19,920
them will sprout and they'll be

3653
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,519
wretchedly deformed

3654
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:24,239
you breed further with them they're

3655
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:26,318
supposed to be toxic actually a few

3656
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:28,879
generations out

3657
02:17:26,318 --> 02:17:32,239
but very specific

3658
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:34,879
uh phenotypic expressions can be

3659
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:36,558
isolated they say well uh seedless

3660
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:39,358
watermelons

3661
02:17:36,558 --> 02:17:41,119
a few other things came from

3662
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:43,439
colchicine

3663
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:44,559
mutagenic

3664
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:45,920
regimen

3665
02:17:44,558 --> 02:17:48,398
and

3666
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:51,920
evidence is the variegation in the leaf

3667
02:17:48,398 --> 02:17:54,239
the twisted curling and also albino

3668
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:56,719
patching in the albino patching is very

3669
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:59,199
geometric

3670
02:17:56,718 --> 02:18:01,598
it happens in specific places and if you

3671
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:03,200
count things out number of leaflets what

3672
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:05,920
side of the leaf you will see the

3673
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:08,479
identical patterns on opposite sides of

3674
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:09,840
the plant

3675
02:18:08,478 --> 02:18:12,558
and it was uh

3676
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:13,760
may have been what made the tie the tie

3677
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:14,959
huh

3678
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:16,559
as well

3679
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:17,759
yeah wow okay

3680
02:18:16,558 --> 02:18:21,199
so

3681
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:23,200
back to kind of one of the strains which

3682
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:24,960
no longer being offered true berry and

3683
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:27,439
that's what combines the indica and the

3684
02:18:24,959 --> 02:18:29,039
sativa sides of the blueberry a lot of

3685
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:31,280
people were just when looking at that

3686
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:34,479
one they might think that that would be

3687
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:36,079
kind of the masterpiece for you do you

3688
02:18:34,478 --> 02:18:37,760
view it like that do you view it as kind

3689
02:18:36,079 --> 02:18:39,760
of the ultimate expression of blueberry

3690
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:42,960
or it's just more of like a cool merging

3691
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:44,639
of the indica in the sativa line yeah uh

3692
02:18:42,959 --> 02:18:47,039
more on the sativa side you're talking

3693
02:18:44,638 --> 02:18:48,799
about the true blueberry yes sorry yeah

3694
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:51,920
and that was that was another one of the

3695
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:54,799
um canadian offerings and it was a

3696
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:54,799
little more sour

3697
02:18:54,959 --> 02:19:00,398
on you know lemony citrus piney side

3698
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:03,280
more

3699
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:04,398
spear-shaped to the buds whereas the

3700
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:07,760
domestic

3701
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:10,398
u.s blueberry is the stretch indica

3702
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:12,478
where you have the nice golf ball bud

3703
02:19:10,398 --> 02:19:14,239
formations um

3704
02:19:12,478 --> 02:19:15,840
placed along

3705
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:19,439
long internodes

3706
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:19,439
uh and a bit sweeter

3707
02:19:19,679 --> 02:19:24,638
but you know again they both they both

3708
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:26,639
have their merit um

3709
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:28,239
and there there was a limited offering

3710
02:19:26,638 --> 02:19:30,638
of those as well

3711
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:32,799
and now they're out floating around uh

3712
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:34,799
doing their thing probably will

3713
02:19:32,799 --> 02:19:36,000
re-release that in some kind of a

3714
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:37,279
throwback

3715
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,280
offering

3716
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:41,280
um again i'm just looking forward to in

3717
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:43,920
the future being able to go back into my

3718
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:46,000
library without being limited so much by

3719
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:48,079
space and time where i can grow out at

3720
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,439
least several hundred plants at a time

3721
02:19:48,079 --> 02:19:50,318
again

3722
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:53,359
and

3723
02:19:50,318 --> 02:19:54,719
search for these various

3724
02:19:53,359 --> 02:19:56,079
expressions

3725
02:19:54,719 --> 02:19:57,840
among others

3726
02:19:56,079 --> 02:19:59,920
there have been things that i've lost

3727
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:02,000
that i want to go back and find i have

3728
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:05,920
notes where they are cherry in

3729
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:08,398
particular very very distinct cherry

3730
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:11,120
yeah okay i mean i don't think anyone

3731
02:20:08,398 --> 02:20:13,279
has ever mentioned cherry as a you know

3732
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:14,640
one of the possible variations from your

3733
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,920
work so that's

3734
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:17,039
i think that'll generate a lot of

3735
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:19,920
interest

3736
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:22,880
yeah uh the woods as well cedar in

3737
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:24,239
particular incense type things

3738
02:20:22,879 --> 02:20:25,839
um

3739
02:20:24,239 --> 02:20:27,600
have merit to me

3740
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:30,639
yeah okay so

3741
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:33,200
um one thing i wanted to ask about was

3742
02:20:30,639 --> 02:20:34,239
velvet rush is this just essentially

3743
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,920
like

3744
02:20:34,239 --> 02:20:38,959
well on paper it looks like it's just

3745
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:40,799
the highland thai afghani it how does it

3746
02:20:38,959 --> 02:20:42,639
differ to that and

3747
02:20:40,799 --> 02:20:45,358
one of the things that says online about

3748
02:20:42,639 --> 02:20:47,039
it is that it's it's quite hard to grow

3749
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:48,318
why where does that comment kind of come

3750
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:50,720
from

3751
02:20:48,318 --> 02:20:52,318
now velvet rush are you talking about

3752
02:20:50,719 --> 02:20:54,799
blue velvet

3753
02:20:52,318 --> 02:20:57,439
well it's just listed purely as velvet

3754
02:20:54,799 --> 02:20:59,519
rush online it says it's just a like an

3755
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:01,040
unknown f generation of the highland

3756
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:02,640
thai afghani that could be totally

3757
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:04,399
incorrect though

3758
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:07,519
yeah no it's not and i don't think it's

3759
02:21:04,398 --> 02:21:09,199
something that that i offer

3760
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:10,560
so it might be somebody else's yeah

3761
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:13,280
someone's doing something with that

3762
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:14,959
there you go so i did have

3763
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:16,720
i did have a blue velvet

3764
02:21:14,959 --> 02:21:18,559
okay and you were you were mentioning

3765
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:20,719
the fox tail

3766
02:21:18,559 --> 02:21:22,398
is that the one in the book where there

3767
02:21:20,719 --> 02:21:24,559
are uh leaves

3768
02:21:22,398 --> 02:21:27,599
like coming out in its long

3769
02:21:24,559 --> 02:21:30,799
thick yeah it was that was mislabeled as

3770
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:33,359
flow that was actually blue velvet

3771
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:34,799
so you know there you go

3772
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:37,120
you're probably aware of this i think

3773
02:21:34,799 --> 02:21:39,519
that photo is one of the most widely

3774
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:42,079
plagiarized photo like i see that photo

3775
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:44,880
on so many strains most notably on you

3776
02:21:42,079 --> 02:21:45,840
know random european websites and stuff

3777
02:21:44,879 --> 02:21:47,759
but

3778
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:49,040
interesting yeah it's a good one i've

3779
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:52,239
seen that one

3780
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:54,479
being labeled as uh dr grinspoon

3781
02:21:52,239 --> 02:21:56,318
you know like that iconic uh calyx

3782
02:21:54,478 --> 02:21:58,318
stacking dr greenspring photo anyway so

3783
02:21:56,318 --> 02:21:59,680
yeah interesting one

3784
02:21:58,318 --> 02:22:01,519
one thing i noticed is whenever i'm

3785
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,040
talking to someone about you know dj

3786
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:05,040
shorts work

3787
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:06,960
i know how they're legit because they'll

3788
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:09,760
say something like yeah do you know

3789
02:22:06,959 --> 02:22:11,199
about toe jam or red-eyed bride and i'll

3790
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:13,040
be like oh this guy knows what he's

3791
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:14,800
talking about can you give us a little

3792
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:16,720
bit of info on those ones the whole

3793
02:22:14,799 --> 02:22:19,599
collaboration process

3794
02:22:16,719 --> 02:22:20,840
yeah chimera again that was when i was

3795
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:23,720
up in uh

3796
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:26,478
vancouver uh mid

3797
02:22:23,719 --> 02:22:27,920
2004-2005 and he was

3798
02:22:26,478 --> 02:22:29,679
establishing his presence in the

3799
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:33,040
community as well

3800
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:35,760
um and doing his thing a lot like

3801
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:38,560
breeder steve but he is more uh

3802
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:40,239
scientific disciplined

3803
02:22:38,559 --> 02:22:43,119
you know focused in that way i think he

3804
02:22:40,239 --> 02:22:44,719
has a degree in in genetics

3805
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:46,800
um up there

3806
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:49,119
doing his thing still i haven't spoken

3807
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:54,000
with these people been in contact in

3808
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:56,399
a long time since since then actually

3809
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,159
well and so those projects were they

3810
02:22:56,398 --> 02:22:59,920
just kind of you know whatever few or

3811
02:22:58,159 --> 02:23:01,600
did you find anything you liked out of

3812
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:02,719
them

3813
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:05,120
um

3814
02:23:02,719 --> 02:23:08,159
again i have so many the

3815
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:11,920
the grow we did it was 600 plants all

3816
02:23:08,159 --> 02:23:14,079
right um africa 18 22 000 watts

3817
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:15,520
something like that old school

3818
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:17,280
hids

3819
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:20,079
um

3820
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:23,280
so there was a lot to look at we had

3821
02:23:20,079 --> 02:23:25,920
i think 12 residence males all from this

3822
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:26,720
one blueberry line when we we picked the

3823
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,680
male

3824
02:23:26,719 --> 02:23:30,879
the b

3825
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:32,639
i forget his number there was a b133 and

3826
02:23:30,879 --> 02:23:34,799
there's probably people online that know

3827
02:23:32,639 --> 02:23:36,799
better than me right now because that's

3828
02:23:34,799 --> 02:23:39,759
legend and it's going around i actually

3829
02:23:36,799 --> 02:23:41,279
have copies of those seeds as well

3830
02:23:39,760 --> 02:23:42,398
um

3831
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:43,520
and it was

3832
02:23:42,398 --> 02:23:46,559
harried

3833
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:50,000
you know there was a lot going on so i

3834
02:23:46,559 --> 02:23:52,879
was pretty much overwhelmed with doing

3835
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:55,359
my own things i was able to

3836
02:23:52,879 --> 02:23:57,358
see other people's things but

3837
02:23:55,359 --> 02:24:01,280
i don't have enough

3838
02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:03,280
real authority to to comment um

3839
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:04,800
one way or another

3840
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:06,399
yeah

3841
02:24:04,799 --> 02:24:07,799
yeah what's interesting is when you

3842
02:24:06,398 --> 02:24:09,358
mentioned that uh

3843
02:24:07,799 --> 02:24:10,639
b133

3844
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:13,040
i'm just looking through the fan

3845
02:24:10,639 --> 02:24:14,879
submitted questions someone actually

3846
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:16,880
submitted that exact question it's like

3847
02:24:14,879 --> 02:24:18,959
can you tell us more about the blueberry

3848
02:24:16,879 --> 02:24:21,920
b133 mail

3849
02:24:18,959 --> 02:24:23,358
yeah i know uh chimera um

3850
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:25,680
was it that one or there was another

3851
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:28,000
mail it was a b something mail and he

3852
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:30,079
selfed the mail

3853
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,760
turned the male female it was another

3854
02:24:30,079 --> 02:24:33,280
process and

3855
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:34,800
made a bunch of those seats i have some

3856
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:37,760
of those as well

3857
02:24:34,799 --> 02:24:38,959
um yeah chimera is very focused

3858
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:41,760
um

3859
02:24:38,959 --> 02:24:43,759
i'm i'm not sure what what he's up to

3860
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:46,559
these days i wish him well

3861
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:48,880
um i know he had some some family issues

3862
02:24:46,559 --> 02:24:52,159
when when i was leaving there and and he

3863
02:24:48,879 --> 02:24:54,398
was dealing with that a lot but i'm

3864
02:24:52,159 --> 02:24:56,159
pretty sure he still has a pretty good

3865
02:24:54,398 --> 02:24:57,840
presence

3866
02:24:56,159 --> 02:24:59,359
in the community i would hope anyhow if

3867
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:00,880
not check them out

3868
02:24:59,359 --> 02:25:03,840
yeah for sure

3869
02:25:00,879 --> 02:25:06,159
do you feel responsible for

3870
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:10,880
having converted a good proportion of

3871
02:25:06,159 --> 02:25:12,398
the community to the 11 13 life cycle

3872
02:25:10,879 --> 02:25:14,159
because i think you should

3873
02:25:12,398 --> 02:25:15,680
oh wow i don't know how much of the

3874
02:25:14,159 --> 02:25:18,079
community is flipped

3875
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:18,720
anyone who's switched on i find is doing

3876
02:25:18,079 --> 02:25:19,760
it

3877
02:25:18,719 --> 02:25:20,799
oh cool

3878
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:23,520
um

3879
02:25:20,799 --> 02:25:26,398
yeah and in all again honesty that came

3880
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:28,479
to me from an old timer uh

3881
02:25:26,398 --> 02:25:30,398
mid 80s

3882
02:25:28,478 --> 02:25:34,159
guy named sonny becker

3883
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:37,039
he passed away of cancer i think in 86

3884
02:25:34,159 --> 02:25:39,520
he was this old biker guy that made

3885
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:42,000
lights i bought my first lights from him

3886
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:44,159
it was a company called agrolight out of

3887
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
junction city oregon

3888
02:25:44,159 --> 02:25:47,840
and it was there at a

3889
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,439
with him and he goes oh make make your

3890
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:51,359
lights near nighttime a little bit

3891
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:54,000
longer than your daytime i'm telling you

3892
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:55,520
it's the thing to do

3893
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,398
and uh

3894
02:25:55,520 --> 02:26:00,000
yeah sunny it was they these these guys

3895
02:25:58,398 --> 02:26:00,799
you know they knew their [ __ ] they were

3896
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,959
um

3897
02:26:00,799 --> 02:26:04,959
wrapping their own ballasts

3898
02:26:02,959 --> 02:26:06,879
all right i mean getting copper wire and

3899
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:08,159
they knew you go so many loops this way

3900
02:26:06,879 --> 02:26:10,559
so when they lose that way you hook it

3901
02:26:08,159 --> 02:26:12,879
to this wire onto this little bulb thing

3902
02:26:10,559 --> 02:26:14,799
put it with this this little capacitor

3903
02:26:12,879 --> 02:26:15,920
and thingy on there and boom you got

3904
02:26:14,799 --> 02:26:17,358
light

3905
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:19,439
um

3906
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:21,680
but he yeah he was the one that passed

3907
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:25,200
it on to me and i had done it ever since

3908
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:25,200
it made perfect sense

3909
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:30,239
plants take in nourishment during the

3910
02:26:28,159 --> 02:26:32,079
day which is light primarily and they

3911
02:26:30,239 --> 02:26:35,199
they put it on at night

3912
02:26:32,079 --> 02:26:36,639
so it can add to production um the main

3913
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:37,520
thing is

3914
02:26:36,639 --> 02:26:40,239
uh

3915
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:44,079
phenotypic reaction you will see

3916
02:26:40,239 --> 02:26:46,719
uh phenotypes that you do not see on the

3917
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:49,200
1212 on certain strains especially a lot

3918
02:26:46,719 --> 02:26:50,959
of mine things will present themselves

3919
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:52,640
that don't present themselves on a 12

3920
02:26:50,959 --> 02:26:55,839
12.

3921
02:26:52,639 --> 02:26:57,840
yep i've i've certainly found that um

3922
02:26:55,840 --> 02:27:00,159
you get like a

3923
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:01,520
a more kind of flavorful and potent

3924
02:27:00,159 --> 02:27:03,359
expression

3925
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:04,720
it's it's so weird but yeah i really do

3926
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:05,920
notice that

3927
02:27:04,719 --> 02:27:07,279
yeah

3928
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:08,719
so it's something i wanted to run by

3929
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:10,560
because we haven't touched on it yet

3930
02:27:08,719 --> 02:27:12,959
what type of growth style do you like to

3931
02:27:10,559 --> 02:27:15,760
use like are you organic are you bottled

3932
02:27:12,959 --> 02:27:18,879
nutrients how do you do it no organic

3933
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:20,318
soil with as few nutrients as possible

3934
02:27:18,879 --> 02:27:23,358
um

3935
02:27:20,318 --> 02:27:25,519
right now the mix i like it comes out of

3936
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:28,720
eugene down to earth

3937
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:31,600
their organic cocoa choir blend is

3938
02:27:28,719 --> 02:27:34,000
really nice there's a company doing worm

3939
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:36,239
castings wonder worm

3940
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,680
out of british columbia that has organic

3941
02:27:36,239 --> 02:27:42,959
worm castings very pure very nice

3942
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:42,960
fortified the soil

3943
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:48,479
had some people that were working i was

3944
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:50,079
going to do some branding thing for an

3945
02:27:48,478 --> 02:27:51,679
organic soil they were doing that was

3946
02:27:50,079 --> 02:27:56,478
water only

3947
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:57,600
uh complete water only soil and um

3948
02:27:56,478 --> 02:28:00,639
that they're they're waiting for

3949
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:02,079
certification they're up in seattle

3950
02:28:00,639 --> 02:28:04,799
um

3951
02:28:02,079 --> 02:28:05,760
and i need to test it myself i haven't

3952
02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:07,599
yet

3953
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:10,478
um but other than that yeah just

3954
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:13,120
fortifying the soil uh plus outdoor i

3955
02:28:10,478 --> 02:28:14,719
prefer outdoor over indoor

3956
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:16,880
definitely

3957
02:28:14,719 --> 02:28:18,719
it's such a waste you know

3958
02:28:16,879 --> 02:28:21,599
just such a waste

3959
02:28:18,719 --> 02:28:24,239
i forget what it was 800 pounds of coal

3960
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:27,280
to make one pound of pot

3961
02:28:24,239 --> 02:28:29,199
in terms of electricity how accurate

3962
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:31,120
that is you know i don't know but it's

3963
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:33,680
been bandied about a lot

3964
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:35,600
um any any when you've got the big

3965
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:36,559
highlight in the sky

3966
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:39,040
um

3967
02:28:36,559 --> 02:28:42,079
places like southern nevada

3968
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:44,960
especially california

3969
02:28:42,079 --> 02:28:46,719
just the opportunities there

3970
02:28:44,959 --> 02:28:48,719
michigan where you have

3971
02:28:46,719 --> 02:28:50,719
incredible soil

3972
02:28:48,719 --> 02:28:53,519
michigan has really unique soil

3973
02:28:50,719 --> 02:28:55,599
composites and places that make

3974
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:56,880
unique cherries and apples and i know

3975
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,040
that the herb

3976
02:28:56,879 --> 02:29:00,159
you know can find its sweet spots there

3977
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:03,120
as well

3978
02:29:00,159 --> 02:29:05,600
um sweet spots outdoors

3979
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:06,840
so yep our organic soil all the way if

3980
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:09,840
you're going to do

3981
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:12,000
hydro aquaponics

3982
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:14,960
that is uh organic

3983
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:18,639
hydroponics the way to go flavor is just

3984
02:29:14,959 --> 02:29:20,799
just great all the way around so

3985
02:29:18,639 --> 02:29:22,559
that's my preference

3986
02:29:20,799 --> 02:29:24,639
for sure and then do you find that

3987
02:29:22,559 --> 02:29:26,398
that's purely a preferencing or do you

3988
02:29:24,639 --> 02:29:28,879
find that kind of like the medicinal

3989
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:31,920
properties and the more kind of complex

3990
02:29:28,879 --> 02:29:34,318
and nuanced parts are more pronounced in

3991
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:34,318
organic

3992
02:29:34,478 --> 02:29:39,438
well i haven't done it any other way so

3993
02:29:36,959 --> 02:29:41,438
i don't have the comparison to make i

3994
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:42,800
would just it just makes common sense

3995
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:44,159
you know yeah

3996
02:29:42,799 --> 02:29:45,599
though those things you're putting in

3997
02:29:44,159 --> 02:29:48,799
the plan the fiber of that plant if

3998
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:51,760
you're smoking it in in terms of a whole

3999
02:29:48,799 --> 02:29:52,639
plant in a joint or a bowl

4000
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:54,719
um

4001
02:29:52,639 --> 02:29:58,478
you're consuming those things in your

4002
02:29:54,719 --> 02:30:00,159
lungs through your lungs all right

4003
02:29:58,478 --> 02:30:04,639
nobody studies that

4004
02:30:00,159 --> 02:30:07,200
fda doesn't study smoking fertilizers

4005
02:30:04,639 --> 02:30:09,119
the eating yeah but eating is a is a

4006
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:10,560
completely different

4007
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:12,960
process so

4008
02:30:10,559 --> 02:30:15,359
where are the guinea pigs so far so good

4009
02:30:12,959 --> 02:30:18,079
though i think the cannabis acts enough

4010
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:20,239
as a protectant that

4011
02:30:18,079 --> 02:30:22,000
whatever nasty things ends up in there

4012
02:30:20,239 --> 02:30:22,799
uh it kind of

4013
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,239
gets

4014
02:30:22,799 --> 02:30:26,398
compensated for somehow by the

4015
02:30:24,239 --> 02:30:27,439
cannabinoids

4016
02:30:26,398 --> 02:30:28,559
yeah

4017
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:30,559
so

4018
02:30:28,559 --> 02:30:32,478
when you're at events you know the cups

4019
02:30:30,559 --> 02:30:34,239
and whatnot i'm sure plenty of people

4020
02:30:32,478 --> 02:30:36,478
come up and maybe they want to show you

4021
02:30:34,239 --> 02:30:38,318
some of your work they've grown out how

4022
02:30:36,478 --> 02:30:40,079
often is it that you'll smoke something

4023
02:30:38,318 --> 02:30:42,478
of that and you're really kind of blown

4024
02:30:40,079 --> 02:30:42,478
away

4025
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:48,560
it happens it does um and i do sample

4026
02:30:46,799 --> 02:30:50,000
everything people give me

4027
02:30:48,559 --> 02:30:53,119
um

4028
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,879
i think the best compliment would be

4029
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:56,800
what i return to

4030
02:30:54,879 --> 02:30:59,279
if i go to something the second or third

4031
02:30:56,799 --> 02:31:02,318
time it's like okay yeah

4032
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:05,600
that's got my interest i will say this

4033
02:31:02,318 --> 02:31:07,119
that what i have done with

4034
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:08,880
these samples people give me as i has

4035
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:11,680
been saving them

4036
02:31:08,879 --> 02:31:15,199
and i had been collecting them for about

4037
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:17,760
10 years and i had a four or five pounds

4038
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:20,720
and i knew a processor somebody i really

4039
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:23,359
liked his his method it was butane but

4040
02:31:20,719 --> 02:31:25,358
he was very very honest game

4041
02:31:23,359 --> 02:31:29,200
and i see here you do something with

4042
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:31,120
this and he made a shatter out of that

4043
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:32,880
and he named it and i thought it was

4044
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:34,720
very appropriate he called it the

4045
02:31:32,879 --> 02:31:36,159
people's choice

4046
02:31:34,719 --> 02:31:38,239
because it was everybody's stuff in

4047
02:31:36,159 --> 02:31:39,920
there so now

4048
02:31:38,239 --> 02:31:41,680
when as people give me stuff i let

4049
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:43,920
people know hey this is going to go in

4050
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:46,398
the next batch of the people's choice

4051
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:48,159
and we're about six years away from it i

4052
02:31:46,398 --> 02:31:52,318
think right now but

4053
02:31:48,159 --> 02:31:55,119
um when it and it was amazing it was

4054
02:31:52,318 --> 02:31:57,600
some of the best stuff i had smoked

4055
02:31:55,120 --> 02:32:00,319
in in quite a while

4056
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:02,079
uh and it's it's gone unfortunately i

4057
02:32:00,318 --> 02:32:03,359
have little i have some of it stuck to

4058
02:32:02,079 --> 02:32:05,600
the paper

4059
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:08,640
you know for one of those oh

4060
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:10,640
i need to visit this again one more time

4061
02:32:08,639 --> 02:32:11,519
but yeah the the people's choice it was

4062
02:32:10,639 --> 02:32:15,920
dark

4063
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:18,319
it smelled like top shelf moroccan hash

4064
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:19,920
and had that flavor too that kind of

4065
02:32:18,318 --> 02:32:22,239
sandalwood

4066
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:25,040
flavor to it um

4067
02:32:22,239 --> 02:32:26,799
very pleasant very pleasant

4068
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:28,479
that's a good story i like that one

4069
02:32:26,799 --> 02:32:31,119
there you go now now everyone knows what

4070
02:32:28,478 --> 02:32:32,239
they're contributing to

4071
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:34,000
so um

4072
02:32:32,239 --> 02:32:35,520
this was a little personal one i wanted

4073
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:38,478
to ask you

4074
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:41,120
i grew out a pack of blueberry and

4075
02:32:38,478 --> 02:32:44,159
i found that the the keeper so to speak

4076
02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:46,240
from that packet it was kind of almost a

4077
02:32:44,159 --> 02:32:48,239
bit skunky you might it might sound

4078
02:32:46,239 --> 02:32:50,559
weird right it was a bit skunky after

4079
02:32:48,239 --> 02:32:53,039
smoking a lot of it it i had this kind

4080
02:32:50,559 --> 02:32:55,760
of epiphany it clicked on me it was like

4081
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:59,280
the blueberry profile to me is like

4082
02:32:55,760 --> 02:33:01,920
skunk like a cheesy skunk with an extra

4083
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:03,439
sweet component on the top it's almost

4084
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:06,398
if you broke blueberry down into say

4085
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:08,398
like a top end a middle and a bottom the

4086
02:33:06,398 --> 02:33:10,559
cheesy skunk is the bottom two but it's

4087
02:33:08,398 --> 02:33:12,079
missing the top have you ever noticed

4088
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:13,600
anything like that like i mean it's

4089
02:33:12,079 --> 02:33:15,439
probably just a really weird question to

4090
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:17,760
ask but it just blew my mind and i was

4091
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:19,439
just like wow like because at first i

4092
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:21,760
was like how did i get this weird kind

4093
02:33:19,439 --> 02:33:24,479
of skunky pheno but it makes perfect

4094
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:26,318
sense and i you know i adore it

4095
02:33:24,478 --> 02:33:28,398
yeah yeah no it does

4096
02:33:26,318 --> 02:33:31,359
and and those things present themselves

4097
02:33:28,398 --> 02:33:34,959
i refer to it as musky

4098
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:34,960
for what i get is the skunk

4099
02:33:35,439 --> 02:33:40,079
yeah

4100
02:33:36,559 --> 02:33:43,359
it's loamy almost kind of loamy

4101
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:46,159
and the other uh side of that when it

4102
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:49,359
doesn't quite

4103
02:33:46,159 --> 02:33:51,600
get to blueberry is anise

4104
02:33:49,359 --> 02:33:52,559
or licorice

4105
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:55,439
um

4106
02:33:52,559 --> 02:33:58,239
and if you can get that licorice nice

4107
02:33:55,439 --> 02:34:00,479
and sweet the the three day dark before

4108
02:33:58,239 --> 02:34:02,799
the the chop helps a lot with those

4109
02:34:00,478 --> 02:34:04,159
particular phenotypes

4110
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:05,519
um

4111
02:34:04,159 --> 02:34:07,920
and uh

4112
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:10,720
yeah so so that's that's kind of what i

4113
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:13,040
look for but the sweet getting that

4114
02:34:10,719 --> 02:34:14,398
sweet in there is important

4115
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:17,359
yeah okay

4116
02:34:14,398 --> 02:34:19,599
and so one thing i wanted to run by you

4117
02:34:17,359 --> 02:34:21,120
basically was i don't know if this is

4118
02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:22,399
true you so you might you know you might

4119
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:25,040
be able to set the record straight but

4120
02:34:22,398 --> 02:34:27,920
basically i was reading uh

4121
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:30,479
some kind of history blurb from vic high

4122
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:33,280
the breeder from british columbia seed

4123
02:34:30,478 --> 02:34:35,119
organization association i believe um

4124
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:37,040
you know really famous breeder sadly

4125
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:38,720
passed away not too long ago but in one

4126
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:40,319
of his strains there's some blueberry

4127
02:34:38,719 --> 02:34:42,639
genetics in there and it has this little

4128
02:34:40,318 --> 02:34:45,359
note it says oh please note our

4129
02:34:42,639 --> 02:34:48,318
blueberry derives from different origins

4130
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:50,079
to dj shorts and it made me think are

4131
02:34:48,318 --> 02:34:51,760
you aware of any blueberry that's

4132
02:34:50,079 --> 02:34:53,600
derived from anything other than your

4133
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:55,040
work like someone who's just happened to

4134
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:56,399
cross a and b and they're like i got

4135
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:57,680
this really blueberry type of thing like

4136
02:34:56,398 --> 02:34:59,039
because i'm not aware of anything like

4137
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:02,880
that

4138
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:05,040
well no not specifically but how many

4139
02:35:02,879 --> 02:35:07,759
things are floating around out there

4140
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:10,800
through how many hands

4141
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:13,439
you know that can claim credit

4142
02:35:10,799 --> 02:35:17,039
that can appear to be something unique

4143
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:19,920
philos is where to look for that

4144
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,880
you know what's what's related to what

4145
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:22,000
and

4146
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:23,759
some of the

4147
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,639
initial findings

4148
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:27,200
from

4149
02:35:24,639 --> 02:35:30,478
years ago when they did their

4150
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:33,840
first runs was that 80 to 85 percent of

4151
02:35:30,478 --> 02:35:36,079
every hybrid out there had some marker

4152
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:41,680
of what i submitted

4153
02:35:36,079 --> 02:35:43,600
um in in an inherited sense so

4154
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:45,520
yeah do you think that's accurate

4155
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:48,000
because that i mean like that does seem

4156
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:50,479
like a little high to be honest

4157
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,559
it wouldn't surprise me

4158
02:35:50,478 --> 02:35:56,318
for a number of reasons

4159
02:35:52,559 --> 02:35:59,119
um it wasn't i mean i i entered the seed

4160
02:35:56,318 --> 02:36:01,199
market in the mid 90s

4161
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:05,600
but you got to remember i was said doing

4162
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:07,280
clones out to the public since 79 and i

4163
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:10,640
know a lot of those went to northern

4164
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:12,960
california southern oregon

4165
02:36:10,639 --> 02:36:15,840
all over the place

4166
02:36:12,959 --> 02:36:18,559
seeds i was giving seeds i was

4167
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:20,000
at the time supplementing by dealing

4168
02:36:18,559 --> 02:36:23,519
whatever i had

4169
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:24,959
i had a lot of foreign student um

4170
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:27,200
clientele

4171
02:36:24,959 --> 02:36:29,199
who i you know oh hey can you give me

4172
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:31,120
some c's yeah sure here fine whatever or

4173
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:33,040
i would be doing r d work and there

4174
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:35,120
would be some seeds and whatever i was

4175
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:36,560
working with at the time that got passed

4176
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:38,319
on to other people

4177
02:36:36,559 --> 02:36:40,559
would say oh by the way i sent that to

4178
02:36:38,318 --> 02:36:43,119
my uncle in morocco or

4179
02:36:40,559 --> 02:36:45,680
australia they went us to japan

4180
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:47,840
i made a list one time was almost 60

4181
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:49,359
countries wow

4182
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:52,079
yeah so

4183
02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:54,880
no it wouldn't wouldn't surprise me

4184
02:36:52,079 --> 02:36:58,318
yeah okay that's that's a good answer so

4185
02:36:54,879 --> 02:37:00,879
uh one thing i wanted to ask you was

4186
02:36:58,318 --> 02:37:03,199
i i have a feeling you would have to be

4187
02:37:00,879 --> 02:37:06,719
one of the most ripped off slash you

4188
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:08,560
know replicated breeders out there

4189
02:37:06,719 --> 02:37:10,079
is that do you view that as a compliment

4190
02:37:08,559 --> 02:37:12,159
or is it more of like a challenge

4191
02:37:10,079 --> 02:37:13,920
because i think for a long time a lot of

4192
02:37:12,159 --> 02:37:15,760
people had issues

4193
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:18,239
getting you know quote unquote your

4194
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:19,760
seeds from seed banks and then only to

4195
02:37:18,239 --> 02:37:21,680
find out that the reality is they

4196
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:23,840
probably weren't your seeds

4197
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:26,639
yeah you just gave me a new term um

4198
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:27,680
complementary challenge yeah yeah that's

4199
02:37:26,639 --> 02:37:28,799
it

4200
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:30,318
um

4201
02:37:28,799 --> 02:37:32,559
yeah uh

4202
02:37:30,318 --> 02:37:35,039
i like to you know cap that off with

4203
02:37:32,559 --> 02:37:36,318
this and just say hey the best is yet to

4204
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:38,640
come

4205
02:37:36,318 --> 02:37:41,039
all right let's let's focus on the

4206
02:37:38,639 --> 02:37:42,159
future let's move forward

4207
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:44,960
um

4208
02:37:42,159 --> 02:37:48,719
i just need my space my time and to be

4209
02:37:44,959 --> 02:37:52,239
left alone and i'll do just fine

4210
02:37:48,719 --> 02:37:53,519
and i'm looking forward to sharing that

4211
02:37:52,239 --> 02:37:57,039
with whomever

4212
02:37:53,520 --> 02:38:00,319
uh appreciates it so

4213
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:02,319
fantastic so i think we might jump into

4214
02:38:00,318 --> 02:38:05,279
some of the fan submitted questions

4215
02:38:02,318 --> 02:38:06,879
we've got a good bunch here we'll um

4216
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:08,960
we'll scroll down to one of the ones i

4217
02:38:06,879 --> 02:38:12,000
wanted to ask first our good friend

4218
02:38:08,959 --> 02:38:15,759
bodie wanted to know if you could talk a

4219
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:17,600
little more about uh your experience and

4220
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:19,920
opinions on

4221
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:21,840
using psychedelics as a tool to assist

4222
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:24,000
with breeding

4223
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:26,239
oh yeah no it's just a

4224
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:27,439
general life

4225
02:38:26,239 --> 02:38:29,840
rule

4226
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:30,960
you know for me

4227
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,840
yeah

4228
02:38:30,959 --> 02:38:33,919
people

4229
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:36,000
there's a the concept of altering

4230
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:37,359
consciousness first of all

4231
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,840
which is what

4232
02:38:37,359 --> 02:38:43,680
makes the the our detractors nervous

4233
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:45,200
that's what makes them uptight

4234
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:47,760
that

4235
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:49,200
we alter our consciousness

4236
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:51,280
and somehow yet

4237
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:52,319
you know have control over it

4238
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:55,040
um

4239
02:38:52,318 --> 02:38:59,680
it's difficult for some people to to

4240
02:38:55,040 --> 02:39:01,040
grasp at any rate utilizing and for me

4241
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:03,040
the the concept of an altered

4242
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:06,640
consciousness gives me what i like to

4243
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:08,080
refer to as a stereoscopic view of

4244
02:39:06,639 --> 02:39:11,439
reality

4245
02:39:08,079 --> 02:39:15,760
i have my baseline state how i perceive

4246
02:39:11,439 --> 02:39:17,920
life anything challenge or obstacle any

4247
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:20,559
decision i have to make and then i have

4248
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:22,799
my altered state where i can consider

4249
02:39:20,559 --> 02:39:24,879
the same things and you can bounce back

4250
02:39:22,799 --> 02:39:27,599
and forth between the two

4251
02:39:24,879 --> 02:39:29,759
and kind of get a little bit broader of

4252
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:31,520
a sense of you know at least what

4253
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:34,000
opportunities

4254
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:37,680
exist

4255
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:41,600
so utilizing it as a tool

4256
02:39:37,680 --> 02:39:42,800
in that regard it it opens sensitivity

4257
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,680
all right

4258
02:39:42,799 --> 02:39:46,478
so

4259
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:48,159
it puts me more in a place of where say

4260
02:39:46,478 --> 02:39:51,519
someone

4261
02:39:48,159 --> 02:39:54,639
in a schizophrenic state maybe or in any

4262
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:55,840
state of disease or distress

4263
02:39:54,639 --> 02:39:57,199
um

4264
02:39:55,840 --> 02:40:00,239
and how

4265
02:39:57,200 --> 02:40:02,880
how am i reacting to that when i consume

4266
02:40:00,239 --> 02:40:04,719
this herb does it help the situation or

4267
02:40:02,879 --> 02:40:07,279
does it you know

4268
02:40:04,719 --> 02:40:09,920
impede make a little worse

4269
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:11,600
make note of that

4270
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:12,719
because the herbs that generally tend to

4271
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:15,840
calm

4272
02:40:12,719 --> 02:40:19,278
in a psychedelic situation

4273
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:22,079
tend to bring that in

4274
02:40:19,279 --> 02:40:24,720
baseline or non-psychedelic state but

4275
02:40:22,079 --> 02:40:27,520
cannabis is a mild psychedelic in and of

4276
02:40:24,719 --> 02:40:30,559
itself so

4277
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:32,640
and so what are some of your preferred

4278
02:40:30,559 --> 02:40:35,899
psychedelics

4279
02:40:32,639 --> 02:40:39,439
oh any you know all the indole range

4280
02:40:35,899 --> 02:40:41,359
[Laughter]

4281
02:40:39,439 --> 02:40:42,159
providing they're pure

4282
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:44,479
all right

4283
02:40:42,159 --> 02:40:46,959
pure um for

4284
02:40:44,478 --> 02:40:48,559
fungal i like things that are naturally

4285
02:40:46,959 --> 02:40:51,679
collected

4286
02:40:48,559 --> 02:40:53,600
if not then naturally grown

4287
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:54,720
by sincere

4288
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:56,399
people

4289
02:40:54,719 --> 02:40:58,879
um

4290
02:40:56,398 --> 02:41:01,199
and yeah they all work

4291
02:40:58,879 --> 02:41:04,478
yeah great

4292
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:07,520
so um one of the questions is what were

4293
02:41:04,478 --> 02:41:09,438
some of the original flavors smells and

4294
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:10,800
structure of the ties that you're

4295
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:12,559
working with obviously you touched on

4296
02:41:10,799 --> 02:41:14,398
this a little before but i think they're

4297
02:41:12,559 --> 02:41:16,000
most interested in the flavors like what

4298
02:41:14,398 --> 02:41:18,478
were the different flavor expressions

4299
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:21,200
you were getting

4300
02:41:18,478 --> 02:41:23,278
in the land race thai yeah

4301
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:27,040
yeah um

4302
02:41:23,279 --> 02:41:30,479
the smell of the flower was just juicy

4303
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:34,479
fruit old school tutti fruity juicy

4304
02:41:30,478 --> 02:41:36,000
fruit gum sweet as can be

4305
02:41:34,478 --> 02:41:38,478
and yet with that

4306
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,760
tropical sharpness

4307
02:41:38,478 --> 02:41:42,159
to it

4308
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:44,880
in the smoke it had

4309
02:41:42,159 --> 02:41:47,119
the fruitiness kind of more of the mango

4310
02:41:44,879 --> 02:41:49,119
so i would assume mercene

4311
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:53,439
uh would have been in there

4312
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:55,840
uh piney sweet cedars more woody

4313
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:59,840
um in the in the smoke

4314
02:41:55,840 --> 02:42:02,239
but the it was just juicy fruit gum

4315
02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:03,920
very difficult to manicure i kind of had

4316
02:42:02,239 --> 02:42:07,039
to just leave

4317
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:09,359
the brack leaves on and run them up the

4318
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:11,279
stem and sort of squish them into a bag

4319
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:13,439
and hope that they

4320
02:42:11,279 --> 02:42:17,439
i think they were more fermenting than

4321
02:42:13,439 --> 02:42:20,398
curing but no that finished product was

4322
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:23,920
pretty wonderful and it had no ceiling

4323
02:42:20,398 --> 02:42:23,920
oh that stuff was dangerous

4324
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,799
yeah i'm really just so incredibly

4325
02:42:26,478 --> 02:42:32,159
grateful to have been able to try some

4326
02:42:28,799 --> 02:42:34,239
highland tie that bodhi grew out um

4327
02:42:32,159 --> 02:42:35,920
and that has got to be some of the

4328
02:42:34,239 --> 02:42:38,000
absolute best herb i've ever had in my

4329
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:40,559
life it was easily the standout herb of

4330
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:42,000
the last trip i did to the states and i

4331
02:42:40,559 --> 02:42:43,359
was trying to describe it to a friend

4332
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:46,000
and i was just like

4333
02:42:43,359 --> 02:42:48,000
it's like you know you're at a party and

4334
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:50,879
everyone's having a great time it just

4335
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:53,680
feels like it felt so good but um

4336
02:42:50,879 --> 02:42:56,879
yeah it's interesting stuff and he's uh

4337
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:58,398
very different to the super racy tie but

4338
02:42:56,879 --> 02:42:59,759
yeah right

4339
02:42:58,398 --> 02:43:02,000
and you asked actually about the land

4340
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:04,079
race and i just asked answered about the

4341
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:05,920
p1's i grew from the land race the land

4342
02:43:04,079 --> 02:43:08,478
race tie

4343
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:10,239
the stick or the untied

4344
02:43:08,478 --> 02:43:13,599
that stuff was

4345
02:43:10,239 --> 02:43:16,318
again just so unique

4346
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:17,600
some of it the curing process on the

4347
02:43:16,318 --> 02:43:20,000
stick

4348
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:21,840
involved fermenting

4349
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:23,840
which is a process that's used with

4350
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:25,760
tobacco

4351
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:28,000
and it's interesting it involves water

4352
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:30,559
soaking and then pressure

4353
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:33,520
and a very specific

4354
02:43:30,559 --> 02:43:34,639
mold or yeast to the

4355
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:37,120
host

4356
02:43:34,639 --> 02:43:38,559
plant has to be present and nothing else

4357
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:39,840
and and

4358
02:43:38,559 --> 02:43:40,879
um

4359
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:42,159
it

4360
02:43:40,879 --> 02:43:44,159
it was like

4361
02:43:42,159 --> 02:43:46,879
it was like thai food

4362
02:43:44,159 --> 02:43:48,639
all right sweet savory

4363
02:43:46,879 --> 02:43:50,639
um

4364
02:43:48,639 --> 02:43:52,159
it was just unique

4365
02:43:50,639 --> 02:43:53,920
it was not

4366
02:43:52,159 --> 02:43:57,520
you know the the

4367
02:43:53,920 --> 02:44:00,398
what i grew from it was close

4368
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:03,279
in a domestic sense but nothing like

4369
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:06,079
what came from thailand

4370
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:07,520
that stuff was just

4371
02:44:06,079 --> 02:44:09,920
amazing

4372
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:12,000
uh tropical fruit

4373
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:14,000
hawaiian punch

4374
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:18,398
only was you know a bit of a

4375
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:19,840
fermentation to it um

4376
02:44:18,398 --> 02:44:23,119
it was nice

4377
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:24,559
yeah well that that sounds great it's um

4378
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:26,800
bringing bringing some memories i had a

4379
02:44:24,559 --> 02:44:29,519
conversation with an old-timer i met not

4380
02:44:26,799 --> 02:44:31,599
long ago and and he lives uh in

4381
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:33,600
australia and he tries to grow those

4382
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:35,120
tyres you talk about and he was talking

4383
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:37,200
about how he's trying to replicate that

4384
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:38,880
terroir and you know trying to get it as

4385
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:41,359
close to thailand as possible and he

4386
02:44:38,879 --> 02:44:44,478
said just as a little side note the

4387
02:44:41,359 --> 02:44:47,040
biggest impactful thing he found was he

4388
02:44:44,478 --> 02:44:49,278
put heating mats under his pots because

4389
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:51,600
he found that rooting the heat ball to

4390
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:52,960
like 25 degrees like basically he said

4391
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:54,800
it would never really get colder than

4392
02:44:52,959 --> 02:44:57,039
that in thailand or where the seed stock

4393
02:44:54,799 --> 02:44:59,438
he was grown and he said it made a huge

4394
02:44:57,040 --> 02:45:02,000
difference phenotypically and i was like

4395
02:44:59,439 --> 02:45:04,639
that's that's food for thought

4396
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:06,159
yeah yeah what what little tricks i was

4397
02:45:04,639 --> 02:45:08,799
just reading

4398
02:45:06,159 --> 02:45:09,840
something on the on the thai stick i

4399
02:45:08,799 --> 02:45:10,879
don't know if it was in the book thai

4400
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:13,279
stick

4401
02:45:10,879 --> 02:45:16,398
um

4402
02:45:13,279 --> 02:45:20,800
that the thai people would let their

4403
02:45:16,398 --> 02:45:24,398
babies the infants sleep on the bales

4404
02:45:20,799 --> 02:45:26,959
wow good sweet dreams

4405
02:45:24,398 --> 02:45:28,398
um yeah yeah

4406
02:45:26,959 --> 02:45:31,358
there was a lot of things went out with

4407
02:45:28,398 --> 02:45:33,680
the tie some of it had opium um in it

4408
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:36,800
which was just soaked in the water left

4409
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:40,159
over from cooking out heroin

4410
02:45:36,799 --> 02:45:42,719
uh from the opium and um that that that

4411
02:45:40,159 --> 02:45:45,279
was potent you did not want to be out

4412
02:45:42,719 --> 02:45:47,760
drinking and smoke any of that

4413
02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:49,520
yeah that's i almost like wish i could

4414
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:52,000
have tried some of that but not at the

4415
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:52,000
same time

4416
02:45:52,079 --> 02:45:56,719
so the next question we have is that

4417
02:45:54,079 --> 02:45:58,559
iconic photo of you in the uh the sports

4418
02:45:56,719 --> 02:46:00,799
coat holding the plan outside in your

4419
02:45:58,559 --> 02:46:02,879
younger days with the long hair

4420
02:46:00,799 --> 02:46:04,879
what year was that

4421
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:06,478
1979

4422
02:46:04,879 --> 02:46:09,199
wow and what plant is that one in your

4423
02:46:06,478 --> 02:46:11,199
hand that plant in my hand wow i'm glad

4424
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:13,680
you asked i wonder if you got a picture

4425
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:15,359
you can throw that out there um that is

4426
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:18,639
the chocolate tie

4427
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:20,880
and it is seated um it was the name of

4428
02:46:18,639 --> 02:46:22,318
that plant at the time was patio door

4429
02:46:20,879 --> 02:46:25,519
because it was the plant that was right

4430
02:46:22,318 --> 02:46:28,478
outside my patio door

4431
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:31,439
uh in the ground it wasn't in a pot and

4432
02:46:28,478 --> 02:46:33,039
um yeah that's chocolate tie

4433
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:34,880
wow that's yeah that's a real history

4434
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:36,160
photo so it would definitely work one of

4435
02:46:34,879 --> 02:46:37,759
those up

4436
02:46:36,159 --> 02:46:38,559
next question which i think is a great

4437
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:40,639
one

4438
02:46:38,559 --> 02:46:42,719
do you remember the first time you ever

4439
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:45,199
hit that weed whether you know whatever

4440
02:46:42,719 --> 02:46:47,358
bong joint whatever and you got that

4441
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:49,920
defined blueberry taste do you remember

4442
02:46:47,359 --> 02:46:49,920
that time

4443
02:46:50,398 --> 02:46:57,599
yeah that would have been doing the f2s

4444
02:46:54,079 --> 02:47:00,639
um so that would have been 1980 or so

4445
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:04,640
and again back then it was

4446
02:47:00,639 --> 02:47:06,478
it was the kind it was just this oh my

4447
02:47:04,639 --> 02:47:09,439
open it was it was uh

4448
02:47:06,478 --> 02:47:10,959
more of a dilator effect and anything

4449
02:47:09,439 --> 02:47:12,239
constrictive

4450
02:47:10,959 --> 02:47:13,839
it was the exact opposite of

4451
02:47:12,239 --> 02:47:16,318
constrictive

4452
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:19,760
uh which is you know kind of a

4453
02:47:16,318 --> 02:47:21,840
fruit experience you know your your body

4454
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:22,800
takes it in it's nourishing it tastes

4455
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:26,000
good

4456
02:47:22,799 --> 02:47:28,318
it's it's it just has this appeal

4457
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:30,639
um just just

4458
02:47:28,318 --> 02:47:33,278
overall holistically

4459
02:47:30,639 --> 02:47:36,318
yeah but yes i i and not the you know

4460
02:47:33,279 --> 02:47:37,439
maybe the exact time in and around then

4461
02:47:36,318 --> 02:47:40,879
um

4462
02:47:37,439 --> 02:47:43,760
it was such a whirlwind uh what i

4463
02:47:40,879 --> 02:47:45,679
experienced in oregon um at that time

4464
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:47,520
coming from detroit

4465
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:49,840
just learning

4466
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:51,279
pot grew there

4467
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:53,600
um

4468
02:47:51,279 --> 02:47:53,600
you know

4469
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:58,239
how easily um

4470
02:47:56,478 --> 02:48:02,478
and and how

4471
02:47:58,239 --> 02:48:05,039
uh the quality compared to you know

4472
02:48:02,478 --> 02:48:08,799
getting the usual dirt weed

4473
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:11,120
even b-grade dirt weed or stumbling upon

4474
02:48:08,799 --> 02:48:14,559
some some a grade

4475
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:14,560
now and again when you're lucky

4476
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:19,439
but it it was uh

4477
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:20,479
quite the eye-opener

4478
02:48:19,439 --> 02:48:22,159
yeah

4479
02:48:20,478 --> 02:48:24,000
and so

4480
02:48:22,159 --> 02:48:27,279
um

4481
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:30,159
new things were constant

4482
02:48:27,279 --> 02:48:32,800
just constant i would have several jars

4483
02:48:30,159 --> 02:48:35,200
of things go oh my god it was this is

4484
02:48:32,799 --> 02:48:37,920
new and that is new and

4485
02:48:35,200 --> 02:48:40,720
and always striving a little better too

4486
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:41,439
you know making it uh better here and

4487
02:48:40,719 --> 02:48:43,119
and

4488
02:48:41,439 --> 02:48:44,720
picking the next

4489
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:48,240
oh yeah you're a little better than your

4490
02:48:44,719 --> 02:48:50,639
mom and and going that route

4491
02:48:48,239 --> 02:48:51,680
yeah striving to do better then i like

4492
02:48:50,639 --> 02:48:52,639
that

4493
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:54,318
so

4494
02:48:52,639 --> 02:48:57,278
another really interesting question we

4495
02:48:54,318 --> 02:48:59,359
got from our friend true cannabilis is

4496
02:48:57,279 --> 02:49:01,760
he says that he read a while ago that

4497
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:04,000
you liked you know maybe preferentially

4498
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:06,398
to kind of smoke buds that had been

4499
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:08,398
pollinated because you kind of enjoyed

4500
02:49:06,398 --> 02:49:09,439
the the changes that went on within the

4501
02:49:08,398 --> 02:49:11,760
plan on

4502
02:49:09,439 --> 02:49:13,439
the biology level could you talk to us a

4503
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:14,960
little more about that like what kind of

4504
02:49:13,439 --> 02:49:17,120
is it you enjoy about these seeded

4505
02:49:14,959 --> 02:49:20,639
plants like do you find them to be more

4506
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:23,120
relaxing or what is it for you

4507
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:25,760
yeah relaxing is is a good way

4508
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:27,040
one one of the aspects

4509
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:29,200
it's a

4510
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:31,520
the term i like is broader

4511
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:35,200
it's just a broader experience

4512
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:37,520
that plant had that seeded was able to

4513
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:40,079
complete its life cycle instead of being

4514
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:41,760
stuck before completing his like cycle

4515
02:49:40,079 --> 02:49:43,039
and then being harvested

4516
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:45,840
and there's just something about it a

4517
02:49:43,040 --> 02:49:48,720
maturity to the resins

4518
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:51,600
um and historically all of the great

4519
02:49:48,719 --> 02:49:52,840
herb that i've i've mentioned

4520
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:55,200
came you know they were all

4521
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:58,159
hermaphroditic and all at least somewhat

4522
02:49:55,200 --> 02:50:02,240
seated and all of the great hash came

4523
02:49:58,159 --> 02:50:04,639
from field run uh hash or hand rubbed

4524
02:50:02,239 --> 02:50:06,559
that was usually hermaphroditic and and

4525
02:50:04,639 --> 02:50:07,519
seeded as well

4526
02:50:06,559 --> 02:50:09,278
so

4527
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:10,560
plus i've had

4528
02:50:09,279 --> 02:50:12,720
you know

4529
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:13,519
i've had to smoke a lot of seeded herb

4530
02:50:12,719 --> 02:50:16,159
in my day

4531
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:18,800
[Laughter]

4532
02:50:16,159 --> 02:50:22,318
yeah that's a good point

4533
02:50:18,799 --> 02:50:24,478
um and and the the resins from from from

4534
02:50:22,318 --> 02:50:26,959
them as well and you can you can tell

4535
02:50:24,478 --> 02:50:28,398
there it's subtle it's it's not a you

4536
02:50:26,959 --> 02:50:29,519
know

4537
02:50:28,398 --> 02:50:33,358
a real

4538
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:35,520
uh bold kind of difference but it's

4539
02:50:33,359 --> 02:50:37,040
subtle and it is my preference

4540
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:38,640
we've touched on a lot of the topics

4541
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:40,160
these questions are so i'm just going to

4542
02:50:38,639 --> 02:50:43,278
kind of cut to the one bit that's not

4543
02:50:40,159 --> 02:50:44,719
there um do you have a preferred

4544
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:47,200
lighting style i know you mentioned the

4545
02:50:44,719 --> 02:50:48,398
cmhs is that that's your preferred one

4546
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:50,560
for indoor

4547
02:50:48,398 --> 02:50:53,199
um right now for having firsthand

4548
02:50:50,559 --> 02:50:56,719
experience with it um i

4549
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:59,520
my son has been working with the leds

4550
02:50:56,719 --> 02:51:02,799
uh with two great success and i'm

4551
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:06,479
reading great things he um he's the

4552
02:51:02,799 --> 02:51:08,799
company he works with is next light

4553
02:51:06,478 --> 02:51:10,559
out of ohio and they're really focusing

4554
02:51:08,799 --> 02:51:12,000
on dialing in

4555
02:51:10,559 --> 02:51:13,359
full spectrum

4556
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,318
lighting

4557
02:51:13,359 --> 02:51:15,600
and

4558
02:51:14,318 --> 02:51:17,199
some of the pictures i've been seeing

4559
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:18,960
people have been bringing in my classes

4560
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:21,439
and things um

4561
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:24,318
my son's been showing me

4562
02:51:21,439 --> 02:51:26,479
bud sets the canopy the buds in the

4563
02:51:24,318 --> 02:51:27,920
canopy are

4564
02:51:26,478 --> 02:51:30,719
albino

4565
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:33,439
they the plant just ceases producing so

4566
02:51:30,719 --> 02:51:35,840
much chlorophyll because that's it's

4567
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:38,479
saturated with light

4568
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:39,359
um production is there

4569
02:51:38,478 --> 02:51:41,199
the

4570
02:51:39,359 --> 02:51:44,079
terpene

4571
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:46,479
quantity and quality is is very high

4572
02:51:44,079 --> 02:51:48,719
because they tend not to

4573
02:51:46,478 --> 02:51:50,000
dissipate so much with these cooler

4574
02:51:48,719 --> 02:51:51,119
lights

4575
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,200
um

4576
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:56,399
so yeah the

4577
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:59,120
leds the high-end leds are are proving

4578
02:51:56,398 --> 02:52:01,039
their merit and worth

4579
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:02,800
yeah fantastic i'm i'm looking at

4580
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:04,880
getting some myself

4581
02:52:02,799 --> 02:52:06,879
so this next question is an interesting

4582
02:52:04,879 --> 02:52:09,278
one i i kind of like the angle of it

4583
02:52:06,879 --> 02:52:11,519
have you ever tried any of what would

4584
02:52:09,279 --> 02:52:13,600
largely be considered hype strains like

4585
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:15,840
smoked it and you thought to yourself i

4586
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:18,800
don't mind that

4587
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:20,639
well i always try to be as positive as

4588
02:52:18,799 --> 02:52:22,719
possible you know

4589
02:52:20,639 --> 02:52:25,358
and and

4590
02:52:22,719 --> 02:52:28,239
one of the things that people pride

4591
02:52:25,359 --> 02:52:29,680
themselves on that is kind of a

4592
02:52:28,239 --> 02:52:32,559
hindrance to me i think a stumbling

4593
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:34,318
block is potency

4594
02:52:32,559 --> 02:52:36,799
so

4595
02:52:34,318 --> 02:52:39,439
and and it's not terribly difficult to

4596
02:52:36,799 --> 02:52:40,799
dial in and people do do it and they are

4597
02:52:39,439 --> 02:52:44,000
proud of it

4598
02:52:40,799 --> 02:52:46,478
and so i will you know it'll be my first

4599
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:48,719
comment if i am past something and i hit

4600
02:52:46,478 --> 02:52:51,438
it and it's a little overpowering i say

4601
02:52:48,719 --> 02:52:53,679
well that certainly is potent

4602
02:52:51,439 --> 02:52:54,880
which you know i guess satisfies their

4603
02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:57,680
ego

4604
02:52:54,879 --> 02:52:58,719
to some extent but um

4605
02:52:57,680 --> 02:53:01,120
no

4606
02:52:58,719 --> 02:53:02,559
basically it's the answer to your

4607
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:04,399
question

4608
02:53:02,559 --> 02:53:05,840
i think i i

4609
02:53:04,398 --> 02:53:09,039
avoid

4610
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:11,200
uh it's it's hard for me anymore i i

4611
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:13,760
judge cups now and again but the only

4612
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:15,439
thing i'm judging are like

4613
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:19,680
resins

4614
02:53:15,439 --> 02:53:22,800
live resins and and solvent lists and

4615
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:24,800
things like that some of the rosin

4616
02:53:22,799 --> 02:53:26,959
um i i

4617
02:53:24,799 --> 02:53:28,318
it's pretty

4618
02:53:26,959 --> 02:53:30,879
easy to

4619
02:53:28,318 --> 02:53:33,439
uh deal with you can titrate just do a

4620
02:53:30,879 --> 02:53:34,639
little tiny bit and decide i like that

4621
02:53:33,439 --> 02:53:36,239
or not

4622
02:53:34,639 --> 02:53:38,398
and then i don't have to go there but

4623
02:53:36,239 --> 02:53:40,719
what i'm trying to avoid are these you

4624
02:53:38,398 --> 02:53:42,398
know got another two hours out of my

4625
02:53:40,719 --> 02:53:44,000
life i'll never get back like a bad

4626
02:53:42,398 --> 02:53:48,719
movie

4627
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:48,719
you know so yeah i've had enough of that

4628
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:53,200
so this is a question i wish i came up

4629
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:55,439
with it's a really good one have you

4630
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:57,760
noticed any negatives throughout the

4631
02:53:55,439 --> 02:54:00,000
course of inbreeding your lines in any

4632
02:53:57,760 --> 02:54:00,000
of them

4633
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:06,479
not really

4634
02:54:02,559 --> 02:54:07,600
not really um vigor is still there

4635
02:54:06,478 --> 02:54:09,840
um

4636
02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:11,359
considering that

4637
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:14,960
you know in terms of commercial

4638
02:54:11,359 --> 02:54:15,920
offerings i'm working with f4s

4639
02:54:14,959 --> 02:54:17,679
um

4640
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:20,079
it's it's

4641
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:23,279
still

4642
02:54:20,079 --> 02:54:25,120
completely interests me i i

4643
02:54:23,279 --> 02:54:27,439
and and there are things like i said

4644
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:29,680
things i've lost i need to look for and

4645
02:54:27,439 --> 02:54:31,279
i know that when i sprout a certain

4646
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:33,120
number of seeds

4647
02:54:31,279 --> 02:54:34,880
especially from a batch i haven't

4648
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:36,560
sprouted before i'm gonna see something

4649
02:54:34,879 --> 02:54:39,119
new

4650
02:54:36,559 --> 02:54:42,959
uh both positive and negative

4651
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:42,960
sometimes there's negative in there too

4652
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:45,680
so i mean well that raises a good

4653
02:54:44,719 --> 02:54:46,559
question

4654
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:49,040
do you

4655
02:54:46,559 --> 02:54:51,199
frequently find there's a few duds in

4656
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:53,279
each project or you know like is that

4657
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:55,200
yeah or yes

4658
02:54:53,279 --> 02:54:57,520
and how often does it completely show

4659
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:57,520
something

4660
02:54:57,760 --> 02:55:02,398
most of the time

4661
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:03,359
yes the keepers are

4662
02:55:02,398 --> 02:55:04,318
you know

4663
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:06,079
um

4664
02:55:04,318 --> 02:55:08,799
a small percentage

4665
02:55:06,079 --> 02:55:11,039
really when when doing r d

4666
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:13,199
um

4667
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:15,279
certain lines like well this happy [ __ ]

4668
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:16,640
line presented a lot of

4669
02:55:15,279 --> 02:55:18,960
stellar

4670
02:55:16,639 --> 02:55:20,959
females um i

4671
02:55:18,959 --> 02:55:22,478
sent some to my son to find a male i

4672
02:55:20,959 --> 02:55:25,039
gave him seven seeds in the end it was

4673
02:55:22,478 --> 02:55:29,599
seven females

4674
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:31,439
which all right so that went that way um

4675
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:33,359
but um

4676
02:55:31,439 --> 02:55:35,920
i think you almost referenced earlier on

4677
02:55:33,359 --> 02:55:38,159
where you know you'd be looking at f8

4678
02:55:35,920 --> 02:55:39,600
f10 before you'd really be inbreeding

4679
02:55:38,159 --> 02:55:42,239
hard right

4680
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:43,439
exactly exactly and and

4681
02:55:42,239 --> 02:55:46,159
i can go

4682
02:55:43,439 --> 02:55:49,439
to any level you know if i

4683
02:55:46,159 --> 02:55:52,239
get bored i can sprout an f3

4684
02:55:49,439 --> 02:55:54,479
and and and look there and then see

4685
02:55:52,239 --> 02:55:57,199
because then there's branches other

4686
02:55:54,478 --> 02:56:00,478
branches can come off of that

4687
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:03,120
whereas when i'm working with f4s

4688
02:56:00,478 --> 02:56:05,199
it's it's kind of more set things are

4689
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:06,399
more um

4690
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:07,680
defined

4691
02:56:06,398 --> 02:56:08,639
yeah

4692
02:56:07,680 --> 02:56:10,800
so

4693
02:56:08,639 --> 02:56:13,039
would you ever consider working any

4694
02:56:10,799 --> 02:56:15,840
feminized gear like you know making your

4695
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:18,640
own feminized lines

4696
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:21,760
i thought about it with flow simply

4697
02:56:18,639 --> 02:56:24,799
because she's never sported one male

4698
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:28,000
flower in all the 27 years she's been

4699
02:56:24,799 --> 02:56:30,239
alive stressed many times near death

4700
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,680
and never shown male flower and i let my

4701
02:56:30,239 --> 02:56:32,639
son i said here why don't give it a

4702
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:36,079
whirl

4703
02:56:32,639 --> 02:56:39,519
and he got male flowers present i think

4704
02:56:36,079 --> 02:56:40,559
some pollen but we did not get seed and

4705
02:56:39,520 --> 02:56:43,120
the

4706
02:56:40,559 --> 02:56:45,039
reason for that project was mainly just

4707
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:46,240
for preservation

4708
02:56:45,040 --> 02:56:47,359
um

4709
02:56:46,239 --> 02:56:50,159
but

4710
02:56:47,359 --> 02:56:52,318
no again i don't have time

4711
02:56:50,159 --> 02:56:54,159
yeah i just i have too many other things

4712
02:56:52,318 --> 02:56:55,760
forward filial crosses are going to keep

4713
02:56:54,159 --> 02:56:58,398
me busy

4714
02:56:55,760 --> 02:57:00,318
and everybody happy

4715
02:56:58,398 --> 02:57:02,239
so i'll let other people do that

4716
02:57:00,318 --> 02:57:03,920
so this one i'm not sure

4717
02:57:02,239 --> 02:57:05,279
you know really the background on it but

4718
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:07,760
it says

4719
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:10,000
uh is it true that there was an original

4720
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:11,439
blueberry and it was lost

4721
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:13,120
not

4722
02:57:11,439 --> 02:57:14,720
lost per se

4723
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:16,960
again i gave you the story about the

4724
02:57:14,719 --> 02:57:20,318
fellow that showed up

4725
02:57:16,959 --> 02:57:22,879
so yeah i was out of my hands but many

4726
02:57:20,318 --> 02:57:24,398
geez thousands of those were sent out to

4727
02:57:22,879 --> 02:57:25,839
many people

4728
02:57:24,398 --> 02:57:26,799
um

4729
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:27,920
so

4730
02:57:26,799 --> 02:57:29,920
it's it's

4731
02:57:27,920 --> 02:57:34,398
i'm pretty sure it's still out there i

4732
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:36,159
could come up with it again as well um

4733
02:57:34,398 --> 02:57:37,519
just waiting for like i said space and

4734
02:57:36,159 --> 02:57:38,239
time

4735
02:57:37,520 --> 02:57:40,960
so

4736
02:57:38,239 --> 02:57:43,199
do you ever smoke males and is it true

4737
02:57:40,959 --> 02:57:45,599
that you want smoked males while on acid

4738
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:48,399
it's a bit of a ridiculous question

4739
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:50,960
smoked what smoked like male

4740
02:57:48,398 --> 02:57:55,439
pollen oh

4741
02:57:50,959 --> 02:57:58,318
yes um well back in days of desperation

4742
02:57:55,439 --> 02:58:01,600
i remember trying stems once

4743
02:57:58,318 --> 02:58:04,719
i remember trying pollen once

4744
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:06,159
it's like smoking hair

4745
02:58:04,719 --> 02:58:07,920
with no

4746
02:58:06,159 --> 02:58:10,318
merit with no

4747
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:10,318
benefit

4748
02:58:10,959 --> 02:58:17,519
now as far smoking males to determine

4749
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:20,560
yes and that's tips

4750
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:22,800
you take the very tips that are are

4751
02:58:20,559 --> 02:58:24,159
flowering enough of them to make

4752
02:58:22,799 --> 02:58:27,519
whatever

4753
02:58:24,159 --> 02:58:29,760
used to be in a bowl or a joint

4754
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:32,239
i found the

4755
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:34,639
volcano vaporizer

4756
02:58:32,239 --> 02:58:38,000
worked great for if there are if there

4757
02:58:34,639 --> 02:58:40,639
is a terpene presence in that male that

4758
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:42,879
you can sense it more more readily with

4759
02:58:40,639 --> 02:58:45,680
the volcano vaporizer

4760
02:58:42,879 --> 02:58:47,839
yeah that's a really good tip actually

4761
02:58:45,680 --> 02:58:49,840
so there's been a little bit of like a

4762
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:52,239
discussion around

4763
02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:54,239
males that hermaphrodite i think you

4764
02:58:52,239 --> 02:58:55,920
were one of the initial people who kind

4765
02:58:54,239 --> 02:58:57,520
of put a bit of a statement out there

4766
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:59,279
saying you didn't mind them

4767
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:00,640
i've i've toyed around with it myself

4768
02:58:59,279 --> 02:59:02,000
and i know other people who have toyed

4769
02:59:00,639 --> 02:59:04,398
around with it and there's kind of been

4770
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:06,478
a bit of mixed results what what's kind

4771
02:59:04,398 --> 02:59:08,239
of your you know opinion on the subject

4772
02:59:06,478 --> 02:59:10,959
now that we can get a proper

4773
02:59:08,239 --> 02:59:12,639
sure i call them backwards males

4774
02:59:10,959 --> 02:59:14,239
and

4775
02:59:12,639 --> 02:59:15,920
i think the reason that i have

4776
02:59:14,239 --> 02:59:18,000
encountered them and been able to work

4777
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:18,879
with them is because whatever plant it

4778
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:21,520
was

4779
02:59:18,879 --> 02:59:23,278
before i knew it sex was very

4780
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:25,840
interesting looking

4781
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:28,880
it was sporting some fluorescence to it

4782
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:30,398
that yeah okay you're cool uh turns out

4783
02:59:28,879 --> 02:59:33,119
to be a male

4784
02:59:30,398 --> 02:59:35,119
and i would think okay let me set you

4785
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:37,120
aside see how you do i'm gonna use you

4786
02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:38,640
as a male and then

4787
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:41,040
after that

4788
02:59:38,639 --> 02:59:43,358
i could put out one set or two set of

4789
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:45,120
male flowers and went totally female

4790
02:59:43,359 --> 02:59:46,559
after that

4791
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:49,760
um

4792
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:50,920
that plant also um

4793
02:59:49,760 --> 02:59:52,239
turned out to

4794
02:59:50,920 --> 02:59:54,639
[Music]

4795
02:59:52,239 --> 02:59:56,719
oh it was sterile it was completely

4796
02:59:54,639 --> 02:59:58,398
sterile and

4797
02:59:56,719 --> 02:59:59,519
sterile i hit it with three different

4798
02:59:58,398 --> 03:00:01,760
males

4799
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:04,720
because she was really stellar

4800
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:05,600
and terribly difficult to clone

4801
03:00:04,719 --> 03:00:07,039
um

4802
03:00:05,600 --> 03:00:08,640
i don't think i cloned her i think i

4803
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:11,760
went to regreener and i had to let her

4804
03:00:08,639 --> 03:00:12,639
go because of space and time constraints

4805
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:13,840
um

4806
03:00:12,639 --> 03:00:15,920
but

4807
03:00:13,840 --> 03:00:18,960
yeah she was uh

4808
03:00:15,920 --> 03:00:21,439
male first and strictly female

4809
03:00:18,959 --> 03:00:26,639
uh but i've seen them um

4810
03:00:21,439 --> 03:00:27,920
at other times and it's a phenomenon um

4811
03:00:26,639 --> 03:00:29,920
again i don't know maybe if this is

4812
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:30,719
related to the culture scene as well or

4813
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:33,840
not

4814
03:00:30,719 --> 03:00:36,879
where they put out uh pre-flowers or

4815
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:38,559
their first sex uh is one and they flip

4816
03:00:36,879 --> 03:00:40,478
to the other

4817
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:43,519
and i haven't had a problem

4818
03:00:40,478 --> 03:00:46,239
um with those using those as uh

4819
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:48,640
well females for flower but

4820
03:00:46,239 --> 03:00:50,000
not for for breeding

4821
03:00:48,639 --> 03:00:52,079
yeah

4822
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,439
so one comment i read a lot on the

4823
03:00:52,079 --> 03:00:55,600
internet and i wanted to get your

4824
03:00:53,439 --> 03:00:57,520
opinion on it was that people seem to

4825
03:00:55,600 --> 03:00:59,840
think that the kind of current offering

4826
03:00:57,520 --> 03:01:01,279
of blueberries are like a sweet uh you

4827
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:03,359
know like kind of what i think of

4828
03:01:01,279 --> 03:01:05,840
blueberry i think but then they say that

4829
03:01:03,359 --> 03:01:08,399
the earlier versions was more of like a

4830
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:10,000
blueberry muffin type of thing

4831
03:01:08,398 --> 03:01:12,079
do you agree with that or do you think

4832
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:13,920
that's maybe just a bit of like you know

4833
03:01:12,079 --> 03:01:15,920
reminiscent looking back and thinking it

4834
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:19,359
was a little different to what it was

4835
03:01:15,920 --> 03:01:21,920
no i think two phenomenon our play there

4836
03:01:19,359 --> 03:01:22,800
one of which is that pre-98 phenomenon

4837
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:25,120
where

4838
03:01:22,799 --> 03:01:27,358
i had released a quite

4839
03:01:25,120 --> 03:01:29,120
broad variance

4840
03:01:27,359 --> 03:01:31,760
um and that someone may have stumbled

4841
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:34,640
upon what they referred to as a

4842
03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:37,680
blueberry muffin phenotype but the other

4843
03:01:34,639 --> 03:01:39,920
side of it i think has to do with

4844
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:41,760
additives fertilizers

4845
03:01:39,920 --> 03:01:45,279
various nutrients

4846
03:01:41,760 --> 03:01:48,000
are altering the flavor of herb

4847
03:01:45,279 --> 03:01:51,120
light frequencies as well i'm having my

4848
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:55,120
best luck again with the blue range

4849
03:01:51,120 --> 03:01:58,079
ceramic metal highlights um the

4850
03:01:55,120 --> 03:02:00,160
leds also are bringing out the sweetness

4851
03:01:58,079 --> 03:02:02,959
and a lot more flavor

4852
03:02:00,159 --> 03:02:05,119
so i think you know one of those two

4853
03:02:02,959 --> 03:02:06,478
factors or both of them working together

4854
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:08,160
have built that

4855
03:02:06,478 --> 03:02:09,278
um

4856
03:02:08,159 --> 03:02:11,600
legend

4857
03:02:09,279 --> 03:02:13,760
yeah yeah it's i think a lot of people

4858
03:02:11,600 --> 03:02:15,920
would go into hybrids trying to create

4859
03:02:13,760 --> 03:02:17,920
the the fabled blueberry muffin terpene

4860
03:02:15,920 --> 03:02:20,079
profile which is interesting no it's

4861
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:21,520
it's there and and i run across it i see

4862
03:02:20,079 --> 03:02:23,520
that phenotype i know what people are

4863
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:25,760
talking about um

4864
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:29,120
it was more prom

4865
03:02:25,760 --> 03:02:31,120
in the 80s late 80s early 90s

4866
03:02:29,120 --> 03:02:34,560
um

4867
03:02:31,120 --> 03:02:37,520
much different additive uh

4868
03:02:34,559 --> 03:02:39,519
available back then

4869
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:41,920
a little bit simpler on the topic of

4870
03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:43,760
additives have you ever heard of

4871
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:45,920
people spraying you know blueberry with

4872
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:48,079
like the the actual blueberry

4873
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:50,398
spray additives

4874
03:02:48,079 --> 03:02:51,279
yeah you know and that's

4875
03:02:50,398 --> 03:02:53,680
don't

4876
03:02:51,279 --> 03:02:55,359
yeah or you know juice blueberry juice

4877
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:58,159
any any colored

4878
03:02:55,359 --> 03:03:00,640
thing the roots will take it up and

4879
03:02:58,159 --> 03:03:01,840
possibly transfer it up to the flowers

4880
03:03:00,639 --> 03:03:03,599
but

4881
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:05,920
yeah yeah i just remember this one time

4882
03:03:03,600 --> 03:03:07,920
i had this banana og and it was almost

4883
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:09,279
too banana to be real and then in

4884
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:10,840
retrospect i have a feeling that's

4885
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:13,920
exactly what

4886
03:03:10,840 --> 03:03:16,318
happened um anyway this is another

4887
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:17,520
really good question from the one of our

4888
03:03:16,318 --> 03:03:21,039
listeners

4889
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:22,640
uh have you ever had like a mistake or a

4890
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:24,080
learning lesson during a breeding

4891
03:03:22,639 --> 03:03:25,680
project that you've really you know

4892
03:03:24,079 --> 03:03:28,318
taken with you and it was a good

4893
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:29,600
experience overall

4894
03:03:28,318 --> 03:03:31,600
um

4895
03:03:29,600 --> 03:03:32,800
mistake well

4896
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:34,000
yes

4897
03:03:32,799 --> 03:03:37,920
um

4898
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,879
when i was shooting for high potency

4899
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:40,879
and

4900
03:03:38,879 --> 03:03:42,719
um fast

4901
03:03:40,879 --> 03:03:46,079
flowering

4902
03:03:42,719 --> 03:03:48,559
i went three generations

4903
03:03:46,079 --> 03:03:51,120
was increasing with each but on that

4904
03:03:48,559 --> 03:03:54,239
third one i ran into

4905
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:57,120
like 75 percent of the crop anyhow was

4906
03:03:54,239 --> 03:03:59,920
this thing called i call no high

4907
03:03:57,120 --> 03:04:02,720
and it was actually worse than no high i

4908
03:03:59,920 --> 03:04:04,639
called it grumpy dope because it it had

4909
03:04:02,719 --> 03:04:07,039
the opposite effect

4910
03:04:04,639 --> 03:04:08,559
it was like anti-pot

4911
03:04:07,040 --> 03:04:11,600
um

4912
03:04:08,559 --> 03:04:12,719
and it was a terrible stuff

4913
03:04:11,600 --> 03:04:15,439
it

4914
03:04:12,719 --> 03:04:17,119
unfortunately i had a funny story i sold

4915
03:04:15,439 --> 03:04:19,760
it to a friend of mine who's a bass

4916
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:21,840
player in a reggae band

4917
03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:23,840
i didn't test it yet and i'd let it go

4918
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:25,439
to him this one evening

4919
03:04:23,840 --> 03:04:27,200
and it was like 8 30 in the morning

4920
03:04:25,439 --> 03:04:28,800
there's a banging on my door what is

4921
03:04:27,200 --> 03:04:31,520
this what is this i was like oh god

4922
03:04:28,799 --> 03:04:33,759
walter and walter was pissed walter

4923
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:35,600
never got pissed and walter was never up

4924
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:37,040
at 8 30 in the morning

4925
03:04:35,600 --> 03:04:40,079
i said what's wrong he's what's this

4926
03:04:37,040 --> 03:04:42,240
[ __ ] you sold me i said i invited him in

4927
03:04:40,079 --> 03:04:45,439
we sat down i took a bong hit over and i

4928
03:04:42,239 --> 03:04:47,760
said jesus dude i apologized right away

4929
03:04:45,439 --> 03:04:50,479
i'm sorry got him something else we

4930
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:53,680
smoked that it took it right away but

4931
03:04:50,478 --> 03:04:56,559
and uh another friend of mine he just i

4932
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:59,120
ended up passing it on to him and he did

4933
03:04:56,559 --> 03:05:00,639
an experiment kind of a rude experiment

4934
03:04:59,120 --> 03:05:02,479
at the oregon country fair where he

4935
03:05:00,639 --> 03:05:05,439
bagged a bunch of that up and then just

4936
03:05:02,478 --> 03:05:07,119
left it in places and he watched people

4937
03:05:05,439 --> 03:05:08,239
and he said they did they started

4938
03:05:07,120 --> 03:05:10,880
fighting

4939
03:05:08,239 --> 03:05:13,760
and it was terrible um

4940
03:05:10,879 --> 03:05:16,559
so i said okay be careful

4941
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:18,719
and make sure you test everything you

4942
03:05:16,559 --> 03:05:20,959
know to me what you're putting out there

4943
03:05:18,719 --> 03:05:23,119
it has to be you've got to know that it

4944
03:05:20,959 --> 03:05:23,979
performs

4945
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:26,079
that's awesome

4946
03:05:23,979 --> 03:05:29,119
[Laughter]

4947
03:05:26,079 --> 03:05:31,680
uh so this question yeah

4948
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:35,040
really intrigued me he said uh i've

4949
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:37,520
heard a rumor that only around 20 to 30

4950
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:39,760
percent of the work you know in your

4951
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:41,439
library has actually ever seen daylight

4952
03:05:39,760 --> 03:05:44,559
is that true

4953
03:05:41,439 --> 03:05:46,159
uh somewhere i would say 40 to 60

4954
03:05:44,559 --> 03:05:48,799
percent

4955
03:05:46,159 --> 03:05:53,279
in that range all right has seen has

4956
03:05:48,799 --> 03:05:54,879
seen so uh 60 to 40 percent hasn't

4957
03:05:53,279 --> 03:05:56,560
wow so yeah you weren't kidding when the

4958
03:05:54,879 --> 03:05:59,039
best is yet to come

4959
03:05:56,559 --> 03:06:00,719
yeah yeah and i

4960
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:03,120
released what i've released i mean i've

4961
03:06:00,719 --> 03:06:05,039
been sitting on my thumbs for so long

4962
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:07,040
here waiting

4963
03:06:05,040 --> 03:06:08,080
for this decades

4964
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:10,399
now

4965
03:06:08,079 --> 03:06:12,159
knowing this time was coming and just

4966
03:06:10,398 --> 03:06:14,959
kind of going oh god making sure

4967
03:06:12,159 --> 03:06:16,478
everything is safe and scattered to the

4968
03:06:14,959 --> 03:06:18,959
four winds and

4969
03:06:16,478 --> 03:06:20,239
in trustworthy hands and

4970
03:06:18,959 --> 03:06:22,079
just waiting

4971
03:06:20,239 --> 03:06:24,079
waiting for the day we'll get it going

4972
03:06:22,079 --> 03:06:26,559
but realistically

4973
03:06:24,079 --> 03:06:29,520
it's going to be when we have

4974
03:06:26,559 --> 03:06:32,478
worldwide importation

4975
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:34,640
then you know maybe resurrect some of

4976
03:06:32,478 --> 03:06:36,799
these genetics back in their sweet spots

4977
03:06:34,639 --> 03:06:38,879
which has been done there's this great

4978
03:06:36,799 --> 03:06:41,519
article it's on icmag it's still on

4979
03:06:38,879 --> 03:06:44,398

03:06:54,559 --> 03:06:59,600
elevation

4986
03:06:56,079 --> 03:07:02,079
and it was amazing and it was beautiful

4987
03:06:59,600 --> 03:07:04,079
and the locals they were posting in the

4988

in the grow and smoke reports that the

4989

4991
03:07:08,959 --> 03:07:12,000
the purple tip

4992
03:07:10,959 --> 03:07:13,199
uh

4993
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,318
gold

4994
03:07:13,200 --> 03:07:16,000
pot

4995
03:07:14,318 --> 03:07:17,119
um so

4996
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:19,520
yeah you know

4997
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:22,720
this is not just domestically it's all

4998
03:07:19,520 --> 03:07:25,760
over the world and and

4999
03:07:22,719 --> 03:07:28,159
again in our area focus on concentrates

5000
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:30,719
and resins and these wonderful terpenes

5001
03:07:28,159 --> 03:07:32,879
and isolating them and and breeding for

5002
03:07:30,719 --> 03:07:34,559
those types of things but yeah when the

5003
03:07:32,879 --> 03:07:36,318
day comes we've got worldwide

5004
03:07:34,559 --> 03:07:38,639
importation

5005
03:07:36,318 --> 03:07:41,199
then people will know

5006
03:07:38,639 --> 03:07:44,478
you know good herb yeah

5007
03:07:41,200 --> 03:07:45,680
on a on a regular basis

5008
03:07:44,478 --> 03:07:47,519
so

5009
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:49,120
do you have any tips for our listeners

5010
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:52,079
about how you go about selecting your

5011
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:53,920
males

5012
03:07:52,079 --> 03:07:55,600
there's no shortcut really you got to

5013
03:07:53,920 --> 03:07:57,920
pollinate the female

5014
03:07:55,600 --> 03:08:01,359
mature the speed

5015
03:07:57,920 --> 03:08:02,398
cure it sprout it and grow it um to be

5016
03:08:01,359 --> 03:08:04,079
sure

5017
03:08:02,398 --> 03:08:06,239
hollow stems

5018
03:08:04,079 --> 03:08:08,079
is an indication of you know there's

5019
03:08:06,239 --> 03:08:09,920
going to be some potency drug cannabis

5020
03:08:08,079 --> 03:08:12,719
same with um

5021
03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:14,799
uh resin content if he's if he's got any

5022
03:08:12,719 --> 03:08:17,599
potency to him whatsoever he'll more

5023
03:08:14,799 --> 03:08:21,358
than likely carry that on and what's his

5024
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:24,079
chirping profile um those those types of

5025
03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:26,640
things too look for the stem rub

5026
03:08:24,079 --> 03:08:28,318
rubbing the leaves smelling that

5027
03:08:26,639 --> 03:08:30,639
if you have five of them next to each

5028
03:08:28,318 --> 03:08:32,079
other which one is the most appealing in

5029
03:08:30,639 --> 03:08:33,840
that regard

5030
03:08:32,079 --> 03:08:35,520
you know those those basic

5031
03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:37,120
characteristics and that's the one i

5032
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:39,200
would lean toward

5033
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:41,040
in terms of using if you know if space

5034
03:08:39,200 --> 03:08:43,439
is an issue numbers are an issue which

5035
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:44,960
they are for some people still

5036
03:08:43,439 --> 03:08:46,000
yeah

5037
03:08:44,959 --> 03:08:48,000
so

5038
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:49,600
what are some of the things which go

5039
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:51,760
through your mind when you're thinking

5040
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:54,079
about starting a new cross do you kind

5041
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:57,120
of really plan things out are you just

5042
03:08:54,079 --> 03:08:59,439
kind of more experimenting at first

5043
03:08:57,120 --> 03:09:00,880
yeah it's pretty much experimental i

5044
03:08:59,439 --> 03:09:05,200
have a list

5045
03:09:00,879 --> 03:09:09,199
i have things uh kind of on deck

5046
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:11,200
that it's going to be one of these um

5047
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:13,279
and

5048
03:09:11,200 --> 03:09:14,159
yeah there's a priority

5049
03:09:13,279 --> 03:09:16,640
uh

5050
03:09:14,159 --> 03:09:20,079
kind of set

5051
03:09:16,639 --> 03:09:22,559
to to looking for various various things

5052
03:09:20,079 --> 03:09:24,559
right now it's still in the resurrection

5053
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:26,959
stage those things that have been

5054
03:09:24,559 --> 03:09:30,238
stumbled upon and released

5055
03:09:26,959 --> 03:09:32,959
and and refining them and getting them

5056
03:09:30,238 --> 03:09:34,318
secured and stable somewhere

5057
03:09:32,959 --> 03:09:37,119
um

5058
03:09:34,318 --> 03:09:38,959
and then going on from there

5059
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:41,520
yeah

5060
03:09:38,959 --> 03:09:43,039
so one listener wants to know

5061
03:09:41,520 --> 03:09:45,600
if you could give us your opinion on

5062
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:47,760
where the autoflower trait originates

5063
03:09:45,600 --> 03:09:50,800
from especially given it was in you know

5064
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:50,800
the the kind

5065
03:09:51,120 --> 03:09:55,840
i really don't know

5066
03:09:52,799 --> 03:09:57,920
tell you the truth i kind of avoided it

5067
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:59,600
in the work i've been doing just simply

5068
03:09:57,920 --> 03:10:01,200
because it tended to have more

5069
03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:03,920
hermaphroditic

5070
03:10:01,200 --> 03:10:06,479
characteristics and for the market i'm

5071
03:10:03,920 --> 03:10:09,520
satisfying with seeds

5072
03:10:06,478 --> 03:10:11,760
you want low hermaphrodite or or none

5073
03:10:09,520 --> 03:10:13,840
it's relatively simple to do you just

5074
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:15,279
two to three generations you don't

5075
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:17,520
tolerate it

5076
03:10:15,279 --> 03:10:19,680
in your parents stock and it

5077
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:20,880
tends to go away

5078
03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:22,800
um

5079
03:10:20,879 --> 03:10:26,000
but i'm curious

5080
03:10:22,799 --> 03:10:28,478
i am curious now i see a lot of people

5081
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:30,398
leaning that way and i do have memories

5082
03:10:28,478 --> 03:10:33,199
of using it so i don't know if that

5083
03:10:30,398 --> 03:10:35,599
helps our answers but

5084
03:10:33,200 --> 03:10:36,720
yeah no that does that's a good answer

5085
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:38,238
there's our last little quick five

5086
03:10:36,719 --> 03:10:40,559
questions they're pretty you know yes no

5087
03:10:38,238 --> 03:10:42,000
type stuff so out of everything you've

5088
03:10:40,559 --> 03:10:44,398
ever had what's your favorite strain of

5089
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:44,398
all time

5090
03:10:44,639 --> 03:10:47,119
um

5091
03:10:45,840 --> 03:10:49,040
hash

5092
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:52,880
nepalese temple ball

5093
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:54,800
right up there with the kashmiri charis

5094
03:10:52,879 --> 03:10:57,599
in terms of hash um

5095
03:10:54,799 --> 03:11:00,478
in terms of herb

5096
03:10:57,600 --> 03:11:03,200
the highland oaxacan

5097
03:11:00,478 --> 03:11:05,278
and the highland tie probably i like the

5098
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:07,600
highland oaxacan a little better

5099
03:11:05,279 --> 03:11:09,840
than the thai they tie it a good potency

5100
03:11:07,600 --> 03:11:10,640
but the oaxacan had a pleasantness about

5101
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:13,200
it

5102
03:11:10,639 --> 03:11:16,398
as did the santa marta the colombian

5103
03:11:13,200 --> 03:11:19,200
gold the acapulco golds all of those uh

5104
03:11:16,398 --> 03:11:20,719
frankincense cedar leaning

5105
03:11:19,200 --> 03:11:23,680
gold

5106
03:11:20,719 --> 03:11:26,000
south and central american strains

5107
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:28,318
those were probably my favorite ty was

5108
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:31,600
right up there with them

5109
03:11:28,318 --> 03:11:33,278
yeah perfect and so what is your least

5110
03:11:31,600 --> 03:11:35,520
favorite strain or just the one that's

5111
03:11:33,279 --> 03:11:40,399
vibed with you least

5112
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:42,399
god i have no idea ruder alice hemp

5113
03:11:40,398 --> 03:11:44,478
oh speaking of driving across country

5114
03:11:42,398 --> 03:11:45,599
man just so you know i took interstate

5115
03:11:44,478 --> 03:11:48,959
80.

5116
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:50,800
there was a lot of feral hemp

5117
03:11:48,959 --> 03:11:52,879
all right we're test august early august

5118
03:11:50,799 --> 03:11:56,719
and they were big plants

5119
03:11:52,879 --> 03:11:59,438
corn fields it was indiana illinois iowa

5120
03:11:56,719 --> 03:12:00,959
um and then into west or eastern

5121
03:11:59,439 --> 03:12:04,079
nebraska

5122
03:12:00,959 --> 03:12:06,799
and on the sides of the cornfields along

5123
03:12:04,079 --> 03:12:08,478
the highway this was kind of strange

5124
03:12:06,799 --> 03:12:09,840
i know you know i've had rumor that

5125
03:12:08,478 --> 03:12:12,559
they're back

5126
03:12:09,840 --> 03:12:15,520
but i know the highway patrol generally

5127
03:12:12,559 --> 03:12:18,639
was yanking those things out

5128
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:21,359
but there were a lot of the big plants

5129
03:12:18,639 --> 03:12:23,439
with big leaves so if you're traveling

5130
03:12:21,359 --> 03:12:25,520
interstate 80 up in that area be on the

5131
03:12:23,439 --> 03:12:28,079
lookout for some uh

5132
03:12:25,520 --> 03:12:29,680
nice looking hemp plants

5133
03:12:28,079 --> 03:12:31,520
that's cool to hear i never thought i'd

5134
03:12:29,680 --> 03:12:33,760
really see the roadside hemp like the uh

5135
03:12:31,520 --> 03:12:35,920
the old seed mags

5136
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:37,920
yeah i didn't either but there it was

5137
03:12:35,920 --> 03:12:42,639
and i had to keep doing a double take

5138
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:45,200
and it sure enough was a big leaf hemp

5139
03:12:42,639 --> 03:12:47,840
that's cool so final question for this

5140
03:12:45,200 --> 03:12:50,640
one what is your hopes for the future of

5141
