Swanson couch in this episode we're

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,729
joined by Johnny of Johnson genetics who

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,100
fills us in on some of the details

13
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,929
around Johnson genetics as well as some

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,520
of his plans for the future and much

15
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:46,409
more so here we go he's a big welcome to

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,460
our guest Johnny from Johnson's genetics

17
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:53,429
and thank you so much for coming on the

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:56,609
show today pretty good so just jump

19
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:59,159
straight into it so the first question I

20
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,808
like to ask everyone growing up what

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,029
were some of the reasons you decided to

22
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:04,798
get into cannabis and what was your

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,469
first experience with it was it with

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,250
some friends was a with your uncle in

25
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:15,269
the backyard Wow

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:19,680
that goes way back I got into the

27
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:22,379
cannabis industry at a young age earlier

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,360
than 13 I don't remember my exact age I

29
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:29,399
started smoking just hanging out with

30
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:32,728
friends as everyone did it was known to

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,380
me that's what my dad did grow oh no you

32
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,739
know so it wasn't anything new to me I

33
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:42,419
wasn't doing it to repeal but that was

34
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:44,459
kind of the original time of whenever I

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,530
had my first instance with marijuana

36
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,228
just hanging out with Brent busted out a

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,140
joint and so I was just like yeah let's

38
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:55,859
go for it and I fell in love immediately

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,250
I think I have kind of a hyper mind and

40
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:01,438
settled settled me down and that that

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,519
was just amazing for me literally at

42
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,889
that moment that joined was

43
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,978
life-changing for me yeah

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,959
and so when you first started growing

45
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,459
what were some of the first strains you

46
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,530
were growing you mentioned that you your

47
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,409
dad was already doing it so did he have

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,568
kind of like a library or radio we you

49
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,400
guys kind of trialing out breeders at

50
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:21,899
the time and if so you know who was some

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,370
of the breeders around at that time you

52
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,939
know like when you dad was doing it over

53
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,730
with it no breeders yet there were

54
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,439
breeders but not in our local area we

55
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:36,060
were kind of it was extremely

56
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:39,689
underground we started in Oklahoma which

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:45,120
is completely no tower and state zero

58
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:46,939
tolerance and so breeding was not really

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,800
talked about among its groups of people

60
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:52,319
it was done basically back then as a

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,830
necessity to have the next round of

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,169
seeds to grow for the next year and we

63
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,430
basically had a lot of our more of my

64
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:04,799
dad had a lot of his old stuff that I

65
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,599
don't know all of the exact sources and

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,200
stuff but he's he's acquired them over

67
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:14,509
the years and whenever I first started

68
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:17,399
he didn't give me anything it was me

69
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:19,679
starting out on my own I didn't exactly

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,280
have like a free gift of genetics

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:30,000
priming but later on I did

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,939
let's see but he he picked up seeds from

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,069
all over he picked up seeds from Africa

74
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:40,919
a lot from Africa he spent 12 years in

75
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:43,319
Africa so yeah all over and then in

76
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,169
Middle East he it was basically that was

77
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,900
the real two main locations he acquired

78
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:52,439
from and then some through some South

79
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,170
American travel but he spent 12 years in

80
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,259
the Middle East in Africa so that's

81
00:03:55,169 --> 00:04:01,069
where a lot of my influence comes from

82
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:04,439
is what his kind of choices were growing

83
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:07,259
growing out that I watched that's

84
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:10,049
incredible so did he kind of work these

85
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,659
lines out himself or where they just

86
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,700
kind of run as they were and probably

87
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,500
would have been pretty game-changer to

88
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:17,608
have afghan seeds at that time right I

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,579
mean I'm imagining this was probably

90
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:23,399
20-30 years ago

91
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:26,728
correct yes yeah that's one of our

92
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,289
biggest I guess you could say staples

93
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:30,649
that I have

94
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:34,040
in the storage of all is old-school

95
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:37,729
Afghan and that's I'm going to be

96
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,710
breaking that out very soon for my next

97
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,430
breeding projects in the next six months

98
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:47,569
or so I think but basically when he

99
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:50,240
started the seeds they were just

100
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,129
landrace essentially they he just

101
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,160
brought them back started and then we

102
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:57,379
would just have to like it would be each

103
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,170
year the best that would be selected

104
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,699
we'd keep the seeds that we ran from it

105
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,500
and then every year we'd progress with

106
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:07,939
it yep

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,500
so I mean what generation do you think

108
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:11,360
that would be at just you know like

109
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,519
since he's had him probably like you

110
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,960
know f20 or something or they won't work

111
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:19,939
that much no I don't know he's his

112
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:24,169
health isn't very good anymore he's he's

113
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:25,819
no longer doing anything himself but

114
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:31,100
when he stopped they would have probably

115
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:33,170
been in the team's possibly at least we

116
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,210
don't always grow the exact same thing

117
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,230
every single year but I would make sure

118
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:42,039
to get seed stock of most things for the

119
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,180
next year and that's kind of where that

120
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:48,280
love of that and watching things

121
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:51,650
progress change watching the genetics

122
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,449
mix with each other and you know from a

123
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:58,089
young age that's what inspired me to

124
00:05:53,449 --> 00:06:00,949
want to start doing this then with the

125
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:02,449
switch of legalization here that kind of

126
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:06,979
just gave me the kick in the ass to get

127
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:08,899
it going yeah so it sounds like you were

128
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,420
pretty self-sufficient for quite a while

129
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:13,669
at what point did you decide to bring in

130
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,800
kind of you know some foreign genetics

131
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,900
so to speak maybe some clones from some

132
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,240
other people or you know you bought some

133
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,859
seeds from some other people or was it

134
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:28,610
really just working with your own stock

135
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:30,439
until then well I felt like a lot of

136
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,170
stuff I don't always just smoke what I

137
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,449
grow and I smoke things from other

138
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:38,300
readers I probably smoked something from

139
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:41,248
everybody out there but I have my

140
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,189
favorites and my favorite smokes

141
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,319
as a tip of the hat kind of respect to

142
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:48,929
the breeders that did breathe some of

143
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,919
the genetics of use that's the main

144
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:55,408
reason like I if they bred something

145
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,628
that I you know fall in love with I'll

146
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:59,188
probably be throwing something of mine

147
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,789
that I think would work out well with it

148
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:04,919
you know genetics come into it's mostly

149
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:09,808
as a show of respect to the other

150
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:13,829
readers yeah but yeah but and that

151
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:16,169
really started around the legalization

152
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,598
time for here maybe a year or two before

153
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:21,538
that you know cuz medically here it's

154
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:25,228
been you know quite open for a long time

155
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:27,449
so I've been working with other genetics

156
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:29,579
for a while I guess I could say yeah

157
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,129
well I mean let's talk about some of

158
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,860
your strains because in my opinion

159
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:37,169
almost all of them use what I would call

160
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,929
like a unique strain in that like one of

161
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:42,688
the parents is not used by really any

162
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:44,938
other breeders so we'll start off with

163
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:46,499
what I assume is probably the main study

164
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,889
in your garden the black sugar berry

165
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,689
I've found at least eight or ten or so

166
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,299
crosses that use it as the male it's

167
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,919
obviously pretty good in your opinion

168
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:58,498
but there's not a lot of info on it on

169
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,818
mine you know how would you describe it

170
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:01,499
to someone who is interested you know

171
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:06,059
like what's your sales pitch for the

172
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:07,469
black sugar berry as a male it was

173
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,819
pretty underground when it came out

174
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:13,498
that's why there wasn't a whole lot of

175
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:18,749
info out there I guess you'd say but

176
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:22,229
it's it's big winning traits or for the

177
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:27,239
most part just nice size colas good

178
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:31,829
purple hues with a good even base flavor

179
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:35,068
I guess you could say it's it's just an

180
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:37,799
all-around real winner in my opinion as

181
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:42,658
far as like production I guess you could

182
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:47,099
say and so I that was my main focus was

183
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:51,028
to use that larger blood pattern to add

184
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:55,050
into some of my other favorite genetics

185
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:58,860
to see if I could push that purple into

186
00:08:55,049 --> 00:09:02,429
really was one of my big pushes which a

187
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,320
lot of them did take so another line

188
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:07,799
that I think is really interesting of

189
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,110
yours is the [ __ ] Valley line and as far

190
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,000
as I know I mean I'm probably wrong but

191
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,100
I can only off the top of my head think

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,870
of you and two other breeders who have

193
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,810
done a similar project where basically

194
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,789
they they work the one line out in

195
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,309
multiple different directions you know

196
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:24,629
like model different phenotypes and

197
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:26,309
right I was wondering what's the

198
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:28,259
inspiration behind this you know was it

199
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:29,789
like a pre-planned idea or was it just

200
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,370
like a happy mistake where you know

201
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:33,779
maybe you pop the first F ones and you

202
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,639
found that there were two fairly

203
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,500
different phenotypes and both were stand

204
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,710
out or did you have a plan from the

205
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,460
start and you knew the pocky valley was

206
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:49,019
something that was going to be worth

207
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:51,120
digging into mistake I I ran into two

208
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,429
fennels that when I was you know

209
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,200
selecting down to my always I'd select

210
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:58,009
down to my best and that's what makes it

211
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,660
to the next generation for breeding that

212
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:04,939
when I came down to making that choice I

213
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:07,769
just couldn't decide between two and I

214
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,780
out of I couldn't throw one away I

215
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,460
couldn't do it and so I just went the

216
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,649
tooter routes with that one number one

217
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:17,370
and number two the magenta and the white

218
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:18,959
as a lot of people call yeah and how

219
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,460
would you describe the two different

220
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,230
lines I've been able to find some

221
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,870
information that says you know I believe

222
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,930
it was the magenta is you describe it as

223
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,820
a little bit more of a medicinal line

224
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:31,169
but yeah how would you describe the two

225
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,730
lines and how they differ from each

226
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:40,049
other yeah the the magenta would be more

227
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,379
along the I don't know how you'd explain

228
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:43,859
it

229
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:49,679
medicating it was more heavy in the

230
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:52,379
medicating feel like heavy indica a fact

231
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:55,469
I guess you could call it it really

232
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:58,409
would sit you in your seat the the white

233
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:05,460
was a little more on the brighter flavor

234
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:07,698
note and not quite so couch locky and so

235
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,679
the the

236
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:11,539
variants of the smoke between the two it

237
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:14,028
just was completely different to me and

238
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:15,980
as was the flavor profiles so I just

239
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:19,278
went ahead and split them up and kept

240
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,759
running with them that's that was my

241
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,619
real basis for keeping to going cuz it

242
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:29,839
was a hard to see to get rid of one or

243
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:32,569
not yeah painstaking choices yeah so I

244
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,489
actually had a lot oh no no no keep

245
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:36,349
going please I was gonna say I've

246
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:38,949
actually had a lot of people who sin

247
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,899
thank you emails saying that they've ran

248
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:44,838
both and they proved they appreciated

249
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,399
the flavor effect of one more than the

250
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,799
other and they said thank you for giving

251
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,220
them the option of both you know so yeah

252
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:53,899
cuz at first I was kind of self battle

253
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,209
whether I was going to do that in one I

254
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,918
think it was a good choice I think is

255
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,748
it's something unique and something that

256
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:02,539
needs to be done more you know and I

257
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,579
yeah I definitely agree that um we're at

258
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:07,399
least in my mind it seems like you know

259
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:08,899
there's this seesaw so to speak of

260
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,298
breeding and you know and in my mind

261
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,938
there's kind of like flavor on one end

262
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:16,129
of it and yield and potency on the other

263
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:17,058
you know and I always tend to think you

264
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:19,129
know you're always kind of trying to

265
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:21,078
balance it out so I try to hit both if

266
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:25,339
you can make to that kind of sit well at

267
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:27,019
either end right right exactly so that

268
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:31,220
brings up kind of my next question a

269
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:35,359
little bit tied into that um on the pro

270
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:39,949
the website strain lynda.com or seed

271
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:44,299
find off basically it says the the [ __ ]

272
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:46,639
run was from world of seeds

273
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:48,168
I was wondering first of all is that

274
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,220
true because it seemed a little odd to

275
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:54,470
me and then to how does a site like that

276
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,178
interact with a breeder do they request

277
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,589
the information from you because I found

278
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:59,838
that like a lot of their stuff is wrong

279
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,579
so I tend to think that maybe they Scout

280
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,999
the information themselves and that's

281
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:07,368
why the errors are there or I think they

282
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:09,379
do they have touched base with me on a

283
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:12,168
couple of my things because kind of as

284
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:15,259
you say I have several things that are

285
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:16,788
very underground not much info on so

286
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:20,350
they have touched base with me on a few

287
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:24,549
things but and and actually the

288
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:28,180
world of seeds deal is correct I I did

289
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:31,319
have a good amount of world of seeds

290
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:35,349
patchy valley that was gifted to me and

291
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,560
i ran a good number of them and i found

292
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,340
a couple that i like that's where that

293
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,339
comes from

294
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,240
i believe so that was a couple years ago

295
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:49,179
but i but that do believe it was world

296
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,470
seeds yeah yeah i've actually had some

297
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:52,000
alright success with world of sees

298
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,519
myself but I've heard some conflicting

299
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,529
reports but i I also just thought given

300
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,329
what you said earlier about the the

301
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:01,600
Afghan land race stuff maybe it had been

302
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:04,629
stuff you doubted maybe collected no no

303
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,909
it is no I don't I don't want take

304
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:10,809
credit for milk it was I and I will say

305
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:14,620
you know honesty I ran a good number of

306
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:17,409
seats to find the ones that I found it

307
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,179
had I just had like a ten pack and pop

308
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:21,579
them I probably would have came out with

309
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:24,489
a complaint that I ran more than that

310
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,580
and but I did find what I considered to

311
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,100
be some good winners so it's you know

312
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:36,009
with numbers you'll you'll find winner

313
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:38,019
yeah but yeah sure yeah so on to what I

314
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:41,200
think he's maybe kind of your new main

315
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:43,329
breeding project the pine tar cush all

316
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,270
sorry that it was used in the making of

317
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,639
the Ron Swanson so back to the Sun the

318
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:50,470
pine tar cush was made by Tom Hill this

319
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,879
is a strain which is actually been quite

320
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,399
a demand for a while a lot of people

321
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,679
have been calling for its resurgence was

322
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,959
that part of the inspiration for you

323
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,389
working it into the Ron Swanson line

324
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,639
like did you think to yourself I'm gonna

325
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:05,169
make this new strain and I want the pine

326
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,970
tar cush to be a part of it because

327
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:09,809
there's certain traits that I'm looking

328
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:14,860
to put into this new stud for example

329
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:16,869
well there I wasn't aware that there was

330
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,259
a very much of a movement going on with

331
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,940
it I it was a favorite of mine I had

332
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:27,399
been growing it for a couple years just

333
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:29,890
for personal smoke and I at some point I

334
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,289
just decided hey and I well I started

335
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,429
running it outdoors instead of indoors

336
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:37,028
and I was getting

337
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:39,989
very large plants 910 feet tall on

338
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:46,528
average and you know several feet around

339
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:48,970
and so I wanted to take it it had a full

340
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:52,570
bushiness where you know it but all the

341
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:56,950
way down the branch very tight and so I

342
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:59,080
I wanted to take it with a couple of my

343
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,930
other strains and I did several readings

344
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:05,440
with there only a couple were released

345
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:07,389
but I I just really enjoyed it

346
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,130
personally as a smoke and it was one of

347
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:13,539
my kind of personal pushes in my

348
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:16,000
genetics I do about 50/50 half of what I

349
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:18,039
would like to see bred and half of kind

350
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,769
of what I feel like the industry would

351
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:24,009
like to see bred so it's kind of a

352
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,929
balance I don't know like forcing people

353
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:29,019
at point only what the strains that I

354
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:33,039
would like to smoke so I try to give a

355
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:34,838
good variance I guess yeah and so in

356
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,088
your mind did you just kind of think

357
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,130
that the black sugarberry given how you

358
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,690
mentioned earlier that it it adds those

359
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:42,580
nice collars did you think that would

360
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,350
just kind of complement the pine tar or

361
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,230
was it for different reasons you chose

362
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:50,550
the black sugar berry to may with it

363
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:53,310
yeah I was trying to make a super plant

364
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:57,189
the way that the pine tar grew for me

365
00:16:53,309 --> 00:17:00,338
consistently for a couple years and my

366
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,700
love for the black sugar berry I I knew

367
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:07,240
that they had worked well together I

368
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:09,279
just didn't intend to I guess I didn't

369
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,549
know that I would like the Ron Swanson

370
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:15,849
as much as I did it turned out to be a

371
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:17,438
long term personal favor of mine yeah

372
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:19,389
how would you describe that to anyone

373
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:25,000
who is interested in just the pure Ron

374
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:28,300
Swanson Ron Swanson by selfie it tends

375
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,179
to grow very much like the pine tar with

376
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:35,980
a heavier lemon line influence it's

377
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,740
whereas my the fennel I was running up

378
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,669
the pine tar was very floral

379
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,529
it had a I don't you know you understand

380
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:47,020
floral flavor you know it right yeah

381
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:49,059
yeah it was very for and

382
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:52,990
it kind of shocked me that it came out

383
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:57,849
so lemon lemon lime being bred with the

384
00:17:52,990 --> 00:18:00,160
black sugar berry but it it translates

385
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:03,429
real well pure Ron Swanson and if you

386
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,460
ever run live resin it's one of the most

387
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:12,039
flavorful live resins I've ever smoked

388
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:15,100
no attitude yeah so in the case of maybe

389
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:16,809
the Ron Swanson or just any any of your

390
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:19,179
own projects where you feel they really

391
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,250
stand out have you ever considered the

392
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,980
idea of maybe doing like a deeper

393
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,500
breeding project maybe maybe a back

394
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,960
cross or taking something to the f2 f3

395
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,640
or do you think that a lot of your

396
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,980
strains are kind of more suited as F

397
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:38,530
ones well actually I don't post a lot of

398
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:44,170
my old breeding but most of my stuff

399
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:45,609
when it's released as f2 or f3 the there

400
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:49,000
aren't there have been a few that have

401
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:53,799
been f1 breedings but for the most part

402
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,400
they are f2 or f3 I am actually about to

403
00:18:53,799 --> 00:19:00,549
start and have one only project that

404
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,400
will allow people with a wider variety

405
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:06,369
of options you know like that kind of

406
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,340
lottery tickets seed yes some refer to

407
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:13,329
it but they would be sold at a

408
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:15,759
discounted rate you know I'm trying to

409
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:17,409
get people that were they can feel like

410
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,240
they have something that's a little more

411
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,890
special than other people may have like

412
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,620
that's what the whole reason I do is a

413
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,400
limited edition I could run a lot more

414
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:29,019
seeds and sell a lot more seeds but I

415
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,640
think when you know people can trade

416
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:34,450
cuts of something that's a little rarer

417
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,460
I think that adds a little more I don't

418
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,460
know prestige to the strains themselves

419
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,650
free every breeder yeah of course I mean

420
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,470
you can look at examples from say the

421
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,790
Brothers Grimm with Apollo 11 and 13

422
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,710
where you know I think they're pretty

423
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:49,950
good examples of how you know the

424
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,470
limited stock is kind of added to the

425
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,269
the mystique of them right it's

426
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:59,259
interesting you say that about how their

427
00:19:55,269 --> 00:20:00,429
f2s do you choose to not list on because

428
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,859
you know like a lot of companies will

429
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:05,139
you know these are f2s I've never seen

430
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:08,288
that on energy any of your packaging do

431
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:12,038
you purposely choose not to do that I

432
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:15,700
just I guess I've never considered it

433
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:18,970
I'm fairly old-school I have I have

434
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,058
designers that do most of the packaging

435
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:25,659
design for me and stuff and I basically

436
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:28,269
send them a list of what I want on there

437
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:32,528
and that never has been a part of what

438
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:34,929
I've sent them I am gonna be redoing my

439
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:38,409
packaging soon though which would

440
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:41,200
probably include what generation it

441
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:42,970
would be yeah I think it would be it'd

442
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,769
be cool to include that because um it

443
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,659
kind of makes sense that you said they

444
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:48,700
were f2f threes because I've always

445
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:51,970
noticed you know a lot of consistency

446
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,460
with your stock I guess the next

447
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,919
question would be though in terms of

448
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,619
that limited-edition and limited

449
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,450
releases back to one of my favorite

450
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:03,939
strains from you the it's such a

451
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:07,298
mouthful the granddaddy platinum berry

452
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:10,028
cookies this is one that came out

453
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:11,859
initially and then I've seen it on one

454
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:13,808
other seed banks since then but as you

455
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:16,089
said you don't really restock it too

456
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:17,798
much when we see this with your strains

457
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:20,230
is that due to the fact that year you

458
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,929
are just pretty much following that

459
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,149
limited edition route or maybe some of

460
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,460
them you just later on decided I'll look

461
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:29,079
that strain doesn't really stand up to

462
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,710
some of the others we've got now I'm not

463
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:36,189
gonna redo it for that reason it's a

464
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:38,169
mixture of both actually it gives me it

465
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,879
doesn't lock me into something that I

466
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:43,269
don't feel confident about breeding in

467
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:45,699
the future if people like it then they

468
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:48,069
had it chant get it well it was limited

469
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,850
edition but it also gives me time and

470
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:54,099
room to work on something new but along

471
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:55,748
with this f1 line that I'll be coming

472
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,398
out with in the near future I'm also

473
00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:00,999
going to be coming out with a classics

474
00:21:57,398 --> 00:22:02,918
line which will be the granddaddy

475
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:05,528
platinum part berry cookies grandma's

476
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,528
sugar cookies and a few other strains

477
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:12,500
that have been requested heavily for

478
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:15,558
returns so those will become

479
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,929
back out and that's part you know though

480
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:20,029
then those will be less of a limited

481
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:22,940
edition release they'll still be

482
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:25,369
numbered as of right now I limit

483
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,350
everything no matter no matter the

484
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:29,379
strain I won't sell more than two

485
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:32,839
hundred and fifty packs of a strain on

486
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:35,120
the classic line and the f1 line I will

487
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,980
probably both allow those to be 500

488
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:41,239
packs maximum so they'll still be

489
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,589
limited I just not quite as limited yeah

490
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,140
a little more available but maybe the

491
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:47,209
people who are after it right and that's

492
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,970
that's part of my my plan is you know

493
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,679
there's certain people that want say

494
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,048
granddaddy Platinum Park Berry cookies a

495
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,950
known and trusted strain but it's not

496
00:22:54,048 --> 00:23:00,650
available to you know but if it'll be in

497
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,509
the future within the year probably I'll

498
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,820
be dropping and actually another drop of

499
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:08,000
those yeah fantastic

500
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:10,788
so moving on

501
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,529
you've got your CBD diesel and this is

502
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:15,019
kind of a broader topic I wanted to talk

503
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:17,269
about when you were creating your CV DD

504
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,769
so obviously you were probably thinking

505
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:21,679
something along the lines of I would

506
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:24,950
like to make a CBD strain what type of

507
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:28,970
lab testing goes into the making of a

508
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:31,548
CBD strain or if there wasn't any how

509
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,169
much kind of testing on the but itself

510
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:34,940
do you have to do because I've as much

511
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:36,650
as people might kind of cringe at this

512
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,150
idea I have spoken to a breeder before

513
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,280
who said they didn't use a lot of lab

514
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,659
testing to make their CBD Australian

515
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:44,058
like they did at the very last step but

516
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,520
up until that point they had just gone

517
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:48,500
on kind of you know anecdotal results

518
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,690
from people of you know what what is the

519
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,159
most medicinal in your opinion and they

520
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,710
said that they kind of got to a good

521
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,330
point using that method but a lot of

522
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,579
people would kind of disagree and say no

523
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:00,319
you should be using lab tests every step

524
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:02,538
of the way you know how did your project

525
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:07,279
work you know what kind of side of that

526
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:09,919
argument do you fall on really have an

527
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:15,069
argument there I dunno where I lie as in

528
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:20,919
the testing for myself I run final stage

529
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:24,139
tested flour product but I start with

530
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,000
known genetics I work with few

531
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,190
dispensaries here that

532
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,180
trying to put out you know medicine for

533
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,620
the patients and they give me a cut of

534
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,200
something that they have that they know

535
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:38,899
what it tests at and then I work with it

536
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,860
alter it change it for what we want and

537
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:45,710
then send it back to be tested you know

538
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:47,329
multiple batches to find out which Fenno

539
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,400
and then we keep progressing on from

540
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:53,689
there I've actually been working with a

541
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,340
guy here in town know if he wants me to

542
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,590
call him out my name and I don't have a

543
00:24:55,339 --> 00:25:02,539
permission yet so I'm not going to but

544
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:04,599
he's got an extremely high CBD extremely

545
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:08,839
low THC

546
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:10,519
canna tonic that I'm working with that I

547
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,579
really think is going to put out some

548
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:17,240
good medicine for the patient's know and

549
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:20,149
so nice sorry and so what's your kind of

550
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,490
you dream for your CBD lines you just

551
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,380
want to make a really good CBD strain

552
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:26,180
and kind of leave it there for people to

553
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,390
do what they want with it or are you

554
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:31,580
thinking no there's a specific kind of

555
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:34,100
illness I'm actually looking to target

556
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:38,000
so I might refine it towards that for

557
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:40,939
example well I

558
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,660
I'm actually the reason they to get into

559
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:47,480
it and if my dream come true I'd be able

560
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:50,000
to come up with an amazing CBD strain or

561
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:54,380
multiple strains some high THC V strains

562
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,900
something that will be free to anyone

563
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,640
that needs it any dispensary that wants

564
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,400
to provide it to a patient any grower

565
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,200
that wants to grow for themselves that's

566
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,040
the true medicine side of the industry

567
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:11,059
and I don't want to be a pharmaceutical

568
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,399
company ever I want to be a helper of

569
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:15,019
people so if that could ever be free to

570
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,480
the people whether it's from me or other

571
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:20,779
growers or whoever that would that would

572
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,789
be my dream for the CBD field my CBD

573
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:27,740
project says if now have basically been

574
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:29,599
to start my working in it and try

575
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,390
inspire some of the other people around

576
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:35,839
me that hey you know we're not after you

577
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:38,330
know 35 percent THC but that can be a

578
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,379
goal but there's other stuff that you

579
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:45,019
can be doing also

580
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:47,270
yeah exactly death so um your your made

581
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:49,220
a og this is an interesting one to me

582
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:51,710
because a few people have done a similar

583
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:55,669
route to you where they decide to leave

584
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,538
one of the parents kind of non document

585
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,520
and you know like they're they're not

586
00:26:56,538 --> 00:27:02,390
gonna fully release the details of it

587
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:04,009
what what in your mind is the reason for

588
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,870
doing this it obviously adds a bit of

589
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:07,548
mystique you know I think in my mind the

590
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:09,229
first person who comes to mind is you

591
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:10,759
know the cookie fan with the Girl Scout

592
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,319
cookies that's probably the most notable

593
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:15,440
one where we don't know the full

594
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,269
genetics do you think that it's a little

595
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,000
bit of a marketing move and if so I

596
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:21,918
think it's a good one um but is it maybe

597
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,500
something else for you maybe maybe you

598
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,929
don't quite know the father what's the

599
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,909
reason for that no it's actually like

600
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:32,000
kind of a it was a marketing move but in

601
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:34,900
a way that you wouldn't think there have

602
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,220
been several genetics that have been

603
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,940
swindled from me I'll call it I won't

604
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,079
call people thieves on that but and I

605
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,610
don't want them getting the credit

606
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:48,408
locally to me so I just I sometimes keep

607
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:51,399
that certain things secret to not blow

608
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:54,679
up the strain that they're holding yeah

609
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,360
so it's it it's not for my market being

610
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:57,919
it's for like anti marketing to the

611
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:01,579
people who have my strains that

612
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,500
shouldn't have them we search a few ones

613
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:05,779
that I didn't one out there and they're

614
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,329
out there so I just don't give them the

615
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:10,339
credit so they don't you know yeah and

616
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:11,990
so that kind of brings us to an

617
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:14,899
interesting point what is your thoughts

618
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,880
on sharing of genetics and I guess more

619
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,330
specifically for someone who buys your

620
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,690
genetics maybe even a future breeder

621
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:25,369
well what would be your kind of your

622
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,259
protocol or you know your recommendation

623
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:29,569
for them for using yours or someone

624
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:31,400
else's strange do you think that as long

625
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:32,839
as they ask you first you know like hey

626
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm gonna make this strain I'd like to

627
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:37,519
use this that's fine with you or do you

628
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,089
think nah they don't even need to ask or

629
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:43,970
you know what's your thoughts on it I

630
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:45,949
think asking is polite but people are

631
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,860
gonna do what they want to do and as far

632
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,808
as like I was gonna be kind of a

633
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,998
smartass and answer your your protocol

634
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:57,548
call question all they got to do is

635
00:28:52,999 --> 00:29:00,259
in the ground that's all they have to do

636
00:28:57,548 --> 00:29:01,788
but like I said asking is polite I

637
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:03,588
appreciate it when people ask me and I

638
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:05,388
feel honored when somebody feels like

639
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:08,058
breeding with my stock

640
00:29:05,388 --> 00:29:10,188
I'm never pissed about it that's you

641
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:12,888
know there's nothing but love in the

642
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:14,499
industry it's a plant we're all just

643
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:18,378
working to try to make it better

644
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:21,769
yeah and so I've spoken to another

645
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:24,798
breeder before and they said I think

646
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:26,028
that people should should try to make it

647
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,769
their own in a way you know like if

648
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:29,979
you're gonna breed with my work take it

649
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:32,149
to the f2 first and try to refine a

650
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:33,979
characteristic you like about it first

651
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:35,628
and then you've got more of a claim to

652
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:37,129
say that you know like this is my strain

653
00:29:35,628 --> 00:29:39,048
I've actually done you know I take it to

654
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:40,759
the f2 and then use it to make your new

655
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:42,078
strain how do you feel about that or do

656
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,999
you think like now if someone just wants

657
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:45,408
to use my strain straight from the

658
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:52,068
generation they get it I'm okay with

659
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:53,959
that I think putting work into it is as

660
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:55,999
part of paying the dues and calling

661
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:58,519
yourself a breeder if you just throw

662
00:29:55,999 --> 00:30:01,759
pollen on a plant you successfully bred

663
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:04,759
something but I would call that breeding

664
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:07,159
yet you know put in a little put in a

665
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:09,288
few groves get it stabilized a little

666
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:13,189
bit in what direction you want and then

667
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:15,648
let people know about it yeah okay

668
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:17,209
ci so people shouldn't announce the the

669
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:23,388
new best breeder in the world when

670
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:24,649
they've made their first f1 get on the

671
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:28,428
mind of a lot of breeders it must be

672
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:32,288
really annoying yeah it happens a lot

673
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:34,369
and nowadays just more ore than ever I

674
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:37,088
remember when you could count the

675
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:40,308
breeders out there on two hands you know

676
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:42,979
now they're theirs you need pages on the

677
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:48,259
internet to list the breeders yeah so

678
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:50,869
how do you know sorry going yeah I was

679
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:53,298
gonna say how do you manage to kind of

680
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:55,368
stay relevant in the industry in your

681
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:58,459
mind do you just take the approach of

682
00:30:55,368 --> 00:31:00,408
I'll let my work speak for itself or do

683
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:02,808
you feel that as you kind of reference

684
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:04,080
there are just so many people breeders

685
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:06,329
at least

686
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,119
it's kind of hard to get lost in the sea

687
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:11,339
of you know marketing almost what do you

688
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,169
think is required these days for a

689
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:14,519
breeder do you think you know as you

690
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,190
mentioned before the interview do you

691
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,950
think having a social media presence is

692
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:23,820
like a good or a bad thing or what do

693
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:26,910
you think these days in 2016 it's

694
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:29,909
definitely a good thing I wish that I

695
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:33,390
could be better at it I'm kind of old

696
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:37,050
school I don't get on the internet much

697
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:42,270
I don't serve I recently figured out

698
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:45,659
what a meme was so I'm not real big on

699
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:47,430
the internet stuff but and I'm going to

700
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,980
work on at it like that's something no

701
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,080
to the other growers the people that

702
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,470
want knowledge about my strains that you

703
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,490
know connect with the fan base I've got

704
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,029
to get better at it

705
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:02,130
posting pictures is not that hard and

706
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:04,619
answering people's questions is not that

707
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,840
hard so I'm going to get better at it

708
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:15,750
but in this day and time it is it's

709
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:17,879
almost a necessity I could up here for

710
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,980
money or fame or anything like that

711
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,710
I'm here it's a behind-the-scenes

712
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,880
breeder that is you know doing the real

713
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:28,620
work in my mind to get this industry

714
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:32,760
headed towards towards a even more

715
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:35,639
positive progression yeah so do you like

716
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,400
to go to you know like the cups and the

717
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,290
events and to meet the guests or do you

718
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:45,630
think that's something I'd like to do

719
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:49,369
but I don't do it quite yet no we we've

720
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:54,000
had a couple booths at because I haven't

721
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:58,229
competed yet I don't know call it nerves

722
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,549
or not wanting to be disappointed but I

723
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:04,319
haven't competed yet so I'm hoping that

724
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:06,299
whenever I throw something in I'll get

725
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,659
it cut my first go-around I highly doubt

726
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:12,809
that that would make me feel good though

727
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:15,360
yeah sorry meeting but oh no you're good

728
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:18,509
I enjoy meeting the fans the

729
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,039
customers the growers people that come

730
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:22,048
up to the booth and don't buy anything

731
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,009
and talk for 20 minutes that's some my

732
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:28,440
favorite people I'm not there for sales

733
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:30,558
I'm there to meet people and hang out

734
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,509
with people with like minds you know

735
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:37,048
yeah for sure I've actually I was gonna

736
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:38,460
say I've spoken to similarly in these

737
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,529
stories they're all the same breed I

738
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,480
just don't have a their name to give out

739
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:45,149
but um they they were saying that

740
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,910
winning a cup as a breeder is not the

741
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:50,130
be-all end-all because you know like the

742
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:51,540
the cut that wins a cup it could just be

743
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,610
like a one in a million I like that

744
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:56,069
strain could be garbage overall but like

745
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:58,649
that one being was really good you know

746
00:33:56,069 --> 00:34:00,539
what I mean yeah so I think that was

747
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,160
kind of saying as a breeder yeah it's

748
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,918
it's not the biggest reflection of your

749
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,590
skills as a breeder that definitely

750
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,710
that's why I haven't competed there's at

751
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:12,449
least to a small extent I want to pay my

752
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,789
dues in the industry a lot of people are

753
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:17,189
like who's this new guy we're not

754
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:20,898
actually that new we're just new to the

755
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:23,250
mainstream scene I guess you could say

756
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:25,858
we're pretty leery like I said we came

757
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,480
from a zero tolerance state and you know

758
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:30,840
over a decade ago though I moved to

759
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,909
Colorado and that's kind of opened my

760
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:38,669
mind and opened the doors to this yeah

761
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,889
so what was what was it like to

762
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:43,378
transition to a full-time breeder as

763
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,179
your job especially I guess when it when

764
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:46,858
you're in that legal environment you

765
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,320
know was there a kind of a defining

766
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:51,418
moment where you just thought yeah now

767
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,080
is the time this is what I want to do or

768
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:58,019
did you just kind of stumble into it

769
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,319
there was well I guess it's a mixture of

770
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,730
both

771
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:06,470
I've always bred I remember breeding my

772
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:10,949
first personal like for me growing I

773
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:15,239
probably like 18 years old I started I'm

774
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:19,409
now 34 but that was when I started off

775
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:21,469
on my own I'm sorry I'm smoking a blunt

776
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:26,730
right now and I told the guys side track

777
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:28,949
hey basically in between working I

778
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:33,088
decided hey

779
00:35:28,949 --> 00:35:35,909
I could start now and start putting my

780
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:38,009
full attention to this and really kind

781
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:40,949
of make something not even for myself I

782
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:44,550
figured you know it could be something

783
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:46,889
for my children as as the u.s. kind of

784
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:49,470
started changing its laws and things

785
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:52,348
started opening up I figured it might be

786
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:54,059
good to put my name out there as like

787
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,740
hey you know this is what we've been

788
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,509
doing for a while we're ready to

789
00:35:55,739 --> 00:36:00,449
announce it and be out in the industry

790
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,700
with everyone else there was a moment

791
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,139
and that was basically when everyone's

792
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:07,169
seen everything starting to come online

793
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:09,179
that was I decided like hey it's just

794
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,889
time to put your name out there and then

795
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:13,319
and I was going through a lot of flack

796
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:15,299
from family from friends everyone was

797
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,910
like man you're gonna get arrested I

798
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,680
said you know somebody's got to do it we

799
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:23,069
got to let everyone know this is the you

800
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:26,129
know what we got to do yeah and have you

801
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:29,280
ever had any run-ins with the law after

802
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,838
that point like after the you know like

803
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,630
they kind of looked like things we're

804
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:38,849
becoming less and less strict so to

805
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:41,789
speak no I've not had any altercations

806
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:43,800
or issues at all

807
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:47,429
and where I'm at locally though things

808
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,670
are pretty relaxed Colorado's very

809
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:52,889
relaxed on the marijuana scene so as

810
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,838
long as you mind your P's and Q's and do

811
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:57,838
what the state tells you to do there's

812
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:01,858
you know nothing to fear yeah

813
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:04,230
and so the johnston farm you guys

814
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:10,858
organic or synthetic and what's your

815
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:15,838
reasons behind that well through at our

816
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:19,279
location it's organic but we do have

817
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:23,068
other growers that grow by other means

818
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:28,349
everything from everything from

819
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:31,920
aeroponics hydroponics and more so i've

820
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:35,190
seen my strains tested locally you know

821
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,690
amongst my grower friends before they

822
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,639
hit the mark I see what they do on

823
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:42,440
almost like every setup with every

824
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:45,150
growing feeding

825
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,880
schedule you could imagine almost and

826
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,139
which one do you think do planets come

827
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,910
out the best in or do you think it's

828
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:55,559
that may be a grower by grower basis I

829
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:57,420
would probably say VY grower basis I

830
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,329
recommend growers when they asked me

831
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,889
what nutrient line to grow if I asked

832
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:05,429
them whatever they're comfortable with

833
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:07,619
that's the main thing having experience

834
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:09,690
with the line or knowing the line and

835
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,400
knowing how to run it that's gonna give

836
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,670
you the best success I've seen amazing

837
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:19,849
buds grown every method my personal

838
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:24,240
favorite is organic but yeah including

839
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:25,920
insecticides that no insecticides my

840
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,769
seeds like even though they would be an

841
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,690
expensive treat I will compete Bordeaux

842
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:38,250
Papa pack in their mouth and chew him up

843
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:42,960
and eat them they're quite healthy I do

844
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:45,900
with them yeah my own slope maintains

845
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,889
his defense will always be that it's its

846
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:54,480
bird feeding it is actually years and

847
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:58,230
years ago I started thing on a I think

848
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,820
it was on a UK chat forum that I was on

849
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:03,300
and I started something called Operation

850
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:06,150
bird drop and I was just promoting

851
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,890
everyone to put their seeds whatever

852
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,200
spare seeds they had in their bird

853
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:12,980
feeders and you know if everyone did

854
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:17,309
that could you imagine what the wild

855
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:19,260
marijuana population would be yeah you

856
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:21,570
couldn't you couldn't have something

857
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,100
that was you could make it illegal if it

858
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:27,510
was on every street corner literally

859
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:29,759
yeah they'd struggle it works

860
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:34,620
I had pot plants all up and down my

861
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,820
neighborhood cool so just going back to

862
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:37,619
that point you made about you know no

863
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,980
insecticides keeping it nice and healthy

864
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:43,650
have you ever noticed a difference in

865
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,480
the quality of seeds produced from a

866
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,639
plant that is say treated you know

867
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,630
organically really healthy the way you

868
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:53,730
do it versus say maybe one that's not

869
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,680
grown with the same love you know not

870
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,570
the same at end

871
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,339
have you ever noticed that the seeds

872
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:01,289
maybe from yours come out better or

873
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:06,180
maybe worse than the other you know the

874
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:10,199
less well maintained plant and I can't

875
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:14,029
say specifically but comparing my seeds

876
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:17,759
my average seeds to a multitude of other

877
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:21,420
genetic company seeds I see a size

878
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,030
difference and that to me speaks for the

879
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,159
health of the seed you know a teeny

880
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:29,040
teeny tiny seed that's not well colored

881
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,799
to me you know it's just not as healthy

882
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,929
as a big fat plump you know properly

883
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,570
colored seed and I don't know if that's

884
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:39,299
coming from use of chemicals or not

885
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:42,630
that's why I can't really say but I do

886
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,980
see a size difference between mine and

887
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,289
some other companies not all other

888
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:50,849
companies there are definitely some good

889
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:53,730
breeders out there yeah so um recently

890
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:56,519
we've seen that there's a bit of a crowd

891
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,990
mentality in terms of hating on blue

892
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:02,250
dream I'm sure you're pretty familiar

893
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:04,619
with it yeah what what do you think

894
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:07,619
about this and what do you think about

895
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:09,659
the idea of like the straw it's blue

896
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,400
dream hate today but like what will it

897
00:41:09,659 --> 00:41:13,739
be tomorrow and the reason why I asked

898
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,510
is because you know you breed with the

899
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:17,639
Girl Scout cookies and I'm a firm

900
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:19,230
believer that one day Girl Scout cookies

901
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:20,730
will be on that bandwagon with blue

902
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,230
dream or maybe blue dream won't be on it

903
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,050
anymore but you know what I mean people

904
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,780
will be hiding on it do you think that's

905
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:31,560
already started anything that gets real

906
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:33,030
big starts to get too much positive

907
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,099
attention someone out there is gonna

908
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:37,260
speak out and bring some negative

909
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:38,940
attention towards it and then mob

910
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,370
mentality you know somebody's always

911
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,460
gonna be there to jump on the bandwagon

912
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:45,929
that's really all it is in my opinion

913
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,460
yeah so do you just kind of disregard

914
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:49,199
that when you're breeding and like so

915
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,079
like I guess maybe the bigger question

916
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,719
is are you not scared to breed with

917
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,639
certain strains based on maybe how

918
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,439
they'll be perceived in the future are

919
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:02,219
you just like nah if it's good today I'm

920
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,110
gonna use it yeah not at all I there are

921
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:07,019
the only things that I have like steered

922
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:08,250
clear from are some some strains that

923
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,590
have some

924
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,909
like outrageous name aims or kind of

925
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:16,350
names I wouldn't want to keep going

926
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:19,409
that's the only thing I've stopped not

927
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:20,789
because of people's views on what the

928
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:24,420
strain will be now or in the future

929
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:25,889
though no ok and by when you say the

930
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,480
names of strains you means like maybe

931
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:32,759
the more hard drug referenced ones

932
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:36,809
correct yeah I don't want to name one

933
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:39,270
out but yeah yeah yeah how should I keep

934
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:43,230
a positive vibe or you know or at least

935
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:46,949
a not a negative vibe yeah

936
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:50,340
yeah so like the name with the strain

937
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:52,799
carries a little bit of like I don't

938
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,800
want to call it karma but you know it's

939
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,720
the name associated with it

940
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,570
yeah you don't want some to happen name

941
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:04,619
so how do you feel about people who make

942
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:06,660
f ones giving the strains names before

943
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,159
they've even kind of grown them out I

944
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:10,109
guess it's maybe ties into a breeder

945
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,480
type of question but if you're a breeder

946
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,740
and you make a new f1 and you're just

947
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,599
giving it out to your friends straight

948
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:17,699
away you haven't even tested it yourself

949
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,799
and you're giving it this you know some

950
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:21,329
crazy you know purple spaceship or you

951
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,160
know just some some crazy name or

952
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:25,110
whatever do you think that that's like a

953
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:27,179
bit of a miss service to the people who

954
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,890
like you have done the work like in my

955
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:30,329
opinion if you're just goofing around

956
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:32,339
you make an f1 I don't think you should

957
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:33,449
really name it until you've like you

958
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,519
know like I think a name should kind of

959
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:37,559
reflect some of the characteristics of

960
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,610
the strain like do you think the same or

961
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:40,110
do you think like now you might just

962
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:42,470
have a hunch before you've even grown it

963
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:46,320
out and you know what I mean I

964
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:48,329
definitely agree especially like you may

965
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,900
name something this cool last name that

966
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:54,299
and now you put it paired with this

967
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,980
stupid plant that you grew and now that

968
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,560
cool names taken you know you should

969
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,530
have saved that for a cooler plant yeah

970
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,090
that's a good point yeah yes

971
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,130
save the cool names wait till you know

972
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:09,450
it's a legit plant and then give it its

973
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:12,769
badass name so yeah so if we looked at

974
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:16,829
on a typical Johnson breeding project

975
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:18,650
what would you list as in and this might

976
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:21,210
be a hard one in in order of priority

977
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,019
what are the traits you're breeding for

978
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:24,780
do you

979
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:27,869
you value you know flavor as the utmost

980
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,550
priority or potency or you know bag

981
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:31,559
appeal like we're how do you kind of

982
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:34,950
rate these traits in terms of what

983
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,929
you're aiming for I always throw one in

984
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:41,730
that my number one is one that I never

985
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:44,549
hear anyone name its structure the

986
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,219
structure of the plan itself is my

987
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:51,840
number one

988
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:54,239
hey having a healthy plant body is my

989
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:59,039
first that that's what I'm looking for

990
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:01,289
once once I have that I look for you

991
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:04,440
like you say that Holy Trinity of like

992
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:06,239
flavor potency yield that's that's a

993
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,519
hard one to balance and those three

994
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:12,179
obviously come right there in second

995
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:14,789
third and fourth my favorite though

996
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:16,579
would be taste the flavor is number one

997
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:19,800
for me

998
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:22,969
potency would be second and yield would

999
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,100
be third in that order of those three

1000
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:29,489
and so that's basically how I judge all

1001
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:31,469
of them now certain strains they get

1002
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:35,189
restructured in that in the priority

1003
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:37,980
order they're yeah mostly for like

1004
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,530
medical stuff and so I was like a bit of

1005
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,150
a follow-up do you think that kind of

1006
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,280
how I mentioned earlier with that kind

1007
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:47,039
of cease or an allergy do you think you

1008
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,040
always are kind of trading off some

1009
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,259
traits for the other or do you think it

1010
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,239
is possible to kind of get that the try

1011
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,750
factor in one or if you do it's very

1012
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:59,729
much like a one in a million

1013
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:02,280
yes you can you can find that perfect

1014
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:06,960
one or what will be right then at that

1015
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:10,380
moment seem perfect but for the most

1016
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,630
part be plus percent of the time it's a

1017
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,440
seesaw effect as you say you're giving

1018
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:18,900
and taking but you will find every once

1019
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,760
in a while that one plant that just even

1020
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,460
amongst all its peers it tastes better

1021
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,300
yields better you know effects better

1022
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:31,889
everything you will find some but it's

1023
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:34,230
rare yeah what type of testing do you

1024
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:35,239
like to do on a strain ideally like you

1025
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,219
what you know what

1026
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,379
numbers would you ideally like to run

1027
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:46,209
before you're confident a strain can go

1028
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:50,630
to market at least 100 le at least 100

1029
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:53,380
sometimes I don't get happy with my

1030
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:56,930
breeding project and I start over I've

1031
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:59,180
I've had to run things you know over and

1032
00:46:56,929 --> 00:47:01,460
over to redo my breeding to a different

1033
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:04,509
they know and start over throw the seeds

1034
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:06,590
away I won't let them out and so

1035
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:08,540
sometimes for one strain to get out

1036
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,070
there it'll be a lot more than 100 it

1037
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:12,860
could be three or four hundred that I've

1038
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,300
ran to get that strain going in out

1039
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,920
there yeah

1040
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,840
and during this stage where you've got

1041
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,030
these nice big numbers is that where

1042
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,160
you're also potentially looking to maybe

1043
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:24,110
find a male for future breeding projects

1044
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:28,219
or is that a different project and maybe

1045
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:31,760
even more numbers than a hundred no I do

1046
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:34,879
in the hundred I look for both always

1047
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,220
the veiny plant any planning of any

1048
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,079
strain that I do I look for a winner

1049
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:42,858
male and a winner female or at least

1050
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:47,029
even a few you know but I'm sourcing

1051
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:50,599
down in the end result to one or two but

1052
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:53,920
I I do always search for the males while

1053
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:56,239
I'm running numbers with the females yes

1054
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,380
once they're sixth separately I don't

1055
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:04,819
want people to get confused and so

1056
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:06,650
what's it like for you as kind of you

1057
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,330
know I'm not gonna say a smaller breeder

1058
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,730
but maybe as you a lesser-known breeder

1059
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:12,409
what's it like for you to interact with

1060
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,420
the the big seed banks you know

1061
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:17,569
obviously you gear is on attitude which

1062
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:20,119
is really cool how what was that process

1063
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:22,039
like to get on there because a lot of

1064
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:23,960
breeders I speak to say it's actually a

1065
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:25,400
harder than you think to get on there so

1066
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,289
you seem to have gotten over that hurdle

1067
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,269
what's it like for you to interact with

1068
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:31,759
the seed banks and the distributors and

1069
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:36,130
you know all of that behind the end of

1070
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:42,320
the seed business in a short word weird

1071
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:47,869
new to me but it's it was it all came

1072
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:49,068
real fast I had started uh giving seeds

1073
00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:51,140
away

1074
00:48:49,068 --> 00:48:52,759
like I said I'm not I wasn't ever there

1075
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:56,449
for the money I didn't even expect to

1076
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:58,969
gain the attention that I did I was just

1077
00:48:56,449 --> 00:49:01,608
doing what I wanted to do and giving

1078
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:03,798
people seeds and then people were asking

1079
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:05,838
me how how they buy my seeds and I

1080
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:10,579
didn't have any avenues to send them to

1081
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:13,369
I didn't even have anyway so I told them

1082
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:15,528
well if if there's a demand for it hit

1083
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:19,009
your seed banks up and ask them to hit

1084
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:21,380
me up and so in the end and quite

1085
00:49:19,009 --> 00:49:23,539
quickly actually several seed banks

1086
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,400
including attitude we're contacting me

1087
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:27,199
saying how do we carry your gear and

1088
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,329
then I we just you know we had to work

1089
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:31,548
out the business side of things but as

1090
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:35,150
far as dealing with the distributors and

1091
00:49:31,548 --> 00:49:37,548
stuff they everyone contacted me awesome

1092
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:40,249
so yeah what would be your advice for

1093
00:49:37,548 --> 00:49:41,659
someone who's in a similar position to

1094
00:49:40,248 --> 00:49:42,978
what you were before you were selling

1095
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:44,719
would you just say yeah just get your

1096
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:48,768
stuff out there you get a good name and

1097
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:52,969
ask people to hit up the the banks yeah

1098
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:55,968
bill you know pay some dues first get

1099
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:58,188
some credit to your name do the right

1100
00:49:55,969 --> 00:50:00,259
thing that's you know number one don't

1101
00:49:58,188 --> 00:50:01,728
don't be in there just to try to get on

1102
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:04,248
attitude to try to make some money and

1103
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:06,018
stuff because in my opinion karma will

1104
00:50:04,248 --> 00:50:07,818
catch up it will you know things won't

1105
00:50:06,018 --> 00:50:08,838
work out something will trip up along

1106
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:11,119
the way

1107
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:13,208
just do what you like doing if you

1108
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,919
really want to be a breeder cuz that's a

1109
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:20,058
long time consuming thing and you got to

1110
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:20,629
be very patient it's you know just stick

1111
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,880
with it

1112
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,829
if you put in the work the work will

1113
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,599
show you know people want to grow those

1114
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:29,479
seeds everybody else doesn't have the

1115
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:31,219
time to do all that work to try to get

1116
00:50:29,478 --> 00:50:34,899
you know quality seeds for other people

1117
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:37,219
to grow yeah exactly

1118
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,429
okey dokey so just going back to one of

1119
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:43,009
the points we spoke about earlier

1120
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:45,798
you mentioned that you know f1 seeds

1121
00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:48,409
being the kind of you know this lottery

1122
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:51,469
idea of a seed a fairly well-known

1123
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:53,749
breeder made a statement a breeding

1124
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:57,079
panel at a few years ago and basically

1125
00:50:53,748 --> 00:51:00,948
said we make F ones because that's what

1126
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:02,360
the market dictates that really sounds

1127
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:03,860
like it doesn't sound entirely

1128
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,200
do you think that's the truth do you

1129
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:08,420
think people want F ones because I

1130
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:10,639
always say to people you know a clone

1131
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,460
only isn't three different phenotypes

1132
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:17,480
it's just one you know so what yep

1133
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:20,210
no I agree 100% stability is king there

1134
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,800
is a place in the market for F ones now

1135
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:24,829
because people do want something

1136
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,960
different and and that's why I decided

1137
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:33,799
that here in the future I'm going out

1138
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:36,170
with F one specific line stabilities

1139
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,470
came though the work that the breeders

1140
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:43,070
put in to to make you know the strains

1141
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:48,019
come out the same it's that's what

1142
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:50,360
really shows a breeders skill and gives

1143
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:52,550
gets my appreciation there's some

1144
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,740
breeders out there that have put in many

1145
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:57,320
years of art work to achieve the

1146
00:51:54,739 --> 00:52:00,139
stability so so to say that only F once

1147
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:02,480
is that all that people need that almost

1148
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:06,379
like discredit all the years of like the

1149
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:09,710
founding fathers of breeding yeah and so

1150
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,690
what would be one of your little tips or

1151
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,070
tricks you're willing to share for your

1152
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,650
selection you know when you're looking

1153
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:17,660
for a male what's one of your go-to

1154
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:20,750
techniques you know a lot of people they

1155
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:22,339
they love to go to their stem Rob what's

1156
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:26,590
what's one of your tips for all our

1157
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:30,170
viewers on how to pick a good male well

1158
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:35,500
the stem Rob is you know classic but in

1159
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:38,480
my opinion also generic it's I look for

1160
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,159
white it's hard to explain I kind of

1161
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,740
like since the plant and look at it and

1162
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:46,460
I look at the plant as a whole how is

1163
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:48,079
its flower production yeah

1164
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,409
how's its flower production like the

1165
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:55,069
density of its clusters the structure of

1166
00:52:51,409 --> 00:53:00,109
the plant as a whole like robustness of

1167
00:52:55,070 --> 00:53:02,059
the individual branches they look for

1168
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:04,370
you know what you would picture in a

1169
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:07,299
male of any breeding program of other

1170
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:15,980
animals I look for a good stud healthy

1171
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:19,310
big robust for its strain profile young

1172
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:21,230
well smells can be varied I trust

1173
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:23,599
usually with what I'm working with I

1174
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:26,809
kind of know the smell profile with what

1175
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:29,480
I'm working with so I'm for my breedings

1176
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:32,088
I'm looking at its structure a lot yeah

1177
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,900
so kind of on an idea you just picked up

1178
00:53:32,088 --> 00:53:38,210
on is breathing a art or a science to

1179
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,760
you you know like like sort of put it in

1180
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:44,449
you know the the most extreme terms do

1181
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:46,550
you think a robot with a set of traits

1182
00:53:44,449 --> 00:53:47,838
to look at would be able to breed as

1183
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,609
well as a human or do you think no

1184
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:52,070
there's always that that kind of that

1185
00:53:49,608 --> 00:53:52,730
hunch that vibe which makes maybe a

1186
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,140
breeder

1187
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:57,530
the difference between a good and a

1188
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:59,179
great breeder no I don't think robot

1189
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:01,700
would be able to come close they would

1190
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:03,199
be able to grow a plant but they

1191
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:05,059
wouldn't have the same love connection

1192
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:09,588
where you could feel with what the plant

1193
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:12,529
needs what the plant you know you could

1194
00:54:09,588 --> 00:54:15,019
see capabilities and plants that a robot

1195
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:17,030
wouldn't be able to there's no

1196
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:20,659
connection there's no love with the

1197
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:24,940
machine like that I definitely feel a

1198
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:28,969
deep connection with all my plants so I

1199
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:31,730
for me personally it's a got a huge art

1200
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:34,250
form to it or at least some form of

1201
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:37,639
connection between the growers or

1202
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:40,130
breeder or you know the plant yeah so

1203
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:41,449
how do you feel about um kind of these I

1204
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,190
don't know I don't think it's the case

1205
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:46,279
in America but in Australia for example

1206
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:49,159
there's proposals of having these really

1207
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,140
big kind of you know almost like your

1208
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:53,029
tobacco conglomerates like you fill up

1209
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:55,368
Morrison's would be the ones owning and

1210
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:57,170
operating these big warehouses producing

1211
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:59,599
the medical weed for the Australian

1212
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:01,849
market do you think in that situation

1213
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,730
where you say got you know one grower

1214
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:07,430
looking after a thousand plants you know

1215
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:09,170
obviously they can't give the love to

1216
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,519
each plant that you would be able to on

1217
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:13,280
a smaller scale would you think that

1218
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:14,480
that would really impact the the quality

1219
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,720
or do you think that at the end of the

1220
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,068
day it may be a little bit you know it's

1221
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:21,348
not going to impact it as much as you

1222
00:55:19,068 --> 00:55:22,849
might think to be looking after tons of

1223
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:27,160
plants and to not be able to give them

1224
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:29,420
that little bit of extra love well I

1225
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:33,048
think when that starts

1226
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:34,490
it will start at some point I think that

1227
00:55:33,048 --> 00:55:36,559
the people that are doing it will have

1228
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:40,489
enough money to figure out the systems

1229
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,990
to run it will they won't have the

1230
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:43,279
connections with the plants because the

1231
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:45,699
numbers are there it'll be a

1232
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,950
commercialized product it won't be like

1233
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:50,808
what is in Colorado right now that's

1234
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:54,789
more like a craft product like a

1235
00:55:50,809 --> 00:56:02,569
microbrew of beers there's will be the

1236
00:55:54,789 --> 00:56:05,019
you know the natural light and so yeah

1237
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:09,469
I'm sorry going no go ahead I'm sorry

1238
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:11,690
yeah well I was just gonna say so with

1239
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:14,269
just kind of you just spurred the idea

1240
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:17,030
the natural light you know how do you

1241
00:56:14,269 --> 00:56:19,489
feel endure rates to outdoor in terms of

1242
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:21,559
the medicinal quality you know it's that

1243
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:23,199
time of the year where I me personally

1244
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:25,609
I'm seeing Instagram flooded with

1245
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,588
pictures of how outdoor is better than

1246
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:29,719
indoor blah blah blah you know I don't

1247
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:32,599
really care for the debate myself but do

1248
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,889
you think it is just like a baton thing

1249
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:38,180
or do you think there is a legitimate

1250
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:41,808
argument to be had everything has its

1251
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:45,440
pros and cons with outdoor you you can

1252
00:56:41,809 --> 00:56:47,630
have a longer season as far as one

1253
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:52,130
individual plant have the right amount

1254
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:54,160
of light and space for it to grow but

1255
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:56,809
indoors you you can have a more isolated

1256
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:59,868
controlled environment and you can do

1257
00:56:56,809 --> 00:57:02,990
things outdoors that you can't do so

1258
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:07,130
they both have their pros and cons I do

1259
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:08,838
I appreciate both I can't say that I

1260
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:11,660
like one better than the other I do a

1261
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:17,509
lot of work indoors but I also have

1262
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:19,129
greenhouses so we we appreciate both its

1263
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:23,109
you just have you have different perks

1264
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:26,740
and different downfalls for each one yep

1265
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:30,469
and so we often hear people talk about

1266
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:32,808
this idea of how with hybridized strains

1267
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:34,548
- we need to go back to our land race

1268
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:35,240
roots and we need to you know start

1269
00:57:34,548 --> 00:57:40,009
fresh

1270
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:41,750
this idea has been around for ages D and

1271
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,140
you kind of referenced earlier that

1272
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,900
you're gonna

1273
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:46,788
yourself do you think the general

1274
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,798
mainstream will actually do it though

1275
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:50,630
like everyone always talks about it but

1276
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,429
no one ever actually does it also it

1277
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:56,079
seems do you think that we will just

1278
00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:59,480
keep hybridizing I think it'll stay

1279
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:02,150
getting more and more hybridized and

1280
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,329
then at some point the land races will

1281
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:08,660
be looked at as a prized possession I

1282
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:11,150
don't think that most you know the

1283
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:14,750
profitable breeding companies out there

1284
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:16,548
are looking at restarting with new land

1285
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:18,219
races and taking up parts of their grow

1286
00:58:16,548 --> 00:58:22,190
for that it's I don't think it is that

1287
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:26,568
profitable but it's something I'm going

1288
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:29,028
to be doing and look forward to I go eat

1289
00:58:26,568 --> 00:58:30,230
I'm old school like I said I go back to

1290
00:58:29,028 --> 00:58:32,838
my roots I watched black-and-white

1291
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:35,358
movies all the time so I have more

1292
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:39,619
appreciation for the old school so I

1293
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:41,659
think it'll be good to go back to the

1294
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:44,750
roots of some of the old genetics that I

1295
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:46,129
have and bring them back out and a lot

1296
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:48,079
of people like some of the old school

1297
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:50,329
smokes I get people all the time saying

1298
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,720
you know where's the old weed at this

1299
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:55,369
stuff's too strong that's not it's not

1300
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:58,189
me personally but some of the old-timers

1301
00:58:55,369 --> 00:59:01,130
say that and you know the why are we

1302
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:02,929
gonna try to you know not grow for a

1303
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:04,818
certain group of people that still want

1304
00:59:02,929 --> 00:59:06,699
something that used to bring them back

1305
00:59:04,818 --> 00:59:09,528
to that era of thought

1306
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:11,929
yeah well I've actually thought about

1307
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:14,659
this topic a little bit myself and I on

1308
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:18,578
a personal note think that whether it's

1309
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:22,670
consciously or subconsciously the the

1310
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:26,028
the brand TGA seeds I think they are

1311
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:27,889
kind of filling that nation away because

1312
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:29,778
I mean it's my opinion and I think a lot

1313
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:32,118
of people's opinions that their weed

1314
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:34,190
isn't the most potent but it's really

1315
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:35,900
flavorful and so you can kind of you

1316
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:38,358
know like smoke a bit more of it without

1317
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,740
getting knocked about and so I think

1318
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:42,558
it's interesting that we are seeing that

1319
00:59:39,739 --> 00:59:44,598
the rise of I think it is probably

1320
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,220
subconsciously in their case but um you

1321
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:48,109
know like breeders filling quite

1322
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:52,759
specific niches and maybe not even

1323
00:59:48,108 --> 00:59:55,489
realizing it right and that's the way it

1324
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:58,280
you know everything works everything by

1325
00:59:55,489 --> 01:00:01,699
it's a way every puzzle has its place

1326
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:06,019
every puzzle piece has its place whether

1327
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:09,259
it knows it goes there or not but as far

1328
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:12,820
as me I I try to make a lot of my moves

1329
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:15,410
and breeds intentional whether they all

1330
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:19,730
come out across that way I don't know

1331
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:23,029
but it but I try and then on you'll see

1332
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:24,619
here soon because everything will be

1333
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:28,090
breeding except for the f1 line

1334
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:31,579
everything will have an average

1335
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:34,940
percentages for its potency on the on

1336
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:37,960
the seed package because I'm doing

1337
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:42,110
everything is getting heavily tested now

1338
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:43,670
so you'll see some here in the future

1339
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:45,320
that will probably be lower percentage

1340
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:49,340
numbers and that will be on purpose

1341
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:50,750
that'll be in in reminiscence of the old

1342
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,850
school strains because some of them

1343
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:54,289
aren't gonna be that high and I'm gonna

1344
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:56,690
bring them up to what I can but I'm not

1345
01:00:54,289 --> 01:01:00,050
gonna try to exclude the old school

1346
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:02,150
traits that they had so um so you're

1347
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:06,470
stuck on sour is a new strain you've got

1348
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:08,570
and that uses the Sour Diesel in it what

1349
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:10,759
are some of the other you know clone

1350
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:12,320
only slash elite clones you know we

1351
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,820
spoke about the pine type course earlier

1352
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,200
what are some of the other coins out

1353
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:18,200
there that you would love to work with

1354
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:19,939
in breeding projects you know I consider

1355
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:29,599
them to be quite good and worth working

1356
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:33,619
with that's hard there's a few that my

1357
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:35,269
buddies have that are just old unknown

1358
01:01:33,619 --> 01:01:37,789
genetics they call them whatever but

1359
01:01:35,269 --> 01:01:39,789
they're not you know anything no they're

1360
01:01:37,789 --> 01:01:44,800
just stuff they've ran for a long time

1361
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:48,710
there's a sin sin d99 clone locally that

1362
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,960
I had for a moment and I didn't breed to

1363
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:54,559
it and I lost it you know you know I've

1364
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,599
done some shirt um but I never got

1365
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:59,119
around beating it and I'll still want to

1366
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:03,559
someone get back to it and then there's

1367
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:05,179
a lime Chernobyl cut around locally that

1368
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:09,110
I'm about to start working with

1369
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:10,199
hopefully it's lime Oh was that you

1370
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:12,750
talking about

1371
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:17,879
I don't know I don't I'm not real

1372
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:18,989
up-to-date on all the people in those

1373
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,059
like you know

1374
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:24,029
yeah I'm pretty is the golden ticket

1375
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:27,389
thinner I think that's what they called

1376
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:30,150
it the golden ticket yes within the past

1377
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:32,009
I have the seed stock that I used when I

1378
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,930
worked with it and I'm gonna try to get

1379
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:36,240
it back again and do some more work with

1380
01:02:33,929 --> 01:02:39,089
it so I can stabilize something I like

1381
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,579
and get it out to the public because I

1382
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:45,090
like that one a lot

1383
01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:47,250
yeah for sure so you know just having

1384
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:50,539
mentioned the Cindy 99 before being

1385
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:52,858
friends with Duke that made me realize

1386
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:54,719
who's a breeder you would like to do a

1387
01:02:52,858 --> 01:02:56,699
collaboration with them and do something

1388
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,759
with them as opposed to just you know

1389
01:02:56,699 --> 01:03:03,629
buy a packet and go from there right

1390
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:05,790
well I mean I have I guess you'd call

1391
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:10,608
them heroes that so many heroes in the

1392
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:12,900
industry I there's a good handful or two

1393
01:03:10,608 --> 01:03:16,019
breeders out there that would love to

1394
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:25,349
work with just it would it would make my

1395
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:33,739
day you know I bet really man feel free

1396
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:37,170
to lease some off if you wanted to well

1397
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:44,519
there's Brothers Grimm would be a cool

1398
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:46,108
one there's what is it called I for a

1399
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:51,480
while I wanted to do something with

1400
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:53,039
Moxie yep yeah they're not old old

1401
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,940
heroes of mine or anything you know

1402
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:58,259
they're know like that but I had respect

1403
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,369
for what they were doing for some of

1404
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,619
their concentrates that are coming up

1405
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:04,650
I'm always involved in the concentrate

1406
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:05,789
field so I got a hold to Center

1407
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,019
concentrates and then you know I had

1408
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:09,420
kind of thought like me and I'd like to

1409
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:10,730
work with yes so sorry I'm just gonna

1410
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,389
say for a lot of people who don't know

1411
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:14,760
there'll be some people to know that

1412
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:16,829
Moxie is are a seed seller and they do

1413
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:20,130
pretty good seeds but they also

1414
01:04:16,829 --> 01:04:20,819
primarily do a lot of concentrates over

1415
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:23,769
in the States

1416
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:27,970
from what I've heard it's some of the

1417
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:31,150
it is yeah it's very good and so I would

1418
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:35,230
really like to work with them like old

1419
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:42,250
old school like some shanty baba action

1420
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:43,929
I would like you know some of the I

1421
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,429
don't want to name out some of the

1422
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:47,500
larger companies I'd like to work with

1423
01:04:45,429 --> 01:04:50,469
because it would probably never happen

1424
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,849
and I'd look dumb but like it would be

1425
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,949
worth it would be cool to work with rare

1426
01:04:51,849 --> 01:04:55,599
daintiness I'm like it seems like when

1427
01:04:53,949 --> 01:04:57,429
I'm at the cups I'm always like near

1428
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,579
home at the booths and we never talk

1429
01:04:57,429 --> 01:05:02,519
really or anything but I don't know you

1430
01:05:00,579 --> 01:05:05,380
know a lot of a lot of the people here

1431
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:10,269
it seems like or had their real clipped

1432
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:12,400
up and it's hard to get into the clicks

1433
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:14,079
like you're not cool with certain crews

1434
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,760
or something they don't you show you any

1435
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,199
attention and I don't go out there

1436
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,750
putting myself out there to get any

1437
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:21,369
attention anyway so it's kind of hard

1438
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:25,269
like I don't really talk to that many

1439
01:05:21,369 --> 01:05:27,549
readers around I'm pretty pretty I'm

1440
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:32,289
pretty much a hermit I just stay to

1441
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:34,720
myself and breed yeah but yeah there's I

1442
01:05:32,289 --> 01:05:38,409
would be in heavy respect to work with a

1443
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:40,329
lot of people I just leave it there like

1444
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:43,539
I get my list would go on because I love

1445
01:05:40,329 --> 01:05:45,849
a lot of readers yeah well I mean just

1446
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:48,849
in terms of that clique eNOS I mean even

1447
01:05:45,849 --> 01:05:50,500
from overseas I can kind of observe that

1448
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:52,420
quite clearly I was talking to a friend

1449
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,880
the other day and he lives in LA and he

1450
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:56,769
said he couldn't get a certain cut that

1451
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,480
I comment which one it was but I thought

1452
01:05:56,769 --> 01:06:00,849
it was it would be pretty easy to get it

1453
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,949
living in LA I need echoed the same

1454
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:04,539
sentiments you know like our nights it's

1455
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:06,460
still very cliquey as to you know you

1456
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:09,550
can get what and who helped you out I

1457
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:12,579
thought that was a bit so yes it is

1458
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:14,080
because I'm not that way I I want to

1459
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:16,000
work with people that are like-minded to

1460
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,039
me there's other companies out there

1461
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,090
that have things that I would like to

1462
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:24,940
breed to that you know I just don't

1463
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:26,200
because I don't know some of the some of

1464
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,090
the companies are a little too big

1465
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:29,649
they've already got their own style

1466
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:33,400
don't need to bring any more attention

1467
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:36,490
to them you know yeah buy something of

1468
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:39,250
theirs so

1469
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:41,679
what's one strain that even you yourself

1470
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:44,230
or just you know his society the

1471
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:47,368
community in general has lost that you

1472
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:50,309
really wish you had back and then why

1473
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:54,519
that's the easy one skunk

1474
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:57,130
good good skunk is hard to find I mean

1475
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:59,530
that was like the original and now it's

1476
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:02,099
lost like that it seems outrageous in my

1477
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:06,880
mind I mean it's not i'm elite lee lost

1478
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:09,670
but as far as the main string goes like

1479
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:13,269
he you know scones just not really that

1480
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:15,250
heard of yeah it it needs to be there

1481
01:07:13,269 --> 01:07:16,900
more Hayes's as well like Hayes's need

1482
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:20,769
to make a comeback skunks need to make a

1483
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:22,930
comeback that's yeah and so did you ever

1484
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:29,469
get a chance to grow the roadkill skunk

1485
01:07:22,929 --> 01:07:33,069
I know no unfortunately no I did it big

1486
01:07:29,469 --> 01:07:34,598
dream of mine but never happened yeah

1487
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:36,369
he's interested in asking people about

1488
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:37,690
that one it's it's got you know one of

1489
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:38,920
those ones where everyone's interested

1490
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:42,099
in it but there's so little information

1491
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,170
about it well there's there's a little

1492
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:47,530
old lady that lives down the road from

1493
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:49,000
me and uh I got when I go for walks I

1494
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:52,900
see her sitting out on her porch every

1495
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:55,088
morning and she keeps she keeps the hope

1496
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,710
alive for me because she he's got a

1497
01:07:55,088 --> 01:07:59,380
pretty large greenhouse in her backyard

1498
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:03,190
and it reeks of skunk and some high

1499
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:05,800
quality skunk so it's still out there

1500
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:08,470
very slick I mean she's a little little

1501
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:10,240
old frail gray-haired lady and uh she's

1502
01:08:08,469 --> 01:08:19,719
she's keeping the skunk alive over there

1503
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:21,250
at least I mean you can walk a few

1504
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:23,140
blocks on the right day and you'll see

1505
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:26,259
four or five people sitting outside in

1506
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:29,619
the front yard token a bowl it's pretty

1507
01:08:26,259 --> 01:08:31,779
funny yeah it's it's not supposed to be

1508
01:08:29,619 --> 01:08:35,500
that out in the open but it is if you

1509
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:37,420
look if you keep an eye out yeah and so

1510
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:41,079
you mentioned earlier you're gonna pack

1511
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:43,359
up your packaging and have things like a

1512
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:45,838
lab percentages on them and stuff this

1513
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,430
kind of brings me to two questions one

1514
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:50,380
how do you feel about lab percentages

1515
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:52,088
you know like do you feel like

1516
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:55,359
a lot of people I've spoken to said that

1517
01:08:52,088 --> 01:08:57,670
the the industry is very driven by

1518
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,710
percentages and so it's easy for you

1519
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:02,230
know them to be inflated just for

1520
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:04,509
purposes of wholesale and selling them

1521
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:07,959
whatnot so you know one how do you feel

1522
01:09:04,509 --> 01:09:12,520
about that I feel like the industry

1523
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:13,899
concentrates on it too much I can sit

1524
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,420
down with anyone that talks about

1525
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:18,608
percentages and without some thing that

1526
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:22,060
tastes good smells good smokes good and

1527
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:24,850
makes them just as happy as any high 20s

1528
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:26,770
you know that you can pull out yeah I

1529
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:28,838
was gonna say when someone says they've

1530
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:32,469
got some 30% weight you what do you

1531
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:38,380
think I don't know how I feel about that

1532
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:40,420
that's why I said hi 20 yeah I would

1533
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:43,270
like to see paperwork and I would like

1534
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:44,739
to do research afterwards to see what

1535
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:49,089
that laboratory how their testing

1536
01:09:44,738 --> 01:09:52,209
methods are and stuff yeah cool and so I

1537
01:09:49,088 --> 01:09:55,119
guess when we expect to see your future

1538
01:09:52,210 --> 01:10:02,139
packaging we're not gonna see mid 30s on

1539
01:09:55,119 --> 01:10:03,939
it or anything like that 30s I'm gonna

1540
01:10:02,139 --> 01:10:08,440
have to send some more in to get tested

1541
01:10:03,939 --> 01:10:11,919
again no yeah I don't I don't see that

1542
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:15,309
happening on anybody's near future but

1543
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,710
the you know I'm gonna post realistic

1544
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:22,150
numbers I'm gonna post an average number

1545
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:25,510
I can't post 20 3.87 you know on the

1546
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:26,888
packaging but I'll post a realistic

1547
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:29,530
number I'll do multiple and I'll

1548
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:32,409
probably Instagram a picture all the

1549
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:34,960
test sheets just you know for the public

1550
01:10:32,408 --> 01:10:38,079
cuz that's unfortunately the industry is

1551
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,609
concentrated on numbers but so I'm gonna

1552
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,850
give them those numbers but I'm not

1553
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:45,779
going to strive to try to shoot for only

1554
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:50,920
the highest of high numbers I'm gonna be

1555
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:53,469
testing as well and so you know that's

1556
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:57,520
that's my big my big focus is flavor

1557
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:59,590
yeah for sure so the follow-up to that

1558
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,870
was I don't know if you've seen it but

1559
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:04,060
there's a few breeders now who have kind

1560
01:11:01,869 --> 01:11:05,769
of this template for their new strain

1561
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,000
it's got a lot of really good info on it

1562
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:09,160
you know it gives like the number of

1563
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,590
phenotypes what you can maybe expect

1564
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:13,479
from each phenotype as well as your

1565
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:15,159
general flowering times and how much

1566
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:17,589
it'll stretch would you ever consider

1567
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:20,619
giving information like this I mean I

1568
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:22,270
would assume that based on the work you

1569
01:11:20,619 --> 01:11:24,340
do you know like growing out the strains

1570
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:26,020
to test it you would have a rough idea

1571
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,880
of say the number of phenotypes there

1572
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:29,830
are in each cross and what to expect

1573
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,690
from each do you think that that

1574
01:11:29,829 --> 01:11:33,039
information is overkill or you'd maybe

1575
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:37,029
be interested in including that in the

1576
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:38,979
future I think in the past I think that

1577
01:11:37,029 --> 01:11:40,689
was overkill a lot of people just wanted

1578
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:42,849
quality seeds and wanted to grow it out

1579
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:45,669
they needed a rough number of when they

1580
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:47,710
might need to harvest it because in the

1581
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:52,210
past people did take a lot of pride on

1582
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:54,880
you know a check and try trichomes or

1583
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:56,980
tight let me head trichomes yeah sorry

1584
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:02,440
I'm itching a mosquito bite from

1585
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:05,529
yesterday anyways people used to check

1586
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:07,179
the color of their trichomes and take a

1587
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:09,130
lot of pride in when they harvested

1588
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,289
knowing that you know it was to the day

1589
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:13,569
when they wanted it and stuff nowadays

1590
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:15,670
people like to see a number on the

1591
01:12:13,569 --> 01:12:16,960
package and if it says nine weeks

1592
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,520
they've been checking it on their

1593
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,970
calendar and they're gonna harvest it at

1594
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:23,590
nine weeks so I think that the new

1595
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:25,930
information for the new growers and

1596
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:27,640
stuff because there's so many that don't

1597
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:31,329
have years of experience and stuff that

1598
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:33,100
are growing legally and illegally no and

1599
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:36,100
so they need a little bit of more

1600
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:37,450
reference now I think so I think in the

1601
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,370
future you'll probably see more of that

1602
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:43,960
from me yeah

1603
01:12:39,369 --> 01:12:48,430
so maybe the dreaded topic for you not

1604
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:50,079
for some feminized seeds what what's

1605
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:52,630
your thoughts and will we ever see any

1606
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:54,939
from Johnston genetics because I'm sure

1607
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:57,190
you've got some killer females that you

1608
01:12:54,939 --> 01:12:58,989
know like people would say that if you

1609
01:12:57,189 --> 01:13:02,169
put them you made some s ones you know

1610
01:12:58,989 --> 01:13:05,319
that'd be pretty cool oh yeah they

1611
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:09,880
there's uh yeah there's definitely been

1612
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:12,489
a lot of talk of it but if you were to

1613
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:14,650
see a feminized [ __ ] for me it probably

1614
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:16,059
wouldn't be coming directly from me it

1615
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:19,059
would probably come from another

1616
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:22,720
breeder that does feminized seeds that I

1617
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:25,180
would do a collaboration with it's not

1618
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,880
something that I do and I like doing

1619
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:31,619
things I feel comfortable with then

1620
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:35,470
feminizing isn't something I do so I

1621
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:39,670
used to say you know it's polluting the

1622
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:42,039
genetics genetic pool now I like I

1623
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:45,960
understand that it has a place in the

1624
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:49,090
industry and not everyone can you know

1625
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,859
weed out the mills and not everyone has

1626
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:52,600
the skill and stuff some people just

1627
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:58,089
want the reliability of plant a seed and

1628
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:59,380
having bud to smoke so I would be okay

1629
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:00,369
with doing the collaboration breeder

1630
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:04,210
with someone that knew what they were

1631
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:07,029
doing there but and it just like autos

1632
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:10,480
like I might work with a couple auto

1633
01:14:07,029 --> 01:14:13,449
companies where it's actually being in

1634
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:14,709
the discussion so I may do some work

1635
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:17,920
with the couple auto companies this year

1636
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:23,260
to do it John says genetics collab on

1637
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:27,220
auto yeah awesome you know against it

1638
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:29,500
yeah no I'm not against it and I'm just

1639
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:31,630
you from your experience do you know if

1640
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:33,640
those orders you were thinking about

1641
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:35,890
doing that's something we've we often

1642
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:39,190
hear spoken about as like you know the

1643
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:41,470
European market is very after autos do

1644
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:43,719
you find that there's much demand in

1645
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:46,050
other parts or it really is just in

1646
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,050
Europe

1647
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:52,899
Europe's obviously the big breadwinner

1648
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:57,730
for the auto market I think you know

1649
01:14:52,899 --> 01:14:59,819
just in America how size yard size and

1650
01:14:57,729 --> 01:15:02,979
everything is just on average its larger

1651
01:14:59,819 --> 01:15:04,569
so people have more space and feel more

1652
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:07,469
comfortable well with you know even just

1653
01:15:04,569 --> 01:15:10,840
growing a shorter indica or something

1654
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:12,300
that's that team tends to be a bill be

1655
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:17,079
the real winner around here

1656
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:21,279
yeah there's yeah but in in Europe I do

1657
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:25,029
see that that's my biggest request area

1658
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:28,059
for autos and you know you may see it

1659
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:29,380
come from me as a collaboration breeding

1660
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:33,220
with another company here in the

1661
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:34,569
next year so awesome you mentioned

1662
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:37,780
earlier that you're a big fan of the

1663
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:41,619
concentrates how do you feel about kind

1664
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:43,539
of this rise in the former old

1665
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:45,880
traditions of people like Frenchy

1666
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:48,399
cannoli and just kind of this artisan

1667
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:51,069
hash market how do you feel about that

1668
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,929
and how it compares to say our more

1669
01:15:51,069 --> 01:15:56,109
modern concentrates like you know you

1670
01:15:52,930 --> 01:16:00,400
Rosen and your live resin and all these

1671
01:15:56,109 --> 01:16:02,979
things I hope that we never lose the old

1672
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:05,109
traditions it's in fact something I'm

1673
01:16:02,979 --> 01:16:07,629
going to be working on personally I

1674
01:16:05,109 --> 01:16:11,500
don't want to see the art of good

1675
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:13,510
quality hash go away because there's

1676
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,600
none oh like the new market is obviously

1677
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:18,039
about all these modern concentrates

1678
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,500
that'll just keep growing there's always

1679
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:23,829
going to be a ton of people wanting to

1680
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,029
work with that but I think that if you

1681
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:28,059
know enough people and the right people

1682
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:30,250
get into bringing more attention to what

1683
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:33,100
the old-school real high-quality hash

1684
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:35,649
was I think more people will catch on to

1685
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:39,060
it again in the future it's definitely

1686
01:16:35,649 --> 01:16:41,589
something I love to smoke yeah nice and

1687
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:43,900
so at the end of the day what would be

1688
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:47,550
your favorite form of concentrate like

1689
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:55,359
you know live resin harsh dry Civ

1690
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:58,690
Wow Wow the favorite that's a real tough

1691
01:16:55,359 --> 01:17:01,389
one because you know real good quality

1692
01:16:58,689 --> 01:17:04,629
live resident or distillate that's made

1693
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:07,110
now some of that can just be amazing the

1694
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:12,640
flavor and the high associated with that

1695
01:17:07,109 --> 01:17:17,259
just amazing but it sits right there

1696
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:21,190
with smoking it and old like you know a

1697
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:23,619
temple ball or something you know they

1698
01:17:21,189 --> 01:17:28,389
both are very high on my my scale of

1699
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:32,859
respect for the smoke but it's hard to

1700
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:35,680
beat a good distillate that's it's an

1701
01:17:32,859 --> 01:17:41,019
amazing hit for those that haven't hit

1702
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:43,059
it it tastes outrageous and it is very

1703
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:46,900
high potency

1704
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:49,150
you know sometimes over 95% in some

1705
01:17:46,899 --> 01:17:52,420
cases Wow

1706
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:54,368
so it can be high and that's other

1707
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:56,230
people's nervous I have not ever

1708
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:59,319
personally tested any form of distillate

1709
01:17:56,229 --> 01:18:01,359
but just from seeing what other people

1710
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:04,299
say you know yep

1711
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:06,939
and so if we were to take a look at your

1712
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:08,020
garden right now what type of lights do

1713
01:18:06,939 --> 01:18:10,448
we have in there I'm always interested

1714
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:12,610
to know have you made the conversion to

1715
01:18:10,448 --> 01:18:14,979
you know like you double-ended bulbs you

1716
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:17,979
know like the I hate saying it but you

1717
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:19,988
know you can meters or you know do you

1718
01:18:17,979 --> 01:18:22,538
still more of an old-school guy you got

1719
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:29,109
your hid lights or what type of

1720
01:18:22,538 --> 01:18:31,269
technology do you use LEC yeah

1721
01:18:29,109 --> 01:18:35,259
light-emitting ceramic or some people

1722
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:37,809
call it like CMH ceramic metal halide

1723
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:41,230
and I think there's even another acronym

1724
01:18:37,809 --> 01:18:44,199
out there for it but yeah the 315 what

1725
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:45,879
Philips bulbs they're amazing I love

1726
01:18:44,198 --> 01:18:48,428
them

1727
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:53,828
soon soon to probably be running double

1728
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:55,420
bulb fixtures yep and so you know you

1729
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:58,299
may or may not have an answer to this

1730
01:18:55,420 --> 01:19:00,489
but have you heard anything at all you

1731
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,500
know maybe whispers or rumors what do

1732
01:19:00,488 --> 01:19:03,848
you think is the next step of growing

1733
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:06,550
you know have you heard of any maybe

1734
01:19:03,849 --> 01:19:08,469
major innovations that are maybe coming

1735
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:09,849
through the pipeline and we might see

1736
01:19:08,469 --> 01:19:12,368
them in the near future you know like

1737
01:19:09,849 --> 01:19:13,569
maybe for example you know a few years

1738
01:19:12,368 --> 01:19:15,009
ago someone would have said oh you know

1739
01:19:13,569 --> 01:19:17,488
there's this new lighting technology

1740
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:22,690
coming out soon these double-ended bulbs

1741
01:19:17,488 --> 01:19:24,399
well I think the things that are gonna

1742
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:28,569
blow up are things that are already out

1743
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:32,078
I think that in the future the plasma

1744
01:19:28,569 --> 01:19:34,779
market will get bigger I think it will

1745
01:19:32,078 --> 01:19:37,210
grow it's it kind of look for a second

1746
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:42,219
and then it kind of went away not that

1747
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:44,380
many people are running plasma but LED I

1748
01:19:42,219 --> 01:19:45,880
think is the big that's what a lot of

1749
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:49,210
companies are spending the money and to

1750
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:51,510
do the research on and even companies

1751
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:54,250
that aren't making grow lights right now

1752
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:56,429
they are doing you know just led

1753
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:59,578
research there

1754
01:19:56,429 --> 01:20:01,679
they're making some big steps I was

1755
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:04,349
working with a company for a while and I

1756
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,819
may in the future but we were working on

1757
01:20:04,349 --> 01:20:08,130
developing new spectrums they were

1758
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:09,779
asking me you know kind of what what I

1759
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:13,349
would like to see and so we were working

1760
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:17,688
on stuff like that but yeah there's a

1761
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:21,840
lot of growth in the LED market yeah

1762
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:23,939
yeah but I would like more attention go

1763
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,578
into the LEC market I would like to see

1764
01:20:23,939 --> 01:20:28,499
higher power Ellie sees there is a

1765
01:20:26,578 --> 01:20:32,340
company out there that has a 400 watt

1766
01:20:28,498 --> 01:20:35,969
LEC you can find them one on the

1767
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:41,069
internet' I'm sure but it's in that that

1768
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:43,260
bulb is actually made by GE okay so yeah

1769
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,399
but it's a it's also the same technology

1770
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,439
I'd like to see more into that

1771
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:49,589
technology if people could be running

1772
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:52,079
thousand watt Ellie season in a small

1773
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:56,130
grow room or ten or something they would

1774
01:20:52,078 --> 01:21:01,308
have amazing spectrum and amazing light

1775
01:20:56,130 --> 01:21:04,590
output yeah yeah it would be insane and

1776
01:21:01,309 --> 01:21:06,630
so on to kind of a bit of a more

1777
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:11,400
political based question what do you

1778
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:13,498
think was one or some of the the

1779
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:15,808
pitfalls of the American legalization

1780
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:20,969
model like what would you have improve

1781
01:21:15,809 --> 01:21:22,708
if you could have what about like

1782
01:21:20,969 --> 01:21:24,748
they're standing laws that we have in in

1783
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:29,849
office right now and what would our land

1784
01:21:24,748 --> 01:21:33,599
change yeah I think they did very good

1785
01:21:29,849 --> 01:21:37,010
for coming up with a complete new law

1786
01:21:33,599 --> 01:21:41,819
system or something that's just been

1787
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:45,989
ignored there are some small loopholes

1788
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:48,868
that need to be covered like there's a

1789
01:21:45,988 --> 01:21:52,618
lot of growers here in in Colorado they

1790
01:21:48,868 --> 01:21:54,569
grow over what they need you know for

1791
01:21:52,618 --> 01:21:56,279
their they harvest and they trim down

1792
01:21:54,569 --> 01:21:58,319
and they weigh it and they say whoa I

1793
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:00,149
have enough to last me for a year and a

1794
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:01,349
half you know and they don't need all

1795
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:02,399
that product because they're gonna be

1796
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:05,429
growing again next year

1797
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:09,149
the Colorado doesn't have a system in in

1798
01:22:05,429 --> 01:22:12,719
order for them to take in

1799
01:22:09,149 --> 01:22:15,119
a product to be tested and once it's

1800
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,980
been tested maybe going for approval to

1801
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:19,219
be sold back to a dispensary so it can

1802
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:20,428
go back out to the you know the patients

1803
01:22:19,219 --> 01:22:22,710
yeah

1804
01:22:20,429 --> 01:22:25,649
little little things like that kind of

1805
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:27,448
need to change sorry so are you saying

1806
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,920
that at the moment in that situation

1807
01:22:27,448 --> 01:22:30,359
they would just be sitting on a surplus

1808
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:34,199
and not really have anything to do with

1809
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:36,299
it all they can do with this smoke yeah

1810
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:38,009
okay yeah and I mean I guess you're the

1811
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,719
implication is it's kind of pushing them

1812
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:41,159
maybe towards the black market of

1813
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:43,679
selling it under the table because

1814
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:46,259
they're just sitting on it definitely

1815
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:48,630
yes I mean kind of like they say idle

1816
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:50,190
hands you know you know when you have

1817
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,650
something it's just sitting there and

1818
01:22:50,189 --> 01:22:55,500
you see it and in temptations around

1819
01:22:52,649 --> 01:22:58,139
there are gonna be you know percentages

1820
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:01,920
of people that will you know take that

1821
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:04,320
route I you know I recommend everyone

1822
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,890
here and at least in in Colorado where

1823
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:09,809
everything's legal you know abide by the

1824
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:13,350
laws we were gifted and we're you know

1825
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:15,480
this this luxury of having all this

1826
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:17,699
weight lifted off our shoulders and it's

1827
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:21,928
not hard here to abide by the law I mean

1828
01:23:17,698 --> 01:23:23,698
the law is extremely relaxed I guess you

1829
01:23:21,929 --> 01:23:25,739
could say there's people with crazy

1830
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:27,928
plant count numbers that can grow you

1831
01:23:25,738 --> 01:23:31,259
know crazy numbers at home which they

1832
01:23:27,929 --> 01:23:32,850
shouldn't be you know you can have a

1833
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:35,510
doctor right ship where you're allowed

1834
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:39,000
to buy a pound a day

1835
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:40,440
you're allowed yeah so in that that's

1836
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,810
getting rarer cuz they're cracking down

1837
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:45,299
on stuff like that but your average you

1838
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:48,870
know you when you sign up I think you're

1839
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:53,810
allowed to buy two ounces any day every

1840
01:23:48,869 --> 01:23:57,649
day so you know for a medical card for

1841
01:23:53,810 --> 01:24:02,699
recreational I think it's an ounce a day

1842
01:23:57,649 --> 01:24:04,619
yeah a minute yeah so you know that's a

1843
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:07,919
pretty relaxed law I mean even if you

1844
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:09,869
were a real heavy partier because

1845
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,310
smoking good Colorado buds it's hard to

1846
01:24:09,869 --> 01:24:13,710
smoke an ounce a day with your friends

1847
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:18,960
you can do it but you can always go back

1848
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:20,369
tomorrow and buy another one so just

1849
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,960
getting to the last part of the

1850
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:22,649
interview now we're just gonna do some

1851
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,469
kind of

1852
01:24:22,649 --> 01:24:27,389
light-hearted questions this is one I

1853
01:24:25,469 --> 01:24:28,980
always love to ask everyone if you could

1854
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:31,440
go back to one place you know

1855
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:33,419
geographically at one point in time to

1856
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:34,789
get some land raise seeds where would it

1857
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:41,279
be and why

1858
01:24:34,789 --> 01:24:44,069
Wow it would have probably been a couple

1859
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:45,899
thousand years ago Asia I would have

1860
01:24:44,069 --> 01:24:50,509
liked to add some of the early early

1861
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:53,599
stuff that would I'm still after some

1862
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:59,130
actual true Asian land race seeds

1863
01:24:53,600 --> 01:25:02,280
anybody out there that's listening so

1864
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:04,020
yeah I I'm really after that so I would

1865
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:05,729
really like I could just take even a

1866
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,500
time period of seeds that would be you

1867
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:11,849
know a couple thousand years ago old

1868
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:14,609
school yeah never thought of that

1869
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:18,300
better be almost scary to think of what

1870
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:23,729
it would be like right take something

1871
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:25,500
with a base foundation you know genetic

1872
01:25:23,729 --> 01:25:28,759
structure of old school back then and

1873
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,840
hybridize it with something from now I

1874
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,190
was gonna say you're gonna work it out

1875
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,350
in a different direction for the next

1876
01:25:32,189 --> 01:25:36,569
thousand years

1877
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:40,199
yeah that would be interesting to see a

1878
01:25:36,569 --> 01:25:43,319
whole new evolution of the point so what

1879
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:45,809
do you think is the worst thing to

1880
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:51,689
happen to the kind of a scene in America

1881
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:53,940
well as far as politically yeah well

1882
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:56,809
maybe even just in general you know

1883
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:59,219
maybe maybe you know people are more

1884
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:01,739
more in it for the money now you know

1885
01:25:59,219 --> 01:26:03,899
that could be a movie one thing yeah

1886
01:26:01,738 --> 01:26:09,209
that's that's one of the things I don't

1887
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:14,519
like seeing now it is going to be a big

1888
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:15,899
money industry but there's everybody

1889
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,360
doesn't have to be focused on that right

1890
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:20,519
now you know the money will come put in

1891
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:22,109
the work and do do what's right for the

1892
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,640
seed do what's right for the plant and

1893
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:27,269
for the grower and for the people

1894
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:30,539
everything else will come you know like

1895
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:32,580
I the the greed that's associated with

1896
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:34,350
it and and the click enos that we talked

1897
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:35,500
about earlier all that needs to go away

1898
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:37,420
that's not stuffed

1899
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:39,579
associated with people that smoke weed

1900
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:42,399
that grow weed that's like new

1901
01:26:39,579 --> 01:26:47,199
modern-day weeds culture now that thing

1902
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:52,469
that needs to go yeah yeah and so what

1903
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:52,470
is the worst strain in your opinion

1904
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:03,430
that's crazy

1905
01:26:56,529 --> 01:27:06,550
well worst is a funny word like the

1906
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:08,409
worst for me like there's like a strain

1907
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:11,110
or two out there that when people bring

1908
01:27:08,409 --> 01:27:13,960
it around I won't smoke it so if you

1909
01:27:11,109 --> 01:27:16,210
want to call first and it's only it's

1910
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,909
funny for me because it's great white

1911
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:22,090
shark

1912
01:27:17,909 --> 01:27:24,909
it gives me an absolute like panic

1913
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:29,470
attack every time I smoke I get the

1914
01:27:24,909 --> 01:27:31,269
jitters and I am so anxiety filled and

1915
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:34,990
everyone else around me is just like wow

1916
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:36,880
this is great smoke so I pass on that

1917
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:39,159
one this so I call it the worst because

1918
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:42,579
it just hammers me I don't know why

1919
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:44,800
there's something about it I get high

1920
01:27:42,579 --> 01:27:48,850
anxiety so so it's not because it's bad

1921
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:52,480
at all but for me it's the worst yeah

1922
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:58,180
and conversely what's what's the best or

1923
01:27:52,479 --> 01:28:01,169
your favorite strained Wow there's I

1924
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:09,340
have probably a top-10 of strains but

1925
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:19,409
I'm three Wow okay that would probably

1926
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:19,409
be kosher kosher Kush chocolate and

1927
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:28,590
that's hard it is I feel like I'm going

1928
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:28,590
in order now I'm trying to I think I

1929
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:34,989
enjoy a good old-school haze like

1930
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:37,929
they're getting pretty hard to find so

1931
01:28:34,989 --> 01:28:40,739
like the old Hayes's that no one cares

1932
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:43,420
to take the time to crow anymore

1933
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:47,039
that would just in general that would be

1934
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:51,000
what talking also yeah no yes

1935
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:52,739
what is your kind of growing tip for

1936
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,479
everyone what's something where you know

1937
01:28:52,739 --> 01:28:56,579
like most of the time when people

1938
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:59,219
contact you and they've got a problem

1939
01:28:56,579 --> 01:29:00,479
you know it's this or just in general

1940
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:02,610
you know like what's something where

1941
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:06,529
people normally just maybe could improve

1942
01:29:02,609 --> 01:29:08,670
in some way in terms of growing well

1943
01:29:06,529 --> 01:29:12,239
there'll be like a kind of a three-part

1944
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:14,010
answer to the I guess one would be just

1945
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:16,289
really be in touch with your plants

1946
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:19,020
spend a lot of time with them watch them

1947
01:29:16,289 --> 01:29:21,060
you know watch them grow especially if

1948
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,440
you're new at this that they should be

1949
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:24,510
your babies you know that you should

1950
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:27,539
probably watching them like probably too

1951
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:30,690
often you know when you start growing

1952
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:33,180
out you're going to see every every ten

1953
01:29:30,689 --> 01:29:35,669
minutes you want to look at them so I

1954
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:38,490
just say spend a lot of time with them

1955
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:41,369
number two talk to other growers

1956
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:44,760
nowadays with with the internet there's

1957
01:29:41,369 --> 01:29:46,680
a lot of information to be had even

1958
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,110
without asking a question you can type

1959
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:51,630
in something on Google or in any kind of

1960
01:29:49,109 --> 01:29:53,460
these platforms and your questions

1961
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:56,970
already been answered somewhere along

1962
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:58,890
the line but there are people to talk to

1963
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:01,260
so that's like them that's the biggest

1964
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:03,539
thing you could do to help yourself is

1965
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,430
you know go to other growers when you

1966
01:30:03,539 --> 01:30:06,989
have an issue don't just try to take it

1967
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:10,440
upon yourself and assume you know what

1968
01:30:06,989 --> 01:30:15,569
you're gonna do to fix an issue and in

1969
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:18,929
like three you know bug mitigation you

1970
01:30:15,569 --> 01:30:22,019
don't want bugs of any kind but unless

1971
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:24,470
you use good bugs harder bugs and you

1972
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:27,450
know things like that

1973
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:31,199
so keep an eye out for bugs and if you

1974
01:30:27,449 --> 01:30:34,019
have to use something to control them

1975
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:35,849
there are organic options out there that

1976
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:38,340
do a pretty good job so look into those

1977
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:40,590
like because you will be smoking this

1978
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:44,329
product or eating or ingesting it in

1979
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:48,180
some fashion in the future I see yep and

1980
01:30:44,329 --> 01:30:52,319
so what is your random product

1981
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:54,780
endorsement I I would say like for an

1982
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:59,179
ingredient like a little tip looking

1983
01:30:54,779 --> 01:31:02,039
into like insect frass it's you know

1984
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:05,840
insect

1985
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:05,840
I believe that's what it is

1986
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:13,860
I'm pretty sure it is but it's look into

1987
01:31:10,529 --> 01:31:15,869
that it's it's got quite a few health

1988
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:19,229
benefits to your plant it's a natural

1989
01:31:15,869 --> 01:31:21,289
thing that can help the plant in

1990
01:31:19,229 --> 01:31:24,899
multiple ways if you if you look it up

1991
01:31:21,289 --> 01:31:27,000
insect brass fr a SS for those that

1992
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:28,710
don't know yeah they're like something

1993
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,010
you mix into your soil or like a top

1994
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:34,980
dressing thing or you can actually do

1995
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:36,770
both but yes it's it's something you

1996
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:41,189
would add into the soil

1997
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:44,160
yeah and that it gets it has some kind

1998
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:48,089
of low numbers of nutrient but it's

1999
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:50,729
stable and it actually has I I think

2000
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:52,800
they could call it tighten its chemical

2001
01:31:50,729 --> 01:31:55,589
that's in there that helps the plant in

2002
01:31:52,800 --> 01:32:01,980
a couple ways of kind of like its immune

2003
01:31:55,590 --> 01:32:05,850
system I think yeah else what yeah right

2004
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:07,649
yeah yeah it's uh it's good stuff and

2005
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:09,800
that would be like a simple thing I

2006
01:32:07,649 --> 01:32:13,859
would say to like look into for people

2007
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:14,960
like a little I guess additive tip yeah

2008
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:17,579
awesome

2009
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:19,140
so the Emerald cup this year's looking

2010
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:21,300
like it's gonna be a really cool event

2011
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:23,010
is there any chance people will be able

2012
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:27,060
to catch you there and may have anything

2013
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:30,930
maybe four so they will be able to catch

2014
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:32,850
me I won't have anything for so we'll

2015
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:36,930
probably be running around checking the

2016
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:39,000
place out in the crowd and then you know

2017
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:41,039
a couple times throughout the event

2018
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,890
you'll be able to probably catch me at a

2019
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:47,359
Drazen Thals booth we'll be hanging out

2020
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:49,410
there so yeah I'll definitely be there

2021
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:54,299
that's really cool so what are you

2022
01:32:49,409 --> 01:32:57,059
actually with Ed resent oh yes it's

2023
01:32:54,300 --> 01:33:00,600
actually pretty cool he contacted me

2024
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:04,100
here a while back asking if I wanted to

2025
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:08,550
come up be in his upcoming book which

2026
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:14,090
blew my mind is definitely one of my

2027
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:16,010
heroes for many many many years

2028
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:18,409
so when he contacted me I was just

2029
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:20,810
ecstatic and honored to be able to have

2030
01:33:18,408 --> 01:33:24,439
that opportunity and we did some work

2031
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:27,320
he'll be featuring the grandma sugar

2032
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:30,979
cookies and the granddaddy platinum part

2033
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:32,539
berry cookies he'll be showcasing both

2034
01:33:30,979 --> 01:33:37,098
those strains and talking a little bit

2035
01:33:32,539 --> 01:33:41,750
about us as a company but we though

2036
01:33:37,099 --> 01:33:44,090
originally there was going to be one

2037
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:45,920
book and it was going to be the greatest

2038
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:48,159
hits and I believe it was gonna be

2039
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,690
called greatest hits and rising stars

2040
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:56,029
edition of the big book of blood series

2041
01:33:50,689 --> 01:34:00,379
and that that book got too big he had he

2042
01:33:56,029 --> 01:34:04,340
had too much too many pictures and so it

2043
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:07,039
got split into two books so right now

2044
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:10,520
the big book of buds Greatest Hits is

2045
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:12,170
coming out and here shortly there will

2046
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:16,099
be another book coming out and I'm not

2047
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:18,158
sure of the the title we'll have an idea

2048
01:34:16,099 --> 01:34:21,710
of the title but I can't release that

2049
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:24,979
but that will be coming down soon I'll

2050
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:26,569
be in that one fantastic that's um

2051
01:34:24,979 --> 01:34:27,948
that's some awesome news to hear

2052
01:34:26,569 --> 01:34:29,479
especially you know on a personal note

2053
01:34:27,948 --> 01:34:31,549
it must be great to be getting some

2054
01:34:29,479 --> 01:34:36,408
recognition from someone you know you

2055
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:40,699
look up to why literally there's no

2056
01:34:36,408 --> 01:34:43,658
words that can expel when at that moment

2057
01:34:40,698 --> 01:34:47,509
when you contacted me and then actually

2058
01:34:43,658 --> 01:34:50,868
last year having a booth in the Michigan

2059
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:53,719
cannabis cup he popped by the booth and

2060
01:34:50,868 --> 01:34:55,359
I was sitting there you know talking

2061
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:58,219
with customers we were pretty busy and

2062
01:34:55,359 --> 01:35:02,089
he walked up and I looked up and I seen

2063
01:34:58,219 --> 01:35:04,969
him and I am never starstruck I've met

2064
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:07,190
multiple celebrities and hang out you

2065
01:35:04,969 --> 01:35:10,989
know they're just people just like you

2066
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:14,809
and me but when I saw and I was

2067
01:35:10,988 --> 01:35:17,000
starstruck I didn't know what to say I

2068
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:20,659
basically could just answer his

2069
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:23,238
questions with short answers he asked us

2070
01:35:20,658 --> 01:35:26,149
to get together for a picture we took a

2071
01:35:23,238 --> 01:35:26,899
picture with the group and we talked a

2072
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:29,239
little bit and then

2073
01:35:26,899 --> 01:35:31,789
headed out and after he left I turned

2074
01:35:29,239 --> 01:35:34,729
the rest of my crew and I said guys I

2075
01:35:31,789 --> 01:35:41,269
just met Rosenthal and I was almost

2076
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:43,699
shaking that's so cool yeah yeah so um

2077
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:47,210
you brought up a good point there your

2078
01:35:43,699 --> 01:35:50,630
grandma sugar cookies that's a strain

2079
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:53,329
that looked like it was kind of in the

2080
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:56,060
run for like you're kind of just staple

2081
01:35:53,329 --> 01:35:57,500
it it's been worked a lot it's been

2082
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:59,810
worked in a few different directions

2083
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:05,000
what is it about the grandma's sugar

2084
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:07,220
cookies that stood out to you that's one

2085
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,199
of the few scenarios where I was looking

2086
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:11,360
at the industry and kind of what they

2087
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:13,279
wanted and I was trying to bring

2088
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:15,109
something of mine to the table mixed

2089
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:18,439
with you know an obvious favorite the

2090
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:21,289
cookies at the time and so I you know I

2091
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:23,329
was trying to get something for my

2092
01:36:21,289 --> 01:36:25,489
customer base that where they could have

2093
01:36:23,329 --> 01:36:28,789
a cookie option for me is really where

2094
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:31,609
that started from I had no idea that it

2095
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:35,630
would turn out to be like you said it is

2096
01:36:31,609 --> 01:36:39,039
it is pretty much my staple which is you

2097
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:42,890
know cool for me because that's actually

2098
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:46,369
reminiscent of my actual grandmother and

2099
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:48,920
her her actual sugar cookies that was oh

2100
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:51,939
that was the whole painting behind that

2101
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:54,680
process and she's long since passed

2102
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:58,460
which so it's nice to see that strain

2103
01:36:54,680 --> 01:37:01,100
get a little bit of attention and you

2104
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:03,380
know it's a kind of a nod to her yeah

2105
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:05,270
nice it's really nice and the fact that

2106
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:07,460
you then decided to work it out you know

2107
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:10,130
we then got the Double Stuf cookies and

2108
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:12,739
the all-star cookies was that kind of

2109
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:16,010
just a testament to how how like solid

2110
01:37:12,739 --> 01:37:20,269
of a base that strain was on its own it

2111
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:22,520
was through multitude of feedback that I

2112
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:24,380
got from people people were coming to me

2113
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,630
saying they they liked it better than

2114
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:29,180
the original cookie and then it produced

2115
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:31,550
more and different things so you know I

2116
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:36,680
did I won't be the one to say that but

2117
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:38,570
that gave me an enough of an you know

2118
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:40,579
enough of what I needed to know to keep

2119
01:37:38,569 --> 01:37:44,210
working with it yeah

2120
01:37:40,579 --> 01:37:45,829
yeah great all right so I think that

2121
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:47,659
brings us basically to the end of the

2122
01:37:45,829 --> 01:37:50,989
interview was there any general comments

2123
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:53,689
or shoutouts you wanted to make yeah I'd

2124
01:37:50,989 --> 01:37:56,989
like to give a shout out mainly number

2125
01:37:53,689 --> 01:37:59,559
one to my fiance Kristen without her

2126
01:37:56,989 --> 01:38:02,389
none of this would be possible really

2127
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:06,050
she puts up with a lot from me and lets

2128
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:08,140
me do basically whatever I want I so I

2129
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:12,079
definitely give a shout out to her I

2130
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:15,500
want to give a shout out to Adam my lead

2131
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:17,420
grower without him a lot of this also

2132
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:20,569
wouldn't be possible because he handles

2133
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:23,569
a lot of stuff when I'm not able to and

2134
01:38:20,569 --> 01:38:27,109
then to my mom pots without them I

2135
01:38:23,569 --> 01:38:29,479
wouldn't be here yeah awesome just

2136
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:32,359

2137
01:38:29,479 --> 01:38:34,729
woman behind every breed oh yeah they're

2138
01:38:32,359 --> 01:38:38,509

2139
01:38:34,729 --> 01:38:39,799
always I was a great honor listen so

2140
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:42,590
