been a minute since i've heard that name

73
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,759
i remember when i was first getting into

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
weed i was watching his videos on

75
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,039
youtube did you ever interact with him

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
much

77
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,039
um yeah a little bit um i sent him the

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,039
cookie berry crunch and stuff to run he

79
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,439
was a real nice dude but we never got

80
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,439
real close and then he disappeared

81
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,199
yeah i remember that he dropped off and

82
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,439
then he like put up a post being like

83
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,719
i'm in new zealand and i was like what

84
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,239
and then like i think that just fell

85
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,120
through as well

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,519
yeah

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,840
yeah i don't i don't i don't

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,158
he popped up

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,519
maybe i want to say five months ago but

90
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,439
and i talked to him for like a second

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,039
just to ask him if he still had that gut

92
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,878
and he's like no i don't still have it i

93
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,560
don't have anything

94
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,399
oh that's a bummer that was that was

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,158
interesting man because i think i've

96
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,719
mentioned this to you on instagram i

97
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,318
love the uh the names of your strains i

98
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,158
can like i hear the name and i'm like

99
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,399
that's a matte riots train and i gotta

100
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,759
admit i i stole that line from him

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
because he was the one who was talking

102
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,120
about it in his videos he was like heard

103
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,919
the cookie berry crunch and he's like

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
that's a matte riot strain

105
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,919
yeah my naming conventions are a little

106
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,319
off some people don't like them at all

107
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,598
like the coke head [ __ ] was not super

108
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,438
popular but you know it is what it is

109
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,639
that's so funny because i literally had

110
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,158
a question about that which i guess

111
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,518
we're going to jump to right now i was

112
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,359
going to say um

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,438
yeah like when when i was cruising your

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,120
site like an hour ago i saw the cokehead

115
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,878
[ __ ] and i just started laughing i was

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
like [ __ ] that's a good name i love that

117
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,199
on so many levels

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
do you feel like strain names

119
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,639
should be embodying of kind of like what

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,639
the strain has to offer or do you think

121
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
like a good strain name is a good strain

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
name

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,000
you know i look at it like art man um

124
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
everything that that that i do with

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
breeding i look at like art you know

126
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,120
i've always been a musician and stuff

127
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,199
like that and

128
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
art's been a big part of my life and i

129
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,280
feel like you know like

130
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,040
the ultimate outcome of reading is is

131
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,119
what your desired goal is and it's

132
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,960
almost like having a canvas that you're

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,040
painting and you have that ultimate

134
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,039
desired goal and if you're not happy

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
with it you'll throw it away you know

136
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
and all that comes around and then all

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,960
the way to naming that painting and it's

138
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
just whatever mood i'm in whatever i'm

139
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,198
thinking about whatever possessed me to

140
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,519
make that creation you know that's that

141
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,360
all goes into it

142
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:06,159
yeah perfect okay so if you had a strain

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,919
that you felt like was bang on a

144
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,800
particular flavor let's just say it's

145
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,799
like it's bang on cherries or something

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,478
do you feel like you really want to call

147
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
it like have cherries in the name or

148
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,120
that doesn't really influence you so

149
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,758
much

150
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,199
um some of the time yeah but like

151
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,280
i see a lot of names out there like

152
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,160
cookies that doesn't taste like [ __ ]

153
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,319
cookies but it's it's been established

154
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,880
as you know this is cookies this is the

155
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,639
look this is the the [ __ ] you know so

156
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,959
i've been trying to to migrate away from

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,038
that but like with my banana stuff

158
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,638
obviously the banana og was a big one

159
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,478
and so that that's usually in the names

160
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,600
because the terpene profile and the way

161
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,439
i i took the line was totally banana um

162
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,439
so when it comes to flavors sometimes if

163
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,519
there's like an amplified flavor usually

164
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,439
that'll be in the name

165
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
yeah of course of course

166
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,079
so a lot has happened since we last

167
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,399
spoke so give me a bit of a rundown what

168
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,240
are you currently up to

169
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,879
um right now i'm going through the whole

170
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,478
blue the blue lines um that's always

171
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,079
been a big passion of mine was the blue

172
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,240
stuff not just because of the the

173
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,318
chirping profile which is my favorite

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,439
terpene profile the true blueberry jam

175
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,639
blueberry muffins type terpenes but um

176
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:19,038
the high the high from very very select

177
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,639
special blueberry uh like the highland

178
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,478
thai thai pies um it's it's clear

179
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,038
clear-headed

180
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,279
very euphoric in many ways but not

181
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,199
slammingly potent it's it's really hard

182
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,879
to describe to someone like a lot of

183
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,280
modern um

184
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,038
a lot of modern smokers uh people from

185
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,959
the generation right below mine they

186
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,318
probably wouldn't see as much value in

187
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,198
it as i do because a lot of them are

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,800
used to the the narcotic afghani thai

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,960
pies but uh

190
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,840
yeah this is special to me and i lost my

191
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,758
riot very og mom in a tissue culture

192
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,000
debacle which we can talk about later if

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,319
you want um let's talk about it now

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,279
mooney moon what do you got to say

195
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,639
oh

196
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,918
you know that i have to be careful

197
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,960
because i don't want to

198
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,560
to get

199
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,519
uh in trouble legally because he's a

200
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,079
little rat but um yeah he killed he

201
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,159
literally killed everything that i owned

202
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,000
everything that i owned um his big

203
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,960
takeaway was that he didn't physically

204
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,160
touch it but um and that's true but the

205
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:20,719
the the thing was he he had a business

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,720
um i was moving and he's like hey let me

207
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
let me take your moms and i'll hold them

208
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,960
for you while you move and i'll tissue

209
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,120
culture while i'm doing that so he sent

210
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,519
someone up to pick them up he supposedly

211
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,918

212
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,079

213
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,839
contact with the dude and mooney during

214
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,758
all of this and no one mentioned

215
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,560
anything about them just [ __ ] killing

216
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,560
everything and uh it took me moving and

217
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,839
being like yo i'm coming to get my [ __ ]

218
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,000
you know i'm sending someone to come get

219
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,799
my [ __ ] now you know i had to get real

220
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,879
mean about it and uh when i did i found

221
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,879
out everything was just liquid in bags

222
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,039
no more moms they just took cuts off

223
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,520
[ __ ] threw it in bags in a box and that

224
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,918
was it been sitting there for months

225
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,159
dude that's so brutal to hear i actually

226
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,079
uh lost my uh

227
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
what how would you call it you know my

228
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,758
my strain that i've been working on for

229
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,598
the longest time raspberry marmara and i

230
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
was so devastated when i found out that

231
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,680
it was just gone you know like no one

232
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,478
still has it i was so bummed out but

233
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
then

234
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,639
i saw the silver lining it kind of

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,879
forces you to move on is that how you

236
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,079
feel about this situation

237
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,080
yeah um

238
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,038
there is a few few good things to come

239
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,959
from it one um i was gonna start working

240
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,639
heavily with moon so i learned he was a

241
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,918
little piece of [ __ ] from the beginning

242
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,958
which is cool

243
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,319
um

244
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,239
secondly

245
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
yeah it's forced me to look in all

246
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
different directions um and i get to

247
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,319
rework all those blueberry lines the old

248
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
blue sativa lines that i love so that's

249
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
kind of cool to be able to do it again

250
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,159
and thirdly i got to see who my my real

251
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,600
friends were there was a lot of people

252
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,278
that reached out were like hey i got

253
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,759
this of yours i'm sending it like right

254
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,000
now you know without me even asking

255
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,919
it was is pretty heartwarming you know

256
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,759
and then i also got to see who is true

257
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,879
to their word um there were several

258
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,759
people that

259
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,320
i made trades with uh like ten thousand

260
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,278
dollars worth of my spray reversal spray

261
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,800
um

262
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,399
and it was right before i did this with

263
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,159
moon because i always want to have a

264
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,120
plan b just in case something [ __ ] up

265
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,759
right

266
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,600
and uh i did a big trade with a few

267
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,519
people a few different people and i said

268
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,440
look if i ever lose anything i want to

269
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,600
be able to grab certain cuts back right

270
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,800
away so you know just this is just a

271
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,200
card in pocket and they're like yeah

272
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,199
yeah cool cool now they have all these

273
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,240
fem lines out and the second i needed

274
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
them they're like yeah i don't got

275
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,839
anything for you bro

276
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
so

277
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,480
yeah [ __ ] it's kind of par for the

278
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,639
course isn't it

279
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,560
it is it is but you know again now i

280
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,919
know that they're they're you know who

281
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,399
they are

282
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,639
yeah okay yeah it's uh it's almost like

283
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,399
that legend og situation where you're

284
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,958
almost like just testing people seeing

285
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,480
who's gonna be the real homies

286
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,479
yep yep

287
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,759
interesting okay so you brought up the

288
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,278
blueberry thing that's interesting

289
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,480
because it was only about like two days

290
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,958
ago i saw swami not the uh the one who

291
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
walks around in the white garb but uh

292
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,278
the the one who [ __ ] with those cool

293
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,518
genetics swami seeds they were saying

294
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,159
something about how you know it seems

295
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,440
like basically dj shorts work has hit a

296
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,600
dead end and they came to that

297
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
conclusion by the fact that jd's work

298
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,720
with it has just been

299
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,879
you know in their opinion quite

300
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,560
lackluster how do you feel about that

301
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,240
and how do you feel about the idea that

302
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,919
you know the work has been somewhat

303
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,120
bottlenecked

304
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,799
well

305
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
there's a few there's a few levels to

306
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,919
that question you've got to start off

307
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
with the source

308
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,559
swami

309
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,078
swami's

310
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,759
he doesn't know jack [ __ ] about breeding

311
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,159
neither does gay afghanistan i've put

312
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,838
them both under the [ __ ] the fire you

313
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,480
know on my live feed and otherwise they

314
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,959
wouldn't come on but um what they were

315
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
doing was attempting to make the one

316
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,599
from um

317
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,278
uh uh

318
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,079
the other [ __ ] i can't remember his

319
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,639
name but um who is it is it mountain

320
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,679
organics or coot no

321
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,559
toots

322
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,919
yeah

323
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,919
so they were trying to make that look

324
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,000
like an old dj short line by saying it

325
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,919
was highland tie and all this [ __ ] and i

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,759
actually popped a bunch of it to see and

327
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,919
there's no relation at all in any of

328
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,720
that to the blueberry

329
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,360
so there is that factor to it they don't

330
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,000
i don't think they have a right nor

331
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,278
the history that they claim being a part

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,200
of brotherhood of eternal life it seems

333
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,200
like a lot of liars pull from that

334
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,600
brotherhood of eternal love [ __ ] card

335
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,440
pack golden coast you know idiots like

336
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
that um

337
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
but yeah like

338
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,679
but i will say that

339
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,800
dj's lines have transformed a lot over

340
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,519
the years and and the blueberry indica

341
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:44,879
stuff the afghani based stuff it's not

342
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,320
particularly blueberry anymore um

343
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,078
you know i have a bunch of that running

344
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,200
with all the old blueberries right now

345
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,359
and it's

346
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
it's uh yeah i don't know if it's due to

347
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,278
inbreeding not being able to take it

348
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,839
back in that direction maybe not a want

349
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,078
to to visit that direction anymore

350
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,519
um but then i see him release stuff like

351
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:02,879
newberry

352
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,240
and i haven't run that so i can't

353
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,480
comment on that i don't know if he's

354
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,560
trying to go back in that direction

355
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,039
but you know i'm not a big fan of any of

356
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,638
the modern blueberry stuff um

357
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,679
i like that

358
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,278
jd's going towards the f-13 and stuff

359
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,278
like that it's one of the best

360
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,480
dj lines ever

361
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,879
and he's been real cool easy to talk to

362
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,600
dj not so much dj's not as easy to talk

363
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,278
to um when i the last time i've met him

364
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
several times but the last time i saw

365
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,278
him he he told me that my company was

366
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,319
not owned by me

367
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:39,278
so i thought that was pretty interesting

368
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,720
interesting observation yeah i thought

369
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,159
he's like yeah you don't you don't own

370
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,759
riot seeds there's a guy named ryan

371
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,719
solly schecter that owns riot seeds and

372
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,559
i was like

373
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,560
no i'm pretty sure he owns oregon seed

374
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,958
bank uh he's a cool dude but yeah no he

375
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,439
doesn't own my company he's like no

376
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,518
um no i i think he owns riot seeds and i

377
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,839
was like okay cool nice seeing you dude

378
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,159
i seen you again dj

379
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,240
yeah wow yeah i remember at emerald cup

380
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,399
i was able to smoke on his one of his

381
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,079
newest trains first light and that was

382
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,559
very much drawing from the more kind of

383
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,919
flow flavors and terpenes so i think i

384
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,000
would agree with you on that blueberry

385
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,199
comment about how it's not so present

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,919
anymore

387
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,240
yeah yeah i wish i wish it were

388
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,360
um when i had my rye berry cup before

389
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,759
moon had so graciously murdered it um i

390
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,278
i offered it to dj because it was so it

391
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,838
was it was so much in the direction the

392
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,919
blueberry jam very purple looked a lot

393
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
like oregon purple tie so i figured man

394
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,039
this is like it's it's a lot it spread

395
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
in the direction of the baseline like

396
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,278
the oregon purple tie but with all the

397
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,720
blueberry traits um blueberry terps and

398
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,720
everything and i offered it to him he

399
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,278
just was not [ __ ] interested in it i

400
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,199
don't know if he didn't believe me or if

401
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,639
he just didn't want to go that direction

402
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,838
and you know that's his prerogative but

403
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,959
yeah um i tried offering that to him and

404
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,160
i kind of wish he would have taken it

405
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,838
now just so i could have gotten it back

406
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,480
from someone

407
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,560
yeah most certainly so one of the newer

408
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,920
blueberry kind of players to hit the

409
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,759
scene is humboldt seed company who have

410
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,439
their blueberry muffin have you had a

411
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,039
chance to try that oh

412
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,839
what do you think

413
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,919
um all right so i mean the blueberry

414
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,199
muffin was a cut and it was my right

415
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,958
berry og cut and it's been that for

416
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,599
i don't know over a decade

417
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,278
um now these guys supposedly are

418
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,720
mountain people who don't really give

419
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,720
two shits about

420
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
naming conventions or otherwise and

421
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,800
that's fine and dandy but

422
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,320
um you're gonna offend people doing that

423
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,439
like putting out a jackhammer that has

424
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,639
nothing to do with jack hair uh genetics

425
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,199
a headband has nothing to do with

426
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,039
headband i know ethos did that too just

427
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,319
i don't know if that's a new thing to do

428
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,559
just steal a name and slap it on

429
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,120
[ __ ] but um

430
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,479
i've been told they're nice people

431
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,159
with all that said i've been told

432
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
they're nice people by by good friends

433
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,360
of mine so i don't want to go too heavy

434
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,800
on it but i no i have not tried it um

435
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,480
i don't know it's just one of those

436
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,838
things where it's like kind of i want to

437
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,600
try it but at the same time i don't want

438
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,399
to support someone who just jacked me

439
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,639
and used all the the energy i put behind

440
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,679
something to make their line sell you

441
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,079
know

442
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,479
yeah i i was able to have a quick chat

443
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,559
with the owner nat at the emerald cup

444
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,079
and he definitely is a nice guy however

445
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,958
i was also able to have a chat with

446
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,359
their head breeder and i was less

447
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,359
convinced when i was asking him some

448
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,639
serious questions about you know

449
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
like you know because they claim it's an

450
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,198
f4 and then on the packaging it says

451
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,800
it's an f8 so i was like so so which one

452
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,719
is it and he didn't really give me a

453
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,319
convincing answer and i was like oh okay

454
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,759
cool man see you later

455
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,000
yeah it's an s1 f4 f8px yeah bro yeah

456
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,680
one of those [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah i

457
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,759
don't know i don't know

458
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,919
yeah i'm not a fan

459
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,600
all right well let's uh let's keep on

460
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,039
the naming conventions for a minute

461
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,560
right i had a question thrown to me the

462
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,278
other day and i couldn't answer it but i

463
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,599
think you might be able to someone said

464
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,958
they made they used some femme spray

465
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,959
they made the s-ones popped the seeds

466
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,278
and then they found some males in it and

467
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,359
i was like well that could be like rogue

468
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,799
pollen by the sounds of it but anyway

469
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,199
let's just assume that it is from the

470
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,159
pollen that they thought it was they

471
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,758
were like if i make f2s with these seeds

472
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,838
what would they be named and i was like

473
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,120
would that be like s1 f2 like i don't

474
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,320
know how to name it what would you call

475
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,919
that

476
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,160
f2r

477
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,078
yeah f2 reversal yeah i mean that's

478
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,319
that's essentially what it would be but

479
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,319
you know like the the mail

480
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,120
um the mail is popping up from femme

481
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,440
seeds is it's a uh

482
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,240
it's a it's a topic like a lot of people

483
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,000
are very staunch in their beliefs on um

484
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
there was a paper the other day i wish i

485
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,759
had it handy um

486
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,160
that that my friend bittersweet pulled

487
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,919
up and it was from i want to say the 70s

488
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,679
talking about it and it gave a full

489
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,759
rundown of what's happening and

490
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,638
basically it is that nature finds a way

491
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,879
that's the answer to it um now when

492
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,360
they're tested i know caleb from csi

493
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,519
humboldt has sent in some stuff uh males

494
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,240
that have been found or plants that have

495
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,400
been expressing male found in s1s or or

496
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,120
reversed hybrids sending those in and

497
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,959
they're coming up testing as female

498
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,078
but they're only expressing male like

499
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,839
they're not expressing any female traits

500
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,838
so i don't know

501
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,519
it's it's a weird topic man it's not

502
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,399
always going to be that way

503
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,959
but um it tends to be

504
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,640
the most common the most common argument

505
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,120
is that it's pollen contamination and i

506
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,440
think 99 of the time it will be pollen

507
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,038
contamination but there there's many

508
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,200
times where it's popped up and there's

509
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,240
no way it could be and then you're left

510
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,240
with

511
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,480
well was it is it a

512
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,279
female that's just expressing male is it

513
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,440
an actual male with male chromosomes

514
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,839
like what is it you know and and it's

515
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,240
different seems to be different in every

516
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,240
case yeah of course so something i

517
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,200
really wanted to ask you do you feel

518
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,798
like the chemicals used in the reversal

519
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,600
spray could be a contributing factor

520
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,960
you know i i tend to think that but um

521
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,038
you know there's people that disagree

522
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,440
with me that have just as much time

523
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,679
reversing and maybe even more experience

524
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
reversing than i do so i take that into

525
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,880
account as well um i truly believe that

526
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,798
that in stressing a plant you're you're

527
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,760
changing its epigenetic changing it at

528
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,519
the epigenetic level and um you know i

529
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,759
was watching an interesting ted talk the

530
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,319
other day talking about epigenetics and

531
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,359
it had to do with rats um

532
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,038
and and mothers nursing their their rats

533
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,759
their rattlings whatever you [ __ ]

534
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,759
call little rats

535
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,038
but yeah like if they didn't if they

536
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,399
didn't nurse them it changed them it

537
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,798
changed these little rats at the

538
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,320
epigenetic level

539
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,240
and they're already born they already

540
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,639
have their set set of genetics but at

541
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,720
the epigenetic level just by not nursing

542
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,000
it changed them for life and it changed

543
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,798
the future

544
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
children 10 generations in

545
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,879
so i mean i think that if you do it with

546
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,400
uh uh stress and and strictly stress

547
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,480
because there's a lot more hormones that

548
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,080
are involved in stress than there are in

549
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,079
simple reversals where you're just

550
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,558
blocking uh

551
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,639
blocking ethylene and um and promoting

552
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,798
gibbrelli you know that those are the

553
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,720
two main things that you need to reverse

554
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,798
however in stress there's a lot more

555
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,720
hormones involved and i think that it

556
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,400
changes the the plants at the epigenetic

557
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,480
level to be more prone to to herm stress

558
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,160
um

559
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,038
if you go that method which i believe

560
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,600
soma calls rotalization um

561
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:36,160
which is a [ __ ] term in my eyes uh

562
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,319
but you know torture your plants and and

563
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,558
make seeds that that is a method that

564
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,960
people use or run them too long and have

565
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,359
them herm and hopefully that make seeds

566
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,840
that's it that's a method people use uh

567
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,678
it's not my choice method uh and this is

568
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,359
just a theory i could be totally [ __ ]

569
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,519
wrong i could be totally [ __ ] wrong

570
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,038
it might one might be just as perfect as

571
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,960
the other and not change anything at an

572
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,679
epigenetic level but until we have the

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,079
ability to test for that who knows

574
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,000
you know i i totally agree and the the

575
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,079
effects of vertical transmission of

576
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,440
stress are well documented in humans so

577
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,119
it makes sense that it would apply to

578
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,279
plants right

579
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,599
i thought it was fascinating that 10

580
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,759
generations down they're seeing that

581
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,719
epigenetically everything is fully

582
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,960
affected like up to 10 generations down

583
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
so even people that smoke cigarettes

584
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,960
males that smoke cigarettes during

585
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,679
conception right or females that smoke

586
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,600
cigarettes after conception and in the

587
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,640
uh and when it's in her

588
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,359
[ __ ]

589
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,799
uterus that's the one yeah here i am

590
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,678
talking botany you know a [ __ ] about

591
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,279
biology but um apparently yeah even

592
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
smoking cigarettes and stuff like that

593
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,200
affects

594
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,159
generations 10 generations down

595
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,720
i mean if i believe the quote was if

596
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,000
someone starts smoking at the age of 9

597
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,640
to 11 it will affect their children's

598
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,480
children 10 generations down negatively

599
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,120
that's i mean that's mind-blowing so

600
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,798
decisions we make as children can affect

601
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,959
future generations

602
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,960
scary yeah for sure i've actually got

603
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,400
this friend who's a doctor and he was

604
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,880
saying to me that he finds it very

605
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,159
peculiar how there's this similarity

606
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,640
within uh unstable cannabis genetics and

607
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,799
like really low socioeconomic humans in

608
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,240
terms of everyone kind of jokingly

609
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,400
acknowledges that like

610
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
you know women from low socioeconomic

611
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,840
backgrounds tend to have kids at a

612
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,359
younger age than if you're like kind of

613
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,639
more or well-off you'd have them a

614
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,719
little bit older and maybe a bit more

615
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,360
financially set up and he was like it's

616
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,558
so peculiar how it's like similar to

617
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,639
plants you know like an unstable plant

618
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,319
will hermaphrodite and want to produce

619
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,240
these offspring at like a much earlier

620
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,960
age and it's got these epigenetic

621
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,798
effects that go on for generations much

622
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
the same as like what happens in humans

623
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:49,038
i was like [ __ ] i never thought of it

624
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,400
like that that's such a brilliant

625
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,839
analogy

626
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,480
yeah and that's along the same theory

627
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,158
that i have like you know if it's stress

628
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,159
stress induced as opposed to just

629
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,559
chemically induced without all the other

630
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,480
stress markers that it it changes [ __ ]

631
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,038
at the epigenetic level

632
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,279
for sure so while we're on the topic of

633
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,359
fem spray we've seen a few new frame

634
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,200
sprays come out since we last spoke

635
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,119
what's your take on this like different

636
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,558
companies producing them

637
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,639
um i think it's good man like it

638
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,639
in in business you need you need

639
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
competition to grow and push everyone to

640
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,159
make the best product possible so i

641
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,640
think it's a great thing dude

642
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,720
i the one thing i don't like is is

643
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,240
people putting out [ __ ] that's just

644
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,400
gonna waste people's money and time

645
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,400
though and i've seen a lot of that a

646
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,559
[ __ ] load of that i can't tell you

647
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
how many emails i get from like tyrese

648
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,639
mis customers messaging me and saying

649
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,400
hey this [ __ ] didn't work i've got a

650
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
[ __ ] problem with it you know i've

651
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,440
got to rush through this and then i have

652
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:49,038
to rush ship them spray so they can

653
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,240
finish their [ __ ] you know um yeah but

654
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,400
as far as uh any competition um hybe of

655
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,038
course he's been doing it longer than me

656
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,960
his spray is very effective um

657
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:02,319
csi humboldt was able to reverse

658
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,319
triangle with it and he he used my spray

659
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,960
his spray and hives and hives worked

660
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,038
great for it great it did burn the plant

661
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,240
up but in in reversals you're not really

662
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,640
worried about keeping it pretty you're

663
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,120
worried about pollen dumping and and his

664
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
in that case was very effective so there

665
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,000
there is also

666
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,038
people need to keep in mind like there

667
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,558
are certain sprays that are more

668
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,798
effective for different phenoes of

669
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,279
different things so yeah i mean it's

670
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,440
good it drives us all to be better

671
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,119
yeah of course and i'll give you a quick

672
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,640
shout out my friend myfam seeds were

673
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:35,439
made from your spray i 100 back it but

674
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,840
yeah yeah yeah one for the homies but uh

675
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,000
yeah yeah that's awesome most notably

676
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,399
with these new fem sprays coming out

677
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
we've seen our buddy swerve put up a

678
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,519
post a while back saying like oh you

679
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,519
know i'm thinking of offering a new

680
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,599
spray and the part which caught my eye

681
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,278
was that he said like you know it's

682
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,278
going to be done properly and i guess

683
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,919
the implication was that others on the

684
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,278
market are maybe not done properly how

685
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,679
do you feel about that

686
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,200
i swears a little bit so i mean he's

687
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,960
going to take shots anyone he's going to

688
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,519
try to come in anywhere in the market

689
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,440
like if you look at how the quality of

690
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,319
his seeds and how he did it producing

691
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,120
[ __ ] auto flowering herms in a line

692
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,319
that was supposed to be neither um it's

693
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,119
probably going to be the same with this

694
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,599
spray he's never been really effective

695
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,439
at doing reversals again tons of pollen

696
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,079
contamination and tons of males in a lot

697
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,000
of his lines um and he's kind of doing

698
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,599
it just to be an [ __ ] but whatever

699
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
more power to him

700
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,399
bring on the competition [ __ ]

701
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,080
that's what i say

702
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,519
yeah yeah if you listen and swerve shout

703
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,359
out bro you can come on soon i know

704
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,440
we've been talking about it

705
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,278
i'm such a little [ __ ]

706
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,278
oh yeah but he's got a story to tell as

707
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,359
well and i want to hear you know i and

708
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,480
even though i don't like swerve um i

709
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,439
will say

710
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,720
a lot of the ogs in the market um the og

711
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,400
kush's were based on his seed line like

712
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,558
a lot of people renamed a lot of his

713
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,559
lines um so i'll give credit where it's

714
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,720
due to that dude on that but it's just

715
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,399
you know the first emerald cup i finally

716
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
got to see him in person and we were not

717
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,360
cool

718
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
and uh it was right after i had my

719
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,558
interaction with uh [ __ ] dave from

720
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,038
golden coast and um i walked up behind

721
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,319
him threw him in a quick choke and then

722
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,759
i let go because i was like okay i'm

723
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,480
being an [ __ ] now kind of being a

724
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,919
bully on this little kid and uh then he

725
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,159
walked up and he was being he was being

726
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,240
nice after he's like yo you know it's

727
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,600
you know we're both og's blah blah blah

728
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
and i was like you know what if you're

729
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,480
changing if you're changing your

730
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,519
attitude in life and [ __ ] that's cool

731
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,519
you know hit me up here's my number and

732
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,038
i [ __ ] you not the day i get home he's

733
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,960
already talking [ __ ] and it's just like

734
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,839
wow did you just do that not to get your

735
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,480
ass beat that's sad that's sad because i

736
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:43,519
i was looking forward to him changing uh

737
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,360
his tune yeah well i mean something you

738
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,720
mentioned which i think is undeniable is

739
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,879
that there's certainly a lot of work out

740
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,038
there that does use his stuff and one of

741
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,360
the more notable ones is purple punch

742
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,440
you know they used his larry og a male

743
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,038
from that to make that

744
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,080
i thought about that for a minute and i

745
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,319
was like well there's a lot of people

746
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,639
who don't really rate purple punch so is

747
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,240
that like how does that does is it a

748
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,840
good marketing point is it a bad

749
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,599
marketing point what's your thoughts on

750
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,240
purple punch

751
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,000
um you know i like smoking it especially

752
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,599
because the terps are [ __ ] amazing in

753
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,839
it i've had some really really good

754
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,240
purple punch that's almost berry that i

755
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,399
really liked um

756
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,159
i don't mind i don't need to get smashed

757
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,240
every time i smoke so i don't mind it

758
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,400
but i get why people are like okay it's

759
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,679
really resinous it gives the appearance

760
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,278
that it's going to be really potent and

761
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,519
then it's not it's disappointing in that

762
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,038
in that sense but it's made us it's it's

763
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,319
made its

764
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,480
uh

765
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,399
it's made its mark on our market and

766
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,319
that's undeniable

767
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,000
yeah and how do you feel in general

768
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,278
about some of the purple strains because

769
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,558
to me at least it's like it seems like

770
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,880
it's the first purple strain that's

771
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,720
really made a mark on the hype market in

772
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,200
a long time so i kind of think like i

773
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,600
mean props for doing that right

774
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,960
yeah yeah definitely um the first people

775
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,839
doing hardcore purple work or naboo

776
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,600
um

777
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:03,278
sunny chiba off of naboo's work um

778
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,959
i don't like to credit myself with a lot

779
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,558
but i was one of the first people really

780
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,319
putting purples out there because they

781
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,000
were hard to find they were real hard to

782
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,000
find purples back in the day and people

783
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,319
see it today everywhere so they don't

784
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,759
really understand how how rare it was

785
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,678
and how much breeding it took to bring

786
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,759
that to the forefront and then you know

787
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,679
csi did a lot of beautiful work with

788
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,519
urkel um

789
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,960
with purple indica

790
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,879
um

791
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,759
you had cvf doing some purple indica

792
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,399
work

793
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,000
uh so yeah you know i'm a fan of purples

794
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,038
dude i love that aesthetic beauty in my

795
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,119
garden at all times so would you

796
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,359
generally agree with the kind of idea

797
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,038
that purples generally speaking are not

798
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,959
as potent as kind of their greener

799
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,398
counterparts

800
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,480
you know i i'd say it would be a

801
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,079
case-by-case basis because purple oracle

802
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,000
the original cut is one of the most

803
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,398
smashing potent

804
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,599
[ __ ] plants i can't smoke it it puts

805
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:58,158
me into a tizzy as it were

806
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,158
it i mean it [ __ ] me up so bad in in a

807
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,600
bad way so i can't really smoke it but i

808
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,679
love breeding with it because of how it

809
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,519
breeds and because i like i like that

810
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,759
flavor so i always have to hybridize it

811
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,480
before i can smoke it but yeah in that

812
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,398
case it's one of the more potent ones um

813
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,399
so it's really hard to say

814
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,199
yeah okay well i mean while we're on the

815
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,879
topic of urkel as time goes by i'm

816
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,038
getting more and more convinced that

817
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,399
urkel is a part of the cookie's genetic

818
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,720
makeup given given your work with the f1

819
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,558
derb as well as a lot of other things in

820
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,399
general yeah what's your stance on this

821
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,240
and what's your what's your uh kind of

822
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,918
you know thoughts on the cookie genetic

823
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,919
lineage

824
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,679
so i was the first person to put out

825
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,080
cookie and seed form

826
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,399
oh i i guess almost

827
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,599
nine eight or nine years ago now and i

828
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,599
was just talking about that today i

829
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,519
didn't realize it's been that long since

830
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,918
it's been out um

831
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,359
back then i noted okay

832
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,679
i've seen this before i've seen this in

833
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,319
urkel and og hybrids you can pull this

834
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,559
out this exact pheno out with just urkel

835
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,240
and og including the ogkb phenotype

836
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,480
which is a common occurring phenotype

837
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,720
that you see in herbal and og hybrids

838
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,919
however uh cookies probably was done

839
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,960
with gdp

840
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,600
um

841
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,120
which isn't another oracle hybrid and

842
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:15,278
gdp and that florida og um i know that

843
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,119
not so dog my buddy has that florida og

844
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,359
and it's had it for a while so that is a

845
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,639
real og cut that did exist

846
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,558
um

847
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,559
yeah and and things like cherry pie

848
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,319
though cherry pie is the mendo derb

849
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:30,480
expression which i think is just mendo

850
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:32,639
derb and the og without the herbal

851
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,679
but you can see very very much that the

852
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,880
the mendo derb aka f1 derv aka purple

853
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,200
pain aka a million other names

854
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,440
um yeah that's that's where you see the

855
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,278
expression in cherry pie the most but in

856
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,480
cookies you really don't see any of that

857
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,720
expression

858
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,599

869
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,919
playing with it um we're learning a lot

870
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,720
about it that it does have a dud trait

871
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,120
in it that doesn't always express um

872
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,120
like you can take a branch off of it and

873
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,639
uh sometimes it's a great branch

874
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,558
sometimes it's a dud branch and if you

875
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,799
get a dud branch you're kind of [ __ ]

876
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,278

situation he was one of the people that

934
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,798
stepped up and you know like a lot of

935
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,799
breeders look at each other's

936
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,798
competition and me and him never have

937
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,398

943
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,159
different strains and

944
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:45,199
yeah i that's the second time he's

945
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,360
helped save my company second time um so

946
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,759
i owe that man the world

947
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,038
yeah truly uh one of a kind person as

948
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,038
you said

949
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,200
yeah so

950
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,679
you touched on it earlier but i want to

951
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,840
get more a bit deeply into it the the

952
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,919
concept of people outsourcing their

953
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,879
breeding is becoming a more and more

954
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,320
common

955
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
kind of uh

956
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,240
occurrence within the the kind of

957
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,919
community how do you feel about this do

958
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,159
you feel like it's a bad or a good thing

959
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,480
or where do you sit

960
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,760
um i can't i can't say it's terrible

961
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,960
because i've been one of those people

962
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,519
that

963
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120
people call to outsource their breeding

964
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,880
i think i think people are starting to

965
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,798
learn their strengths in this industry

966
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,320
some people are really good at marketing

967
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,480
and really good at packaging and

968
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,519
presentation but not so good at breeding

969
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,200
and i think i think that's uh

970
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,519
it's hard when you have an ego we all

971
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,840
have egos to a certain extent and as as

972
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,519
artists and breeders we all have egos

973
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,038
however um

974
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,038
it's

975
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,558
we have to put our egos down to say okay

976
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,158
someone else is better than me at this

977
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:47,599
particular thing

978
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,440
and i'm going to have them do it now

979
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,278
with that said i think there should be

980
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,038
transparency in it there should always

981
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,679
be transparency in it ghost spreading

982
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,599
kind of sucks you know

983
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,759
and being able to just buy

984
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,558
street cred and breeding to me is is

985
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,240
pretty lame um

986
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:05,839
but outsourcing breeding as long as it's

987
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,679
transparent i think i think it's going

988
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,358
to be something we see more often you

989
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,240
know um

990
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,398
yeah

991
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,838
yeah yeah that's dance so i guess that

992
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:18,159
was a kind of a neat little segue into

993
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,320
what i love to ask everyone the whole

994
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,398
candy rain debacle from cookie fam you

995
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,559
know that was one such example of this

996
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,719
outsourcing how do you feel about that

997
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,320
situation and more specifically how do

998
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,918
you feel about their response to the

999
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,919
issues do you feel like they adequately

1000
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,078
responded to the situation or they kind

1001
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,158
of dropped the ball

1002
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,679
well i mean they themselves when they

1003
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,919
first showed up said

1004
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,838
and i quote yeah they're breeding shits

1005
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,799
for [ __ ] nerds so they you know i

1006
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,960
mean

1007
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,119
anybody who invested in that that they

1008
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,280
got what they deserved i mean there was

1009
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,879
plenty of warning everyone when they

1010
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,240
even talked about it a lot of us came

1011
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,480
out and said you know if you're going to

1012
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,598
spend good money on on seeds that are

1013
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,199
bred

1014
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,039
why would you go to people who are not

1015
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,000
breeders why would you go to people who

1016
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,800
don't understand genetics and they got

1017
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,119
exactly what they paid for um i know

1018
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,160
that i think two or three people might

1019
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,760
have been

1020
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,920
made good on the candy rain where they

1021
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,119
gave them another cross from jbz um i'm

1022
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,358
conf

1023
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,519
i'm confused why jbz would want to work

1024
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:20,559
with them but that's his prerogative you

1025
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,960
know i mean maybe it was a good

1026
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,119
financial situation good financial move

1027
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,159
and i can't i can't hate on him for that

1028
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,480
but at the same time like i just trashed

1029
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,639
to me they're trash

1030
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,719
yeah so i mean does that

1031
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,400
frustrate you in a way the price point

1032
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,559
they set given the quality because i

1033
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,160
know that you know everyone's probably

1034
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,639
familiar that you know you're not

1035
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,879
looking to cater to the cheapest pack in

1036
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,480
the store and that's fine because the

1037
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,559
quality is there to back up the price

1038
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,679
tag but when you've got this situation

1039
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,838
of an even in like much higher price

1040
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,598
much lower quality such as the candy

1041
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,679
rain do you feel like that makes it

1042
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,280
harder for you to stand your own ground

1043
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:01,440
when you're justifying why you do have

1044
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,160
the pricing you do

1045
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,679
um you know really customers set the

1046
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,159
price

1047
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,319
eddie it's only worth what people are

1048
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,399
willing to pay for it and if people

1049
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,359
were willing to pay that for it then

1050
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,800
it's worth exactly that those those

1051
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:20,319
non-germinatable seeds were worth

1052
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,079
exactly 500 a pack or whatever it was

1053
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,760
and um

1054
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,359
you know whether that the quality is

1055
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,040
there with it that's up to them to

1056
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,199
determine maybe they like trash and

1057
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,639
maybe they like they like just the fact

1058
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,759
they maybe they spent that money for the

1059
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,920
packaging

1060
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,400
you know or to make them feel better so

1061
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,599
it you know i don't know um

1062
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,599
yeah

1063
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,519
it's it's a weird situation with that i

1064
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,079
mean there's a lot of people who i think

1065
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:46,400
like like csi humboldt i see his prices

1066
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,680
hundred dollars a pack or 200 for the

1067
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,720
chem 91 s ones or it was 100 and then

1068
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,159
200 for the triangle cush s ones i think

1069
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,239
that blew my mind because i know how

1070
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,838
much goes into reversals and a lot of

1071
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,479
people don't understand what really goes

1072
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,559
into reversals the main thing being what

1073
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,960
determines the price on reversals for me

1074
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,440
is how many times did i fail before i

1075
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,000
[ __ ] have a room that i produced

1076
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,000
viable seeds from that sometimes you'll

1077
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,119
have three runs of nothing

1078
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,880
so then okay that sucks you just lost

1079
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,119
you know x amount of money per each room

1080
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,960
that you wasted on a reversal and it's

1081
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,079
not a matter of skills it's just how

1082
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,000
reversals work um so i know he had tried

1083
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,560
chem 91 several times and triangle kush

1084
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,719
several times and people were bitching

1085
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,799
that he charged 200 a pack i could have

1086
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,480
slapped every single one of them because

1087
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
i he should have charged 600 a pack in

1088
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,159
my opinion that's what they're worth

1089
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,880
they're that rare it's that hard to do

1090
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,000
there was that many failures involved um

1091
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,079
yeah

1092
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,760
yeah totally i mean considering no one's

1093
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,400
ever successfully been able to reverse

1094
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,440
the tk by him it totally validates your

1095
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,280
point right

1096
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,119
yep absolutely

1097
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,920
i got six seeds from my first triangle

1098
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,280
push reversal six oh

1099
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,039
damn

1100
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,480
so i mean

1101
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,639
we'll come back to cookies in a minute

1102
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,880
but while we're talking about the tk you

1103
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,960
know the tk origins crew has come out of

1104
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,039
the shadows since we last spoke i've

1105
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,800
spoken to a few people such as josh d

1106
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,838
who i i'm a big fan of josh d i think

1107
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,440
he's a lovely guy um you know he said to

1108
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,440
me he he really thinks the story is

1109
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,679
legit you know he he backs it you know

1110
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,679
how do you feel about it

1111
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,799
um i'm friends with marty i like marty a

1112
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,679
lot um he's tk origins guy

1113
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
um

1114
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,919
i don't know

1115
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,639
there are things that have changed over

1116
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,639
the years in that story the main part

1117
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,078
being the hindu kush edition and that it

1118
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,279
was intentional

1119
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,359
um

1120
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,480
other than that i don't i don't see a

1121
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,239
reason

1122
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,320
i don't see any holes in the story that

1123
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,679
he was a part of that original crew i do

1124
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,559
believe that probably to be true um

1125
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:53,039
there's also the super knot dude um and

1126
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,880
he can he backs up some of the story i

1127
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,119
believe um

1128
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,838
so yeah i mean i i don't see a lot of

1129
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,200
holes in that story i think maybe the

1130
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,320
intention

1131
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,480
and the

1132
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,240
you know might be different and the

1133
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,358
knowledge of what's in it might be

1134
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:11,279
different

1135
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:13,920
um it sounds a lot more positive and and

1136
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,519
sure than it was you know x amount of

1137
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,960
years ago when he came online and talked

1138
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,280
about it but that's the only difference

1139
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,760
i see but i do think he was a part of

1140
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,359
that original crew and and i don't know

1141
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,920
that triangle would be around if he

1142
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,000
hadn't been a part of it so yeah

1143
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,680
and how do you feel about this uh

1144
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,838
emerald triangle strain that was the

1145
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,598
supposed mother i'm really struggling to

1146
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,679
find any information about it have you

1147
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,960
got any thoughts around that one

1148
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,838
um

1149
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,960
no uh i it's kind of like dog butt it's

1150
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:45,039
one of those things that's up in the air

1151
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,240
what the [ __ ] was it you know um

1152
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,079
yeah yeah

1153
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,078
it probably was just a strain from the

1154
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,039
emerald triangle but what it actually

1155
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,200
was

1156
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,039
hindu kush probably i think he's even

1157
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,519
right in guessing that

1158
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,519
i i would assume that's probably a good

1159
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,559
direction to to go with it would be a

1160
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:05,440
hindu kush a stretchy more golf ball

1161
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:08,000
nugget hindu kush which those do exist

1162
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,400
um the hayes brothers old kali kush was

1163
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,358
like that the vintage is the 80s

1164
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,358
what was it called vintage 80s

1165
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,598
hayes brothers california kush that was

1166
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,199
the full name that they gave it but uh

1167
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,359
it was similar to that so yeah there

1168
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,039
were there was cushes around like that

1169
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,119
and and that strain might have had a

1170
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,119
name originally it might not have but if

1171
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,640
it came from the emerald triangle

1172
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,160
you know that's that's probably what it

1173
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,920
was

1174
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:34,078
and so how do you think we got to the

1175
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,000
point where we have all the ogs from

1176
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,400
there do you think that you know the

1177
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,679
kind of standard lemon og type of thing

1178
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,920
was locked inside those initial tk and

1179
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,480
josh d ogs or do you think there was

1180
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,760
more added to the the pool

1181
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,559
i'm sure there's been more added to the

1182
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,240
pull over time um with ogs a lot of

1183
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,920
people say oh it's just an s1 of that

1184
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,000
yeah we don't know if it's s-ones or if

1185
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,680
it's uh another plant that hurt in a

1186
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,519
room i think that there's a lot of that

1187
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,598
going i think people recognize that it

1188
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,358
was amazing weed and that's why you

1189
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,480
started seeing people keep seeds from

1190
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:08,239
these bags of this weed you know and as

1191
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,559
it moved across the country and through

1192
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,159
different groups each person each group

1193
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,559
kept a little little bit of a different

1194
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:17,279
version like in california resin long's

1195
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,480
crew had their og i have that copy and

1196
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,359
that was

1197
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,599
what is

1198
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,920
supposed to be the original

1199
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,079
josh d-o-g and we still have it it's

1200
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,639
actually a lot more different a lot

1201
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,880
different from uh the the cuts out there

1202
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,519
called josh d that i've seen it's more

1203
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,119
stocky it's more it stays about five

1204
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,519
feet tall whereas like

1205
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,280
uh triangle will [ __ ] grow straight

1206
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:40,719
up like a vine you know i that i have an

1207
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,440
eight footer in the room right now just

1208
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:46,318
growing up you know all lanky this one

1209
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,480
is lenky but not as lenky as the pure

1210
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:51,358
kush not as lanky as loompas headband

1211
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,240
and stuff like that so um and then louie

1212
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,358
was another uh early og crew you know

1213
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,078
the louis

1214
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,480
kazarin i think his name was and then

1215
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,880
you had the jew cut with habibi and

1216
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,440
those dudes those are all the early ogs

1217
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,519
people selecting that backseat

1218
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,960
essentially and finding it running their

1219
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,559
own and that's how all these started

1220
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,760
popping up but whether they were pure or

1221
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,159
not

1222
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,119
you know we'll never really know

1223
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,719
yeah yeah most certainly so interesting

1224
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,318
one you brought up the lumpus headband

1225
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,559
i've been talking to a few people behind

1226
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:25,358
the scenes and i won't reveal any names

1227
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,799
but a few people have said to me that um

1228
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,119
they're they're a little bit i don't

1229
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,039
want to say ticked off but like you know

1230
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,318
they've got their kind of grievances

1231
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,599
around the fact it's called lumper's

1232
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,199
headband because apparently there was a

1233
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,160
lot of people who had it before lumper

1234
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,519
did and to me part of me feels like well

1235
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,759
i mean if he just stepped up to the

1236
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,599
plate and said this is my headband it's

1237
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,520
called lumper's headband then it's just

1238
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,880
kind of okay he got in first how do you

1239
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,800
feel about that like if someone named

1240
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,318
australian after themselves if it was

1241
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,440
given to them by someone you know what i

1242
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,119
mean like there's lots of other people

1243
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,039
who've got it

1244
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,280
um i you know lupus really didn't name

1245
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,559
it after himself he was on he was on a

1246
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,920
thc farmer a lot and um

1247
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,199
a lot of people just referred to because

1248
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,960
he was showing off this cut he had

1249
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,239
called headband his name was lupa on the

1250
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,838
thing and people started referring to

1251
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:11,358
his lupus headband and he just went with

1252
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,599
it um not the best choice really but

1253
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:16,159
it's also not the same headband that was

1254
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,000
around before it and i think that's been

1255
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:21,118
fairly established that it's an og kush

1256
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,838
cut um it's not the original headband

1257
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,440
but it was an early cut that he called

1258
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,679
headband

1259
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,119
there's a lot of origin stories on it

1260
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:30,879
that have popped up from him

1261
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,680
specifically

1262
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,680
um i i

1263
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,279
he says it came from new york out of

1264
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,358
someone's pocket someone smuggled that

1265
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,359
out of a room that's one of the stories

1266
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,318
and there's a few other stories that it

1267
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:47,519
was just from someone's [ __ ] room

1268
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:49,358
in a in somewhere up in norcal

1269
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,280
you know so it's

1270
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:53,679
you know there's a few origin stories on

1271
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,280
it it's a it's one of the best og kush

1272
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,960
cuts out there i think right up there

1273
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,720
with triangle so that that is uh

1274
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,639
that's that's for sure we know that for

1275
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,279
sure but it is an og kush gut it is not

1276
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:08,400
a a traditional headband in the sense of

1277
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,880
a northern light super skunk type line

1278
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,200
yeah certainly i feel like um whenever

1279
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,358
you smell it you can smell that og nose

1280
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,399
on it right oh yeah yeah it's one of the

1281
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,559
heaviest like soapy noses you can get

1282
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,160
yeah yeah cool cool it's actually i

1283
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,000
swear it's one of my favorites and i

1284
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,679

person that it landed at they didn't

1297
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,519
really know how to look after plants and

1298

me another photo while i was still in

1303
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:02,838
the states and it was dead and i was

1304
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,839
like

1305
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:08,480
[ __ ] that sucks dude yeah the one thing

1306
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:11,599
the best advice i will give someone if a

1307
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,240
cut is uh magically magic through the

1308
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,318
air to someone immediately get it and

1309
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:17,759
either stick it in a cube in a dome

1310
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,679
because it's coming out of a hundred

1311
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,720
percent humidity whether you realize it

1312
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,879
or not it's you have to re-harden it off

1313
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,078
or stick it in a cup of water that's it

1314
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,079
that's all you have to do is stick it in

1315
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,160
a [ __ ] cup of water let it sit

1316
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,400
there for two days harden off

1317
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:34,399
then then start rooting it you know um

1318
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,079
that's that's the best advice i can give

1319
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,838
anyone in that situation because that

1320
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,800
[ __ ] sucks when you get something super

1321
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,639
rare that's so hard to get over anywhere

1322
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,920
you know and and just to watch it die

1323
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,440
i've had it happen so many times over

1324
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,880
the years and that's been the the major

1325
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,400
fix for it

1326
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,640
oh man thank you i'll uh if any cuts uh

1327
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,920
what is it

1328
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:57,838
transcentiate themselves over here we'll

1329
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,838
uh we'll see if we'll see if that works

1330
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,719
recently on your instagram i mean you're

1331
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,640
talking about the the true headband

1332
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,118
lineage being like that nl super skunk

1333
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,960
hybrid i saw you made that post about

1334
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,480
one of your friends who was running the

1335
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,480
jesus ones

1336
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,838
and they had got like that recessive

1337
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,519
super skunk fino made me think to myself

1338
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,039
where is the real super skunk you know

1339
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,480
people talk about it but does it

1340
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:21,358
actually still exist

1341
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,318
no

1342
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:26,960
um for all intents and purposes as far

1343
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,559
as we know it is dead that doesn't mean

1344
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,559
that someone doesn't have it tucked away

1345
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,039
but it's not accessible to anyone that

1346
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,440
we know of and no one we know um in our

1347
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,199
little circles holds it and i think our

1348
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,639
circles are pretty pretty complete right

1349
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,159
now with people that had it back then

1350
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,960
we're all friends and

1351
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,399
yeah we it's the the and it was actually

1352
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,079
i thought it was a jesus one but it

1353
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,639
turned out it was my skunk spray cam

1354
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,560
which is diesel crossed a sour dub um so

1355
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,279
even in that hybrid it expressed itself

1356
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,679
purely as the mass super um it came out

1357
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,079
skunk spray smelling and

1358
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,960
it's it's the legit real deal

1359
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,160
pheno of super skunk as as it was and

1360
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,199
that's pretty amazing because i was

1361
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:04,639
worried that it would just be the

1362
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,879
structure and look but not have the

1363
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:10,000
smell you know the high all that stuff

1364
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,838
so um yeah it's cause caused quite a bit

1365
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,679
of hubbub and and a lot of the original

1366
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,920
dudes that ran the super skunk you know

1367
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,199
want it they want it back you know so i

1368
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,800
think that's cool it's cool for the

1369
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,199
person that bought the seeds and popped

1370
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,880
them um it's you know it's his way to

1371
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:26,078
make them make his mark on the community

1372
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,480
and rightly so he he popped those seeds

1373
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,240
he kept it alive he did all that and he

1374
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,440
should be able to make profits off that

1375
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,919
you know

1376
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,720
for sure and so i mean the super skunk

1377
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,318
it's such a fabled strain and

1378
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,078
yet it's there's still so much

1379
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:42,000
uncertainty around it and my biggest

1380
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,920
question is what are the genetics you

1381
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,440
know we've heard from skunk va that he

1382
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,480
thinks it was like you know maybe like

1383
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,480
an original skunk f2 type of thing but

1384
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,079
then also you know you've got like the

1385
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,318
the actual genetics which is like an

1386
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,318
afghan cross skunk type of thing where

1387
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:58,800
do you sit on this one

1388
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,239
um it's absolutely in a hundred percent

1389
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,160
my opinion based on running all the old

1390
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,598
super skunks it is just a super skunk

1391
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,440
afghani afghan tea which i don't believe

1392
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,880
like neville said i do not believe that

1393
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,440
it was from maple leaf indica i think it

1394
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,160
was an afghani one crossed the skunk one

1395
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,679
and it it has some skunk traits uh skunk

1396
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,440
one traits but it does not have skunk

1397
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:19,279
one terps because i think the biggest

1398
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,159
confusion is that skunk one is nothing

1399
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:26,319
like what we know in america as skunk

1400
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:27,598
smelling um the american skunk being a

1401
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:29,679
little animal

1402
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,359
what it sprays smells nothing like skunk

1403
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:32,719
ones skunk ones the the furthest

1404
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:35,358
expression or closest expression to

1405
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:35,358
skunk would be

1406
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:50,558
what he was available with wasn't going

1407
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,960
to be skunk spray smelling but it was

1408
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,720
the skunk old skunk one and i think a

1409
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,000
lot of assumptions were made on that by

1410
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:59,439
the people buying the seeds because they

1411
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
weren't educated and uh yeah

1412
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,200
but with that said that afghani one of

1413
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,440
all the breeding that i've done with

1414
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:10,399
afghani one the laf old laffy cut um

1415
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,318
it that is a baseline like no other it's

1416
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,039
very similar to that heirloom afghani

1417
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,960
line that i have that's caused a lot of

1418
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:21,199
commotion with all of its skunk traits

1419
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,280
and and burnt rubber and and piss in it

1420
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,919
yeah okay i mean you bring up a really

1421
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,319
interesting point there with that laffy

1422
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,240
i mean the lacon got a really good rap

1423
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:32,159
on its first release and i was always

1424
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,479
told that that was because they had the

1425
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,639
real cut that first time

1426
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,719
where is that cut now do you reckon

1427
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,318
i i think it's dead i don't know um

1428
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:41,838
there's a cut going around that looks

1429
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:43,599
like bubba

1430
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:45,519
that is not the original i still have

1431
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,318
pictures of the original and it's

1432
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:52,800
identical to the scentsy seeds afghani

1433
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:55,279
one um i uh there's a catalog from 1999

1434
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,039
and if you look in in that catalog uh

1435
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,880
from scentsy seeds you can see a picture

1436
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:02,239
of the afghani one and it is literally

1437
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,760
identical to that picture um that clone

1438
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,078
that's been long gone for me the last

1439
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,839
person i gave it to was walking dude and

1440
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,400
i traded it to him for the hayes

1441
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:12,000
brothers cali kush and he has since

1442
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,480
passed away he was one of me and sonny

1472
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,440

tga in just a minute but let's uh let's

1474
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,079
wrap up this one first so yeah jumping

1475
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:16,558
back to the roadkill or you know those

1476
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,440
kind of skunk spray smells it's it's a

1477
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,440
focal point of many people's phenohunts

1478
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,000
what have your views on this mythic

1479
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,280
strain change since we last spoke like i

1480
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,199
mean i know that

1481
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,800
a lot of people have the view that your

1482
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,719
skunk spray afghani is one of the

1483
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,519
closest things we've got to it do you

1484
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:35,358
think we'll eventually nail it down

1485
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:37,920
yeah yeah i see no reason we can't you

1486
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,078
know i mean i think uh i nailed it down

1487
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,000
in the diesel sour dub there's skunk

1488
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,480
spray total skunk spray coming out of

1489
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,960
that um and i did it with the heirloom

1490
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,719
afghani line and i and i truly believe

1491
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,679
that heirloom afghani line is either an

1492
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,679
afghani one or uh afghani ones super

1493
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,000
skunk hybrid or just super skunk one of

1494
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,598
the three um when i was given to me by

1495
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,599
bite me he didn't tell me anything other

1496
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,119
than it's an afghani and i asked him

1497
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,800
well which afghan he said well there was

1498
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,640
a lot of afghani one going around at the

1499
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,720
time it was uh late 80s early 90s so

1500
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,719
that's when he was popped he kept those

1501
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:11,439
seats for a long time only a few pop for

1502
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:14,399
me

1503
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,838
um the male i wish i would have kept him

1504
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,160
and the female was killed again by

1505
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,639
mooney moon dog so now we're doing a big

1506
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,719
hunt through the s-ones uh me and my my

1507
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:25,039
partner skunk tech are doing that

1508
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,598
and and i gave some to friends too for

1509
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,880
them to use because i don't believe that

1510
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,359
that

1511
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,280
i own that really you know

1512
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,199
i found it it doesn't have anything to

1513
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,359
do with me other than i made s-ones of

1514
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,558
it but i think that it should be shared

1515
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:40,000
with the community because a lot of

1516
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,920
people are looking for it so i've given

1517
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,199
it out to like my buddy pipsweed el jefe

1518
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,880
there's a lot of people who've gotten

1519
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:51,039
the afghani for me um for free just to

1520
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,119
bring it back into modern lines and work

1521
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,279
in all these different directions i know

1522
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,119
my buddy surfweed also did that crossed

1523
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,480
it to my banana tie

1524
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,599
crossed it to a bunch of stuff old

1525
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,920
family purple from caleb so yeah yeah

1526
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,240
it's there um and i think people can

1527
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,680
find it dude just by running running

1528
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,679
even jesus ones or

1529
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
old chem s-ones um you're not finding it

1530
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:15,519
necessarily in the chem 91 you're

1531
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,400
getting more of the burnt rubber kemi

1532
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:18,079
stuff

1533
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,440
but you can find it in old super skunk

1534
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,240
lines if you can trace an old super

1535
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,639
skunk line or old afghani one line

1536
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:27,358
yeah of course and so are you of the

1537
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:29,358
opinion that the road kill per se at

1538
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:32,480
least in the way people talk about it

1539
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:34,318
was not necessarily one specific cutting

1540
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,920
but just more maybe like a general

1541
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:38,400
terpene profile or do you think it very

1542
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,079
much was one very specific thing

1543
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,440
oh no i think it was just people were

1544
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,119
getting afghani it was the first time

1545
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,720
they were experiencing afghani which

1546
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,640
started um

1547
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,480
talking to seattle northern lights greg

1548
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,159
he was saying that that northern lights

1549
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,760
afghani which was called this or the

1550
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:53,598
steve murphy afghani that was used in

1551
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,119
northern lights came in the early 80s

1552
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,960
and that's always been my contention the

1553
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,440
earliest you'll ever see in afghanistan

1554
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,760
1978 roughly

1555
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,838
maybe the earliest of one person might

1556
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,079
have had it would be 76 but you don't

1557
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,880
see anything earlier than that

1558
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,559
so during that era afghanis started to

1559
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,000
disperse and people were used to

1560
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,000
colombian gold

1561
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,838
you know they were used to mexicans once

1562
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,440
that afghanis started spinning around

1563
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:19,119
and people in america that were used to

1564
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,318
smelling skunks they started calling it

1565
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,000
skunk

1566
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,480
i'm not sure that roadkill skunk was

1567
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,838
ever a term used back then it was more

1568
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,599
of a term used in uh referring to what

1569
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:30,480
had been around back then and had been

1570
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,640
lost

1571
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,159
and referring to many different

1572
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:38,318
phenos of an afghani type plant

1573
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:39,759
so you just mentioned skunk tech is

1574
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:41,920
someone who you're currently working

1575
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,599
with would you be willing to share any

1576
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,599
little secrets in terms of what we might

1577
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,920
be able to expect from you guys

1578
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,359
oh yeah um yeah skunk's one of my best

1579
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,880
friends we have all the shirts that

1580
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:53,199
we've been releasing

1581
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,240
so i've been going back and uh

1582
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:59,519
buying up all the old um

1583
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:02,879
i guess you uh thermal transfer shirts

1584
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:05,358
from the 70s and 80s and i've been going

1585
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,400
back buying them up and

1586
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:08,000
bringing them

1587
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,720
back like because there's some beautiful

1588
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,119
old colombian gold art acapulco gold art

1589
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,480
lebanese red art all this stuff and so

1590
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,280
we've been working together on that he

1591
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,920
has a beautiful like 45 000 t-shirt

1592
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,640
printing machine that does the best

1593
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,358
t-shirt prints i've ever seen and better

1594
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:27,118
than even hand screening and uh so we've

1595
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:29,119
been putting those out slowly but surely

1596
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,960
and people are catching on to that

1597
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,318
but yeah we're also doing pheno hunts

1598
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,000
big fino hunts through a lot of

1599
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:35,358
different things like like my heirloom

1600
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,199
afghani

1601
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:40,400
we're going to help reproduce high-end

1602
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:42,000
lonesomes appalachia f2s together

1603
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,160
actually it would be f3s that we're

1604
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,480
going to be working on

1605
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:49,039
yeah we have a lot of projects

1606
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,599
i might be moving up to livermore by him

1607
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,279
so we can continue to actually

1608
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,960
have him be part of riot seeds and

1609
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,640
that's that's the ultimate goal

1610
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,960
i've never really had a partner in riot

1611
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:02,318
seeds that that is that established i've

1612
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,838
had a lot of people work with me on a

1613
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,239
lot of different things and there's a

1614
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,000
lot of people in riot seats but as a

1615
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:09,358
direct partner in right ct would be the

1616
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,199
first

1617
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:13,598
yeah exciting times

1618
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:15,199
yeah man you uh you raised a really good

1619
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,640
point about how you know you guys are

1620
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:18,558

1621
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:21,199
to be working with that something i've

1622
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,640
noticed and it is you know i mean i'll

1623
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:24,639
take it with a grain of salt because the

1624
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:27,199
australian scene it's so in its infancy

1625
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:28,960
in every way basically but sure i've

1626
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:31,118
noticed that there's certain people and

1627
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,720
it's probably the same internationally

1628
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,720
they just can't seem to find like they

1629
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:36,399
can't phenoh hunt on a very rudimentary

1630
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,719
level like they pop seeds and they can't

1631
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,240
really discern the keeper it sounds like

1632
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:41,439
a bit of a foreign concept but i

1633
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:42,798
legitimately find it like they're

1634
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,798
popping seeds and they've never got

1635
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:45,599
anything to offer back and it's not that

1636
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:47,119
like

1637
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,440
i don't think it's the case that there's

1638
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,119
no keepers in the packs because you pop

1639
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,159
a pack from a reputable breeder you're

1640
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,400
pretty much always going to find

1641
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,598
something worthy of hanging around so my

1642
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,680
question is

1643
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,200
how do people pop seeds and not find

1644
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:01,440
keepers

1645
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:04,159
i think okay in order to find a true

1646
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,519
keeper you you one have to run the seed

1647
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:07,199
but you should probably run a clone of

1648
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:08,798
it as well to see how it continues to

1649
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:09,759
express in clone form because it's

1650
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:12,079
always going to be different than the

1651
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,839
seedling secondly you have to have your

1652
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,519
environment at least dialed in enough to

1653
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:17,440
be able to see that phenotype expressed

1654
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,838
at its highest value and i think that's

1655
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,920
where a lot of it occurs man like it's

1656
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:24,639
again in australia it's in its infancy

1657
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,559
um indoor growing is is a lot different

1658
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,719
you know i mean that's probably a newer

1659
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,400
idea in australia because so many people

1660
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,000
grow in the bush out there you know a

1661
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,599
lot of people grow outdoors out there so

1662
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,760
indoor growing is a lot different than

1663
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,440
outdoor growing and to get these these

1664
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,640
things to express at their best value

1665
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,798
you have to be able to grow in your

1666
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,318
environment at its best and i think

1667
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:43,920
that's why they're not finding these

1668
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:45,759
keepers like they're thinking oh damn

1669
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,519
this [ __ ] sucks and it's like

1670
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,200
it's because it wasn't super happy a lot

1671
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,639
of this stuff a lot of the best stuff's

1672
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,318
coming from the us

1673
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:54,000
and it's being bred in the u.s it's

1674
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:55,838
acclimated to the u.s so when you bring

1675
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,838
it to a foreign environment you have to

1676
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,078
acclimate it you have to acclimate it

1677
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,078
and that's another big part of it um you

1678
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,480
know it may hurt right away when it when

1679
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,599
it hits uh the australian climate and

1680
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,119
and that's to be expected with cannabis

1681
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,559
so acclimation's a big thing and a lot

1682
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,559
of people don't understand that part of

1683
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,480
it

1684
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,359
yeah definitely seems like a very valid

1685
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,159
point

1686
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:19,838
so a while back we had a breeder steve

1687
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:22,239
on the show it was a really good episode

1688
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:24,639
in my opinion he discussed this idea of

1689
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:26,798
how when he was looking to find keeper

1690
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,960
females to breed with he would grow them

1691
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,880
outside like two or three times and just

1692
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,798
be culling the females away until he's

1693
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,559
left with like the best ones and then he

1694
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:36,960
would take him indoors and then do the

1695
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,319
same thing again and so at the end of it

1696
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,159
all he'd have like this female that

1697
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,880
performed well outside perform well

1698
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:45,039
indoors all ticks all the boxes

1699
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,200
and as a result a lot of people make the

1700
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:49,679
comment that like yeah he's some of his

1701
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,960
strains you'd run him outside and people

1702
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:53,358
wouldn't be able to tell whether it was

1703
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,119
indoor or outdoor wheat and that that

1704
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:56,639
seems to make a lot of sense to me do

1705
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,039
you think that there might be a push to

1706
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,199
kind of do that type of more extensive

1707
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,039
pheno hunting and breeding going forward

1708
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,919
for a lot of breeders um i think it's a

1709
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,920
smart idea breeder steve's obviously a

1710
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,079
legend in the community and shout out to

1711
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,760
kootenay i see mag his original breeding

1712
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,640
partner [ __ ] dude is so cool so cool

1713
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,240
um

1714
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,400
yeah you know one of my favorite strains

1715
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,039
is the blue satellite blue satellite

1716
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,358
number one i think that's a a very

1717
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:27,119
special special breeding project um that

1718
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:29,039
they did and i think steve hat he's he's

1719
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,559
and kootenay for that for that matter

1720
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,639
are were well ahead of their times in

1721
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,480
doing all that kind of stuff i think

1722
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,558
it's the smart idea

1723
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,240
me i'm not as i'm not as geared towards

1724
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,000
outdoor growing so i probably won't do

1725
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,399
that um

1726
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,880
my all my lines are tested and run

1727
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,480
indoors by me and i don't have outdoor

1728
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,480
space so i don't know that i'll be doing

1729
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,559
that maybe in the future i'll get bigger

1730
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,318
spaces and whatnot and do it but until

1731
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,760
then but i think it's a great idea

1732
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:54,880
because there is that outdoor seed

1733
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,599
demand

1734
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,599
all over the world

1735
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:01,679
of course so

1736
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,119
just to change topics for a minute

1737
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:04,879
just uh

1738
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,160
i'm always interested in hype strains

1739
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,160
i'm always interested in what's ahead of

1740
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,519
the curve not because i get super caught

1741
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,719
up in the hype strains like you're not

1742
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,280
going to see me cruising around in a

1743
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,679
skittles t-shirt but at this

1744
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,440
but at the same time like i i find it

1745
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:19,440
very interesting you know it's like uh

1746
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,880
like markets and the way they behave

1747
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,720
it's it's really interesting to me so

1748
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,920
basically here's the question

1749
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:28,639
gmo's had its run it's done well then we

1750
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,440
moved on to max next what's next

1751
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:32,798
unfortunately the wave has been cheese

1752
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,798
that i've been seeing that people are

1753
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:35,838
asking most about in my live feed i have

1754
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,239
a um

1755
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,480
it's got an okay following you know like

1756
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,479
it's it's it's small but it's building

1757
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,240
um but i do get a lot of questions from

1758
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,318
a lot of people and the cheese has been

1759
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,078
the one that's like no please don't

1760
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,558
bring that [ __ ] back please i mean it's

1761
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,318
it's okay uk guys love it but for a

1762
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,160
while everything was [ __ ] cheese

1763
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:56,318
everything like and and i've already

1764
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:57,838
seen that happen and i did never thought

1765
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:59,519
i'd be around for the resurgence of

1766
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:01,440
cheese i thought it would be at least 20

1767
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,599
years but that shit's coming back

1768
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,798
and in full form um

1769
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,559
definitely that's one of them um

1770
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:10,480
i think there's going to be a resurgence

1771
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,920
with stuff like the nl5 haze you know i

1772
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,798
mean i like i was talking about earlier

1773
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,798
with you uh before the show nl5 haze

1774
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,960
seems to be peaking people's interest

1775
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:22,719
that was the most uh

1776
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,798
grown strain in the 90s was nl5 hayes

1777
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,959
yeah most certainly and i mean you know

1778
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:28,400
our most recent guest ak bean brands

1779
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,920
actually no sorry second most recent

1780
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,160
karma was on yeah you know he spoke

1781
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,318
about that tkno5 haze and a lot of

1782
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,558
people's ears perked up to that have you

1783
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:38,639
heard much about that one at all

1784
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:41,440
um yeah uh there's been there's been

1785
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,719
some interesting thoughts on that tknl5

1786
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,280
haze um

1787
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:47,358
i am a big fan of ak bean brains he just

1788
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,960
sent me you know the rest of the catalog

1789
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:51,679
some of his blueberry work i'm running

1790
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:54,079
his uh blueberry cut which is very very

1791
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,440
interesting it reminds me a lot of blue

1792
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,640
dream in the sense of the smells that

1793
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,480
are coming out of it minus the

1794
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:01,199
trapinoline not as much of the menthol

1795
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,358
but it's like a sour blueberry

1796
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,679
it's weird it's really good it has some

1797
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:07,440
autoflowering traits in it which i i've

1798
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:08,798
been able to kind of push back but i'm

1799
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,079
not sure how it's going to breed in the

1800
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,318
future with it

1801
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,760
he's a very very cool [ __ ] dude

1802
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:15,679
though

1803
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,039
yeah definitely he's certainly a very

1804
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:18,960
genuine guy and i just wanted to say

1805
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,559
before i forget you're being very humble

1806
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,240
about your live streams i think they're

1807
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,920
phenomenal and people should get in on

1808
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,598
them whenever they can i certainly try

1809
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,280
to um

1810
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,039
with that being said

1811
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,280
i wanted to bring it up before i forgot

1812
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,720
i mentioned mac a second ago

1813
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,160
let's talk about

1814
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:37,919
caps colombian give me the low down

1815
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:40,719
so there before i talk about is

1816
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,680
colombian um one of the things that moon

1817
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:45,519
had had killed was his uh colombian

1818
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,519
cross to neville's haze

1819
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,759
and i you know it was clearly labeled on

1820
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:52,000
the plants i had a bunch of them

1821
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,000
sent them over when i got it back in the

1822
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,318
bag of liquid it was labeled caps

1823
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,480
colonial so all of me and my friends all

1824
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,838
refer to it as caps colonial from now on

1825
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,119
because it was such a joke that they

1826
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:03,599
couldn't even

1827
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:06,160
keep the name straight on what [ __ ] was

1828
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:09,200
um the colombian you know

1829
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:10,960
i like cap and again very nice guy

1830
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:13,519
i get along with him i like a lot of

1831
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,318
points he makes about our industry

1832
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:17,838
the mac one cut is very very good it's

1833
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:19,838
not great for taking pollen but for

1834
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:21,838
smoke people love it and it's it's very

1835
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,078
resinous i think the reason it can't

1836
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:26,719
take pollen is because it's so resinous

1837
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,640
and it puts so much of its um energy

1838
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,519
into building resin

1839
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,598
that and and yield that it doesn't focus

1840
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:35,440
at all on pistola production it's a

1841
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,880
really weird thing but um yeah it

1842
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,838
doesn't take pollen at all i found that

1843
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:43,039
myself um as far as the colombian in it

1844
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:45,038
he's he specifically said they were the

1845
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:48,079
colombian was from seeds that he got

1846
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:50,160
while he was in colombia

1847
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,359
he also said it was a nine week strain

1848
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,598
which

1849
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,000
most people like myself that have grown

1850
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,400
a lot in a lot a lot of heirloom

1851
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,880
colombian lines they're usually you know

1852
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,639
21 plus weeks sometimes sometimes

1853
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,440
they're as low as 14 if it's a worked

1854
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:09,118
american line version of it um i've seen

1855
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:11,519
it down as low as 11 with the uh

1856
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:16,000
farmer's choice colombian which was a

1857
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:18,880
project across the boards in the um

1858
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,239
early 2000s um

1859
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,640
with that said i don't think it's

1860
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:25,279
colombian in it in my opinion i think

1861
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:27,358
it's uh super lemon haze to be honest

1862
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,039
with you but he says that's not the case

1863
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,759
and you know he has more experience with

1864
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,960
it obviously obviously than i

1865
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,839
so you've always got to take that into

1866
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,920
account um and it may not be that the

1867
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:40,000
actual cut has super lemon haze in it

1868
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,920
but the seed line everybody is pulling

1869
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,239
super lemon haze finos out of the the

1870
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,599
max seeds um

1871
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,239
you're not seeing a lot of keepers come

1872
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,240
out of the max seeds that were released

1873
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,318
and there were a lot sold

1874
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,719
yeah so that's that's my next exact

1875
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:57,199
question do you feel like it's the case

1876
01:04:54,719 --> 01:05:00,318
that because the mac one cutting is so

1877
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:02,000
good that people compare their keeper

1878
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:04,000
from the packs of seeds and go it's just

1879
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,920
not as good and so we don't see keepers

1880
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,920
because of that or do you think that it

1881
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,159
was just like a fluke the mac one

1882
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,159
cutting and the seed stock itself is not

1883
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,480
as good it's not a representation of the

1884
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:17,038
mach one cutting per se

1885
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:20,159
i think that seeds are probably

1886
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,400
a hybridized form of that

1887
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,399
of the line that that cutting came from

1888
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,200
and whatever he hybridized with it super

1889
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,880
eliminates um it you know it could be

1890
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:31,279
why it's coming out so [ __ ] because

1891
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,280
super lemon haze is it's not necessarily

1892
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,960
[ __ ] but it's it's it's not what people

1893
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,680
are necessarily looking for when they go

1894
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,720
by max seeds per se

1895
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:43,598
yeah certainly certainly so

1896
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:46,318
on that same topic how do you feel about

1897
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,720
uh late last year we saw those 100

1898
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:50,798
eighths of mac from big al and more

1899
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,639
importantly how do you feel about cap's

1900
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:55,199
response to that situation do you feel

1901
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,000
like a breeder has the right to try to

1902
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:02,078
impose some sort of structure or

1903
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,920
business structure around their strains

1904
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,440
once you let it cut out dude if you try

1905
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,639
doing that [ __ ] you're gonna catch

1906
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,720
backlash it just is what it is um people

1907
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:12,480
have again

1908
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:13,919
something's only worth what people are

1909
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,519
willing to pay for it if people are

1910
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,000
willing to pay for it that's what it's

1911
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:20,639
worth and if that worked for that dude

1912
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,119
big day out then that's fine you know um

1913
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:25,838
that's how it works uh

1914
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,358
cap's new to that aspect of it and and i

1915
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:29,358
understand he wants to protect his

1916
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:30,318
breeding rights and protect the plant

1917
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:32,078
that he

1918
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:34,318
so

1919
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,200
hardly worked on um

1920
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:37,199
that

1921
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,879
you know it's it's his first reaction to

1922
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:40,639
say you can't do you can or can't do

1923
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,720
this with it you can or can't do that

1924
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:44,639
with it and that's cool if people you

1925
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,000
know respect that and want to respect

1926
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,598
his wishes but they're always going to

1927
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,239
be the outliers that don't respect his

1928
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:53,200
wishes at all and trying to hold them to

1929
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,719
a standard in a black market is is not

1930
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:57,038
going to happen

1931
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,199
this is the black market man you can't

1932
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,520
do that [ __ ] and granted there is a

1933
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,639
legal market to speak of but

1934
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:06,318
i don't know much about that [ __ ]

1935
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,798
we don't take kindly to those folks

1936
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:08,798
around here

1937
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,760
yeah so i mean it's interesting you

1938
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,838
raised the point like the idea of

1939
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,520
middlemen you know and i had a chat to

1940
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,440
al and he seemed like a really

1941
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:19,440
reasonable guy and he mentioned how you

1942
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,720
know like he's been growing for years

1943
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,880
and he doesn't really grow so much

1944
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:24,639
anymore he's like a middle man now and

1945
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,559
it raised this idea to me because it's

1946
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:27,598
like i mean burn is kind of the same

1947
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,000
thing right like you know he's not

1948
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,680
really a grower but um

1949
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,358
you know i just wonder how the scene is

1950
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:36,558
going to evolve where we've now got you

1951
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:38,400
know like these exclusive hype men

1952
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,559
yeah um

1953
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,280
you know with uh with the generation

1954
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:45,200
that i'm from we didn't really have that

1955
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,039
breeders either hyped their own strains

1956
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,118
or the strains hyped themselves you know

1957
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,880
it was one or the other and usually the

1958
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,640
people that were hyping their own [ __ ]

1959
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,160
if it turned out to be [ __ ] you were

1960
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:55,679
tossed from the community or you were

1961
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,239
made to look like a jackass and no one

1962
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:01,038
talk to you swerve for example total

1963
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,879
jackass and uh constantly posting on

1964
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,200
instagram that he gets no respect but

1965
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,039
that's why he gets no respect because he

1966
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:09,519
acted like that he was he was trying to

1967
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,200
be his own hype man he was he was

1968
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:13,440
not necessarily moral with how he

1969
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:16,000
treated people and dealt with people um

1970
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,759
and that was a a really good example of

1971
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,079
of how that was dealt with in the old

1972
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:22,319
days now with the modern age

1973
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:24,559
younger people associate weed with

1974
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,880
rappers rappers are always rapping about

1975
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,839
weed they're the perfect

1976
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,798
middleman hype man for this generation

1977
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:32,880
um

1978
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:35,039
and in trying to educate them is really

1979
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,480
hard we saw that with seth rogen not too

1980
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:37,519
long ago there was a lot of pushback

1981
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,399
with him

1982
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,480
he came out with house plant and uh

1983
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:44,559
and started calling like chem 91 house

1984
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:48,000
plant sativa which was just on so many

1985
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:50,319
levels insulting to so many people um

1986
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,560
not not only was it spelled weird it was

1987
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,480
not supposed to be a sativa in the first

1988
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,960
place um

1989
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,718
all kinds of [ __ ] with that but he has a

1990
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,119
massive pull from the entertainment

1991
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:03,119
community and people look up to him as a

1992
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:04,798
a comedian who smokes a lot of weed and

1993
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:07,119
as a famous person he must know good

1994
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,198
weed that's that's where it goes um

1995
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:12,238
again but he's not a grower he's not a

1996
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:13,678
breeder he's a glorified hype man and

1997
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,678
it's going to be interesting to see how

1998
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,359
that direction goes if it changes if

1999
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,640
people choose to educate themselves or

2000
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,798
if they just buy into the hype and

2001
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,719
that's where it goes and and it's ruined

2002
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:25,119
for good

2003
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,359
yeah of course i mean it was just

2004
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:30,238
earlier i think today maybe yesterday

2005
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,838
that uh shibinsky made a post about how

2006
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:35,198
there was like a ride up in i think it

2007
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:37,519
was an la magazine and it and it used as

2008
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,919
like it it referenced the amount of

2009
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,960
times he had been name dropped in rap

2010
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,000
songs

2011
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,039
as like as like a metric for how popular

2012
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,838
he was

2013
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:47,600
and

2014
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,359
on the one hand you're kind of like okay

2015
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,880
it's undeniable things are becoming more

2016
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,640
accepted and mainstream but at the same

2017
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,319
time i just got such a weird feeling

2018
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,400
about it it was like like how is that a

2019
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:59,198
metric for anything

2020
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:02,639
yeah it's really not but he's not

2021
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:05,279
he's not uh someone that's in any kind

2022
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,159
of circle of real growers and real

2023
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:10,719
breeders um so maybe that's his personal

2024
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:12,399
metric for success i mean he's always

2025
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,319
about the followers how many followers

2026
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:16,479
you get and [ __ ] and then you'll see you

2027
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:17,599
know people who are breeders that are

2028
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:19,119
private

2029
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,960
and there's a reason for that because we

2030
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:24,399
want our followers to equate to real

2031
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,399
real world sales we care about that um

2032
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:28,960
it's just a different world man like

2033
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,960
where where social media is is a base

2034
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,640
level for a lot of people's way of

2035
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,480
looking at who's successful and the fact

2036
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,039
that you could buy followers

2037
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:39,359
is is just a another

2038
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:42,238
another tricky tool in all of that um

2039
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:44,000
shirbinski he is obviously the sherb is

2040
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:47,039
in a lot of people's strains i've worked

2041
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,399
with it um he's a very nice guy himself

2042
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,158
so i i don't want to say anything

2043
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,839
terrible about the guy he is a nice guy

2044
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,319
he's one of the few people from that

2045
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:57,199
that cookie fam uh

2046
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,880
place uh that group um that that is

2047
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:00,879
tolerable but there are some some

2048
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,239
cringe-worthy stuff that is said by him

2049
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,719
too

2050
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:06,639
yeah okay i feel you on that and i mean

2051
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,079
i definitely would love to say as well

2052
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:11,280
please come on the show shibinsky you

2053
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:12,719
know um but uh but at the same time i

2054
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:14,319
wonder where he's going to go next i

2055
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,480
wonder where cookie fam is going to go

2056
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:19,119
next because it was like you know

2057
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:21,919
sherbet cross to cookies makes gelato

2058
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:24,238
and now gelato cross some other cookies

2059
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,158
makes moki or however you want to say it

2060
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,839
biscotti it's like where do where do we

2061
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,839
go from here is it just perpetually

2062
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,600
cookies into cookies into cookies or

2063
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,920
will there ever be like some creative

2064
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,960
outcrossing i wonder

2065
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,560
uh i don't think we're gonna see

2066
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,158
anything creative come from any of those

2067
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,920
guys or that crew

2068
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:41,759
all we're seeing is muddled cookies to

2069
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,920
cookies to cookies to cookies done 90

2070
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,880
different ways and slapped with a bunch

2071
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,800
of

2072
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,640
names of [ __ ] you could buy at starbucks

2073
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,000
or somewhere else you know it's not very

2074
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,560
creative

2075
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,840
it's a lot of incestuous breeding that's

2076
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,400
going to lead to a lot of inbred

2077
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,400
depression and shitty plants eventually

2078
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,759
and people's rooms are stuck with this

2079
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:01,519
[ __ ] they're not growing anything else

2080
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,440
because it's what the the modern market

2081
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,960
wants and eventually they'll find that's

2082
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:07,039
all that they have

2083
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,520
that's all they have access to

2084
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,960
and there's nothing left for them and

2085
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,560
that's going to be a sad day for them

2086
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,000
because that's that's that's how weed

2087
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,480
gets ruined

2088
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,399
so do you think these guys have any of

2089
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:20,799
these original seeds left that could

2090
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:23,920
potentially bring to life something new

2091
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:26,480
because i mean for me i always see a pie

2092
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,480
guy what's his name powers up

2093
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:30,399
yeah lay off the caps lock homie that's

2094
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:32,879
what i'd say to him

2095
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:34,960
but he's always posting like some new

2096
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,800
strains about to drop and nothing ever

2097
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,000
drops so it's like what's the deal with

2098
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,520
that

2099
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,039
he's just trying to

2100
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,719
keep himself relevant he doesn't have

2101
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:45,840
anything to offer in fact he was the one

2102
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:47,679
that said breeding is for [ __ ] nerds

2103
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,600
and he ain't no nerd that's the guy who

2104
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,199
made the quote dude so the fact that

2105
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,199
he's talking about dropping strains and

2106
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:54,559
[ __ ] you can't have it both ways you

2107
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:56,960
can't call yourself a breeder and then

2108
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,800
say breeders are [ __ ] nerds you know

2109
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,960
um implying that you're so street that

2110
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,840
you can't breed um

2111
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,560
yeah i i yeah i don't know man all i see

2112
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,480
is bad from all that um with that said

2113
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,760
you know like i said i it was eight nine

2114
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,399
years ago when i was working with

2115
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,800
cookies um i see new companies coming

2116
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:16,319
out and using cookies still

2117
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,480
um

2118
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:20,319
it's time to it's time to expand it's

2119
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,718
time to move on you know like that's the

2120
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:24,559
way i feel maybe the market doesn't feel

2121
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,239
that way though and and that's why it

2122
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,039
hasn't moved on you know people are

2123
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:28,718
still

2124
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:31,279
new to cookies every day there's new

2125
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:33,198
smokers reading high times cookies is in

2126
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:35,439
there that's their first experience with

2127
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:38,639
something that frosty that [ __ ]

2128
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:40,319
pretty that dense and uh so yeah i don't

2129
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,239
know how long it's gonna stay around i

2130
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:44,479
would like to see a change from it but

2131
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:46,879
it but i think there are unique things

2132
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:49,359
you can do with cookies um

2133
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,039
there's unique ways to take cookies uh

2134
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:53,599
the chocolate thai cookies that i did i

2135
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:56,238
was really stoked about um that was on

2136
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,679
um who was it be real smoked some on his

2137
01:13:56,238 --> 01:13:58,399
show

2138
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,359
and

2139
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:03,039
he he expected it to be like a a and uh

2140
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:04,238
hit him like an afghani type line where

2141
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:06,158
he was waiting for it just to hit him

2142
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:08,079
right away you know and over time you

2143
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:10,319
got to see him turn into a giggly a

2144
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:12,238
giggly soul you know through it you know

2145
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:13,679
it's cool to watch but there's there's

2146
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,158
there are interesting ways to take

2147
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:19,199
cookies lines and some of us do that

2148
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:21,599
but i think the whole cookies into

2149
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,919
cookies hybrid into another cookies the

2150
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,920
gelatos the sherbs the

2151
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,840
it's just incestuous breeding leading to

2152
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,960
inbreeding

2153
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,119
depression of course

2154
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,520
so this one's maybe a bit of an extended

2155
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:35,039
one so my apologies but one thing i

2156
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,800
noticed most recently when i was in the

2157
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:39,760
states was that there's just this

2158
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,840
undeniable consumer

2159
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,679
appetite for cookies and it became most

2160
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:46,560
clear to me when i was at like this kind

2161
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,640
of farmer's swap meet and there was a

2162
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,520
jar of uh

2163
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,880
that

2164
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,719
head lumper's headband grown by um mr

2165
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,800
bob hemphill growing phenomenally thank

2166
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:59,679
you i was smoking out the whole trip and

2167
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,520
uh my homie was telling me yeah like

2168
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,359
people are only gonna pay like you know

2169
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,520
like a thousand a pound for this type of

2170
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:08,319
thing and um then next to it he has a

2171
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,600
jar of wedding cake had no terps to it i

2172
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,840
think it was like you know i mean it was

2173
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,360
grown to look nice but it didn't have

2174
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,360
you know like what you would expect of

2175
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:17,359
really high quality wheat yeah it looked

2176
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:18,719
the part but it didn't fit it and he's

2177
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:20,479
like yeah people will also pay a

2178
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,480
thousand for this and i'm like how does

2179
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:24,718
that work like anyone with a nose would

2180
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:26,319
be able to discern that the headband is

2181
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,079
way better and he just looks at me and

2182
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:29,759
he's like yeah but people have smelt

2183
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:32,079
that nose before

2184
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,480
and i was just like really like that's

2185
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:36,079
[ __ ] all this is and so like how can

2186
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:38,079
we as a community

2187
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,840
get the general public to acknowledge

2188
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:41,679
that like yeah wedding cakes well and

2189
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,560
good but you know what lumpus headbands

2190
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,560
is a [ __ ] bomb

2191
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:50,079
i think it's just through education and

2192
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:51,359
and i you know i i've been a very big

2193
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,920
pessimist that people want to be

2194
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:56,319
educated i don't think they do i and and

2195
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,920
my whole career i firmly believe that

2196
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:59,679
but then i started getting my live feed

2197
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,679
going and i see how many people are

2198
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:03,760
coming in now to learn and the only

2199
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,719
reason people come to to my life eat is

2200
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,760
because they want to learn about

2201
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,520
breeding they want to learn about

2202
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,600
strains i think that's what what's been

2203
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,360
established as a place people can come

2204
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,440
actually ask questions about breeding

2205
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:15,279
and actual breeding and learn about

2206
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,279
strains as opposed to just sitting there

2207
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:19,279
watching me dab because i'm not into

2208
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,198
that you know like i i see a lot of

2209
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,519
breeders come on do live feeds and all

2210
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:25,439
they do is dab and [ __ ]

2211
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,080
i i'm not into that that's not that's

2212
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:30,158
not what i'm about you know we all smoke

2213
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:32,559
i'm not impressing anyone by [ __ ]

2214
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:33,839
hitting the bong or dabbing you know so

2215
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,520
i want to be able to answer real

2216
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,159
questions and the fact that it's getting

2217
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,080
more and more popular every day blows my

2218
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:41,920
[ __ ] mind and it shows i'm not

2219
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:43,519
exactly right people were wanting to be

2220
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,480
educated they just didn't have anywhere

2221
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,159
to go get this education um then again

2222
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:50,158
i'm not the all-knowing narrator so i

2223
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,719
want more breeders to do what i'm doing

2224
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:54,960
i want more people that are um

2225
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,000
that have a big platform in the breeding

2226
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,520
community

2227
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,119
starting to do live feeds answering

2228
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:02,239
breeding questions and i think it will

2229
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:03,599
also show people the guys that don't

2230
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:06,000
they're not doing it because they have

2231
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,280
no [ __ ] real experience or education

2232
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,520
in any of this and they're just pulling

2233
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:11,920
the wall over your eyes so i implore all

2234
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:15,360
the breeders to do that um duke will do

2235
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,960
it you know he comes on talks um

2236
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:18,799
you know karma's done it you know

2237
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,880
karma's come on with me and talked bodhi

2238
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,560
will talk to people about breeding caleb

2239
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,880
will talk to people about breeding but

2240
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,800
there's very few people who will and i

2241
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:29,039
think that speaks volumes but people

2242
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,400
want this education let's give it to him

2243
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:32,880
the more people that are educated the

2244
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,479
more breeders doing this like it doesn't

2245
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,840
scare me for other breeders to do live

2246
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:38,718
feeds i think the more people being

2247
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,319
educated by the larger amount of us the

2248
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:42,158
better for all of us the better for

2249
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:44,880
breeding the better for cannabis the

2250
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,879
more education that goes out there

2251
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,400
and so how do you feel about the advent

2252
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,359
of kind of like

2253
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:53,039
people who will say go live with me bro

2254
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:55,439
let's settle this beef right now let's

2255
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:58,079
do it live you know it seems almost like

2256
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:01,599
reminiscent of like the the wwf you've

2257
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:01,600
been calling for for so long

2258
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,800
well you know uh one of my friends does

2259
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,199
does the whole life with me bro thing

2260
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,039
and um it's a part of his his character

2261
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:12,879
and i love seeing characters in this

2262
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,439
business i think it keeps it

2263
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,039
interesting i think it keeps it creative

2264
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,198
you know like people always looked at me

2265
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:21,039
like the villain for a long time and i i

2266
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:22,799
at first i was kind of

2267
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:24,719
i didn't love it you know it's like i

2268
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,960
don't feel like i'm a total villain but

2269
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:29,279
as i embraced it i started [ __ ]

2270
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,119
loving it dude you know and and people

2271
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:32,719
look to me to be this villainous type

2272
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:34,960
character when they get to know me they

2273
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,560
see that maybe that's not the case but i

2274
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,719
think characters make make for

2275
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,520
interesting tales and this is our our

2276
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:43,279
tale of breeding this is our era this is

2277
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,600
our tale

2278
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:48,079
so inevitably when are we gonna see the

2279
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,880
real deal weed wrestling federation

2280
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:52,640
where breeders settle beefs in the ring

2281
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,000
i've been dying for that dude i have

2282
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,480
been dying

2283
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,560
dying to do that um every time i go to

2284
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:00,718
these these events you know like people

2285
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,560
look at me and i'm short and fat like i

2286
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,640
think they think that i'm gonna

2287
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,719
not be the person that i am

2288
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,039
that i that i am on the live feed or and

2289
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,600
i'm i'm unfortunately for them i am

2290
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:14,960
every bit the same person that i pre

2291
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,760
that i that i profess to be um

2292
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,079
yeah

2293
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,760
like i you know

2294
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:21,439
i've learned that people in our

2295
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,560
community that like to act tough and

2296
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:27,119
talk tough um you saw you saw

2297
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,840
yourself at the cup you were right there

2298
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:31,840
with me as one little [ __ ] golden

2299
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,239
coast hunkered down in a corner after he

2300
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,679
got [ __ ] treated like a little [ __ ]

2301
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:38,079
you know i couldn't punch him because he

2302
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,679
was gonna sue me but it is what it is

2303
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:41,279
and that's what usually happens if the

2304
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,279
last one joint breath came up to the

2305
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,759
table acted like he was gonna get tough

2306
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:47,920
skunk tech was right in front of me um

2307
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,920
it was a pretty cute little little dance

2308
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,359
we did i took all the weapons out of my

2309
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,800
pockets laid them on the table so he

2310
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:54,639
knew that there were no [ __ ] weapons

2311
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,480
in my pockets i said bring it

2312
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,239
[ __ ] scurried away so i don't

2313
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:59,919
know if we'll ever have this event

2314
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:02,000
because so so many people are such

2315
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,600
[ __ ] and so scared to get hit but i

2316
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,520
think like we could we could sell

2317
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,520
tickets to it we could donate that to

2318
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,000
[ __ ] the money to good [ __ ]

2319
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,400
uh funds you know like i think it would

2320
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,238
be funny as [ __ ] i think it would

2321
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:16,559
get rid of a lot of the animosity in our

2322
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:18,238
community and you know i

2323
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,320
i i i'm

2324
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:22,319
pretty open to say what i feel about

2325
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:24,399
people but at the same time i realize

2326
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,799
that the the division in our community

2327
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:29,119
sucks it does suck but at the same time

2328
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,719
we have to get rid of the trash so

2329
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:34,639
before we can

2330
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:36,719
be united we have to divide and conquer

2331
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:38,079
the [ __ ] the retards and the scam

2332
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,158
artists

2333
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:42,800
i love it man first first fight i'm

2334
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:44,638
gonna be the matchmaker it's gonna be

2335
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,279
your wrestling name is the trash man you

2336
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,119
take out the trash that's right it's

2337
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:52,319
gonna be it's gonna be the trash man

2338
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:54,238
versus flat earth crew aka gate oh yes

2339
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:55,679
oh yes i'm so damn well you know i don't

2340
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:57,919
know if that one would be able to be

2341
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:01,039
public it might get a little more bloody

2342
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:03,119
than uh people would like

2343
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:06,238
uh so since our last talk have you had

2344
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:08,399
any interactions with the ggg crew

2345
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:10,479
um not really dude i haven't had

2346
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,960
interactions specifically with keyplay

2347
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:14,479
who used to be a good friend of mine

2348
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,800
many many years ago

2349
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:18,959
um i gave him his start in breeding i

2350
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,880
gave him his start uh as a company

2351
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,719
giving him a big push got him on the

2352
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,039
attitude got him in books

2353
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:27,198
um gage green for all intents and

2354
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:28,800
purposes would not be where it's at

2355
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:30,960
without that big [ __ ] push that they

2356
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,719
got for me and i'll say that until the

2357
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,719
day i die and he knows that that's the

2358
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,439
truth um

2359
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:39,520
with that said he i he won't speak to me

2360
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:42,399
last time we spoke was many many years

2361
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,760
ago and that's when he tried shaking me

2362
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:45,039
down telling me people know we're

2363
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,719
friends and they'll believe anything i

2364
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:49,519
say about you give me money and give me

2365
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:52,239
strains um that's who that dude is

2366
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:54,880
that's who he is at his base um that

2367
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:56,879
that one kid jason fong or michael

2368
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,359
whatever he calls himself now they ate

2369
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,279
the little scrawny asian brat um he

2370
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:02,639
wasn't around during all this he was not

2371
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:04,880
around he had nothing to do with

2372
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,400
anything i don't really know much about

2373
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,600
him but he seems to be the one talking

2374
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:11,519
the most [ __ ] about me and he's not

2375
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,079
it's not ideal for him to do that

2376
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,480
because he's he's all of 40 pounds

2377
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:18,079
soaking wet um

2378
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:19,678
yeah i don't have much interaction with

2379
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:21,840
them other than seeing like every once

2380
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:23,840
in a while they'll post like this seed

2381
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,639
list where things are like four thousand

2382
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,880
five thousand dollars and uh talking

2383
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,199
about flat earth and and just weird [ __ ]

2384
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,600
like that dinosaurs never existing

2385
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:35,359
um yeah i try to have as little

2386
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,520
interaction with those idiots as much as

2387
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:41,359
possible but when i'm at these events i

2388
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,360
go around looking for them just in case

2389
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,639
yeah i mean i i would i would love for

2390
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:48,079
them to tell their story so uh you know

2391
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,679
that would be an interesting one to hear

2392
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,760
but something i got to bring up you know

2393
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,399
to be fair i like i like to you know try

2394
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,320
to be fair where i can so i'd love to

2395
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:59,198
know do you agree with this kind of

2396
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:01,039
observation in that i i'm of the opinion

2397
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:02,559
that they kind of got screwed with mendo

2398
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:04,319
breath you know like at the end of the

2399
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,320
day i think it's a killer strain i

2400
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:08,319
really like it i've got some hybrids of

2401
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:10,479
it i think they're good plants but it

2402
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:13,039
seems like everyone picked up that work

2403
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:14,079
and ran with it except for them and i

2404
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:16,000
wonder

2405
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:18,000
did was that them just missing the boat

2406
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,238
on their own strain like they rarely get

2407
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,639
a mention in the genesis of it or even

2408
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:24,399
just in the context and i can't help but

2409
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,319
feel like they kind of got the short end

2410
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,920
of the stick in regards to a strain they

2411
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,439
made or do you see it a little

2412
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,119
differently

2413
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:33,839
i see a little differently because i had

2414
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:36,559
already made a strain similar to that

2415
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,159
using the og kb uh before the mendo

2416
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,920
breath was out so it was already out

2417
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:43,039
there people were using that the 26

2418
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,719
cookies um it didn't catch it did not

2419
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:46,639
catch on like their mendo breath did

2420
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,880
that's for god damn sure because mental

2421
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:50,719
breath is literally everywhere i think

2422
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,800
they dropped the ball on it i think they

2423
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:54,639
were too focused on the negative aspects

2424
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,000
and fighting with people as opposed to

2425
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,239
putting their nose to the grindstone and

2426
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,079
making it making it their legacy you

2427
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:03,039
know it was one of the few strains that

2428
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:04,800
wasn't from jojo wasn't from me wasn't

2429
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:06,880
from medic seed collection wasn't from

2430
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,639
lumpa that they weren't renaming and

2431
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,279
weren't doing that [ __ ] it was something

2432
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:13,359
that they actually made and uh yeah they

2433
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:14,559
missed the boat on it and

2434
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:16,079
that's their own fault because they were

2435
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,840
just so focused on fighting with

2436
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:19,039
everyone about it and not just that they

2437
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,079
were fighting with other people about

2438
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:22,000
flat earth they were fighting with

2439
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:24,158
people about [ __ ] that had nothing to do

2440
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,158
with anything um

2441
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:27,759
i think

2442
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:29,359
i think the reason people don't mention

2443
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,760
it is because of all their bad energy

2444
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,359
attached to it nobody wants to to bring

2445
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,920
their name up and [ __ ] because it just

2446
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:38,158
brings so many bad vibes

2447
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,840
yeah i'd have to agree for a crew that

2448
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:41,599
goes around espousing that they're all

2449
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,319
about good vibes they seem to put out a

2450
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,480
lot of negative vibes themselves yeah

2451
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:48,479
yeah and and that's that's the irony of

2452
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:50,479
it all man and that happens a lot you

2453
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:52,879
know uh people people pull the hippy

2454
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:54,158
dippy [ __ ] to try to uh because they

2455
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,000
know that catches on in the cannon

2456
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:58,319
community a lot of people are into that

2457
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
you know peace and love stuff but they

2458
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:01,759
don't really espouse it you know and

2459
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,399
then you see guys like bodhi that really

2460
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:06,400
do that are absolutely you know all

2461
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,719
about the earth and and paying attention

2462
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:10,638
to the energy of everything and and they

2463
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,480
live their life that way and and it

2464
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:14,159
shows the the amount of love that he

2465
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:15,599
gets and the amount of love that they

2466
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:17,839
don't get

2467
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,400
yeah okay so let's keep getting a bit

2468
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,199
more edgy how do you feel about breeders

2469
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:24,799
who espouse the random [ __ ] we hear

2470
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:27,198
like from gage green you know like i

2471
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:30,400
mean i read a post the other day from uh

2472
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:31,279
uh feng shen however you say his name uh

2473
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:32,399
jason

2474
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:34,719
jason

2475
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:38,399
please come on the show

2476
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,399
yeah he's coming on after this

2477
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,239
yeah so i i read a post says talking

2478
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,920
about like if you eat berries and [ __ ]

2479
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:45,919
you'll purify your lymphatic system and

2480
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,239
it can cure cancer or there's like caps

2481
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,840
famous chemtrails post how do you feel

2482
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:52,638
when people kind of take a foot off the

2483
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,560
edge with some of these claims

2484
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,800
uh you know i mean

2485
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,560
being that they claim to be breeders

2486
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,400
they should be

2487
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,800
science-driven and if you're

2488
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:04,559
science-driven you know that you know

2489
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,719
you have to go through trials you have

2490
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,080
to have things be able to be repeatable

2491
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:10,239
you have to you know i mean like there's

2492
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:12,639
a there's a method a scientific method

2493
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:15,119
for a reason and if they are breeders if

2494
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,639
they are scientists they would probably

2495
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:19,119
think a little bit more before they

2496
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:21,520
speak and and it just shows like

2497
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:23,359
it shows their competency level it shows

2498
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,880
all that [ __ ] with that said

2499
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:26,719
you know i myself

2500
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,279
have been called a conspiracy theorist

2501
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,719
by philos and many other people and in a

2502
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:32,319
sense you know i've studied a lot of

2503
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,158
that stuff but i've also studied it

2504
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:36,639
because i like to know before i speak on

2505
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:39,519
things and i mean i have my own views on

2506
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,639
[ __ ] aliens and ufos and [ __ ] but

2507
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,800
you know i don't think it really has

2508
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:45,600
much to do with breeding

2509
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:48,480
yeah of course of course so i mean final

2510
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,079
question on our friend's gauge um you

2511
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:51,759
know recently they put a post up saying

2512
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:53,679
that they had received an offer in the

2513
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,440
past for 15 million dollars for their

2514
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,440
company and they said

2515
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:58,799
they turned it down because ggg is worth

2516
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:00,559
more than that

2517
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,000
you want to uh give your interpretation

2518
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,760
of that situation

2519
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,760
those broke [ __ ] didn't get no

2520
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,520
15 million offer they would have sucked

2521
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,440
the dick of [ __ ] whoever was giving

2522
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,440
it to him i don't buy it i don't buy it

2523
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:13,439
at all nobody's giving them a 15 million

2524
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:15,119
dollar offer like from from the way

2525
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:16,638
they're charging for their strains dude

2526
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,359
and how many times they've been hit for

2527
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,520
doing illegal [ __ ] you know not just uh

2528
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,119
not just growing weed but other [ __ ] you

2529
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,920
know that they get involved with meth

2530
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:27,198
[ __ ] like that it's uh yeah

2531
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,399
you know i think they would have sold

2532
01:27:27,198 --> 01:27:30,079
out right away they don't give a [ __ ]

2533
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,759
about this community if someone offered

2534
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:33,600
him 15 million they would have done

2535
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,239
anything for it so i don't buy that [ __ ]

2536
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,000
at all but it makes a nice story it's

2537
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:40,079
it's it's trying to convince people of

2538
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,439
their value that doesn't exist there is

2539
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:46,000
that i mean people do that all the time

2540
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:47,678
yeah okay so i mean you know to kind of

2541
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,439
change to a slightly different topic

2542
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,440
given that there is this prevalence for

2543
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:52,960
people to kind of be more compassionate

2544
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:54,479
centric within our community you know

2545
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,239
like there's not a lot of purely

2546
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:58,399
businessmen within our scene at least

2547
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:59,919
not ones that are embraced how do you

2548
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:02,319
feel like breeders are going to be able

2549
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:04,319
to survive moving forward given the

2550
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,158
advent of what seems like an inevitable

2551
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,319
commercialization and like a big ag

2552
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:09,519
takeover of things

2553
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:12,319
i'm scared

2554
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:14,639
i'm scared um but those of us who who

2555
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:16,799
thrived in the black market long before

2556
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,039
all this in the early forum days and

2557
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,960
whatnot that's how we made our name you

2558
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,359
know getting on the forums passing stuff

2559
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:26,239
out um selling stuff through word of

2560
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:28,319
mouth um we'll be fine man this is how

2561
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,559
we've always rolled but with the big ad

2562
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:32,639
takeover they may take over recreational

2563
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,239
and [ __ ] but people eventually realize

2564
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,840
like there's always going to be a demand

2565
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:37,599
for quality weed and you're not going to

2566
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,279
get that from walmart weed you know what

2567
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,760
i mean

2568
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:44,319
yeah of course i mean and it raises

2569
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:47,199
another point i had about you know uh

2570
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:49,599
vape pens they're so on the rise a lot

2571
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:51,519
of people will hate on them but a lot of

2572
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,760
people will also point out that they are

2573
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,440
kind of like a stepping stone between

2574
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,600
the the connoisseur community and just

2575
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:00,000
the casual enthusiast how do you feel

2576
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,639
about the old [ __ ] sticks

2577
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,359
the whole [ __ ] sticks yeah um

2578
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,760
i don't know man i vape uh nicotine i

2579
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:09,839
don't you know so i i guess i'm kind of

2580
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,360
involved in in that kind of [ __ ] but

2581
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,639
that's just because i think cigarettes

2582
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:15,519
are stinky and i don't want to smoke

2583
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,719
them however with cannabis um yeah

2584
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,320
there's a lot of people that will do

2585
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,079
that and never smoke a joint because

2586
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,319
they still have that fear of associating

2587
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:24,000
with something like that so there's

2588
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:25,840
always going to be a demand for it and i

2589
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,520
think eventually

2590
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,279
there it will be a bigger demand for it

2591
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,719
worldwide you know the the younger

2592
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:32,158
community is going to keep going that

2593
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,079
direction and that's fine but there will

2594
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,319
always be a connoisseur community and

2595
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:37,679
those that that breed connoisseur seeds

2596
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:39,279
they're going to have to fight for those

2597
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,520
positions and the people that are

2598
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:43,599
[ __ ] not really good at breeding and

2599
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:46,320
and just preyed upon people's you know

2600
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,000
like the average high times reader

2601
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:49,679
they're uh they're gonna fall down in

2602
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,039
that market you know what i mean there's

2603
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:52,319
only gonna be a few people making that

2604
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:54,158
market and they're definitely not going

2605
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:55,279
to be anything in the connoisseur market

2606
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:57,439
those are the kind of people that are

2607
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:59,519
going to fall off and not be around but

2608
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:02,000
like people like me people like bodhi

2609
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:04,080
people like csi we're going to be around

2610
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
doing this long after the money's gone

2611
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:07,920
long after you know the interest is

2612
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,399
there this is what we do this is who we

2613
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,800
are you know

2614
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:15,839
yeah of course so around that same

2615
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:18,480
debate of the vape pens we have this

2616
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,159
like a sub debate around whether the

2617
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:22,158
introduction of cannabis-derived

2618
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:23,759
terpenes to these carts is like a good

2619
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:25,198
or a bad thing and then a further

2620
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,280
sub-debate of like well are those

2621
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:29,439
terpenes cannabis derived are they

2622
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,359
derived from other sources like natural

2623
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:32,960
sources so to speak do you have much of

2624
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:35,359
an opinion on this and i guess the very

2625
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:38,079
specific question is do you feel like

2626
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:40,000
externally added terpenes are kind of

2627
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:42,960
like detrimental to a product or like

2628
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,639
kind of reduce it from what it could be

2629
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,399
i think scientifically finding out that

2630
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,840
cannabis derived terpenes are indeed

2631
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:49,920
different than like fruit derived

2632
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,760
terpenes or from other places

2633
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,840
originally initially they said that a

2634
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,760
terpene is a terpene is a terpene right

2635
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,039
um limonene is limiting is limiting no

2636
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,079
matter where it comes from but that's

2637
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,399
not they're finding out that's not

2638
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:02,238
necessarily the case um the entourage

2639
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:05,039
effect is very real a lot of these hot

2640
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:07,599
dog carts uh the vape carts hot dog

2641
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,960
water parts whatever they're called um

2642
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,960
isn't that i think that's the nickname

2643
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,840
yeah i love it

2644
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,119
uh

2645
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,480
you know like you smoke them and you'll

2646
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:18,399
get the same high that you would get

2647
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:19,759
from say poorly extracted bho to where

2648
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:21,359
everything is stripped all the terpenes

2649
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,920
are stripped you get the same height and

2650
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:26,238
to me it's kind of speedy it's bland

2651
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:28,079
it's not it's not really super enjoyable

2652
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:30,638
the entourage effect is a real thing you

2653
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:32,880
need cannabis derived terpenes whether

2654
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:34,560
and i don't know that whether extracting

2655
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:37,199
it from cannabis and then re-adding it

2656
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,120
if there's something that is missing um

2657
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:40,960
i don't i don't know i can't speak to

2658
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,319
that i've never really

2659
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,600
i don't think a lot of these people that

2660
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:45,039
are claiming that they have cannabis

2661
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,120
derived terpenes are really going that

2662
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:49,359
route because it's cheaper to get um you

2663
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:51,439
know fruit extracted terpenes than it is

2664
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:53,679
from cannabis extracted terpenes i think

2665
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,039
most people are going the easier route

2666
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:57,279
in saying it's cannabis extracted

2667
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:59,519
because there's no way to really prove

2668
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:01,198
that you know what i mean so i think

2669
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,639
there's a lot of shortcuts being taken

2670
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:04,559
and that's just going to happen that's

2671
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:06,079
the nature of business and they're going

2672
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,480
to try to take advantage of people at

2673
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:09,679
every step to save a buck

2674
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:12,000
of course

2675
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,840
so how do you feel about the idea of

2676
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,600
some of the more well-known and let's

2677
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,800
just say accepted breeders within our

2678
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,280
community

2679
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,800
doing work for big ag because i have a

2680
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:22,719
feeling it's inevitable where someone's

2681
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,320
like oh i'm creating a hybrid that's

2682
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,198
going to be planted in fields and it's

2683
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:27,519
going to be

2684
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:29,039
you know just harvested by big combines

2685
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,560
all over the place

2686
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:32,319
do you feel like that would be a

2687
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,679
negative thing or it's kind of like hey

2688
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:35,599
we may as well meet him in the middle if

2689
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:37,679
it's going to happen

2690
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,199
oh that's such a hard one dude like i've

2691
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,760
been watching some of my friends that i

2692
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:44,238
respect slowly drift over to the

2693
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,760
corporate world and and some of these

2694
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:47,519
people are people that are that have

2695
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,679
been through the really big hardships of

2696
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,920
getting popped watching their family get

2697
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,840
thrown on the floor by dea agents you

2698
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,960
know and and uh back during the really

2699
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:58,480
illegal days watching their you know

2700
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,399
watching their family go through that

2701
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:02,959
and then finally having an avenue to not

2702
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:05,839
have to worry about that again i get the

2703
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:08,158
want for that um with that said it's a

2704
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,639
personal decision and it's definitely

2705
01:33:08,158 --> 01:33:12,719
not for me not [ __ ] for me no no

2706
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:14,800
amount of money is worth [ __ ] selling

2707
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:16,560
all my friends down and really that's

2708
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,639
what's going to happen

2709
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:21,039
you may think it's only affecting you

2710
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,800
it's only one person but if everybody

2711
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:24,479
starts making those moves it's going to

2712
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,920
start taking out a lot of your friends

2713
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:28,319
it's going to make a lot of your friends

2714
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,480
lives a lot harder um

2715
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:32,158
that that that's exactly what's going on

2716
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:34,399
with philos as we've watched it which is

2717
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:35,519
another hot button topic

2718
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:38,000
yeah okay

2719
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:40,320
so i mean just to kind of jump off the

2720
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,679
old doom and gloom big ag situation

2721
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:43,679
earlier on you mentioned when we were

2722
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:45,840
talking about the uh the the skunk spray

2723
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:47,679
afghani seeds that they were from like

2724
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:50,159
the late 80s early 90s i think you said

2725
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:51,920
from memory do you have any other stock

2726
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:54,000
left from back in that time frame that

2727
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,600
you're kind of itching to get into

2728
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,479
i have a bunch of stuff from that

2729
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,960
individual bite me um he gave me so many

2730
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:03,519
like i think 13 or 14 different things

2731
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,279
only three or four were labeled the rest

2732
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,120
are supposed to be you know colombian

2733
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:09,119
golds colombian blacks colombian reds

2734
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:10,639
colombian rainbows and then other

2735
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:12,158
nepalese different things that were

2736
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:14,719
coming down the pipe in florida during

2737
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:16,158
that era um and i have stuff from that

2738
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:18,560
i've saved from my own collection that

2739
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:20,079
i've gotten over the years but a lot of

2740
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,360
those seeds are really hard to pop so

2741
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:23,039
it's going to take tissue culture

2742
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:25,198
popping and

2743
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:26,719
that in itself has become another

2744
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:28,079
problem there's a lot of scammers in

2745
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,439
that world too

2746
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:31,198
they realize that there's money to be

2747
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:33,359
made there they realize that you know

2748
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:35,119
some breeders like me i'm not on top of

2749
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:37,198
tissue culture i i don't know that i

2750
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:39,119
don't know all the ins and outs of it so

2751
01:34:37,198 --> 01:34:40,799
it's really easy to take advantage of

2752
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:43,439
people and uh

2753
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,360
yeah and you know i hope that you know

2754
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:47,678
more people step forward finest has been

2755
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,359
really kind to me um

2756
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,800
and there's other people mike hydro is

2757
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:53,198
doing [ __ ] great work with jungle

2758
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,800
boys and tissue culture stuff

2759
01:34:53,198 --> 01:34:56,960
nice nice i mean you just mentioned

2760
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:59,119
finest i'd heard from some people that

2761
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,560
they got caught with their pants down at

2762
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:02,319
the emerald cup in terms of like some of

2763
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,239
the cuts they were selling were like had

2764
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:05,759
issues with them have you heard anything

2765
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,000
about that

2766
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,079
ah no um

2767
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,198
you know with tissue culture comes an

2768
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:14,158
issue

2769
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:15,439
that you have to use certain hormones in

2770
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:17,839
order to

2771
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,759
make them go through that process and

2772
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:22,239
some of those cuts aren't necessarily

2773
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:24,159
the best for cropping let's say you buy

2774
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:25,919
a thousand cuts just to bloom out right

2775
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:27,359
away you know from that have been tissue

2776
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:29,520
culture they've been treated with so

2777
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,279
many hormones and it takes x amount of

2778
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,960
months for that to happen to get it out

2779
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:34,399
of its system before you can bloom it

2780
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,079
and i think that's some of the issues

2781
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:38,479
they're running into i know some people

2782
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:39,519
said pm and stuff like that at the cup

2783
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:41,198
and

2784
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,840
you know when you bring

2785
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:45,039
clean clones very sterile clones into an

2786
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,600
environment where there's a bunch of

2787
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:49,439
growers walking around from their rooms

2788
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,039
you're gonna get [ __ ] i don't even know

2789
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:53,839
how people can sell clones at events

2790
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:56,479
like that and not worry about that

2791
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,400
yeah definitely feels like a good choice

2792
01:35:56,479 --> 01:35:59,678
to maybe quarantine those bad boys off

2793
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:01,599
initially

2794
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,760
yeah oh yeah yeah treat them with some

2795
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,760
micronized sulfur put them in a corner

2796
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,199
for a while treat them again

2797
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,079
figure it out before you bring them in

2798
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,359
the room

2799
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:13,679
of course of course so given so many of

2800
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:15,679
your strains have been used by other

2801
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:17,440
breeders to kind of make new lines and

2802
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:19,359
whatnot have you ever found yourself in

2803
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:21,439
a situation where you made a strain you

2804
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:22,639
released it everything's all good and

2805
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:24,479
then you kind of forgot about it and

2806
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:26,239
then someone's used it and they've made

2807
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:28,399
like a new hybrid and it's kind of like

2808
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:30,158
really got some jazz to it and you're

2809
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:31,839
like damn maybe i need to go back and

2810
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:33,279
pull out those seeds again like maybe i

2811
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,719
kind of pulled the plug on that a little

2812
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:36,399
early in terms of i should have explored

2813
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:39,039
that one a bit more

2814
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:40,719
uh you know not really i i like when

2815
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:42,079
people do that and they find their own

2816
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:43,520
special [ __ ] in it and they they

2817
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:45,359
hybridize it and find something that

2818
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,760
they love in it and at that point i'm

2819
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:49,279
usually my mindset is wow i'm glad they

2820
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,800
found something special in it i hope

2821
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,118
they take it a new direction and that's

2822
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,800
that i've left it if i've left it behind

2823
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:57,279
then i've left it behind that's that

2824
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,119
it's very rare that i pick up an old

2825
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:01,920
strain and i'm like wow there was a lot

2826
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:03,759
more in that i should have looked for

2827
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:06,239
it's very rare that that happens because

2828
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,239
i i do good i do good pops of my stuff

2829
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:08,879
to go through enough phenos to see it

2830
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:09,759
all

2831
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,600
and

2832
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,960
sometimes what they find that they love

2833
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,760
and that other people love isn't what i

2834
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,920
love so yeah um i

2835
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,280
and also i look at everybody who buys my

2836
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,158
seeds like they're investing in my

2837
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:24,880
company and i they're buying rights to

2838
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:26,799
use those lines as they see fit and you

2839
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,118
know they have the option to

2840
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,320
reproduce them if they want it's not

2841
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:32,319
necessarily going to get the best

2842
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:34,238
reaction if they're like reproducing it

2843
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:36,000
to undercut me on price and you know

2844
01:37:34,238 --> 01:37:38,399
keeping the same name and all that [ __ ]

2845
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,760
because uh it may not be a good

2846
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:42,319
representation of where i wanted the

2847
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:44,000
line to go but um

2848
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:46,079
you know it's all part of the game it's

2849
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,840
all a part of it and and i i think the

2850
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:49,840
highest honor is someone carrying on a

2851
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:52,239
strain and using it and finding

2852
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,920
something special in it that they love

2853
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:56,238
yeah of course

2854
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:59,279
would you ever consider remaking one of

2855
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:00,559
your previous strains that you maybe

2856
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,319
were kind of thinking was just going to

2857
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:04,639
be a one-off but you were like hey this

2858
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,719
is actually something special

2859
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:09,679
strawberry switchblade was one of those

2860
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:12,239
um it was one that i made as a one-off

2861
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:13,760
usually i have a direction uh and a goal

2862
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:16,158
with everything that i put in a room

2863
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:18,159
that i'm that i'm using um i don't put

2864
01:38:16,158 --> 01:38:19,519
anything in there usually for you know

2865
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:21,198
just because there's space throw it in

2866
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,960
there for shits and gigs

2867
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:24,960
but in that case that is the one time

2868
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:27,118
when i did that and it became something

2869
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,520
that people really truly loved and i

2870
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:31,359
went back worked that line um

2871
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,719
yeah that was that was an anomaly for

2872
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:34,238
sure

2873
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,000
so how would you describe your general

2874
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:37,519
approach to new projects do you just

2875
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,198
kind of everything just kind of comes

2876
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,880
organically and just like you know you

2877
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:42,960
do it yourself or do you have like more

2878
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,960
of like a methodical like a whiteboard

2879
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,719
like i'm kind of mapping things out how

2880
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:49,359
do you approach it

2881
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:51,439
dude i i have a a

2882
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:53,039
brain where everything's just chaos so i

2883
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:54,799
don't have any white boards i don't have

2884
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:57,600
any any

2885
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:59,440
any like note pads anywhere my chick's

2886
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:01,039
laughing because she knows how chaotic i

2887
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:02,479
am um

2888
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,279
yeah it's

2889
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:06,718
everything is just kind of off the cuff

2890
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:09,279
you know like i see what i have

2891
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:11,359
sometimes i'll hit uh a mental block and

2892
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:13,198
i don't do anything for a year because i

2893
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:15,359
just don't have any creative juices

2894
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,960
flowing nothing's nothing's coming from

2895
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:19,279
it and i don't like to make things just

2896
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,960
to make things you know

2897
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:23,198
yeah certainly i mean i think there's

2898
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,880
probably a few breeders who have been

2899
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:26,719
guilty of putting out some stuff that

2900
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:29,359
fits that criteria

2901
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:31,520
oh yeah i've had a lot of people message

2902
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:34,559
me asking me about

2903
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,760
why top dog as a breeder is still so

2904
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,440
popular

2905
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,199
despite the fact like a lot of the

2906
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:41,039
crosses have produced like less than

2907
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:43,678
ideal results

2908
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:45,600
and like why why does he have such a die

2909
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,279
hard fandom you know like i totally

2910
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:49,920
respect everything jj's done for the

2911
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:52,399
scene and a lot of money mike's work is

2912
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,480
really well received but it seems like

2913
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:57,279
some of you know the newest stuff put

2914
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:59,519
out by jj is a bit hit and miss maybe

2915
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:03,279
more of a miss

2916
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:05,360
you know jj's been around a long time um

2917
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:07,439
it's i think a lot of us old guys

2918
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:10,639
including myself it's it's a struggle to

2919
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:11,678
stay relevant you know um we realize

2920
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:13,760
that

2921
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:16,319
as much as we want to really you know

2922
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:18,159
work lines hard um

2923
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:20,158
take several years to work a line

2924
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:23,439
properly and release it

2925
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:25,679
that's not what the

2926
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:27,519
the community and the seed buying public

2927
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:29,118
really demands they want something new

2928
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,080
shiny in front of their face all the

2929
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:32,158
time

2930
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:34,319
so it's it's it's a struggle to stay

2931
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:35,279
relevant it's a struggle to keep your

2932
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:37,759
name

2933
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:40,000
out there and that always runs the risk

2934
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,960
of releasing something that is subpar

2935
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,719
that comes back and affects your legacy

2936
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:50,079
jj is very fortunate that he made star

2937
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:52,880
dog um he has the the i-95 um kmd kmdi95

2938
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:54,639
has been a very popular one um

2939
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,880
i've worked with this white dog which i

2940
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:58,880
think is totally underrated his ddnl

2941
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:00,000
lines his dnl releases are totally

2942
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:02,319
underrated

2943
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,960
but um yeah i think it's just like a lot

2944
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:07,920
of us old guys are trying to find

2945
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,920
a way to stay relevant in a time where

2946
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:11,920
in a time of cookies and wedding cake

2947
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,079
you know in a time of all that [ __ ] that

2948
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,840
has no interest to us at all so trying

2949
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:20,158
to to meld that into breeding that we do

2950
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:22,319
um it's hard it's hard it's it's a hard

2951
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,719
world it's a hard brutal world um you

2952
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:26,399
know he had the popularity of being at

2953
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:28,079
high times a bunch getting all these

2954
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,158
kinds of uh

2955
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:32,000
nods and stuff from high time saying you

2956
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:33,759
know best breeder of this year best

2957
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,600
breeder of that year and a lot of that

2958
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,520
was real man he was he was really making

2959
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,840
his mark on the world but with that

2960
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:42,400
comes a demand from the the seed buying

2961
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:44,000
public and new customers to on to want

2962
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:45,359
new why aren't you using the wedding

2963
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,359
cakes why aren't you using the cookies

2964
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:49,920
why aren't you using this why why am i

2965
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:52,479
having to wait for this um so yeah it's

2966
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,800
it's hard to temper those two things and

2967
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:56,479
and we're all finding our our ways of of

2968
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,520
working through it and some you know

2969
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:01,678
i've hit speed bumps i'm sure he has and

2970
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:03,520
and you know i put out stuff some people

2971
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:06,480
don't like and it is a personal

2972
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,360
perspective on it i think also

2973
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:11,039
uh jj has a lot of newer growers that

2974
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:13,118
buy his stuff that maybe aren't the best

2975
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:14,800
growers too and that's why you're not

2976
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:17,039
seeing um

2977
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,159
a majority of the stuff come out as good

2978
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:20,238
it's because

2979
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:21,599
his his clientele has changed before it

2980
01:42:20,238 --> 01:42:25,279
was a lot of breeders buying his stuff

2981
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:27,840
now it's a lot of uh modern growers um

2982
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:30,158
and and you know jj will even admit

2983
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,760
sometimes he reacts to things a little

2984
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:33,839
uh

2985
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,199
um i'm trying to think of the word for

2986
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,960
it um

2987
01:42:35,198 --> 01:42:38,638
he reacts pretty quickly to stuff and i

2988
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,920
have that same issue so i ca it's not

2989
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:42,079
like i'm throwing him under the bus for

2990
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:44,560
reacting [ __ ] like kind of hot-headedly

2991
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:46,000
um he's a passionate man so

2992
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,159
when people talk [ __ ] about what he's

2993
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,319
doing he's passionate about it and gives

2994
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:51,839
it back to him and and and of course

2995
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:53,039
with that comes backlash people don't

2996
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,600
like being talked to you like that and

2997
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:58,000
i've had that same problem myself

2998
01:42:55,600 --> 01:43:00,079
yeah i mean totally i i agree with you

2999
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,920
you know i grew out his skunk og and i

3000
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:04,479
found a keeper in there no worries but

3001
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,239
the overwhelming feedback i get is that

3002
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:07,839
people tend to be a little less than

3003
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:11,118
thrilled with some of the results they

3004
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:14,079
find and so i guess in a

3005
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:16,559
in a sense a lot of people point to this

3006
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:19,359
factor of how he doesn't keep males he

3007
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:21,440
uses like a new male every time

3008
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:23,839
so people will often reference how like

3009
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:26,079
the first star dog release was like this

3010
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:28,560
[ __ ] it was what you wanted and then

3011
01:43:26,079 --> 01:43:30,158
subsequent ones have not been as good do

3012
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,000
you feel like overall this is a good

3013
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:34,559
strategy or it might be actually working

3014
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,479
against the people employing it

3015
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,239
um you know i don't keep a lot of i try

3016
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:40,079
to keep males but i lost a lot during

3017
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:42,559
the moon thing i've lost some when i

3018
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:44,000
moved from san diego back to bakerfield

3019
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,719
um

3020
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,198
i don't keep a lot of males around long

3021
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:51,520
i i do one good run with them i'll keep

3022
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:53,678
them around just in case as best i can

3023
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:55,600
but if i don't i don't but i also take

3024
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:58,158
the time to select them which is really

3025
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,239
important um you want to you want to run

3026
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:01,599
them you you don't know if the mail is

3027
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:04,879
good or not until you run the progeny

3028
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:06,480
and that's just a fact you know

3029
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:08,000
that said i don't

3030
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:10,079
like to

3031
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,760
let's say i have bubble gum cookies and

3032
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:15,279
i use uh whatever mail for it and i then

3033
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,560
want to make bubble gum cookies because

3034
01:44:15,279 --> 01:44:18,719
it has a

3035
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,880
awesome reception and then

3036
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:22,639
put out the same name i you know i

3037
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,239
always have to denote it with a v2 if

3038
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:25,520
i'm using a different male for that run

3039
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:26,959
or you know whatever so people can

3040
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,080
differentiate between the two and don't

3041
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,039
think they're getting the same first

3042
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:30,399
product

3043
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:33,039
or um

3044
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:35,279
if it's a filial generation like an f2

3045
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:36,639
or f3 or f4 of whatever i'm doing i like

3046
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,079
to denote that so they know they're not

3047
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,719
getting the f1 and not going to see the

3048
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:42,158
same exact results that the f1 got

3049
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:43,920
i think it's important to clarify that

3050
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:45,920
kind of stuff

3051
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:48,319
yeah of course and i mean i guess a

3052
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:51,039
final little kind of question i wanted

3053
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:52,639
to tease out based around this is i'd

3054
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:53,920
heard a while back and admittedly i

3055
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:56,239
should probably just message high and

3056
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:58,719
lonesome and find out but i'd heard that

3057
01:44:56,238 --> 01:45:01,439
maybe some people from that whole new

3058
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:03,760
york crew had politely asked him

3059
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:06,559
lonesome to you know quit with these

3060
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:08,639
awesome tres dog hybrids because

3061
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,639
you know like the appalachia like the

3062
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:12,880
dog waltz they were phenomenal hybrids

3063
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:14,560
and i guess the idea was like

3064
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:17,359
you know maybe he was doing a better job

3065
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:19,119
than they were um how would you feel

3066
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:21,118
about that idea that you know maybe they

3067
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:22,799
politely asked him to stop breeding with

3068
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:23,920
that work

3069
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,000
um

3070
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,679
i know a little bit of the inside on

3071
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,359
that i don't know what hayan lonesome

3072
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:30,800
would want me to disclose because he's

3073
01:45:29,359 --> 01:45:33,759
so [ __ ] laid back he didn't give a

3074
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:35,199
[ __ ] about anything drama-wise but i do

3075
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,800
know that um

3076
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:39,759
he was asked

3077
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:42,400
to work with a certain company that you

3078
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,480
i mean that we just recently mentioned

3079
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:46,479
and he wasn't really into it just

3080
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:49,599
because he's a he's kind of a lobo he's

3081
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:53,039
a lone wolf you know um

3082
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:55,280
and that might be why

3083
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,679
they then kind of twisted the narrative

3084
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:59,359
to sound like they asked him to stop

3085
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:01,600
it was more his choice to just kind of

3086
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:03,599
walk away from everything he left

3087
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,360
he just wasn't into it he and if you

3088
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,840
noticed a lot of people thought dog

3089
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,439
waltz was jj's work a lot of people

3090
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,360
thought that for a long time and i don't

3091
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:13,118
know that anyone ever took the time to

3092
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:15,839
say no no that's not that's actually

3093
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:18,719
high in lonesomes you know um and that's

3094
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,159
that's disappointing over time but um

3095
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,399
that dude is one of the coolest

3096
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:24,319
[ __ ] i've ever met um he's a

3097
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:26,479
legit old school dude old school

3098
01:46:24,319 --> 01:46:27,359
virginia dude um

3099
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:29,919
yeah

3100
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:31,439
really cool [ __ ] and and i think

3101
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,199
i i have all the respect in the world

3102
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:35,439
for him and the fact that he asked me to

3103
01:46:33,198 --> 01:46:36,479
continue the appalachia line for him

3104
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:38,479
that was

3105
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:41,118
what an honor you know that's [ __ ]

3106
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:43,439
crazy and um i had the honor of going

3107
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:46,960
and getting him back the uh the poodle

3108
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:49,439
nuts cut of the dog waltz so yeah that's

3109
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:51,039
that's one guy i really really respect i

3110
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:53,118
don't know that they asked him to not

3111
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:55,279
work that they might have felt like that

3112
01:46:53,118 --> 01:46:56,559
and that it was showing up uh some of

3113
01:46:55,279 --> 01:47:00,079
the work that was being released with

3114
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:00,080
the trade dog and stuff like that but

3115
01:47:01,198 --> 01:47:04,719
yeah no i think i'm probably of the same

3116
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:06,638
opinion actually i think it was probably

3117
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:09,118
never expressed but they probably they

3118
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:11,600
probably felt it but um oh yeah i will

3119
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:13,679
admit you know in one of the very early

3120
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:17,520
interviews i think i attributed dog

3121
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:19,520
waltz to to mass g of all people so hey

3122
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,199
you know i'm just as guilty as every one

3123
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,199
of these things

3124
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:24,158
yeah i don't know that that g did much

3125
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:26,879
breeding

3126
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:28,638
um lots of accidents happened i'm still

3127
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,079
trying to get uh and you know match to

3128
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,079
use one of my buddies dude like we've

3129
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:33,600
been friends for a while and uh but i

3130
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:35,600
still can't get the answer from him

3131
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,199
about jesus when was it created seems

3132
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,760
like a simple answer but i cannot get a

3133
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:41,678
lot of answers out of that dude um

3134
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,119
we can't get the answers about kim d and

3135
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:44,800
why there's so many different chemd's

3136
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:46,960
that all came sourced from him there's a

3137
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,800
lot of a lot of questions that go around

3138
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,359
and because he's my buddy i don't i

3139
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:53,360
don't put the the screws to him too hard

3140
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:56,238
about it he was a young dude when all

3141
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:58,079
the chem stuff happened and i think

3142
01:47:56,238 --> 01:48:00,319
i think if people realized how young he

3143
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:02,000
was when all that happened a lot of the

3144
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:03,920
expectations that they have for how

3145
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,520
stuff was handled would go away um he's

3146
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:07,199
a super nice dude

3147
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,440
yeah a hundred percent you know shout

3148
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:11,198
out mass g and i always remind myself of

3149
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:13,919
that you know like no matter what anyone

3150
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:16,399
has to say about the story or the gaps

3151
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:18,319
in it or whatever like dude was 17 when

3152
01:48:16,399 --> 01:48:20,638
he popped the seeds like [ __ ] me when i

3153
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:22,880
was 17 i couldn't even keep a plan alive

3154
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,960
let alone exactly let alone preserve it

3155
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,000
for years so like so much credit to that

3156
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,800
guy

3157
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,238
yeah absolutely i i totally agree and

3158
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,360
you know and then there's other things

3159
01:48:30,238 --> 01:48:35,279
like certain people that were involved

3160
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:38,559
during that first transaction that hang

3161
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:40,319
around and verify people's cuts for them

3162
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,320
that really don't know [ __ ] about [ __ ]

3163
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:44,079
when it comes to the chem but have

3164
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:46,158
attached their name permanently to the

3165
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:48,399
chem and i i can't tell you how many

3166
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:50,158
people i've had coming to me saying oh

3167
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:51,519
this person verified this cup for me and

3168
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:53,679
no you know they're part of the early

3169
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,600
chem fam so i'm pretty sure it's legit

3170
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:57,920
you know and that same person handing

3171
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:59,920
out cuts to [ __ ] like joint breath

3172
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:02,560
and others that there's there's a lot of

3173
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:04,800
frustrating stuff and a lot of a lot of

3174
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,960
weird expectations a lot of weird

3175
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:09,199
assumptions made with how the kim family

3176
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:11,118
stuff operated in the early days and how

3177
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:12,479
how attached these guys really were to

3178
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:14,639
each other how much they interacted how

3179
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:17,279
much they actually bred um and how much

3180
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:20,000
were accidents and and

3181
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:22,000
like i said gee was young man like i i

3182
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
would love to hear the true tell of d

3183
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,840
the chem d i would love to hear the true

3184
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,118
tale of all of those and i don't know

3185
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:31,039
that we'll ever hear that um and and

3186
01:49:29,118 --> 01:49:32,479
i think it's a shame because

3187
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:33,840
i think it would be an interesting story

3188
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:36,079
to hear the actual

3189
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:37,679
facts of each d and how it came to be

3190
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:39,840
what really happened with the sister

3191
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:41,359
what was which was a sister s1 why was

3192
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,480
that used as the d why was that passed

3193
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:44,880
as the d

3194
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:47,839
et cetera things like that

3195
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,840
yeah i've always personally felt like uh

3196
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,679
joe brand could probably fill some of

3197
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,480
these holes in but unfortunately i've

3198
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:56,719
been told by too many sources that you

3199
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:58,319
just can't trust what he says

3200
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:01,599
yeah he's off the rails and that's

3201
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:03,599
unfortunate um that's real unfortunate

3202
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:05,840
uh yeah

3203
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:07,279
that sucks but it just is what it is

3204
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,920
with that

3205
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:11,840
yeah that's life i guess so to kind of

3206
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:14,319
change things up a bit since the last

3207
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,760
time we spoke um you're now vending

3208
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:17,759
through some seed banks you know shout

3209
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,000
out seeds here now and james bean

3210
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,679
friends of both of us how did this come

3211
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,920
about and how does it feel to now be

3212
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:26,800
affiliated with two rather big seed

3213
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:29,118
banks most notably seats here now

3214
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,119
um

3215
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:35,118
after the moon situation

3216
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:36,879
um

3217
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:38,559
during that time i i've always been

3218
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,079
protective about who my merchant account

3219
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,840
was because

3220
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:43,439
it's really hard for breeders and seed

3221
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,880
sellers to have a merchant account

3222
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:46,559
that's something you have to guard with

3223
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,118
your life but

3224
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,960
i take chances on friends and and mooney

3225
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:53,118
and his buddy uh i can't remember the

3226
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,719
dude's name uh not really important but

3227
01:50:53,118 --> 01:50:56,639
he um they wanted to start a seed

3228
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:58,399
company and because i trusted them he

3229
01:50:56,639 --> 01:50:59,359
had my mom's and was taking care of them

3230
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:01,920
for me

3231
01:50:59,359 --> 01:51:03,519
supposedly i i told them who my merchant

3232
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:05,440
account was and the second that i found

3233
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,679
out my plants were dead i got reported

3234
01:51:05,439 --> 01:51:08,879
to my merchant account for selling seeds

3235
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,039
um

3236
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:13,118
so i lost that and i lost the ability to

3237
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:14,639
accept credit cards and in this can in

3238
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:16,880
this in this world if you can accept

3239
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:19,279
credit cards it's a really hard road to

3240
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:22,239
travel most people are these are impulse

3241
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:24,158
buys um they'll make an order and won't

3242
01:51:22,238 --> 01:51:25,359
send the cash because it takes a lot of

3243
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:27,359
effort and we're all a bunch of [ __ ]

3244
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:29,439
stoners and that's the way it is so it

3245
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:31,439
was really important to have that

3246
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:33,118
also during that time i mean early on me

3247
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:35,439
and james were not really necessarily

3248
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:38,238
friends

3249
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:38,238
i was very

3250
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:42,319
judgmental of james because of who he

3251
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:43,520
was associated with when he first came

3252
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:45,118
into the business

3253
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,800
but over the years i've watched james

3254
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:48,960
work really hard to get to the point of

3255
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:52,159
where he's at that dude [ __ ] hustles

3256
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,920
non-stop nonstop and and over the years

3257
01:51:52,158 --> 01:51:55,598
i even though like we argue and [ __ ]

3258
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,359
i've always had an appreciation for how

3259
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:59,840
hard he's worked and and

3260
01:51:57,359 --> 01:52:02,719
if people work and pay their dues dude

3261
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:03,599
who am i to [ __ ] judge him you know

3262
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:05,840
um

3263
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,360
so with that said when all that happened

3264
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,719
me and james started talking and we had

3265
01:52:07,359 --> 01:52:11,279
talked about working together for a bit

3266
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:13,279
but you know we just kind of

3267
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:14,880
hemmed in hard he didn't quite trust me

3268
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:17,279
because i've i've called him a [ __ ]

3269
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:18,319
[ __ ] publicly plenty of times and i

3270
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:20,079
didn't really trust him because i don't

3271
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:21,840
trust seed banks like i've had a lot of

3272
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:24,719
bad interactions in the old days with

3273
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:26,960
european seed banks the attitude uh

3274
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:28,960
the serious seeds are not serious i'm

3275
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,639
sorry not serious seeds uh sensible

3276
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,880
seeds different than the original

3277
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:35,520
sensible seed bank sensible seeds they

3278
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:39,279

3279
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:41,520

3284
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:52,639
scammed the rev he scammed a lot of

3285
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:55,840
people um so it's been a hard hard work

3286
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:57,279
hard world trusting seed banks but um i

3287
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,400
i eventually

3288
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:00,000
tried it with james and it's been

3289
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:02,238
working great it's been working awesome

3290
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,840
he's been true to his word everything he

3291
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:06,079
said he'd do he's done

3292
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:08,239
um and then i also work with breeders

3293
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:09,439
direct seed co who is a good friend of

3294
01:53:08,238 --> 01:53:11,439

3295
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:13,198
established and

3296
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:15,118
he's he's doing it right dude he's only

3297
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:17,118
picking up breeders that

3298
01:53:15,118 --> 01:53:19,039
for the most part there may be a few

3299
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:20,799
odds and ends of of people that aren't

3300
01:53:19,039 --> 01:53:22,960
really haven't been around a long time

3301
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:25,599
but for the most part i mean he's got me

3302
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:27,279
csi he's picking up hip sweet el jefe

3303
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:29,599
like a lot of people like that that that

3304
01:53:27,279 --> 01:53:30,880
are that are older breeders and are

3305
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,400
established and he's trying to do it

3306
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,719
right

3307
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:36,719
yeah for sure i mean i think uh yeah i

3308
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:38,158
can echo the sentiments about ct now

3309
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:40,800
they've always been really awesome in

3310
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:42,638
regards to our relationship

3311
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,719
um and james in general you're right man

3312
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:46,560
i don't i don't think i know many if any

3313
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:48,079
people who hustle harder than that guy

3314
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:50,880
definitely no he's the king of the

3315
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:51,679
hustle dude king of the hustle for sure

3316
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:54,480
yeah

3317
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,079
so i noticed um for a while

3318
01:53:54,479 --> 01:53:58,959
you know as i mentioned earlier i love

3319
01:53:56,079 --> 01:54:00,880
your feminizing spray that um there was

3320
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:03,279
basically like some issues with like

3321
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,520
payment gateways and stuff and so what i

3322
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,439
was wondering is how hard is it to

3323
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:09,360
operate a can of business giving like

3324
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:12,000
the range of limitations that like

3325
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:14,079
financial institutions place on us like

3326
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,039
i mean you you must have patience beyond

3327
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:20,319
words given that whole debacle

3328
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:21,519
um i constantly have a worry in my gut

3329
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:23,279
every morning that i'm going to wake up

3330
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:25,360
with an email saying

3331
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:26,238
you're no longer active with a merchant

3332
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:28,238
account

3333
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:30,879
because it's really really really hard

3334
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:32,879
to get them um

3335
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,880
yeah and now with hemp being legal

3336
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:37,359
people are more open-minded to the seed

3337
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,279
aspect of it but it hasn't always been

3338
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:40,719
that way dude and and you know i get a

3339
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:42,319
lot of requests from a lot of readers

3340
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:45,359
asking me how the [ __ ] are you pulling

3341
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:47,439
this off and you know like now after the

3342
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:49,519
moon situation i don't say [ __ ] anymore

3343
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:52,158
i know i can't trust anyone with my

3344
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:54,800
merchant account [ __ ] um but it's hard

3345
01:54:52,158 --> 01:54:58,319
man it takes a lot of patience um things

3346
01:54:54,800 --> 01:55:01,199
will go down things will go wrong and uh

3347
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:03,118
and frankly just accepting cash it is

3348
01:55:01,198 --> 01:55:05,839
not a working model for me there's about

3349
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:08,319
a 10 follow through rate on on orders

3350
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:10,159
and uh you know i've told other breeders

3351
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:12,399
this that are big that go that route and

3352
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:14,638
they've confirmed it 10 follow-through

3353
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:16,479
rate on orders that means 90 of people

3354
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:18,480
who order aren't going to pay

3355
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:20,399
that's rough that is so rough it's

3356
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:22,158
defeating you know like you see all

3357
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:23,439
these orders come through you're stoked

3358
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:25,839
maybe you're doing a big drop of

3359
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:28,399
something really special 90 of those

3360
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,319
orders of it are [ __ ] and so you

3361
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:32,638
stop you you apportion this amount of

3362
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:34,319
seeds for that and then all of a sudden

3363
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:35,920
you know three weeks down the line you

3364
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:37,359
have them to re have to resell a bunch

3365
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,639
of them and people are calling you out

3366
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:40,880
yeah you said you were only gonna make

3367
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:42,560
so much well you've sewn it again you

3368
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,639
know they don't understand the ins and

3369
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,880
outs of the cash business

3370
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:49,840
having a merchant account is everything

3371
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:51,599
and and it's hard it's really hard

3372
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,440
yeah so these same kind of financial

3373
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:55,599
restrictions that we're talking about

3374
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:57,678
were basically imposed on last year's

3375
01:55:55,599 --> 01:56:00,159
emerald cup which i think prior to the

3376
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:02,000
most recent one was a really good event

3377
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:03,679
but last year you know

3378
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,079
it felt different you know there wasn't

3379
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:08,639
the same energy in the air it just it

3380
01:56:06,079 --> 01:56:09,760
just wasn't the same event basically

3381
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:11,359
how do you feel these events are going

3382
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:14,239
to go down in the future and do you plan

3383
01:56:11,359 --> 01:56:15,598
to go to the next emerald cup

3384
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:17,919
um

3385
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:19,599
i i have

3386
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:22,639
personal feelings about the people

3387
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:25,039
behind emerald cup that put it on

3388
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:26,000
um that make me not want to work with

3389
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:28,238
them

3390
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,599
i think i think they are the same kind

3391
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:31,519
of guys

3392
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:33,279
bringing [ __ ] like filos around

3393
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:36,239
backing them up

3394
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:37,920
and bringing scummy ceo types and saying

3395
01:56:36,238 --> 01:56:39,759
they're cool you know let's work with

3396
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:42,319
them it's a big money event and it was

3397
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:44,480
bound to happen um yeah last year was

3398
01:56:42,319 --> 01:56:46,799
not remotely the same feeling as the

3399
01:56:44,479 --> 01:56:48,479
first one the first one um i mean it's

3400
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,920
stressful being around a bunch of people

3401
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:51,198
as is having a bunch of people come up

3402
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,399
to you that know what you look like and

3403
01:56:51,198 --> 01:56:53,759
you don't know who they are what they

3404
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:56,319
look like or what their agendas or

3405
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:58,719
intentions are um this last one dude i

3406
01:56:56,319 --> 01:57:00,799
felt sick when i was in there but i i

3407
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:02,880
had never my live feed wasn't as big the

3408
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:05,119
first year the second year like last

3409
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,319
year uh this most recent one when i was

3410
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:08,479
walking around i was getting grabbed

3411
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:10,079
every few seconds and and being in a

3412
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:11,519
crowd of that many people and getting

3413
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:13,198
grabbed from all angles it's a little

3414
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:15,119
intimidating right like you don't know

3415
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:17,118
who's gonna [ __ ] shake you in your

3416
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:19,279
back or or want to shake your hand for

3417
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:20,880
that matter um

3418
01:57:19,279 --> 01:57:22,880
yeah it was a different energy all

3419
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:25,039
around it was very corporatized it was

3420
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:28,000
not it wasn't anything that i really

3421
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:30,399
liked i'll be at the emerald cup but not

3422

3426
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
that that we are now making annual

3427
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:42,959

3428
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,198

3429
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,279
yeah yeah it's gonna be i mean last year

3430
01:57:45,198 --> 01:57:48,960
it was kind of put together at the last

3431
01:57:47,279 --> 01:57:51,359
minute you know and and we weren't sure

3432
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:52,960
who was gonna show up um one person

3433
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:54,799
tried to hijack the whole thing and

3434
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:56,639
saying that there was a [ __ ] dui

3435
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:58,800
checkpoint no one go there come to my

3436
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:01,118
party because i had a little i had a

3437
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:03,679
little instagram um

3438
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:06,079
like uh circle you know where a bunch of

3439
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:07,279
us were in the message and uh that's how

3440
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:08,479
we were communicating about what was

3441
01:58:07,279 --> 01:58:10,000
gonna happen where it was gonna be and

3442
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:11,359
all that and the last minute after the

3443
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,439
emerald cup when everybody was about to

3444
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:14,799
go someone's like hey dui checkpoint

3445
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:17,039
everybody watch out which there was no

3446
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:19,119
dui checkpoint and they were like hey

3447
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:20,639
come to this barbecue place

3448
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:22,719
so yeah

3449
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:25,199
yeah opportunistic to say the least i

3450
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:27,679
mean just just relating back to the

3451
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:29,678
point about the emerald cup itself i'd

3452
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:30,560
heard some whispers from people that

3453
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:31,760
like

3454
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,080
you know basically there was like a

3455
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:36,159
small if not large consensus from

3456
01:58:34,079 --> 01:58:38,639
breeders that they were possibly going

3457
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:40,638
to shrug off the next emerald cup and go

3458
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:42,719
to the cup that was being held in mass

3459
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:44,319
on that same weekend

3460
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:46,319
you given any thought to that one at all

3461
01:58:44,319 --> 01:58:48,158
and i mean if you heard that there was a

3462
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:50,079
sizable group of people doing that would

3463
01:58:48,158 --> 01:58:52,399
you consider doing that

3464
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:54,880
um

3465
01:58:52,399 --> 01:58:56,559
no because we have our party uh and

3466
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,319
everything like that but i know that one

3467
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:00,239
person in particular was trying to push

3468
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:01,759
everyone in that direction

3469
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:03,359
and saying that this person and that

3470
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,560
person was going to be there but then i

3471
01:59:03,359 --> 01:59:07,118
talked to the actual people and they're

3472
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:09,360
like no i'm not going there so i think

3473
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:11,920
one person in particular is trying to

3474
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:14,238
make that happen and uh

3475
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:15,760
yeah i don't know i i think it's cool i

3476
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:17,919
mean there should be events going on at

3477
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:20,320
both places and stuff but we have we

3478
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:23,359
have our annual party now the the canned

3479
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:25,439
illuminati party so yeah

3480
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,439
for sure something to drag people in if

3481
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:28,799
they were being allured by that uh that

3482
01:59:27,439 --> 01:59:30,799
other offer

3483
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:33,760
yeah yeah

3484
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:36,400
so a little bit off topic but i really

3485
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:38,480
really really want to delve into it what

3486
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:40,559
are some of the lines from other

3487
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:42,079
breeders coming out in the future that

3488
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:45,679
you're aware of that you're looking

3489
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:48,000
forward to um

3490
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:50,560
csi a lot of the stuff he's been doing

3491
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:53,359
the triangle kush s1s his old family

3492
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:56,400
purple reversals and the trump reversals

3493
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:58,079
those are going to be phenomenal um

3494
01:59:56,399 --> 01:59:59,839
i don't make any secret of it that him

3495
01:59:58,079 --> 02:00:02,719
and body are like my top two favorite

3496
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:04,960
breeders and i consider uh csa kind of a

3497
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:06,480
mentor man like he's he's

3498
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:08,639
he's uh

3499
02:00:06,479 --> 02:00:10,399
he's hard to get close to he's very hard

3500
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:11,920
to get close to and there's a reason for

3501
02:00:10,399 --> 02:00:12,960
that there's a lot of scammers and stuff

3502
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:15,760
and he doesn't want to deal with it and

3503
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:17,599
i don't blame him but um

3504
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:19,440
when we started becoming good friends he

3505
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:20,480
really has taken care of me brought me

3506
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:22,399
in

3507
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:24,158
put me where i needed to be

3508
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:26,238
and to meet a lot of people that i that

3509
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:27,519
i should have been already met you know

3510
02:00:26,238 --> 02:00:30,158
um

3511
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:32,239
his lines he he tests

3512
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:34,879
he tests way more seeds than i even do

3513
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:38,079
um he does large populations of pops

3514
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:39,599
before they're ever released um the abc

3515
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:41,439
that's a line i've hunted for over a

3516
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:44,000
decade he's been on hunting it for

3517
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:46,319
probably two decades hunting the abc the

3518
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,920
australian bastard cannabis and a lot of

3519
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:50,399
people don't see the value in it because

3520
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:53,118
it's weird looking it's kind of hempy

3521
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:55,519
it's not really potent um

3522
02:00:53,118 --> 02:00:57,839
but there's a lot more value to strains

3523
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:59,840
than just recreational potency so i'm

3524
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:00,960
looking forward to that a lot um that's

3525
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:03,199
something a lot of people have been

3526
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:04,639
hunting and he managed to to bring

3527
02:01:03,198 --> 02:01:06,719
to bring forward with painted forest

3528
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:08,800
farms which is really cool and a young

3529
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:11,198
guy getting into this the scene that

3530
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,560
happened to stumble upon that and and is

3531
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:14,319
making his name with it which is really

3532
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:16,719
cool and it seems like he's taking a

3533
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:18,639
genuine interest in cannabis history and

3534
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:20,239
we need more young people like that

3535
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:24,319

yeah that's just to name a few i'm

3565
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:32,960
probably forgetting a bunch

3566
02:02:31,118 --> 02:02:34,479
yeah so much to talk about i mean the

3567
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:36,960
first one which picked my ears when you

3568
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:39,359
mentioned it was how i totally forgot uh

3569
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:41,520
csi who i i totally agree an amazing

3570
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:43,359
breeder um he's

3571
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,119
he's got that cutting the you know the

3572
02:02:43,359 --> 02:02:46,639
keeper one that he calls the trump or

3573
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:49,279
like you know it's got the word trump in

3574
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:51,039
the name and uh it was interesting to

3575
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:53,439
see the backlash like how many people

3576
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:55,039
are so against trump as a politician

3577
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:56,960
that they were like willing to boycott

3578
02:02:55,039 --> 02:02:58,880
this cut and it's [ __ ] phenomenal

3579
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:01,118
like i mean the old family purple like

3580
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:02,960
geez that's some good weed like what do

3581
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:04,799
you think about like people just being

3582
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,560
put off australian purely because of the

3583
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,239
name

3584
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:10,080
they must not understand the history of

3585
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:11,359
how that name was came up with it was

3586
02:03:10,079 --> 02:03:16,238
done by um

3587
02:03:11,359 --> 02:03:17,519
our buddy redbeard uh at uh portland csi

3588
02:03:16,238 --> 02:03:20,000
um

3589
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:22,159
uh i i don't wanna say his real name but

3590
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,158
yeah he did the obamacush he's

3591
02:03:22,158 --> 02:03:26,238
responsible for the obamacare he

3592
02:03:24,158 --> 02:03:28,638
selected that cut made his name with

3593
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:30,238
that cut he also selected the trump and

3594
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:32,239
named it it wasn't it wasn't caleb who

3595
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:34,559
named it and it was because he had an

3596
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:36,319
obama it was made during that era now we

3597
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:38,400
have the trump era doesn't mean he

3598
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:40,719
supports him in any

3599
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:42,479
way shape or form i don't think

3600
02:03:40,719 --> 02:03:44,719
most breeders would be a huge trump

3601
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:46,799
supporter just because of the uh

3602
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:48,719
the pushback from corporatocracy you

3603
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:50,320
know that's invading our community but

3604
02:03:48,719 --> 02:03:51,840
then again i don't you know i don't know

3605
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:54,238
i don't support any politicians i think

3606
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:57,360
they should all be hung

3607
02:03:54,238 --> 02:03:59,198
anarchy matt

3608
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:01,198
yeah they're all dirty but yeah you know

3609
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:04,000
i i think if they understood that it

3610
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:06,078
wasn't necessarily like a pro-trump move

3611
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,639
it was just because the first one was

3612
02:04:06,078 --> 02:04:10,479
named obama the second one named trump

3613
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:11,599
that's why you know i think if they

3614
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:12,638
understood that it would be a lot

3615
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:14,880
different

3616
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:17,359
of course so you mentioned

3617
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:19,359
uh pip swede working with the irene

3618
02:04:17,359 --> 02:04:21,359
sauer that's interesting because a lot

3619
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:23,679
of people talk very highly of irene yeah

3620
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:25,920
it also goes quite you know it's it's

3621
02:04:23,679 --> 02:04:28,000
not as well known among the circles

3622
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:29,760
there's a lot of other cuts and combined

3623
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,840
with the sour like it's it's like a

3624
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:34,239
powerhouse it's like these two

3625
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:35,679
really highly regarded cuts when do you

3626
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:37,598
think we can expect to see some of that

3627
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:40,399
going live

3628
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:42,400
you know pip is another one that um

3629
02:04:40,399 --> 02:04:44,559
he's a perfectionist and when you're a

3630
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:46,399
perfectionist in in the artistic

3631
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,280
breeding world

3632
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:48,559
it

3633
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:50,399
you want to make sure everything's

3634
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:52,320
[ __ ] sound and he will not release

3635
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:54,799
that [ __ ] until it's absolutely perfect

3636
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:57,198
and i think i think in the next year

3637
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,760
you're going to see the irene sour

3638
02:04:57,198 --> 02:05:02,158
irene i think isn't as used because it's

3639
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:04,560
not as photogenic as a lot of other cuts

3640
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:06,879
it's not a beautiful cut it's not very

3641
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:09,360
resinous it's very awkward looking it

3642
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:11,520
doesn't look like most og cushes

3643
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:13,519
but the chirps on that [ __ ] is crazy it

3644
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:15,440
has a beautiful high

3645
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,679
and it breeds really well in fact it has

3646
02:05:15,439 --> 02:05:20,238
a better structure than most og kush's

3647
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:21,440
it looks like it has some bubba in it um

3648
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:22,959
and it looks like it might have

3649
02:05:21,439 --> 02:05:25,118
something else in it too i'm not sure

3650
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:27,198
what else is in it but it's it's most

3651
02:05:25,118 --> 02:05:29,759
likely an og bubba across to something

3652
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:31,118
else and it maintains that that above a

3653
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:33,599
structure where you don't have to

3654
02:05:31,118 --> 02:05:34,479
[ __ ] majorly stake it

3655
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:37,360
yeah

3656
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:39,919
yeah okay so do you know what sour he

3657
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:42,238
used in order to make these seeds is it

3658
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:44,000
a femme cross or did he use like karma's

3659
02:05:42,238 --> 02:05:45,439
sour release and get like a male from

3660
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,158
that

3661
02:05:45,439 --> 02:05:51,439
he uses uh he has a few sours he keeps

3662
02:05:48,158 --> 02:05:53,598
he has what's referred to as the choco

3663
02:05:51,439 --> 02:05:55,839
or a cob well it has a lot of different

3664
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:58,078
names but that old cut of sour the

3665
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:59,920
what's considered the manny cut the

3666
02:05:58,078 --> 02:06:01,679
original cut

3667
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:03,599
which is the original name for the sour

3668
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:04,639
from the sour crew it would be the manny

3669
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:07,440
cut

3670
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:08,719
fondo i think is the one that named that

3671
02:06:07,439 --> 02:06:11,198
um

3672
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:14,239
he also has a sour

3673
02:06:11,198 --> 02:06:15,678
i believe from res dogs work that was

3674
02:06:14,238 --> 02:06:18,158
used to

3675
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:20,480
make the original death star and i do

3676
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:22,319
believe that is the one that he used in

3677
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:24,799
the irene sour diesel but i might be

3678
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:27,920
wrong he might have used the choco cut

3679
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:30,480
he's done his own sour bx work along the

3680
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:32,158
along the lines that karma did using

3681
02:06:30,479 --> 02:06:35,118
obviously a different cut than karma's

3682
02:06:32,158 --> 02:06:37,519
using to do this um karma has his own

3683
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:38,719
selected cut from res dog's work

3684
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:40,960
and

3685
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:44,239
pip's been doing both the i believe the

3686
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:45,920
the original manny cut choco cut and the

3687
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:48,959
the one used in death star he's been

3688
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:50,880
doing back crosses using that stuff

3689
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:53,118
interesting and what do you think about

3690
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,960
karma's sour i mean i don't i've never

3691
02:06:53,118 --> 02:06:58,158
smoked or anything but i mean

3692
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:59,840
it looks it looks true to form right it

3693
02:06:58,158 --> 02:07:01,439
does look like a salary yeah he's done a

3694
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,520
great job with it the head banger and

3695
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:05,198
all that stuff came out beautiful and it

3696
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:07,280
came out true to form with a sour you

3697
02:07:05,198 --> 02:07:09,759
know headbanger i think is is probably

3698
02:07:07,279 --> 02:07:11,039
the best non-traditional but amer i

3699
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:13,039
would say

3700
02:07:11,039 --> 02:07:14,560
modern headband

3701
02:07:13,039 --> 02:07:16,399
you could call it like the sour og

3702
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:18,239
headband as opposed to the northern

3703
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:20,078
light super skunk i think it's probably

3704
02:07:18,238 --> 02:07:22,479
one of the best releases of a modern

3705
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:24,158
headband line and seed form

3706
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:26,479
and so what are your thoughts on the

3707
02:07:24,158 --> 02:07:28,559
very original sour i mean just to clara

3708
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:30,158
i might be [ __ ] you know insert that

3709
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:32,320
alex jones meme where it's like i'm kind

3710
02:07:30,158 --> 02:07:34,399
of [ __ ] but um

3711
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:37,279
you know like is the original sour

3712
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:39,598
around or is that just long gone

3713
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:41,198
okay so if you're not [ __ ] this has

3714
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:44,319
been something that is it's one of the

3715
02:07:41,198 --> 02:07:46,158
hardest nuts to crack um i've talked to

3716
02:07:44,319 --> 02:07:48,319
almost everyone involved

3717
02:07:46,158 --> 02:07:51,279
except for manny and i don't think

3718
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:54,238
anyone's really talked to manny um

3719
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:56,800
vondo and klopp were roommates back then

3720
02:07:54,238 --> 02:07:58,879
and this is the story from bondo uh

3721
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:01,360
vondo was the one who had the bag of

3722
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:04,000
seeds for manny and it was labeled our

3723
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:05,759
diesel now their diesel was either chem

3724
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,760
91 or

3725
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:09,679
a bad seed from the chem 91 which could

3726
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:12,159
be a chem 91 hybrid

3727
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:14,800
or an s1 of chem 91 they don't know

3728
02:08:12,158 --> 02:08:16,799
they're not sure but it was from seed

3729
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:19,760
supposedly

3730
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:21,599
that's from that bag of our diesel was

3731
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:24,079
selected the manny cut which is what we

3732
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:26,000
know as the choco sour diesel today

3733
02:08:24,078 --> 02:08:28,000
that's the best that anybody's put it

3734
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,118
together um

3735
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:34,158
that you have michael klopp um who is

3736
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:36,000
who is the weasel and he is given many

3737
02:08:34,158 --> 02:08:38,078
stories on many different podcasts that

3738
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,760
don't quite jive with each other he's a

3739
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:41,840
super nice dude but i'm not sure how

3740
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:42,560
accurate he remembers it or can retell

3741
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,440
it

3742
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:49,599
but he was the the partner of or not

3743
02:08:45,439 --> 02:08:51,759
partner but uh roommate of vondo um i

3744
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:54,000
don't want to go into details about

3745
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:55,520
all the personal interactions of people

3746
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,158
dating each other's girlfriends and

3747
02:08:55,520 --> 02:09:01,040
stuff but vondo eventually left london

3748
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:03,359
left new york went to cali and it was

3749
02:09:01,039 --> 02:09:06,319
out of the picture when

3750
02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:08,238
the weasel started pushing sour diesel

3751
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:10,158
which was supposedly from the pakistanis

3752
02:09:08,238 --> 02:09:12,158
that said our diesel now i don't know

3753
02:09:10,158 --> 02:09:13,759
how much of that's true you know it's

3754
02:09:12,158 --> 02:09:15,598
one person's

3755
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:18,480
recollection of it but it was the person

3756
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:20,319
who was involved heavily in it so you

3757
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:23,118
you kind of have to tender

3758
02:09:20,319 --> 02:09:24,319
uh the human story with facts and try to

3759
02:09:23,118 --> 02:09:26,078
put together

3760
02:09:24,319 --> 02:09:29,279
facts from a bunch of different sources

3761
02:09:26,078 --> 02:09:31,039
and that seems to jive the most

3762
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:31,759
yeah of course

3763
02:09:31,039 --> 02:09:34,158
so

3764
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:36,239
seems like the sour to me has like an

3765
02:09:34,158 --> 02:09:37,519
even more muddy story than the chem dog

3766
02:09:36,238 --> 02:09:40,319
would you agree

3767
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:42,639
oh [ __ ] yeah it's it's it's so muddy

3768
02:09:40,319 --> 02:09:43,599
dude and it's just because people have

3769
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:46,000
uh

3770
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:48,480
an agenda i mean you have aj who has his

3771
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:51,039
agenda to be mr sauer you have the

3772
02:09:48,479 --> 02:09:52,078
weasel who aj kind of attributes to it

3773
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:53,679
but

3774
02:09:52,078 --> 02:09:55,599
the weasel wants to pretend that he was

3775
02:09:53,679 --> 02:09:58,078
more of a breeder in it than it being

3776
02:09:55,599 --> 02:09:59,840
just kind of happenstance and

3777
02:09:58,078 --> 02:10:01,840
maybe he remembers himself being more of

3778
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:03,599
a breeder than he was and that's cool

3779
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:05,279
you know um

3780
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:07,599
that you know people remember [ __ ] way

3781
02:10:05,279 --> 02:10:09,279
differently looking back uh you know it

3782
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:11,520
was a long time ago

3783
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:12,479
but somewhere in there is the truth and

3784
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:14,880
uh

3785
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:17,439
the one thing that that goes

3786
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:20,239
in line with both the 91 and the sour to

3787
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:22,319
me in my opinion is the super skunk you

3788
02:10:20,238 --> 02:10:23,919
always see super skunk expressions in

3789
02:10:22,319 --> 02:10:27,039
both of those lines that's the thing

3790
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:29,440
that's the bind that ties you know

3791
02:10:27,039 --> 02:10:31,039
of course of course so

3792
02:10:29,439 --> 02:10:33,279
at the end of the day

3793
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:35,519
it seems to me like a lot of genetics

3794
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:36,960
just tie back to super skunk and

3795
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:38,639
northern lights

3796
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:42,239
how do you feel about that

3797
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:44,719
yeah no i mean uh afghani one skunk one

3798
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:47,118
northern lights and haze that's that's

3799
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:49,439
the basis of almost everything now

3800
02:10:47,118 --> 02:10:51,359
granted you have malawi you have other

3801
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:53,759
africans you have other lines that have

3802
02:10:51,359 --> 02:10:56,319
been brought in over time but but the

3803
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:58,639
overall gene pool is afghani one skunk

3804
02:10:56,319 --> 02:11:00,399
one northern lights super skunk you know

3805
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:02,239
like all those baseline haze

3806
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:04,399
specifically those are the ones that

3807
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:07,039
make up a majority of the population of

3808
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:09,519
what we have today

3809
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:10,880
yeah okay so the final one i wanted to

3810
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:12,960
ask you about which i always get

3811
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:14,639
messages about from me is it's a smaller

3812
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:16,880
community of followers but god they're

3813
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:18,159
passionate the piff

3814
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:19,840
is it around

3815
02:11:18,158 --> 02:11:22,158
tell me about it

3816
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:26,078
yeah the piff's still around um

3817
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:27,759
hazer has a pif and i do believe from uh

3818
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:30,799
people he's given it to and that i trust

3819
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:34,639
their palette um that it is the real pif

3820
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:36,239
um it's an old nl5 haze cut old nl5 haze

3821
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:38,960
and that's all it is but it's a very

3822
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:40,479
specific cut the the cut most people are

3823
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,359
searching for when they say the word

3824
02:11:40,479 --> 02:11:43,759
pith

3825
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:45,679
um is the frankie it has a lot of

3826
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:47,920
different names the frankie the poo day

3827
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:50,239
the the washington heights hayes the

3828
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:52,719
uptown hayes stuff like that

3829
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:54,638
it's all referring to a specific case

3830
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:57,279
that smells like a catholic church like

3831
02:11:54,639 --> 02:11:59,118
the frankincense and myrrh type uh smell

3832
02:11:57,279 --> 02:12:01,599
along with some metallic which you'll

3833
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:03,759
find in old like positronics haze along

3834
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:05,199
with some ammonia which you're getting

3835
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:07,679
from the northern light aspect in the

3836
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:10,238
steve murphy afghani that's what people

3837
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:12,719
mostly refer to now there's also the

3838
02:12:10,238 --> 02:12:14,158
mango pif which is an older mango type

3839
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:15,599
pheno that came out of the same northern

3840
02:12:14,158 --> 02:12:18,238
light 5 haze

3841
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:19,279
you can see that same similar phenotype

3842
02:12:18,238 --> 02:12:22,000
and work

3843
02:12:19,279 --> 02:12:23,359
in the in enchantees mango haze line

3844
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,679
you're seeing that same pheno being

3845
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:27,198
worked with similar type highs

3846
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:30,158
granted

3847
02:12:27,198 --> 02:12:31,839
most people see less of the mango pith

3848
02:12:30,158 --> 02:12:33,039
up in new york because it takes a lot

3849
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:35,279
longer to grow

3850
02:12:33,039 --> 02:12:36,639
it's not as in high demand as the

3851
02:12:35,279 --> 02:12:38,800
frankie piff

3852
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:40,239
but now i think that the term piff has

3853
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:42,400
been thrown on a lot of [ __ ] that

3854
02:12:40,238 --> 02:12:44,319
has nothing to do with the pif the um

3855
02:12:42,399 --> 02:12:45,839
the cuban black haze cut going around a

3856
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:47,840
lot of people call that pif it's not

3857
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:50,239
piff it's it's not the frankie

3858
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:53,279
specifically but people also use the

3859
02:12:50,238 --> 02:12:55,198
term piff interchangeably with dank fire

3860
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:57,359
things like that refer to really good

3861
02:12:55,198 --> 02:12:59,039
weed as that that pif you know that's a

3862
02:12:57,359 --> 02:12:59,920
big rapper thing to do

3863
02:12:59,039 --> 02:13:01,840
so

3864
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:04,560
yeah that that's that's kind of the the

3865
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:06,400
roundabout story on the piff

3866
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:08,719
yeah yeah another one of those ones

3867
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:11,279
where it's just it's been elusive for

3868
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:14,158
the most of the general public i guess

3869
02:13:11,279 --> 02:13:16,078
yeah i was fortunate to have it early on

3870
02:13:14,158 --> 02:13:18,078
um i didn't know what the [ __ ] it was

3871
02:13:16,078 --> 02:13:19,599
when i was handed it i had no idea i'm

3872
02:13:18,078 --> 02:13:21,439
not from the east coast so i'm not i

3873
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:23,520
wasn't privy there wasn't anything

3874
02:13:21,439 --> 02:13:25,279
online about the pif during that era

3875
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,679
nobody was talking about the pif during

3876
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:30,479
that era when i got it but it was from a

3877
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:32,239
friend i was actually a nemesis online

3878
02:13:30,479 --> 02:13:35,118
nemesis the dude that would troll the

3879
02:13:32,238 --> 02:13:36,479
[ __ ] out of me um early on they ended up

3880
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:38,319
becoming friends with me because he had

3881
02:13:36,479 --> 02:13:40,479
the same passion i did and we eventually

3882
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:42,559
saw that in each other and he said yo

3883
02:13:40,479 --> 02:13:44,319
i'm gonna hand you these seeds dude

3884
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:45,840
it's called the piff you're gonna thank

3885
02:13:44,319 --> 02:13:47,359
me later he said you know and then he

3886
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:49,440
put the stipulations on it you can't

3887
02:13:47,359 --> 02:13:50,719
breed with it pure never release it pure

3888
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:52,399
or you're gonna have some dominicans

3889
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:53,920
after your ass and you don't want that

3890
02:13:52,399 --> 02:13:54,719
no i don't want that

3891
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:56,480
um

3892
02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:58,399
and i didn't know what it was but when i

3893
02:13:56,479 --> 02:14:01,198
got it when i grew it when i used it i

3894
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:02,638
realized how special it truly was

3895
02:14:01,198 --> 02:14:04,479
100

3896
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:06,719
so if we just kind of link back to a

3897
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:10,158
point you made you mentioned shanti and

3898
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:11,920
you know some of the mango in his lines

3899
02:14:10,158 --> 02:14:14,799
just take a little sidestep of him for a

3900
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:16,560
moment it wasn't all too long ago maybe

3901
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:19,360
you know a bit over a month or more that

3902
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:21,199
we sadly saw the passing of neville how

3903
02:14:19,359 --> 02:14:22,880
do you feel about neville given you know

3904
02:14:21,198 --> 02:14:24,799
you had that interaction with him and

3905
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,159
more importantly how do you think he's

3906
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:29,440
going to be remembered what do you think

3907
02:14:26,158 --> 02:14:29,439
his legacy should be

3908
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:36,719
neville was a complex man um

3909
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:38,560
i i did work with neville in 2010 2011

3910
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:40,078
during his resurgence i was i wasn't

3911
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:41,679
friends with him during the heyday of

3912
02:14:40,078 --> 02:14:44,000
the seed bank or anything like that i'm

3913
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:46,399
way too young for that but i did have

3914
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,319
the privilege of interacting with him

3915
02:14:46,399 --> 02:14:52,399
and doing a little bit of work with him

3916
02:14:48,319 --> 02:14:54,399
during 2010 and 2011. um

3917
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:56,238
he's a complex man

3918
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:58,000
um

3919
02:14:56,238 --> 02:15:00,158
a lot of guys that operated during that

3920
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,920
era had to have some shade to him you

3921
02:15:00,158 --> 02:15:03,598
know um

3922
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,158
he may not have been the best at keeping

3923
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:08,078
promises or delivering on them

3924
02:15:06,158 --> 02:15:10,238
i don't want to bad-mouth him though

3925
02:15:08,078 --> 02:15:11,759
because there is no doubt there is no

3926
02:15:10,238 --> 02:15:14,479
doubt that cannabis

3927
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:16,480
genetics would not be where they are now

3928
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:18,799
without the seed bank in his early work

3929
02:15:16,479 --> 02:15:20,559
and all this [ __ ] he is an absolute

3930
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:24,159
legend in that and he had the [ __ ]

3931
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:26,880
balls to run that it took a large set of

3932
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:28,879
steel [ __ ] cajones to [ __ ] pull

3933
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:30,719
off running the sea bank like he did in

3934
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:32,560
such a gangster fashion you know the

3935
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:34,158
cannabis castle

3936
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:36,960
that's his legend and that's what i hope

3937
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:38,399
he's remembered for i we all have our

3938
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,158
quirks i mean there's a lot of people

3939
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:41,118
that don't like anything about me and

3940
02:15:40,158 --> 02:15:43,679
and

3941
02:15:41,118 --> 02:15:46,719
maybe that's that's justified you know

3942
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:47,920
in their in their eyes um

3943
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:49,599
you know it's going to be the same way

3944
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:51,359
with neville we're all complex quirky

3945
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:52,960
characters to even be involved in this

3946
02:15:51,359 --> 02:15:54,479
business it's it's

3947
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:56,480
it's uh

3948
02:15:54,479 --> 02:15:58,479
it is sad that he passed there were a

3949
02:15:56,479 --> 02:15:59,839
lot of stories left to tell from neville

3950
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:02,158
there are a lot of questions left to be

3951
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:04,639
answered from neville um and we can't

3952
02:16:02,158 --> 02:16:06,638
get those answers now i know he has a

3953
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:08,239
son that was also interested in breeding

3954
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:09,760
and i expect to see a resurgence from

3955
02:16:08,238 --> 02:16:10,799
him at some point

3956
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:13,199
um

3957
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:15,360
i don't know how heavily involved he got

3958
02:16:13,198 --> 02:16:17,118
with his dad's stuff or how much he more

3959
02:16:15,359 --> 02:16:19,519
he knew than anyone else about his dad's

3960
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:21,679
stuff

3961
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:23,520
with that said i hope i hope if he does

3962
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:25,118
pop up he carries on the legacy even

3963
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:28,560
better

3964
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:31,279
of course and so it seems as though

3965
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:32,960
a lot of people in magazines articles

3966
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:35,519
have been quick to

3967
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:38,000
kind of say that you know his haze was

3968
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:40,000
his big contribution and undeniably he

3969
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,599
cleaned it up but i feel like there are

3970
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:43,519
some other lines that are really in

3971
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:45,679
contention for his legacy like i mean

3972
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:47,200
we've been talking about nl hayes for a

3973
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:49,840
while now and i feel like that's more

3974
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:51,280
his than what just pure haze is

3975
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:52,799
how do you feel about how do you feel

3976
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:55,840
about him being labeled as like you know

3977
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:57,518
like haze was his contribution

3978
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:00,079
um yeah his wasn't really his

3979
02:16:57,519 --> 02:17:03,040
contribution the nl5 haze was his actual

3980
02:17:00,079 --> 02:17:05,519
work and i think it's uh

3981
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:07,920
it may be even more important than the

3982
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:09,439
than the haze by itself um granted he

3983
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:11,920
couldn't have made it without the haze

3984
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:14,239
but as far as bringing forward potency

3985
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:16,960
and modern lines nl5 haze was absolutely

3986
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:19,280
integral it was the most grown line in

3987
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:21,199
the 90s if you go back and look at all

3988
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:23,200
the high times issues from the 90s all

3989
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:25,840
you'll see from your submissions is nl5

3990
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:29,359
has that's it um

3991
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:31,280
that the super skunk um ultra skunk i

3992
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:33,439
believe was the original name for it

3993
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:35,679
that kind of stuff the afghan tea work

3994
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:37,920
which may or may not be afghani one he

3995
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:40,558
said it was maple leaf indica but that

3996
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:42,960
may be because sam's afghani won that

3997
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:45,358
was sam's and him and sam were ultimate

3998
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:47,678
enemies you know in everything they did

3999
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:49,840
have some interaction early on but

4000
02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:51,679
you know they became very hate-filled

4001
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:54,159
for each other and i think that that

4002
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:57,439
drove uh a lot of their brilliance and a

4003
02:17:54,159 --> 02:18:00,398
lot of their madness you know

4004
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:02,479
yes i mean undeniably it was inevitable

4005
02:18:00,398 --> 02:18:04,478
we're gonna get to this but uh how do

4006
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:06,879
you feel about our buddy dave watson's

4007
02:18:04,478 --> 02:18:09,199
acquisition of the fire lost shares and

4008
02:18:06,879 --> 02:18:11,839
uh the coinciding announcement of their

4009
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:11,840
breeding program

4010
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:14,159
wow

4011
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:16,079
um

4012
02:18:14,159 --> 02:18:17,280
dave watson's another very interesting

4013
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:18,318
character

4014
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:19,760
you know

4015
02:18:18,318 --> 02:18:21,840
you can't talk about dave without

4016
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:25,679
talking about rob clark

4017
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:27,040
they go hand in hand there is no one in

4018
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:28,719
this

4019
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:31,040
world i respect more when it comes to

4020
02:18:28,718 --> 02:18:33,279
breeding than rob clark he's done more

4021
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:35,599
for advancing the breeding of this plant

4022
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:37,359
whether through science and through

4023
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:38,960
education

4024
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:41,359
no one's done more than rob clark with

4025
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:43,518
that sam is an amazing breeder he's a

4026
02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:45,760
brilliant dude there again no denying

4027
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:48,559
that he is he was some of the first

4028
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:50,880
doing male reversals uh some you know

4029
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:52,478
early on doing reversals

4030
02:18:50,879 --> 02:18:54,959
there's so much that he's offered this

4031
02:18:52,478 --> 02:18:57,679
community and he's a uh

4032
02:18:54,959 --> 02:19:00,478
he is an often vilified figure and and

4033
02:18:57,679 --> 02:19:02,638
not for no reason not for no reason

4034
02:19:00,478 --> 02:19:04,239
i think his attitude and how he

4035
02:19:02,638 --> 02:19:06,799
interacts with people drives a lot of

4036
02:19:04,239 --> 02:19:08,959
that um there is a lot of debate on

4037
02:19:06,799 --> 02:19:11,438
whether there was some

4038
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:12,558
cohesion with the dea whether that was

4039
02:19:11,439 --> 02:19:14,079
true or not

4040
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:15,599
um

4041
02:19:14,079 --> 02:19:18,239
there's not a lot of

4042
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:19,679
physical paper proof but when you know i

4043
02:19:18,239 --> 02:19:21,840
was working with neville neville said

4044
02:19:19,679 --> 02:19:23,359
yeah he was known as uncle sam because

4045
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:25,599
he walked around with this goddamn de

4046
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:28,399
agent and everybody knew that dude the

4047
02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:28,398
dea agent

4048
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:31,438
but

4049
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:33,040
whether he ratted on people or not

4050
02:19:31,439 --> 02:19:34,239
there's no real paper proof of that and

4051
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:37,120
i don't like to call someone a rat

4052
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:39,280
unless it's on paper that's that's

4053
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:42,000
classless

4054
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:43,280
with that said can sam has always been

4055
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,398
about

4056
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,280
personal

4057
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:47,439
gain

4058
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:50,000
with cannabis and i know a lot of people

4059
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:52,639
don't feel good about that especially

4060
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:54,159
when it leads to to corporatocracy

4061
02:19:52,639 --> 02:19:57,519
bringing in these corporate [ __ ]

4062
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:59,920
like gw pharma and and rob and sam were

4063
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:02,960
integral in gw pharma and cannabis and

4064
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:04,879
their their work with it um

4065
02:20:02,959 --> 02:20:07,519
we don't know how much they still have

4066
02:20:04,879 --> 02:20:09,839
to do with that uh

4067
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:11,120
the first mentions of philos we can find

4068
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:12,159
online

4069
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:13,280
are from

4070
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:15,119
sam

4071
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:16,880
sam was on icymag we still have the

4072
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,399
quotes we still have the screenshots we

4073
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:21,039
still have all that stuff of sam

4074
02:20:18,398 --> 02:20:23,439
mentioning philos asking people to send

4075
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:24,960
in their seeds that won't pop these old

4076
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:26,720
seeds that you have in your just send

4077
02:20:24,959 --> 02:20:28,639
them in just send in these seeds yeah

4078
02:20:26,719 --> 02:20:30,559
they're not worth anything to you just

4079
02:20:28,639 --> 02:20:32,719
send them into us and a lot of people

4080
02:20:30,559 --> 02:20:35,519
didn't know about tissue culture popping

4081
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:37,519
they didn't know about genetic mapping

4082
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:38,800
they didn't know about crispr they don't

4083
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:41,359
know about any of this stuff and they

4084
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:43,358
don't see the value in it um

4085
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:44,880
and i you know i i almost sent stuff

4086
02:20:43,359 --> 02:20:46,559
into them because of it and i'm really

4087
02:20:44,879 --> 02:20:48,318
glad i didn't but a lot of really

4088
02:20:46,559 --> 02:20:50,799
special stuff was submitted to philos

4089
02:20:48,318 --> 02:20:52,478
based on rob and sam's work

4090
02:20:50,799 --> 02:20:55,199
um

4091
02:20:52,478 --> 02:20:57,760
yeah it's the whole philos fall down has

4092
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:59,280
been kind of interesting to watch i've

4093
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:01,280
been saying for a long time i've been

4094
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:03,760
one of the the loudest people

4095
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:05,439
um fighting against philos for years now

4096
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:06,880
two years i think it was when i first

4097
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:08,880
started really understanding who they

4098
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:10,559
were what they were about that they were

4099
02:21:08,879 --> 02:21:12,719
doing these weird shady things like

4100
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:15,039
vouching for themselves by using a shell

4101
02:21:12,719 --> 02:21:16,079
company called open cannabis project

4102
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:17,680
um

4103
02:21:16,079 --> 02:21:19,120
but i got a lot of backlash from it i

4104
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:21,120
got kept getting called conspiracy

4105
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:22,079
theorists tin foil hat matt you know

4106
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:24,319
like

4107
02:21:22,079 --> 02:21:26,799
and and that that isn't a good way to to

4108
02:21:24,318 --> 02:21:28,799
feel and being the only person standing

4109
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:30,559
up with a big platform standing up

4110
02:21:28,799 --> 02:21:33,920
against a multi-billion dollar

4111
02:21:30,559 --> 02:21:36,478
corporation that's not fun that's not a

4112
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:38,159
position i even wanted to be in and i i

4113
02:21:36,478 --> 02:21:40,639
thought a lot of nights about it before

4114
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:42,478
i said anything um

4115
02:21:40,639 --> 02:21:44,159
so there is some

4116
02:21:42,478 --> 02:21:46,159
good feelings coming from the fact that

4117
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:49,200
everybody's finally [ __ ] starting to

4118
02:21:46,159 --> 02:21:51,439
wake up and all it took was

4119
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:53,280
a few years of collecting what philos

4120
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:55,439
themselves said and went on the record

4121
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:57,040
as saying and

4122
02:21:55,439 --> 02:21:58,720
showing using that and showing them a

4123
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:00,800
mirror of themselves and putting their

4124
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:03,039
words back out there in a cohesive form

4125
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:05,119
that people can understand and look at

4126
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:08,960
and say they are obviously contradicting

4127
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:10,399
themselves they used underhanded and and

4128
02:22:08,959 --> 02:22:12,000
non-transparent means to get the

4129
02:22:10,398 --> 02:22:14,719
genetics that they have in the data they

4130
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:16,398
have for the purpose of breeding and the

4131
02:22:14,719 --> 02:22:18,079
the presentation that was circulated

4132
02:22:16,398 --> 02:22:20,318
from 2015

4133
02:22:18,079 --> 02:22:23,359
clearly shows that philos had the

4134
02:22:20,318 --> 02:22:25,439
direction and goal of ultimately

4135
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:27,680
breeding and right now they're trying to

4136
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:29,760
say it was a new idea that they had and

4137
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:32,159
they're just getting into it but they

4138
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:33,680
were presenting investors with a a

4139
02:22:32,159 --> 02:22:37,680
presentation saying that that was their

4140
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:40,800
ultimate goal even back then um how rob

4141
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:42,720
and sam well we know rob is on the chair

4142
02:22:40,799 --> 02:22:44,639
uh he's a chairman on the board of

4143
02:22:42,719 --> 02:22:46,159
philoso we know that

4144
02:22:44,639 --> 02:22:48,719
how sam

4145
02:22:46,159 --> 02:22:51,039
and gw pharma are ultimately tied in i'm

4146
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:53,519
not sure philos is working with a

4147
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:55,680
company called gw industries also known

4148
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:58,319
as groundworks industries there's no

4149
02:22:55,680 --> 02:23:00,159
clear tie yet to gw pharma but i'm gonna

4150
02:22:58,318 --> 02:23:02,799
find that [ __ ] tie i will if there's

4151
02:23:00,159 --> 02:23:04,879
one to be found i'm gonna find it um

4152
02:23:02,799 --> 02:23:07,438
there's proof cultivar that also goes

4153
02:23:04,879 --> 02:23:10,398
under the name of gw industries we have

4154
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:13,120
jeremy plum who started uh open cannabis

4155
02:23:10,398 --> 02:23:15,279
project with mowgli homes also involved

4156
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:17,040
with the cultivation classics being a

4157
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:19,760
partner of philos and all this being

4158
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:22,560
this weird incestuous circle of

4159
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:24,079
uh corporations and shell companies all

4160
02:23:22,559 --> 02:23:26,478
trying to all for the purpose of

4161
02:23:24,079 --> 02:23:28,079
deceiving people and getting the said

4162
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:30,478
data to sell

4163
02:23:28,079 --> 02:23:32,639
as a whole to scots they often say that

4164
02:23:30,478 --> 02:23:34,398
they're open source but they don't have

4165
02:23:32,639 --> 02:23:36,799
an open source license so they're not

4166
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:38,478
open source they when you ask them about

4167
02:23:36,799 --> 02:23:40,159
it they'll say that they're working on

4168
02:23:38,478 --> 02:23:42,318
getting their license to be open source

4169
02:23:40,159 --> 02:23:44,000
but in their rebuttal to this whole

4170
02:23:42,318 --> 02:23:46,398
thing they keep saying the using the

4171
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,840
word open source to try to trick people

4172
02:23:46,398 --> 02:23:49,840
into believing that they're open with

4173
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:51,439
the data everybody can see the data they

4174
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:53,120
haven't published a data set in two

4175
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:56,000
years during those two years they've

4176
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:59,200
tried selling off to scots and monsanto

4177
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:01,920
i asked paige from filos directly have

4178
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:04,720
you ever courted scots monsanto to sell

4179
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:06,639
the data and she said uh

4180
02:24:04,719 --> 02:24:08,398
i don't know

4181
02:24:06,639 --> 02:24:11,840
which was one of my favorite answers of

4182
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:12,719
all time because scots has heavy ndas

4183
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:14,318
and

4184
02:24:12,719 --> 02:24:16,079
she couldn't quite say yes because they

4185
02:24:14,318 --> 02:24:18,318
have non-disclosure agreements she

4186
02:24:16,079 --> 02:24:20,239
couldn't say no because she's too stupid

4187
02:24:18,318 --> 02:24:21,439
and didn't and maybe they've already

4188
02:24:20,239 --> 02:24:23,600
been caught in so many lives she didn't

4189
02:24:21,439 --> 02:24:25,280
want to get caught in another

4190
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:29,040
of course i mean

4191
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:30,479
it seems to me like if nothing else it's

4192
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:32,800
just the way they've handled the

4193
02:24:30,478 --> 02:24:34,559
situation has been quite problematic i

4194
02:24:32,799 --> 02:24:36,079
mean even if like let's just let's just

4195
02:24:34,559 --> 02:24:37,920
play devil's advocate and say that they

4196
02:24:36,079 --> 02:24:40,079
did have best intentions and it was a

4197
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:41,680
recent idea and it wasn't very well

4198
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:43,439
thought out and all of these things

4199
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:45,200
which don't necessarily seem true but

4200
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:47,600
let's just say they are it seems like

4201
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:50,479
it's still being like a pr nightmare 101

4202
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:53,040
on their part so it just seems to

4203
02:24:50,478 --> 02:24:54,879
back give you know give credence to the

4204
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:56,640
idea that like no it is what they're

4205
02:24:54,879 --> 02:24:57,438
trying to deny

4206
02:24:56,639 --> 02:25:00,159
yeah

4207
02:24:57,439 --> 02:25:02,318
um i think it's it's blatant

4208
02:25:00,159 --> 02:25:04,159
um a lot of people are losing focus on

4209
02:25:02,318 --> 02:25:06,398
the idea that they are quote unquote

4210
02:25:04,159 --> 02:25:09,039
stealing [ __ ] genetics they didn't

4211
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:11,119
steal anything it was handed to them but

4212
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:13,439
it was handed to them under a false

4213
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:16,160
pretense that's the problem the problem

4214
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:18,079
was the lies the lack of transparency

4215
02:25:16,159 --> 02:25:19,200
that um i mean they called me they

4216
02:25:18,079 --> 02:25:20,639
outright called me a liar and a

4217
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:22,720
conspiracy theorist when i brought up

4218
02:25:20,639 --> 02:25:24,879
their breeding program and their tissue

4219
02:25:22,719 --> 02:25:26,639
culture lab six months ago

4220
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:28,318
they called me a conspiracy theorist and

4221
02:25:26,639 --> 02:25:30,559
said that that tissue culture lab didn't

4222
02:25:28,318 --> 02:25:32,478
exist after they made a press release in

4223
02:25:30,559 --> 02:25:34,639
a business publication about the tissue

4224
02:25:32,478 --> 02:25:35,920
culture lab so they're talking out both

4225
02:25:34,639 --> 02:25:37,439
sides of their mouth and they really

4226
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:38,879
think that our community is so stupid

4227
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:41,840
and so stoned we're not going to catch

4228
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:43,199
on to it and um that that really shows

4229
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:44,559
how they look at us and that they are

4230
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:46,159
not part of our community and they

4231
02:25:44,559 --> 02:25:48,719
clearly don't understand what we're

4232
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:51,119
about who we are

4233
02:25:48,719 --> 02:25:52,478
yeah certainly certainly

4234
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:55,680
i do however

4235
02:25:52,478 --> 02:25:58,239
have some questions myself around

4236
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:59,280
the actual applicability of this data

4237
02:25:58,239 --> 02:26:01,439
like you know having a bit of a

4238
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:02,880
molecular biology background i can kind

4239
02:26:01,439 --> 02:26:05,280
of understand a lot of the technology

4240
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:07,279
they're talking about and i still don't

4241
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:09,840
understand how they plan to use this

4242
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:11,840
data set to help them breed better

4243
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:14,239
because it seems like it's still a bit

4244
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:16,239
fanciful in some ways like i mean unless

4245
02:26:14,239 --> 02:26:18,159
they're planning on doing some actual

4246
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:20,079
like casper 9 christmas stuff but i feel

4247
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:22,318
like that would take a long time to

4248
02:26:20,079 --> 02:26:24,879
develop you know the specific primers

4249
02:26:22,318 --> 02:26:25,680
they need to change certain loci

4250
02:26:24,879 --> 02:26:27,599
so

4251
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:31,120
yeah it just seems like it's so ill

4252
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:33,520
thought out but maybe i'm just [ __ ]

4253
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:35,040
no um i think it's misdirection i think

4254
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:37,040
it's clearly misdirection they intend to

4255
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:39,120
sell the data which is why it's not up

4256
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:41,520
there to view publicly i don't think

4257
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:43,920
they intend to breed [ __ ] um maybe

4258
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:46,000
they'll do some cbd work and lame

4259
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:47,439
attempts at putting markers in but the

4260
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:49,280
problem is that they have short read

4261
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:50,960
data that's why they're having a problem

4262
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:52,880
selling it that's why scott's monsanto

4263
02:26:50,959 --> 02:26:54,159
didn't buy is because it's short read

4264
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:56,079
data

4265
02:26:54,159 --> 02:26:58,318
i talked with kevin mckernan from

4266
02:26:56,079 --> 02:27:00,239
medicinal genomics and and as a

4267
02:26:58,318 --> 02:27:02,318
disclaimer they are a direct competitor

4268
02:27:00,239 --> 02:27:04,159
of philos so of course he's going to say

4269
02:27:02,318 --> 02:27:06,159
certain things that they cast a negative

4270
02:27:04,159 --> 02:27:08,559
light on them but i i have to say he's

4271
02:27:06,159 --> 02:27:10,799
been very fair in this whole debacle

4272
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:12,719
with philos in explaining the the

4273
02:27:10,799 --> 02:27:14,398
science behind it and the fact that

4274
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:16,398
they're using short read data so their

4275
02:27:14,398 --> 02:27:18,478
their data sets are incomplete there's a

4276
02:27:16,398 --> 02:27:21,279
reason why they're still

4277
02:27:18,478 --> 02:27:23,599
confused why forum and the forum cut of

4278
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:25,760
cookies and ogkb are showing up as the

4279
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:26,559
same exact clone when they clearly are

4280
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:28,880
not

4281
02:27:26,559 --> 02:27:30,639
um they're still thinking all the og

4282
02:27:28,879 --> 02:27:33,119
cushes or s ones of each other even

4283
02:27:30,639 --> 02:27:34,398
hybrids and and they they look they come

4284
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:35,920
back as being the same clone it's

4285
02:27:34,398 --> 02:27:38,000
because their data sets aren't complete

4286
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:40,318
and with that without complete data sets

4287
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,600
with incorrect data sets they're not

4288
02:27:40,318 --> 02:27:43,439
going to be able to do the breeding that

4289
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:45,280
they want to do that's and i think they

4290
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:46,880
know that now so all this breeding stuff

4291
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,159
is misdirection

4292
02:27:46,879 --> 02:27:50,959
from what they're really doing which is

4293
02:27:48,159 --> 02:27:54,959
trying to sell everyone's data

4294
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:58,398
yeah okay so how do you feel about uh

4295
02:27:54,959 --> 02:28:01,199
molecular farms being granted the rather

4296
02:27:58,398 --> 02:28:03,279
broad sweeping utility patents last year

4297
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:04,880
which you know there wasn't an analysis

4298
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:06,479
done by it i can't remember the author's

4299
02:28:04,879 --> 02:28:08,639
name but they basically said you know if

4300
02:28:06,478 --> 02:28:10,799
i've got my you know my things correct

4301
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:12,719
here seems as if at any point if they

4302
02:28:10,799 --> 02:28:14,559
wanted they could pull the plug on the

4303
02:28:12,719 --> 02:28:16,318
entire cannabis industry in terms of

4304
02:28:14,559 --> 02:28:19,439
like these utility patterns seemingly

4305
02:28:16,318 --> 02:28:21,439
cover all cannabis that currently exists

4306
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:22,800
yeah they are very broad sweeping and

4307
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:25,439
the problem with patents once they're

4308
02:28:22,799 --> 02:28:27,759
granted it takes an act of god and a lot

4309
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:30,239
of money to fight them it takes a lot of

4310
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:33,120
money to fight them so um

4311
02:28:30,239 --> 02:28:34,799
it's it's terrifying um but again

4312
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:36,399
cannabis wasn't

4313
02:28:34,799 --> 02:28:38,239
it's always been in the black market the

4314
02:28:36,398 --> 02:28:39,760
black markets always existed let them

4315
02:28:38,239 --> 02:28:42,239
try to sue us when the [ __ ] black

4316
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:43,520
market let them figure it out you know

4317
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:45,199
we'll go under a thousand different

4318
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:47,840
[ __ ] names so they have no idea who

4319
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:50,880
to sue that's what we'll do um they

4320
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:52,318
fight legally we fight real you know so

4321
02:28:50,879 --> 02:28:53,759
they can try to use their [ __ ] but

4322
02:28:52,318 --> 02:28:56,239
it's not gonna work and not be affecting

4323
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:59,120
the black market uh the legal market has

4324
02:28:56,239 --> 02:29:02,799
already shown in many cases whether it's

4325
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:04,960
bedrock on in in amsterdam or the uh i

4326
02:29:02,799 --> 02:29:07,279
can't remember the name of one in israel

4327
02:29:04,959 --> 02:29:08,398
they want a monopoly there is going to

4328
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:10,000
be a monopoly

4329
02:29:08,398 --> 02:29:11,599
where people have to buy from one

4330
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,359
certain source to get their weed they

4331
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,040
may make it look like it's not a

4332
02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:16,720
monopoly by having a bunch of shell

4333
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:18,479
companies and shell corporations under

4334
02:29:16,719 --> 02:29:20,000
them but there's going to be one owner

4335
02:29:18,478 --> 02:29:21,519
doing this stuff that's the way it's

4336
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,600
going and and that's what it's going to

4337
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:25,120
be we have to fight back the black

4338
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:27,200
market

4339
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:28,160
so do you think that there might be a

4340
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:30,880
certain

4341
02:29:28,159 --> 02:29:34,000
event or like you know kind of something

4342
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:35,438
specific to happen before they do you

4343
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,600
know bring everything online and just

4344
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:39,200
try to pull the plug on everyone

4345
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:41,439
yeah they're waiting for federal uh

4346
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:42,319
legal legalization at the federal level

4347
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:44,079
um

4348
02:29:42,318 --> 02:29:45,680
and it's going to be through people like

4349
02:29:44,079 --> 02:29:47,600
when i was going through proof cultivar

4350
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:49,760
and all their employees they have their

4351
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:51,880
own lobbyist they and they have

4352
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:55,040
literally it shows on their page a

4353
02:29:51,879 --> 02:29:57,039
multi-billion dollar fluid finances so

4354
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:59,439
they're able to afford these lobbyists

4355
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:01,280
pushing through uh bills when they want

4356
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:03,680
to be pushed through and they're behind

4357
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:05,840
a lot of anti-home grower bills and i

4358
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:08,720
think once people realize that these big

4359
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:11,280
companies proof [ __ ] gw industries

4360
02:30:08,719 --> 02:30:13,599
whoever the [ __ ] they really are um

4361
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:15,680
philos all these people are behind these

4362
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:17,680
anti-home growing bills

4363
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:19,280
once people realize that then it's going

4364
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:21,200
to get real disgusting because you're

4365
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:22,640
you're [ __ ] with people's livelihoods

4366
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,240
and these aren't people that go to

4367
02:30:22,639 --> 02:30:26,639
lawyers these aren't people that use

4368
02:30:24,239 --> 02:30:28,239
lawyers to settle [ __ ] and they're gonna

4369
02:30:26,639 --> 02:30:30,398
they're gonna run into

4370
02:30:28,239 --> 02:30:32,559
a few scary places for them for their

4371
02:30:30,398 --> 02:30:34,318
their personal uh their personal

4372
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:35,760
protection you know and that's not for

4373
02:30:34,318 --> 02:30:37,680
me that's not me saying i'm gonna do

4374
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:39,359
anything but it's a reality that's this

4375
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:40,239
is what they're dealing with they're not

4376
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:43,359
made

4377
02:30:40,239 --> 02:30:46,079
they're not made uh to work in an uh

4378
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:48,559
quasi-legal industry they're soft

4379
02:30:46,079 --> 02:30:51,280
they're daddy's money boys

4380
02:30:48,559 --> 02:30:51,279
gang gang

4381
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:56,239
straight up um

4382
02:30:54,159 --> 02:30:58,559
so i mean ultimately how do you feel

4383
02:30:56,239 --> 02:31:01,039
about the idea of technology assisted or

4384
02:30:58,559 --> 02:31:02,559
like entirely facilitated breeding

4385
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,920
programs would work do you think it's

4386
02:31:02,559 --> 02:31:05,760
inevitable that we'll reach a point

4387
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:07,439
where like you know tech assisted

4388
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:09,280
breeding just supersedes like using

4389
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:11,520
first principles and just us you know

4390
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:13,040
picking what we think is good

4391
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:14,800
this is where you'll hear the hippie

4392
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:16,960
side of me come out which there is very

4393
02:31:14,799 --> 02:31:18,719
little that exists in my punk rock soul

4394
02:31:16,959 --> 02:31:20,879
but god damn it

4395
02:31:18,719 --> 02:31:23,679
i truly believe that the plants are

4396
02:31:20,879 --> 02:31:25,438
sentient beings and this robo-breeding

4397
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:27,280
[ __ ]

4398
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:28,479
and i think the best quote i ever heard

4399
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:31,359
was from bodhi

4400
02:31:28,478 --> 02:31:33,438
i don't need your machine to

4401
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:36,318
to tell me what my plant is i smoke my

4402
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:38,000
bud i know how it is i grow my bud i see

4403
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:39,439
the phenotypes at hand i don't need your

4404
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,159
machine to tell me how to breed i've

4405
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:44,079
been doing this long before it and and

4406
02:31:42,159 --> 02:31:45,840
the whole machine breeding is it it's

4407
02:31:44,079 --> 02:31:48,079
going to have it's it's going to have a

4408
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:50,880
place in it but i think it loses a lot

4409
02:31:48,079 --> 02:31:52,879
of the soul a lot of the art behind it a

4410
02:31:50,879 --> 02:31:54,719
lot of the art and the soul behind it it

4411
02:31:52,879 --> 02:31:57,358
loses a lot of the love between the

4412
02:31:54,719 --> 02:31:58,959
plant and the and the grower which

4413
02:31:57,359 --> 02:32:00,399
i don't care what anyone says dude like

4414
02:31:58,959 --> 02:32:02,559
when i'm depressed my plants are

4415
02:32:00,398 --> 02:32:04,318
depressed and it's not just because of

4416
02:32:02,559 --> 02:32:06,000
maybe i'm not watering as much maybe i'm

4417
02:32:04,318 --> 02:32:08,000
not paying as much attention they feel

4418
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,439
it they interact with you you're you

4419
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,680
know um

4420
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:14,079
yeah it's it's gonna lose all that if it

4421
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:16,159
all goes to that that kind of breeding

4422
02:32:14,079 --> 02:32:19,280
um it has its place in certain medical

4423
02:32:16,159 --> 02:32:21,359
applications it will exist um i think

4424
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:23,280
it's cool to work in tandem with it but

4425
02:32:21,359 --> 02:32:26,159
never lose the soul never lose the soul

4426
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:28,239
in the art and breeding

4427
02:32:26,159 --> 02:32:30,398
i agree i feel like yeah there's a lot

4428
02:32:28,239 --> 02:32:32,239
of there's a lot of evidence to suggest

4429
02:32:30,398 --> 02:32:33,920
that they definitely interact with us

4430
02:32:32,239 --> 02:32:35,520
you know if not just being stimulated by

4431
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:36,719
our voices

4432
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:38,479
exactly

4433
02:32:36,719 --> 02:32:40,719
so to kind of change things up get a

4434
02:32:38,478 --> 02:32:42,239
little more lighthearted i want to jump

4435
02:32:40,719 --> 02:32:43,519
back to some older strains for a minute

4436
02:32:42,239 --> 02:32:45,039
you know one i've been thinking about

4437
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:47,920
for a while that i think you probably

4438
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:49,600
have some experience with cali missed

4439
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:51,120
used to hear about it a lot and then it

4440
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:53,520
just kind of fell off you know what do

4441
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:56,399
you think happened there

4442
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:58,159
so kelly missed um i believe

4443
02:32:56,398 --> 02:32:59,519
simon himself

4444
02:32:58,159 --> 02:33:00,799
i don't want to misquote him because

4445
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:02,399
i've seen people misquote him and he

4446
02:33:00,799 --> 02:33:03,920
gets super pissed

4447
02:33:02,398 --> 02:33:05,920
but he had lost some of the original

4448
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:08,239
parents to cali mist in a bust back in

4449
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:10,159
the the older days and since then it

4450
02:33:08,239 --> 02:33:12,398
hasn't been able to be recreated the

4451
02:33:10,159 --> 02:33:14,000
same however i do have an old pack of

4452
02:33:12,398 --> 02:33:14,879
original cali mist

4453
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,079
here

4454
02:33:14,879 --> 02:33:18,879
and

4455
02:33:16,079 --> 02:33:22,000
i've been kind of waiting to pop them

4456
02:33:18,879 --> 02:33:24,639
myself i don't have the the desire to

4457
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:26,079
to really go down the cali mist route um

4458
02:33:24,639 --> 02:33:28,398
i'm kind of hoping that someone comes

4459
02:33:26,079 --> 02:33:30,879
along that has that major desire and the

4460
02:33:28,398 --> 02:33:33,279
ability to do that and puts these seeds

4461
02:33:30,879 --> 02:33:35,599
to good use and and brings it back you

4462
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:37,439
know but um i know i have so many other

4463
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:39,040
projects that i haven't focused on it

4464
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:42,559
but those seeds are there and they're

4465
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:44,960
well stored um for for any real breeder

4466
02:33:42,559 --> 02:33:46,959
um with skin in the game so don't don't

4467
02:33:44,959 --> 02:33:48,959
be hitting me up [ __ ]

4468
02:33:46,959 --> 02:33:50,559
noobs don't be hit me up for my cali

4469
02:33:48,959 --> 02:33:52,398
mist it's only going to go to special

4470
02:33:50,559 --> 02:33:54,079
people that i know that really have skin

4471
02:33:52,398 --> 02:33:56,239
in the game that have a want and desire

4472
02:33:54,079 --> 02:33:57,760
to bring this line back

4473
02:33:56,239 --> 02:33:58,719
yeah of course

4474
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:00,559
so

4475
02:33:58,719 --> 02:34:02,959
you know from all of my observations it

4476
02:34:00,559 --> 02:34:04,799
seems like the largest component of good

4477
02:34:02,959 --> 02:34:06,959
breeding or a good breeding program at

4478
02:34:04,799 --> 02:34:10,000
least is having like really good p1

4479
02:34:06,959 --> 02:34:11,119
parental stock on top of good selection

4480
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:13,520
however

4481
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:15,359
for everyone living outside of the us it

4482
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:16,960
can be hard to find truly phenomenal

4483
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:18,559
clones to breed with so you're forced to

4484
02:34:16,959 --> 02:34:21,358
deal with seeds

4485
02:34:18,559 --> 02:34:23,359
so with so many of us in that situation

4486
02:34:21,359 --> 02:34:25,040
should we just constantly be buying

4487
02:34:23,359 --> 02:34:26,880
seeds cracking them trying to find

4488
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:29,280
better parents and breed with that or

4489
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:31,839
should we focus on creating strains

4490
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:33,200
um in terms of like

4491
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:34,559
like just trying to make an offspring

4492
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:36,159
that's better than the parents if you

4493
02:34:34,559 --> 02:34:37,359
get what i mean by that

4494
02:34:36,159 --> 02:34:39,920
yeah um

4495
02:34:37,359 --> 02:34:41,439
i think maybe not constantly be buying

4496
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:44,079
seeds because i don't think there's a

4497
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:46,079
constant supply of good parentage out

4498
02:34:44,079 --> 02:34:48,079
there i think there's a finite supply

4499
02:34:46,079 --> 02:34:50,478
yet there is a lot of seeds out there to

4500
02:34:48,079 --> 02:34:51,920
buy but there's a finite supply of good

4501
02:34:50,478 --> 02:34:53,840
parent stock

4502
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:55,760
be mindful of it go back and learn a lot

4503
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:57,200
of these baselines these baselines you

4504
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:58,559
can still buy from certain dutch

4505
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:00,319
companies that

4506
02:34:58,559 --> 02:35:02,398
and they may not be the best versions of

4507
02:35:00,318 --> 02:35:04,559
what they once were but you can still

4508
02:35:02,398 --> 02:35:07,599
find those old phenos in those lines i

4509
02:35:04,559 --> 02:35:09,840
think that's a great place to start

4510
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:11,280
clones are what they are like the clone

4511
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:13,040
onlys they're great there's a high

4512
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:14,720
demand of them in the us because there's

4513
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:16,399
hype behind certain ones some of them

4514
02:35:14,719 --> 02:35:18,478
have some of them have created their own

4515
02:35:16,398 --> 02:35:21,119
hype and and are as good as they they

4516
02:35:18,478 --> 02:35:22,959
say they are however all these started

4517
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:25,520
with the seed everything starts with the

4518
02:35:22,959 --> 02:35:27,919
seed you know um

4519
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:29,600
i think i think things can be created

4520
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:31,200
absolutely magical in any land that

4521
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:34,559
you're at as long as you have good

4522
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:35,680
parent stock and seed stock to work from

4523
02:35:34,559 --> 02:35:38,159
overall

4524
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:40,079
how do you feel outdoor bud compared to

4525
02:35:38,159 --> 02:35:42,318
indoor and the reason why i asked this

4526
02:35:40,079 --> 02:35:44,318
is because you know i love outdoor i

4527
02:35:42,318 --> 02:35:46,000
like maybe i should say i love the idea

4528
02:35:44,318 --> 02:35:48,478
of outdoor but the reality is i just

4529
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,318
still haven't found any outdoor bud that

4530
02:35:48,478 --> 02:35:52,079
makes me feel like this is better than

4531
02:35:50,318 --> 02:35:54,719
indoor

4532
02:35:52,079 --> 02:35:56,159
i think it needs to be um there are

4533
02:35:54,719 --> 02:35:58,478
certain lines that want to be run

4534
02:35:56,159 --> 02:36:01,520
outdoor as opposed to indoor being the

4535
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:03,679
old colombians the old ties stuff like

4536
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:05,760
that they really truly express better

4537
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:06,880
outdoor than indoor but like modern

4538
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:08,239
lines

4539
02:36:06,879 --> 02:36:11,119
it's rare that you'll find something

4540
02:36:08,239 --> 02:36:13,199
grown outdoor organically and all that

4541
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:14,720
that really does compare to what you can

4542
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:16,880
get in a uh

4543
02:36:14,719 --> 02:36:17,679
in a room that's that's built for that

4544
02:36:16,879 --> 02:36:19,839
line

4545
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:23,040
but with that said i mean some of these

4546
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:25,120
old ties the old colombians they only

4547
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:27,439
they only do well outdoors there's a lot

4548
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:29,600
of lines that i have that i don't run

4549
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:31,280
that i keep old heirloom and land race

4550
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:32,800
lines because i don't have an outdoor

4551
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:35,280
space and i don't want to do them the

4552
02:36:32,799 --> 02:36:37,840
disservice of trying to grow them indoor

4553
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:39,439
and not getting their full

4554
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:41,120
the full range of phenotypes and

4555
02:36:39,439 --> 02:36:43,280
expressions because they were always

4556
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:44,720
grown outdoor and never acclimated for

4557
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:46,880
indoor

4558
02:36:44,719 --> 02:36:49,358
so with that being said what's the most

4559
02:36:46,879 --> 02:36:51,438
medicinal strain for you personally like

4560
02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:52,960
what kind of cures things the best for

4561
02:36:51,439 --> 02:36:54,880
you

4562
02:36:52,959 --> 02:36:56,000
uh my riot very line helped with my

4563
02:36:54,879 --> 02:36:57,599
depression

4564
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:00,239
um i think that's from its tie

4565
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:03,600
expressions in it um it helped i had a

4566
02:37:00,239 --> 02:37:06,398
tooth abscess for like two weeks nothing

4567
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:07,920
was helping no no narcotic pills nothing

4568
02:37:06,398 --> 02:37:10,239
was [ __ ] helping it was it was

4569
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:12,000
excruciating pain and that riot very the

4570
02:37:10,239 --> 02:37:14,879
second that i tried that even though

4571
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:17,200
recreational potency it was minimal

4572
02:37:14,879 --> 02:37:19,119
minimal um

4573
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:20,560
but it helped with that pain that nerve

4574
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:23,439
pain and that's when i found that

4575
02:37:20,559 --> 02:37:26,000
special medical uh part of it

4576
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:28,479
yeah awesome answer this is this is one

4577
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,799
i've got a lot of questions for and uh

4578
02:37:28,478 --> 02:37:32,799
if you don't talk about it i understand

4579
02:37:30,799 --> 02:37:34,879
but you know i've a lot of a lot of

4580
02:37:32,799 --> 02:37:36,478
people in the cannabis community i don't

4581
02:37:34,879 --> 02:37:38,159
want to say a lot but you know there's a

4582
02:37:36,478 --> 02:37:40,398
substantial minority who come to

4583
02:37:38,159 --> 02:37:42,799
cannabis because they're dealing with

4584
02:37:40,398 --> 02:37:44,719
addictions in one form or another and

4585
02:37:42,799 --> 02:37:46,639
you know they view this as a gateway to

4586
02:37:44,719 --> 02:37:48,559
a better life

4587
02:37:46,639 --> 02:37:50,318
how has cannabis been involved in your

4588
02:37:48,559 --> 02:37:52,318
life in regards to addiction like how do

4589
02:37:50,318 --> 02:37:53,680
you view it as like a tool to help

4590
02:37:52,318 --> 02:37:55,519
overcome that and what would be your

4591
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:58,079
message for people who maybe are looking

4592
02:37:55,520 --> 02:38:01,120
to use cannabis as a means to help fight

4593
02:37:58,079 --> 02:38:02,879
whatever kind of demon they're battling

4594
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:05,680
you know in our in our community there

4595
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:10,079
is a lot of shaming um of people that

4596
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:12,479
use our use or have used other drugs uh

4597
02:38:10,079 --> 02:38:14,159
but from the era i came from usually if

4598
02:38:12,478 --> 02:38:16,799
you were dealing weed you were dealing

4599
02:38:14,159 --> 02:38:18,879
other [ __ ] too and in dealing other [ __ ]

4600
02:38:16,799 --> 02:38:21,199
you usually got involved in other [ __ ]

4601
02:38:18,879 --> 02:38:23,839
um for personal use or otherwise i've

4602
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:26,720
been pretty open about my use of opiates

4603
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:28,799
in my my you know my past with heroin my

4604
02:38:26,719 --> 02:38:31,199
past with female my past with all kinds

4605
02:38:28,799 --> 02:38:33,199
of narcotics i i went on the whole gamut

4606
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:35,359
it was it was a part of our punk rock

4607
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:38,319
scene unfortunately a lot of my best

4608
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:39,760
friends have died because of it

4609
02:38:38,318 --> 02:38:41,760
cannabis took me in a whole new

4610
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:45,439
direction it gave me a lot of hope that

4611
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:47,520
i didn't have um it gave me a way to

4612
02:38:45,439 --> 02:38:48,639
kind of realize that i had value in this

4613
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:50,319
world

4614
02:38:48,639 --> 02:38:51,840
that i had something to offer this world

4615
02:38:50,318 --> 02:38:53,600
you know aside from just playing punk

4616
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:55,120
rock music and being [ __ ] up and just

4617
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:57,200
doing [ __ ] up [ __ ]

4618
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:59,520
um with that said

4619
02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:00,960
every day there isn't a day that goes by

4620
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:04,319
that some of the people who don't like

4621
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:06,959
me don't call me a [ __ ] junkie

4622
02:39:04,318 --> 02:39:08,959
that's they do it to be hurtful but at

4623
02:39:06,959 --> 02:39:11,599
the same time it shows their ignorance

4624
02:39:08,959 --> 02:39:13,358
and it shows their ability to understand

4625
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:15,120
that most of the old school dealt with

4626
02:39:13,359 --> 02:39:17,600
this at some point most of a lot of the

4627
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:19,520
old breeders around were at one time

4628
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:21,840
dealing with opiate abuse you know it

4629
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:24,079
was just a part of the deal

4630
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:25,280
i wish people would stop the shaming

4631
02:39:24,079 --> 02:39:26,719
because i mean

4632
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:28,800
whether people want to admit it or not

4633
02:39:26,719 --> 02:39:30,318
cannabis is a drug it is a drug it

4634
02:39:28,799 --> 02:39:33,039
affects your central nervous system you

4635
02:39:30,318 --> 02:39:35,439
can get high from it that is a drug

4636
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:37,840
for all intents and purposes

4637
02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:39,920
whether you're using it for escaping

4638
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:42,398
reality or not it you know we're using

4639
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:44,079
it medically that's up to you you're you

4640
02:39:42,398 --> 02:39:45,358
know it's what you can deal with

4641
02:39:44,079 --> 02:39:47,840
yourself looking at yourself in the

4642
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:49,600
mirror and be happy with i i try to be

4643
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:52,478
outspoken about

4644
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:54,079
the the harm reduction using cannabis as

4645
02:39:52,478 --> 02:39:56,239
opposed to getting off of opiates using

4646
02:39:54,079 --> 02:39:58,959
cannabis to do it i try to be open about

4647
02:39:56,239 --> 02:40:01,760
it and talk about it only because every

4648
02:39:58,959 --> 02:40:04,239
time i do i get messages from you know

4649
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:05,680
20 30 people thanking me saying you know

4650
02:40:04,239 --> 02:40:06,959
i'm dealing with this and i'm scared to

4651
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:08,159
even talk about it out in the open

4652
02:40:06,959 --> 02:40:10,159
because i don't want to be called a

4653
02:40:08,159 --> 02:40:12,398
junkie like you get called a junkie but

4654
02:40:10,159 --> 02:40:13,760
if it helps them if then that's that's

4655
02:40:12,398 --> 02:40:14,959
all that i give a [ __ ] about i don't

4656
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:16,639
care about the people who call me a

4657
02:40:14,959 --> 02:40:18,879
junkie they obviously don't know me you

4658
02:40:16,639 --> 02:40:20,398
know but it but it is it's a hard stance

4659
02:40:18,879 --> 02:40:22,478
to take in this community and lately

4660
02:40:20,398 --> 02:40:24,478
i've been seeing other breeders um

4661
02:40:22,478 --> 02:40:26,000
family members of breeders come out and

4662
02:40:24,478 --> 02:40:27,920
talk about their their struggles with

4663
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:29,439
addiction and i'm it makes me so [ __ ]

4664
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:31,680
proud to see it because it's not an easy

4665
02:40:29,439 --> 02:40:33,279
stance to take people are very very

4666
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:34,720
judgmental in this community and you'd

4667
02:40:33,279 --> 02:40:37,040
think this would be the most accepting

4668
02:40:34,719 --> 02:40:40,799
community for it

4669
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:43,040
yeah that's a really wonderful sentiment

4670
02:40:40,799 --> 02:40:44,398
so just to kind of jump back to some of

4671
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:45,760
your work you're currently doing i

4672
02:40:44,398 --> 02:40:47,439
totally forgot to ask you about this

4673
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:48,880
earlier my apologies

4674
02:40:47,439 --> 02:40:50,559
the platinum banana line you mentioned

4675
02:40:48,879 --> 02:40:53,119
it at the start you know it's obviously

4676
02:40:50,559 --> 02:40:55,439
a very popular line do you have future

4677
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:58,000
plans to work it out further

4678
02:40:55,439 --> 02:41:00,239
i do um i need to get my mail back

4679
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:04,159
luckily before the whole moon situation

4680
02:41:00,239 --> 02:41:04,159
i stored my mail with uh cecil

4681
02:41:04,559 --> 02:41:09,278
and uh

4682
02:41:06,478 --> 02:41:11,278
why yeast farms has my mail as well so

4683
02:41:09,279 --> 02:41:13,200
hopefully i can get that back and and

4684
02:41:11,279 --> 02:41:15,840
continue to work the line it's very very

4685
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:17,920
special in uh breeding against dominant

4686
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:19,680
traits like the deep chunk

4687
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:21,920
is notorious for being a really hard

4688
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:23,359
plant to breed with it always always

4689
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:25,520
always dominates everything that it

4690
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:27,520
touches and uh the platinum banana is

4691
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:29,120
one of those lines where it allowed the

4692
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:31,040
best traits of deep chunk to come

4693
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:34,160
through which is the resin production

4694
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:36,080
it's a uh density and

4695
02:41:34,159 --> 02:41:38,159
and its overall look that beauty of the

4696
02:41:36,079 --> 02:41:40,079
blackness that it has

4697
02:41:38,159 --> 02:41:42,000
but it's it's terps aren't that great

4698
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:44,159
and the potency it's okay but it's not

4699
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:46,478
the best and platinum banana allowed the

4700
02:41:44,159 --> 02:41:48,000
best traits to come through and i'm

4701
02:41:46,478 --> 02:41:50,000
really proud of that line the chunky

4702
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,000
monkey line um

4703
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:53,840
as well as the when i crossed into the

4704
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,439
highland tie it allowed the best traits

4705
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:59,279
of the highland tie to come through the

4706
02:41:55,439 --> 02:42:00,720
juicy fruit tie and uh and and kept with

4707
02:41:59,279 --> 02:42:02,880
some of the banana trades kept that

4708
02:42:00,719 --> 02:42:04,239
banana terp i mean when people people

4709
02:42:02,879 --> 02:42:05,759
want banana og it's usually because

4710
02:42:04,239 --> 02:42:07,920
they're searching for banana terps not

4711
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:09,920
because they want og you can find og

4712
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:11,600
anywhere but that banana terp is very

4713
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:13,760
special and it and it brings that to

4714
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:15,279
every line it touches

4715
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:16,960
yeah definitely i'm certainly on the

4716
02:42:15,279 --> 02:42:18,479
lookout for that one but to jump to

4717
02:42:16,959 --> 02:42:20,719
another hybrid

4718
02:42:18,478 --> 02:42:22,398
another male you've been using recently

4719
02:42:20,719 --> 02:42:24,559
you've been working with the skittles

4720
02:42:22,398 --> 02:42:26,478
cube line and i wanted to know what was

4721
02:42:24,559 --> 02:42:28,639
it specifically about that like maybe

4722
02:42:26,478 --> 02:42:31,119
for example it was the structure or like

4723
02:42:28,639 --> 02:42:33,119
the nose or like whatever it may be what

4724
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:35,040
was it about you that drew you towards

4725
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:37,120
that one and what's your plans going

4726
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:38,720
forward with it

4727
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:41,200
i don't have any plans going forward

4728
02:42:38,719 --> 02:42:44,079
with it um what i found in the z cube

4729
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:45,840
line the the mail and how it bred was

4730
02:42:44,079 --> 02:42:47,359
that it actually was nothing like this

4731
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:49,359
girls clone

4732
02:42:47,359 --> 02:42:51,200
and that's what really drew me to it i'm

4733
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:52,559
not i'm not too enthused about the

4734
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:54,800
skittles clone i had a friend that

4735
02:42:52,559 --> 02:42:56,318
pushed me to pop a bunch of the the

4736
02:42:54,799 --> 02:42:57,759
skittle stuff he was saying it's hype

4737
02:42:56,318 --> 02:42:59,920
you know it's got the best [ __ ] this is

4738
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:02,398
what people want i wasn't enthused about

4739
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:04,639
it but also i tried to remember you know

4740
02:43:02,398 --> 02:43:06,559
i have my own views on stuff and maybe i

4741
02:43:04,639 --> 02:43:08,159
need to open up you know and look at a

4742
02:43:06,559 --> 02:43:10,318
way other people view [ __ ] maybe they

4743
02:43:08,159 --> 02:43:11,680
know better than me in modern age with

4744
02:43:10,318 --> 02:43:13,039
modern strains because i don't pay a lot

4745
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:14,000
of attention to it

4746
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:16,000
um

4747
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:18,079
with that said what i found i loved in

4748
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:20,879
it i found an old hindu kush type plant

4749
02:43:18,079 --> 02:43:23,760
that was [ __ ] rank absolutely ranked

4750
02:43:20,879 --> 02:43:25,519
not fruity um it does breed some fruity

4751
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:28,639
traits in certain lines but they're

4752
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:30,479
recessive so you don't see it as often

4753
02:43:28,639 --> 02:43:32,559
but i loved everything it brought to all

4754
02:43:30,478 --> 02:43:34,559
the lines that i crossed with it um it

4755
02:43:32,559 --> 02:43:36,719
just taken it back to a throwback hindu

4756
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:38,799
kush and i thought that was [ __ ] rad

4757
02:43:36,719 --> 02:43:40,478
um but with that said

4758
02:43:38,799 --> 02:43:41,759
it's not very skittles-y

4759
02:43:40,478 --> 02:43:43,519
it's not what people expect from

4760
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:45,680
skittles so there is that but i try to

4761
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:47,279
make that super clear

4762
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:49,040
wow that's it's a really interesting

4763
02:43:47,279 --> 02:43:52,640
point because i've got a friend who's

4764
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:54,240
about to pop the same pack i believe and

4765
02:43:52,639 --> 02:43:56,719
he asked me he said oh do you think i'll

4766
02:43:54,239 --> 02:43:58,318
find like hindu kush

4767
02:43:56,719 --> 02:44:00,159
finos and i was like oh is that the mail

4768
02:43:58,318 --> 02:44:02,159
they used initially and he's like yeah

4769
02:44:00,159 --> 02:44:03,760
and i was like well i mean if it's a bx3

4770
02:44:02,159 --> 02:44:05,279
you probably shouldn't like i mean if

4771
02:44:03,760 --> 02:44:08,000
they've done their job you probably

4772
02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:10,560
shouldn't if they feel about it

4773
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:12,159
if they've done their job like in a bx3

4774
02:44:10,559 --> 02:44:14,478
so back crossing is perfect for

4775
02:44:12,159 --> 02:44:16,719
stabilizing a single trade and i think a

4776
02:44:14,478 --> 02:44:18,879
lot of people because of

4777
02:44:16,719 --> 02:44:21,039
brothers grim specifically with their

4778
02:44:18,879 --> 02:44:24,079
work with c99 telling people that it

4779
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:26,000
makes a a pure representation of a clone

4780
02:44:24,079 --> 02:44:27,120
that's not how it works reading forward

4781
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:29,520
is the way to

4782
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:33,279
lock in several several traits at once

4783
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:35,279
back crossing locks in a single tray um

4784
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:37,359
taking that to the bx3

4785
02:44:35,279 --> 02:44:40,159
it was very uniform i'll say that but it

4786
02:44:37,359 --> 02:44:41,279
was so uniform and and and nothing like

4787
02:44:40,159 --> 02:44:43,359
skittles

4788
02:44:41,279 --> 02:44:45,920
that they'd missed the mark like a

4789
02:44:43,359 --> 02:44:47,439
[ __ ] with it um but i see that

4790
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:48,960
in a lot of that process i don't think

4791
02:44:47,439 --> 02:44:51,359
people understand the purpose of bat

4792
02:44:48,959 --> 02:44:53,039
crossing and i think because of brothers

4793
02:44:51,359 --> 02:44:54,559
grimm saying that you know yeah this is

4794
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:56,560
how you back cross and get a perfect

4795
02:44:54,559 --> 02:44:58,799
representation of the clone because

4796
02:44:56,559 --> 02:45:01,039
technically it's you know 88 of the

4797
02:44:58,799 --> 02:45:02,719
genetics et cetera et cetera that's not

4798
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:04,560
how it really works though it's it's for

4799
02:45:02,719 --> 02:45:07,278
stabilizing a single trait not multiple

4800
02:45:04,559 --> 02:45:09,600
traits um but it was uniform it was

4801
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:10,960
uniform i'll say that in structure and

4802
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:12,239
appearance but it was nothing like

4803
02:45:10,959 --> 02:45:13,599
skittles at all

4804
02:45:12,239 --> 02:45:16,000
with that said

4805
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:18,479
i've seen many people pop z cube and get

4806
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,239
completely different but uniform things

4807
02:45:18,478 --> 02:45:22,000
from that line and i don't know that

4808
02:45:20,239 --> 02:45:24,239
that line was really

4809
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,559
what they said it was

4810
02:45:24,239 --> 02:45:28,559
i don't know that they didn't take that

4811
02:45:26,559 --> 02:45:29,840
line whatever seeds they had and throw

4812
02:45:28,559 --> 02:45:32,079
it into several different lines with

4813
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:34,159
different names that's what i saw when

4814
02:45:32,079 --> 02:45:36,559
popping a big wide swath of the dying

4815
02:45:34,159 --> 02:45:39,439
brain stuff um

4816
02:45:36,559 --> 02:45:42,079
i like shiloh i don't i i think brandon

4817
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:42,079
was a kind of

4818
02:45:44,478 --> 02:45:47,358
clown shoes

4819
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:49,760

4826
02:45:58,239 --> 02:46:02,318
community and just seeing that video

4827
02:45:59,760 --> 02:46:05,200

4832
02:46:10,719 --> 02:46:13,679
hilarious but yeah that dude's a wingnut

4833
02:46:12,639 --> 02:46:16,719
um

4834
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:20,559
shiloh is is is an interesting dude i i

4835
02:46:16,719 --> 02:46:22,318
he's likable but i i don't think that um

4836
02:46:20,559 --> 02:46:25,278
he was as involved with a lot of these

4837
02:46:22,318 --> 02:46:27,119
projects as maybe he should be because

4838
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:29,439
people have all kinds of stories

4839
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:31,279
plants tell the truth and when you pop

4840
02:46:29,439 --> 02:46:32,559
you know 12 different strains from a

4841
02:46:31,279 --> 02:46:33,920
company they're supposed to be 12

4842
02:46:32,559 --> 02:46:35,199
different things and they all look

4843
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:37,520
identical

4844
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:39,200
there's an issue there's an issue

4845
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:41,439
they stuffed the seeds

4846
02:46:39,200 --> 02:46:43,359
they beat and switched

4847
02:46:41,439 --> 02:46:44,639
yeah wow there you go i have to let my

4848
02:46:43,359 --> 02:46:45,520
buddy know

4849
02:46:44,639 --> 02:46:47,199
so

4850
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:48,560
just to jump on to something we spoke

4851
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:50,079
about earlier when you were talking

4852
02:46:48,559 --> 02:46:51,760
about how you know different land races

4853
02:46:50,079 --> 02:46:53,200
perform better outdoors and it's almost

4854
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:54,719
like you know a bit of an injustice to

4855
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:56,720
do them indoors

4856
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:59,199
what are some land race lines that you

4857
02:46:56,719 --> 02:47:00,559
would really love to see pop their heads

4858
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:02,000
up you know not necessarily that you

4859
02:47:00,559 --> 02:47:03,278
think will because like you know

4860
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,959
someone's got the seeds or whatever but

4861
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:06,800
you would just be really stoked if they

4862
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:08,318
did happen

4863
02:47:06,799 --> 02:47:10,879
i'd like to see the lines that i

4864
02:47:08,318 --> 02:47:13,119
selected of colombian black to pop up

4865
02:47:10,879 --> 02:47:14,159
that gage green uh used and claimed as

4866
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:15,200
his own

4867
02:47:14,159 --> 02:47:17,680
um

4868
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:19,520
i'd like to see that pop back up and

4869
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:23,439
with that said that was from brazilian

4870
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:25,279
seed co who is a well-known scammer um

4871
02:47:23,439 --> 02:47:27,120
one of one of uh

4872
02:47:25,279 --> 02:47:28,880
kind of our circle's friends went over

4873
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:29,920
to his operation and saw how he was

4874
02:47:28,879 --> 02:47:32,239
running it and it was all

4875
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:34,559
cross-contamination cross-pollination so

4876
02:47:32,239 --> 02:47:35,600
calling that line colombian black may

4877
02:47:34,559 --> 02:47:38,398
not be

4878
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:40,880
a truism you know but it was the li what

4879
02:47:38,398 --> 02:47:42,559
he called the line and that specific

4880
02:47:40,879 --> 02:47:44,000
line was really special and a lot of

4881
02:47:42,559 --> 02:47:46,959
people used it over the years but i'd

4882
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:48,478
like to see it come back pure um i think

4883
02:47:46,959 --> 02:47:50,959
gage released it in something he called

4884
02:47:48,478 --> 02:47:52,639
a bastard series which was

4885
02:47:50,959 --> 02:47:54,159
probably because i selected it and he

4886
02:47:52,639 --> 02:47:56,398
just wanted to [ __ ]

4887
02:47:54,159 --> 02:48:00,318
throw shade you know but it was special

4888
02:47:56,398 --> 02:48:02,079
but it was a long 23 week 26 week line

4889
02:48:00,318 --> 02:48:04,639
yeah dude i think i actually had some of

4890
02:48:02,079 --> 02:48:07,200
those seeds before uh my seed collection

4891
02:48:04,639 --> 02:48:08,959
a few years back got stolen so

4892
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:11,200
damn

4893
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:13,519
yeah that's that hurts

4894
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:15,359
yeah i feel like you haven't haven't

4895
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:17,760
really been in the community for very

4896
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:19,279
long if you haven't had it happen to you

4897
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:20,719
oh yeah that's for sure dude it'll

4898
02:48:19,279 --> 02:48:22,079
happen at some point

4899
02:48:20,719 --> 02:48:23,278
that's it man

4900
02:48:22,079 --> 02:48:24,959
so

4901
02:48:23,279 --> 02:48:27,200
what are some of the boxes that you're

4902
02:48:24,959 --> 02:48:28,639
looking for like a strain or a clone to

4903
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:30,720
tick before you bring it into the

4904
02:48:28,639 --> 02:48:33,039
library and are you regularly looking to

4905
02:48:30,719 --> 02:48:34,398
bring new things into the library or are

4906
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:37,439
you just kind of waiting for something

4907
02:48:34,398 --> 02:48:40,398
special to more so present itself

4908
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:42,960
you know i go off um i don't really go

4909
02:48:40,398 --> 02:48:44,799
hunting i don't trade a lot with people

4910
02:48:42,959 --> 02:48:46,799
with that said i brought a lot in after

4911
02:48:44,799 --> 02:48:49,358
the moon incident but i don't do a lot

4912
02:48:46,799 --> 02:48:50,879
of trading um which is funny because i

4913
02:48:49,359 --> 02:48:52,559
you know i've been accused of stealing

4914
02:48:50,879 --> 02:48:53,679
clones from people's rooms and [ __ ] and

4915
02:48:52,559 --> 02:48:56,079
i'm a hermit i don't go into other

4916
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:57,760
people's rooms and i don't trade i don't

4917
02:48:56,079 --> 02:48:58,398
like trading it's not a big thing that i

4918
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:01,120
do

4919
02:48:58,398 --> 02:49:03,119
because of of certain things like that

4920
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:05,680
um

4921
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:07,279
i when i look for bringing something in

4922
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:09,279
it's usually because someone i really

4923
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:11,920
respect and trust tells me this [ __ ] is

4924
02:49:09,279 --> 02:49:14,000
[ __ ] insane you've got to try it um a

4925
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:16,239
lot of my friends know that

4926
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:18,159
personally like for my smoke i can't

4927
02:49:16,239 --> 02:49:20,959
smoke afghani based stuff it makes me

4928
02:49:18,159 --> 02:49:23,119
paranoid and depressed so if they tell

4929
02:49:20,959 --> 02:49:25,519
me it's something that's really special

4930
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:27,760
on a spectrum of of something that i can

4931
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:29,200
smoke and enjoy that's something that

4932
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:31,120
that interests me especially if i

4933
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:33,040
respect that person and know that they

4934
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:35,840
really know good weed

4935
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:38,240
yeah yeah definitely on to our last

4936
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:42,079
questions before the quickfire ones

4937
02:49:38,239 --> 02:49:43,119
it incorporates your favorite person sub

4938
02:49:42,079 --> 02:49:44,079
cool

4939
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:45,439
oh yeah

4940
02:49:44,079 --> 02:49:47,600
here we go

4941
02:49:45,439 --> 02:49:48,479
yeah no buddy of everyone

4942
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:50,640
so

4943
02:49:48,478 --> 02:49:52,639
some people say that certain parents

4944
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:56,000
contribute certain uh traits to

4945
02:49:52,639 --> 02:49:59,278
offsprings you know and sub says that

4946
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:01,600
the male is what imparts the potency and

4947
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:02,800
the female is more like the structure

4948
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:04,880
have you ever found anything like

4949
02:50:02,799 --> 02:50:06,639
yourself or do you just find it's a mix

4950
02:50:04,879 --> 02:50:08,239
of random traits expressed from each

4951
02:50:06,639 --> 02:50:09,519
parent and there's no like hard fast

4952
02:50:08,239 --> 02:50:10,959
rule of thumb

4953
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:12,640
there's there's definitely no hard fast

4954
02:50:10,959 --> 02:50:14,079
rule of thumb science tells us that

4955
02:50:12,639 --> 02:50:15,760
different different traits align

4956
02:50:14,079 --> 02:50:18,398
differently with different parents it's

4957
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:20,079
there's no that is such a odd blanket

4958
02:50:18,398 --> 02:50:21,199
statement and tells me he has no [ __ ]

4959
02:50:20,079 --> 02:50:23,279
clue what he's talking about when it

4960
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:26,000
comes to breeding um everything is a

4961
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:28,239
case-by-case uh basis not just strain by

4962
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:30,000
strain but fino by fino how those traits

4963
02:50:28,239 --> 02:50:32,079
will and alleles will align with align

4964
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:34,079
with each other so yeah there's no way

4965
02:50:32,079 --> 02:50:37,039
to do that with that said i remember

4966
02:50:34,079 --> 02:50:39,279
neville saying specifically with hayes

4967
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:41,520
that he did not like how the female haze

4968
02:50:39,279 --> 02:50:43,120
bred but he liked how the male hazes

4969
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:45,279
bread that it imparted the best traits

4970
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:46,880
of haze and with someone like that that

4971
02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:49,520
worked so extensively with the haze i

4972
02:50:46,879 --> 02:50:52,079
would i would probably uh listened to

4973
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:54,399
him in that fashion but with that said

4974
02:50:52,079 --> 02:50:57,039
it won't be always indicate it's a case

4975
02:50:54,398 --> 02:50:59,599
by case and parent by parent and uh

4976
02:50:57,040 --> 02:51:01,439
basis you know you really have to

4977
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:03,600
to keep that in mind in science things

4978
02:51:01,439 --> 02:51:05,359
don't line up necessarily all the time

4979
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:07,760
the same ways

4980
02:51:05,359 --> 02:51:10,800
yeah for sure for sure

4993
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:42,079
uh

4994
02:51:39,359 --> 02:51:43,359

4995
02:51:42,079 --> 02:51:45,120
um

4996
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:47,520

found from anything for being true

5002
02:51:55,040 --> 02:52:00,399
breeding and breeding amazing trades

5003

5005
02:52:02,559 --> 02:52:05,840
yeah i think you even mentioned bubba

5006
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:08,559
sativa in the mix as well so there's

5007
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:11,200
some consistency i dig i dig it so

5008
02:52:08,559 --> 02:52:13,359

5009
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:16,000
your opinion

5010
02:52:13,359 --> 02:52:17,680
buckeye purple

yeah yeah i remember see

5013
02:52:20,159 --> 02:52:23,279
there are a few people

5014
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:26,318
that would be

5015
02:52:23,279 --> 02:52:28,720
a lot less respected if c depot the old

5016
02:52:26,318 --> 02:52:30,318
forum was still around but they scammed

5017
02:52:28,719 --> 02:52:31,278
a lot of people so they shut their forum

5018
02:52:30,318 --> 02:52:32,959
down

5019
02:52:31,279 --> 02:52:35,040
but there are a few people from that

5020
02:52:32,959 --> 02:52:37,119
forum that have made some really bold

5021
02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:39,439
claims lately whether they're saying

5022
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:40,960
that urkel is from their family or

5023
02:52:39,439 --> 02:52:42,159
they're saying they created buckeye

5024
02:52:40,959 --> 02:52:44,879
purple out of all northern lights

5025
02:52:42,159 --> 02:52:46,478
genetics that you know this and that um

5026
02:52:44,879 --> 02:52:48,799
melvan

5027
02:52:46,478 --> 02:52:50,639
she started

5028
02:52:48,799 --> 02:52:52,719
not that many years ago it was during

5029
02:52:50,639 --> 02:52:55,119
the sea depot days we all saw her first

5030
02:52:52,719 --> 02:52:57,599
grows we saw her bragging about buying

5031
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:58,479
bodies you know recently released nl5

5032
02:52:57,600 --> 02:53:00,880
line

5033
02:52:58,478 --> 02:53:03,199
and uh we saw the trash that she was

5034
02:53:00,879 --> 02:53:06,000
putting out there known as as buckeye

5035
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:08,800
purple it's garb um

5036
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:11,359
people probably hadn't been

5037
02:53:08,799 --> 02:53:13,199
as as knowledgeable about chitrali and

5038
02:53:11,359 --> 02:53:14,960
its beautiful magenta traits and and

5039
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:16,960
stuff that it throws and that it dries

5040
02:53:14,959 --> 02:53:19,679
pretty brown for the most part and

5041
02:53:16,959 --> 02:53:21,278
smells like hay and they look at that it

5042
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:23,439
looks pretty in magenta and that's new

5043
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:25,279
to them so they go for it but i have

5044
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:28,159

5076
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:33,680
we'll definitely leave that in

5077
02:54:30,829 --> 02:54:36,159
[Laughter]

5078
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:38,639
alrighty so next question you're on a

5079
02:54:36,159 --> 02:54:40,159
desert island you can only take two

5080
02:54:38,639 --> 02:54:41,760
strains with you you don't have to

5081
02:54:40,159 --> 02:54:44,879
cultivate him you've just somehow got an

5082
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:46,478
endless supply what two

5083
02:54:44,879 --> 02:54:48,559
um if i were gonna cultivate him it

5084
02:54:46,478 --> 02:54:50,559
would be nl5 and haze

5085
02:54:48,559 --> 02:54:52,559
just because i know how much variance

5086
02:54:50,559 --> 02:54:54,959
comes from nl5 haze and how much amazing

5087
02:54:52,559 --> 02:54:56,719
[ __ ] uh has resulted from it

5088
02:54:54,959 --> 02:54:59,358
if i only had it to smoke right barry

5089
02:54:56,719 --> 02:55:01,278
and bubba sativa and maybe maybe silver

5090
02:54:59,359 --> 02:55:03,279
pearl maybe silver pearl in there i'm

5091
02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:05,279
pretty a pretty big fan of the silver

5092
02:55:03,279 --> 02:55:07,120
pearl cut pips has

5093
02:55:05,279 --> 02:55:09,359
man that's one that doesn't get a lot of

5094
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:11,359
you know good publicity and i always

5095
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:13,200
thought maybe it was because like early

5096
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:14,880
pearl was like you know more of like

5097
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:17,279
that cash crop of variety and obviously

5098
02:55:14,879 --> 02:55:19,599
it used silver pearl what's what's the

5099
02:55:17,279 --> 02:55:21,760
real silver pearl like

5100
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:24,399
um if you if you go and look at his feed

5101
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:26,800
i i suggest that anybody who listens to

5102
02:55:24,398 --> 02:55:28,719
this goes and checks out at that sign

5103
02:55:26,799 --> 02:55:31,438
pip sweet on instagram he's got

5104
02:55:28,719 --> 02:55:33,519
beautiful pictures up of it it's it it's

5105
02:55:31,439 --> 02:55:36,720
it's very photogenic like any modern

5106
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:39,760
variety crazy resin production it is not

5107
02:55:36,719 --> 02:55:42,398
narcotic potent it is it is not it's a

5108
02:55:39,760 --> 02:55:44,559
very clear-headed quality sativa type

5109
02:55:42,398 --> 02:55:46,719
high on an indica frame what people

5110
02:55:44,559 --> 02:55:47,840
would normally associate with a sativa

5111
02:55:46,719 --> 02:55:49,438
type high

5112
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:50,719
you can find that high in afghanis you

5113
02:55:49,439 --> 02:55:53,040
can find it everywhere it's not

5114
02:55:50,719 --> 02:55:54,559
necessarily a sativa type high but it's

5115
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:56,479
what people would normally associate

5116
02:55:54,559 --> 02:55:59,039
with sativas and i [ __ ] love that

5117
02:55:56,478 --> 02:56:02,159
thing plus my girlfriend has lupus and

5118
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:04,479
it treats the nausea from lupus for her

5119
02:56:02,159 --> 02:56:06,639
insanely nothing treats it better and uh

5120
02:56:04,478 --> 02:56:08,398
yeah that that's that's it's a special

5121
02:56:06,639 --> 02:56:09,680
plan

5122
02:56:08,398 --> 02:56:11,278
there you go something we all need to

5123
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:12,398
keep an eye out for

5124
02:56:11,279 --> 02:56:13,920

5125
02:56:12,398 --> 02:56:15,439

5126
02:56:13,920 --> 02:56:17,040

5130
02:56:21,279 --> 02:56:25,120
our interview today

5131
02:56:22,879 --> 02:56:26,639
what is one strain

5132
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:27,680
where if you could go back in time and

5133
02:56:26,639 --> 02:56:29,519
get it

5134
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:32,000
you would the one you would pick to go

5135
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:34,720
back and kind of save from being lost to

5136
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:39,840
uh you know the ages

5137
02:56:34,719 --> 02:56:39,840
steve murphy's afghani or the afghan tea

5138
02:56:40,318 --> 02:56:43,199
you're gonna have to fill us in a little

5139
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:45,680
more on what they are

5140
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:47,439
so steve murphy's afghani is the basis

5141
02:56:45,680 --> 02:56:48,880
for all northern lights uh northern

5142
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:50,800
lights one through

5143
02:56:48,879 --> 02:56:52,719
twelve i believe we're all based on the

5144
02:56:50,799 --> 02:56:55,358
steve murphy afghani line each with

5145
02:56:52,719 --> 02:56:58,079
different parents combined in it

5146
02:56:55,359 --> 02:56:59,920
afghan tea is what neville said was the

5147
02:56:58,079 --> 02:57:02,000
basis for

5148
02:56:59,920 --> 02:57:04,239
super skunk and he said it was from the

5149
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:06,879
maple leaf line but i don't believe that

5150
02:57:04,239 --> 02:57:09,279
i think it's an afghani one selection

5151
02:57:06,879 --> 02:57:12,000
and it's responsible for all the chems

5152
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:14,479
all the sours all the og's that's that

5153
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:16,478
that's that special special plant and i

5154
02:57:14,478 --> 02:57:19,039
think that's why i would choose those

5155
02:57:16,478 --> 02:57:20,639
two specific lines um you know there's

5156
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:22,640
chocolate tie and other lines i'd love

5157
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:26,000
to see but if i had to go back and

5158
02:57:22,639 --> 02:57:28,318
rescue two strains it would be those two

5159
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:29,279
what a fantastic selection

5160
02:57:28,318 --> 02:57:31,439
