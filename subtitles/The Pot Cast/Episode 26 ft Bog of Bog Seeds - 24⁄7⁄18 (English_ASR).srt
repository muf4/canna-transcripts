well thank you for having me daddy i

appreciate it and i'm happy to talk to

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,039
your folks this would be great

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
so a little deviation from the normal

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
first question what are you currently

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,118
smoking on at the moment

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,200
well my wife and i are old school you

32
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,920
know been smoking many years together

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
and

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,200
uh we're smoking my sour bubble it's an

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,799
elite breeder clone that we've had like

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,040
17 years now

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,600
and sour bubble is really a very unusual

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
selection out of my straight bubble gum

39
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,399
it was supposed to be straight bubble

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,720
gum it was

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,280
bubble gum from amsterdam

42
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,640
and i called it bog bubble my version of

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,359
it you know

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,799
and and we grew that for years

45
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,200
every once in a while and with the

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
originals that we noticed that there

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,600
were

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,159
an occasional different phenotype and it

49
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,639
wasn't always exactly the same but

50
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,479
compared to bubble gum

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:17,919
the sour bubble as i called it

52
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,840
was a darker green and looked a lot

53
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,878
lot its leaf structure and plant

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,439
structure

55
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,598
like 398 bubba kush

56
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,878
and uh it doesn't quite have that kind

57
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,280
of flavor

58
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,479
but it's kind of uh

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,120
almost as cushy as bubble gummy you know

60
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,199
for like above a kush it's kind of

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,080
unusually cushy

62
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,639
and we had it uh

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,519
tested when we originally

64
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:49,598
had that clone cut and that was

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,800
up in anna when we lived in bozeman

66
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,560
and it was 30.5

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,439
resin weight

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,199
uh now that's all the thcs and the cbds

69
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,280
and all that put together

70
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,878
but back at that time

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,158
which was like you know 2001 i think

72
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,518
that was a really really high thc clone

73
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,598
that we selected out of the bubble

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,800
government was normally

75
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,959
uh

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,080
much lower you know

77
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,959
more in the range of around 20 percent

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,799
thc usually just delicious and

79
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,640
everything you know but

80
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000
this was a lot stronger and a lot

81
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,039
tighter

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,439
and maybe didn't yield quite as much but

83
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,359
we had that sour bubble clone and we all

84
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,400
just loved it you know

85
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
the uh

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,640
the high is really quite indica sided

87
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:46,079
it's probably my most indica strain and

88
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:50,399
it uh even has a little trait of the uh

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,959
leaf hands where like pre-98 bubba kush

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,280
one of the tiniest little leaves

91
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,680
sticks up like a finger like you know

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,598
the three stooges is called a teacup

93
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
with their little finger sticking out

94
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,199
somebody's showing me a picture of their

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,560
pre-98 bubba

96
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,158
wow and so when you found the sour

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
bubble clone

98
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,519
was your first thought like i want to

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,598
find the male version of this since you

100
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,319
had the seed stock

101
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,599
well yes exactly and you know what this

102
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,798
is the thing

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,560
uh i had or two or three of these

104
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,399
different versions and we decided this

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,360
clone this was this was it we were just

106
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:30,159
calling it super bog bubble at the time

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,199
and my son who's also you know all he's

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
a

109
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,919
42 year old man down he was a man at the

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
time

111
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,240
was was helping me and he he decided and

112
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,680
i did that this was the one we

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,478
definitely wanted to

114
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,400
keep

115
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,879
just and breed with it

116
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,679
well we were growing from seed

117
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:51,040
commercially up there in montana now i

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,720
may have inadvertently um

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,080
violated a few statutes but in montana

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,600
uh you may a man's home mrs castle and

121
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,279
you can pretty much do what you want to

122
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,280
do in your home

123
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,359
and they they can't get a search warrant

124
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,599
for in a private owner's home at all

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,038
even if they think they're fairly safe

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
growing our own way there we did it back

127
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,560
in michigan too

128
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,879
but uh we

129
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,800
had kept growing the bog bubble

130
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,879
which was supposed to be straight bubble

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,079
gum but was obviously really above a

132
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,439
kush

133
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,639
and uh

134
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,759
it took

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,800
two years of continuously growing from

136
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
seed

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,918
uh to come up with the mail and i

138
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,680
finally did and it just it just appeared

139
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,639
and you could smell it and you could see

140
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,360
it and it was obviously a sour bubble

141
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,600
mail and it was like you know a gift

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,038
from above i mean honestly i had been

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,560
hoping and not seeing anything like it

144
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,399
because it's quite different than the

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,280
bubblegum version that i have you know

146
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,519
isolated in the blog bubble side and so

147
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,638
we were able then to make that first

148
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:59,599
cross and then keep back crossing to

149
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,960
uh the original clone selection

150
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,240
and the sour bubble became a big hit

151
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,159
back at the same time on overgrow

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
which was like you know the big mega

153
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,720
site back then

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,759
that the guy i sent my seeds to

155
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,160
came out with what was called og kush

156
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,639
and it was the first ochi kush

157
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
that any of us that overgrow

158
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
oh i know there's all kinds of stories

159
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,279
about where it came from but uh i knew

160
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,159
that he had it and he sent me seeds and

161
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,279
clones of his version and i knew that we

162
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
both had

163
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,519
you know different versions and i didn't

164
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,799
you know i didn't call mine that i

165
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:43,120
i came up with the name sour bubble

166
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,199
right and who was that person online

167
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,840
well i don't remember

168
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,319
it's a long time ago and the guy did

169
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,679
acknowledge this his clone no longer

170
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,680
exists

171
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,959
um this would be something to be

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,038
investigated but you know i mean back in

173
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,198
the day we just you know knew each other

174
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,519
by names and stuff and didn't keep

175
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,280
anybody's names or addresses but

176
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,560
i had sent him

177
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,399
my bog bubble seeds and my boggle gum

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,079
seeds which is blog bubble cross with

179
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:16,318
nl5

180
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:18,800
and that he had had selected this clone

181
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,199
out of either one or the other okay i'm

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
not even sure which one but i had

183
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,160
assumed

184
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,160
out of the bog bubble

185
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
yep

186
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,319
so if we take a step back all the way to

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,000
the start now before we get too deep

188
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,120
into things what was your first

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,120
experience with cannabis

190
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,199
oh wow

191
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,639
well that was a long time ago

192
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,280
i think i was

193
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,478
only 13 years old

194
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,799
and i had moved from birmingham michigan

195
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,478
to algonac michigan which was on the

196
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,160
water on the saint clare river which is

197
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,918
part of the great lakes system and

198
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,879
beautiful

199
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:59,519
and the new friends i met and we

200
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,400
had boats and stuff and we could go camp

201
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,038
on this island called go island

202
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,918
and it was just paradise for like young

203
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,000
teenagers no parents and

204
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,839
you know i mean we could take beer or

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,478
anything well one of my friends from

206
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,878
birmingham came up to visit and go with

207
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,918
us to do this and he had brought some

208
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,759
pot

209
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,399
for me to try

210
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,038
and i don't know why but he didn't even

211
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,519
want to smoke it he had just gotten it

212
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,839
was like enough to fill up by a good

213
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,918
sized tobacco pipe and probably had a

214
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,278
few seeds in it you know

215
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,439
and anyhow

216
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,958
i was the only one

217
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,120
who smoked it

218
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,958
and we got to the island we set up our

219
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,879
little tent or whatever

220
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,598
and everybody was having a great time

221
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,080
and

222
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,399
i remember i sat down and i smoked that

223
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,959
whole pipe load i mean we were we were

224
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,839
cigarette smokers anyhow so i i didn't

225
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,399
have much trouble at age

226
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,560
token down that big tobacco pipe full of

227
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,200
weed and it was probably like some

228
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,679
mexican weed with a few seeds in it

229
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,680
and i got a damn good buzz off it i mean

230
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,479
it took me about 15 minutes to smoke it

231
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,519
i think

232
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,399
and this was a fun night let me tell you

233
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,959
man

234
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,399
this island is only about i don't know

235
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:20,000
half a mile long and it's just sand with

236
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,480
a few trees on it i guess and you can

237
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,559
run around the whole damn thing in about

238
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
half an hour probably

239
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,239
but

240
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,719
i mean it was two or three other guys

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,519
were out there after i got high and

242
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,278
running around on the beach and

243
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
fooling around the water and i was just

244
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,600
stoned and i've never been stoned before

245
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,839
i didn't really know all i knew was i

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
was happy i was having a good time

247
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,279
and before i knew it there i see that

248
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
they're laughing at me

249
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:50,000
and this is my one little friend who had

250
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,800
brought the tobacco up i mean the the

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,720
marijuana up for me to smoke

252
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,639
uh he was laughing the hardest and it

253
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,759
looked to me like he was he was putting

254
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,360
his his pecker away and what's going on

255
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,759
here and he said you didn't even notice

256
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,440
did you and i said what he says i peed

257
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,639
on your leg

258
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,000
you know we're like standing in the

259
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:13,759
water but no i had not i had not felt

260
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,440
any pee hit my leg i said it did not

261
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,439
you know so anyhow

262
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,079
that was the first uh

263
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,760
you know adventure i guess on pot and

264
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,519
you know i could tell you what happened

265
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,639
is we fooled around out there for a

266
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,639
while

267
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,360
we ended up i went back to the tent i

268
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:33,679
had the munchies like mad i didn't

269
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,079
i i actually i ate like a dozen donuts

270
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,479
and drank like a two liter bottle of

271
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,399
cola

272
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,959
and i probably smoked about a pack of

273
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,958
cigarettes i had a damn good night

274
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,480
that's a great story i like that a lot

275
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,359
so

276
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,720
from there did you you know decide that

277
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
weed was your thing and you began to

278
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,920
smoke it regularly or was there some

279
00:10:54,078 --> 00:11:00,719
time before you become like a regular

280
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:02,639
smoker and got really engulfed in it

281
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,399
well that's interesting i did love it

282
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,720
and i i don't think that was actually

283
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,200
one of those like totally addicting

284
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,079
moments though because no i wasn't right

285
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,480
out seeking it or anything like that and

286
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,958
it seems to me though

287
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,079
that the next time i got high

288
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:24,000
uh that a buddy of mine and i

289
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,679
and i don't know

290
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,919
i can't remember that

291
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,319
but we got high we went to a carnival

292
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,319
and we rode the loophole plane

293
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,079
and you know the one where you hold the

294
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
break and the eggs sort of go upside

295
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,559
down

296
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,480
well it

297
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,078
you lose all the change in your pockets

298
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,959
of course and you know that's how they

299
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,759
get a little extra money for the carnies

300
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,838
but we had a ball on that ride i

301
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,679
remember that ride i mean the buddy yes

302
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,480
making that thing spin and we were so

303
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,879
high

304
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,039
and that was the second time and that

305
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,919
was the time that i really thought geez

306
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,719
i've got to have this weed more often so

307
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:03,759
i think it took a couple of happy

308
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,360
evenings on it to then be convinced you

309
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,200
know and i and i was then getting in

310
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,039
there

311
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
at an age of like

312
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,000
uh

313
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,039
for sure by 16 but but i think

314
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,839
at 15 i i had weed about half of the

315
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,519
time because we could get bags of weed

316
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,519
wasn't very good

317
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,399
but a lid of weed which was like you

318
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,799
know maybe a half an ounce even

319
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,320
for for as little as 10 bucks

320
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,479
maybe 12 bucks

321
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,160
and it was a guy named chief

322
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,920
that we had indians that lived across

323
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,078
the river

324
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,000
so in algonac it wasn't too hard to find

325
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,199
a guy named chief who might sell a kid

326
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,519
some weed

327
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,680
and uh being a buddy could could get a

328
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,679
lid from him for 12 usually

329
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,720
damn that's good

330
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,240
so

331
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,839
at what point did you decide you wanted

332
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,560
to start growing yourself and not just

333
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,959
be a buyer

334
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,439
well uh we

335
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,319
even teenagers in high school were

336
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,680
experimenting with growing pot we lived

337
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,839
in michigan

338
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,719
which is a very northerly state in the

339
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,320
u.s and you know you you

340
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,600
you get a fairly well of course we

341
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,240
didn't really have the right kind of

342
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,000
seeds it would finish early enough

343
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,600
but i remember that we were growing a

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,120
few plants in the woods behind a friend

345
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,320
of mine's house

346
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,320
uh back when we were only like 15.

347
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,639
but we weren't having much success but

348
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,879
we got some leads and i remember

349
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,759
that his name was todd and

350
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,919
and he was uh he had a bag of

351
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,319
leaves you know they chopped up and of

352
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,879
course we smoked some of them

353
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,079
and he was actually rolling joints and

354
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,120
selling joints in school and as i recall

355
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,439
they were

356
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,560
uh you know like

357
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,480
uh really cheap you know like

358
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,399
i can't remember how she made they might

359
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,920
even be as cheap as three for a dollar

360
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,919
and uh you know like 50 cent joints

361
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,759
so that's what i recall and they really

362
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,198
really weren't worth any more than that

363
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,838
because you know they couldn't have had

364
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,958
like more than a half of a percent of

365
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,240
thc

366
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,159
but you know

367
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
when your kids

368
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,838
bought anything you can get right

369
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,838
make it work

370
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,879
that's

371
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,120
we did actually though uh start trying

372
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,000
to grow in earnest shortly after i got

373
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,959
married

374
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,198
uh

375
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:32,078
my my wife and i got married when we

376
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,078
were 18 years old and not because we had

377
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,958
two we had been going steady into high

378
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,479
school years for two and a half three

379
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,359
years

380
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
she's a wonderful girl and uh pat and i

381
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,278
uh

382
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,839
got married and then we had this

383
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,240
apartment for a year up at the college

384
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,440
where i was going to school

385
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,600
and uh my dad bought an old farmhouse

386
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,240
just because he was buying the property

387
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,920
up in that area and i had some family up

388
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,159
there in

389
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,639
central michigan

390
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,480
and so you know oh there was this old

391
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,000
vacant house i went looked at it and

392
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,278
asked if i could live in there and he

393
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,600
said sure

394
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,159
so uh once we were out there which is

395
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,959
like when i probably was less than 19 i

396
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,759
was probably still 18.

397
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,719
we were growing weed outside and

398
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,639
uh

399
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,680
you know i was working on outdoor

400
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,519
growing

401
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,159
and it was kind of difficult but you

402
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,440
know i had some limited success

403
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:33,838
and we were still usually mostly

404
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,639
having to buy her from somebody

405
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,199
but you know we we always managed to

406
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,680
have a little bit of it around and did

407
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:44,319
eventually get better at growing

408
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:47,120
i did eventually get some plants to

409
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,000
flower in the summertime and realize

410
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,159
how good cincimelia could be

411
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,679
and that was before i really even knew

412
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,278
what it was

413
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,278
and that was probably in about

414
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,078
74

415
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,519
right

416
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:07,039
the uh

417
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,600
really what helped me living in michigan

418
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,919
was they came out with something called

419
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,720
a halide light

420
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:18,639
and i was already growing indoors before

421
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,639
the halided light was invented

422
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,479
and i had been doing high output

423
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
fluorescence

424
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,159
grow tubes that were like eight feet

425
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,879
long

426
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:31,838
and i also had some regular fluorescence

427
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,039
and four foot things and so i had a room

428
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,519
that could

429
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:39,679
uh it was you know equivalent to maybe a

430
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,560
thousand watt room now or something like

431
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,638
that one big row of plants

432
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,799
and i had some limited success with that

433
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,198
but then the limited genetics that i was

434
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,159
able to obtain back then

435
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,319
uh i would tend to get things that were

436
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,399
you know that would run under lights

437
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,440
like that so when the halide light came

438
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,839
out

439
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,800
all of a sudden i was able to grow top

440
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,400
grade since amelia

441
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,918
and uh i

442
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
had also

443
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,038
upgraded from my own seeds that i had

444
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,720
worked on for years you know even back

445
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,838
in michigan

446
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,798
uh but that i had then brought out to

447
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,359
montana when i moved out there

448
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,679
and in earnest started trying to you

449
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,599
know work on seeds and i even

450
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,038
well i went through a whole progression

451
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,719
of different stages but finally got some

452
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,000
genetics from

453
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,640
amsterdam and some from canada

454
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,798
uh and that sort of got my company

455
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,799
started without intending to

456
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,160
okay and the stuff you were working on

457
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,079
prior to that did you do you still use

458
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,798
any of that at all or is it kind of just

459
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,798
being outdated

460
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,159
well the the first things that i worked

461
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,400
was were from michigan and some of it

462
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,558
was just bag seed

463
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,600
that i had crossed to this one strain

464
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,440
that a friend of mine had in michigan

465
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,599
and uh

466
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,160
you know he had an indoor halide light

467
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,279
too but he had done some outdoor growing

468
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,480
there

469
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,119
and

470
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,200
his strain was called blanchard strain

471
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,959
which blanchard's a small town in

472
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,558
central michigan

473
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,079
very rural

474
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,599
but his his

475
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,240
plan i remember was just delicious

476
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:31,599
and i cried i had you know what i called

477
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,679
red was my own original first strain

478
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,639
and uh my strain red

479
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,320
tasted good and and people liked it

480
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,559
but uh

481
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,960
his strain the blanchard strain was a

482
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,480
lot stronger and it seemed more

483
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,120
indicated

484
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,839
and very sweet and it must have had some

485
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,918
skunk in it it seems to me

486
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,159
and and i'm not sure what else but it

487
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,559
was a very sweet

488
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,519
with the very bitter skunky leaves you

489
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,200
know

490
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,200
and it just

491
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,919
hard to say for sure i mean it wasn't

492
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,400
like anything from local

493
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,520
but uh stuff that had been around back

494
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,360
when

495
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:15,119
uh the grateful dead were passing out

496
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,119
is there something like a long time ago

497
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,038
well yeah

498
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,038
and if they

499
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:26,319
actually neither of those strains

500
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,000
ended up in any of

501
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,240
the world once we were selling seeds so

502
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,798
no i don't have those anymore they're

503
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,120
just be so old now they wouldn't work

504
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,400
i have had luck with seeds older than 10

505
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:44,879
years old and i do keep old seeds

506
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,880
but no i don't have those anymore

507
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,720
in when you look on your library with

508
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,200
all the genetics you've collected over

509
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
the years is there any older stock that

510
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,720
you've got in there that you might want

511
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,319
to work with but you're thinking oh it's

512
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,279
a bit old i might not really be able to

513
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,279
get it to germinate

514
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,558
oh i see what you're saying well

515
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,919
we of course are always working on

516
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,200
something new

517
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,640
and uh

518
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,480
with my

519
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,880
company and the way i do things

520
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,558
sometimes it's a long time between a new

521
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,520
strain because

522
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:22,158
we got up to like 15 strains and

523
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:24,558
uh it became difficult as a small

524
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,080
mom-and-pop operation to keep them all

525
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,558
in stock

526
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:31,279
and i don't like discontinuing strengths

527
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,798
too much because i you know my niche is

528
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,678
old school and i

529
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,558
try to preserve the genetics as i got

530
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,679
them

531
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:42,720
originally now i i have wonderful

532
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,960
genetics that i was gifted by friends

533
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,038
that people when they knew that i was a

534
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,759
breeder at overgrow and we were actually

535
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,000
selling my seeds worldwide

536
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,960
well i was the first american breeder to

537
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,240
sell seeds worldwide through gypsy

538
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,079
uh

539
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,359
nobody was doing that from here and then

540
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:04,079
i brought a couple other guys in

541
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,038
reservoir seeds red dog he became a big

542
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,240
deal

543
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,919
and you know

544
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,079
he was a friend of mine and i was the

545
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,159
one who talked gypsy into

546
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,918
bringing him in because he had so many

547
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,320
good genetics you know

548
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,280
but in my old school genetics and res

549
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,480
dog would say this that that bog had the

550
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,759
gum

551
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:27,200
and the fact is that the way we worked

552
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,319
and progressed in each of our strains

553
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,840
all my strains have bubble gum in them

554
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:35,678
they used to call me the bubble gum guru

555
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,759
there's a little story about the bubble

556
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,840
gum that i'd like to tell you

557
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,839
you know when i was a little kid

558
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,639
i was a little businessman of a little

559
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,480
kid

560
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,038
i was always uh

561
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,679
thinking about how to buy something

562
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,359
cheap and sell it high honestly i mean

563
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,400
when i was only

564
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:58,798
10 years old i was buying and selling

565
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:02,000
switchblade knives i got some from italy

566
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,720
and i also when we were traveling

567
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,359
managed to to gamble and use slot

568
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,079
machines and make money and

569
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,719
so i was always thinking about this well

570
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,279
when i was really young one of the first

571
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,759
times i got any money in my hand it was

572
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,000
like five dollars you know

573
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,558
and i went down to the horse stable

574
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,640
where they sold publica

575
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,879
now that's why this story is because i

576
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,919
got a box with 500 pieces of bubble gum

577
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,240
in it and that was my first stash

578
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,640
this was the gateway drug they talked

579
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,759
about pure sugar and it tasted like

580
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,159
bubble gum

581
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,319
so i took that box of bubble gum and i

582
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,880
took it home and i guess i had to stash

583
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,558
it somewhere so i hid it in the garage

584
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,919
and i found a spot in the garage and

585
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,158
luckily the mice didn't get them or

586
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,880
maybe they got some and i didn't know

587
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,440
but

588
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,440
i used to go and grab me 20 pieces or so

589
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,038
or my bubble gum and head to the movie

590
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,679
theater and you know i'd be chewing

591
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,558
bubble gum like a wacko

592
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,600
so

593
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,960
i was an abuser of bubble gum well when

594
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:07,038
i got bubble gum seeds from

595
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,000
amsterdam later when i was a grower the

596
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,599
last thing i really expected what darn

597
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,480
buds would actually smell like bubble

598
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,319
gum

599
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,240
but we grew the plants and we hoped for

600
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,798
the best and when

601
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,558
the plants got to be like

602
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,119
four weeks and before

603
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,798
i was fooling around and

604
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,359
sniffing them and i rubbed a step

605
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,158
smelled my fingers and my mouth

606
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,959
dropped open enough what the hell

607
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,200
it smells like bubble gum i mean how do

608
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,440
you how could that be possible and i

609
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,840
went up and i told my wife and son we

610
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,240
were both upstairs

611
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,319
i was living in montana i had a montana

612
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,720
basement it was only like five feet high

613
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,798
it was horrible you had to stoop all the

614
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,079
time and you couldn't use

615
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,440
big lights because of the height

616
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,119
restriction but

617
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,200
it smelled like bubble gum and i went up

618
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,399
and i told them that and they both

619
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,798
doubted my work they can't believe that

620
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
dad tells them and they don't think so

621
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,038
and i

622
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,880
i said look you go down there

623
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,480
and you just check it out for yourself

624
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,400
and they did and they both came back

625
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,599
upstairs and their mouths were hanging

626
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,120
open too

627
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,959
and i'll tell you bubble gum really

628
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,759
smells like bubble gum before it gets

629
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,840
done

630
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,759
and they were like how is that possible

631
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:23,759
i said well the name that's on the seats

632
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:26,960
there you know it it's actually uh

633
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,519
supposed to be a bubble gum

634
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,240
and uh

635
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,720
we grew that and we were amazed uh for

636
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,440
one thing that it was a decent yielder

637
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,440
and we really liked the high the indica

638
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,038
high was very relaxing and stuff we

639
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,080
thought it was plenty strong enough for

640
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,158
us

641
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,519
what i thought most about it was it was

642
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,840
like candy

643
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,158
that uh who cares if it wasn't the

644
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,839
strongest thing you could grow wasn't as

645
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,880
strong as skunk or something like that

646
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,439
but

647
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
i just couldn't believe how yummy it was

648
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,400
and i mean that's all we smoked for

649
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,880
years

650
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,120
until we got hooked on the sour bubble

651
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,679
and then

652
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,558
that ended up being no like we got

653
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,559
totally addicted to that

654
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,399
wow there's a lot of things i'm gonna

655
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,798
have to ask questions about the

656
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,240
so the first one is

657
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,240
do you remember who you got your bubble

658
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,079
gum from breeder wise and is it the same

659
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,079
as the one adam dunn took over there

660
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:29,119
oh well actually you know it's drunker's

661
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,159
bubble gum and he deserves some credit

662
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:34,079
uh my seeds were obtained through white

663
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,278
label seed company

664
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,879
before they called it double gum

665
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,400
they did call it

666
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,200
bubble gum

667
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,559
and

668
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,159
uh i had a small selection of those

669
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:50,480
seeds

670
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,480
and you know he was the third guy

671
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,038
who also had cloned the real bubblegum

672
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,519
clone

673
00:25:54,038 --> 00:26:00,000
so uh i say yeah

674
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,079
you know i met and talked to adam and

675
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,599
the other guys and the only one i didn't

676
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,599
mean to talk to was was ben drunkers

677
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,038
no okay interesting

678
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,959
um and so

679
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,519
the next question i had which i think

680
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,278
everyone wants to know is

681
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,200
basically

682
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,640
a lot of people sent me in questions

683
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,319
asking me to ask you about this so i

684
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,559
thought i better bring it up your

685
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,439
relationship with the infamous res dog

686
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,480
so

687
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,400
the the

688
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,519
question which struck me the most was a

689
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,759
lot of people are familiar with sour dub

690
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,599
but they may not you know realize that

691
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,599
it's obviously like a collab between you

692
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,158
and res how did that happen and how did

693
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,959
you meet res

694
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,919
well res dog and i were friends online

695
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,880
back in the overgrow days in the icy mag

696
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:50,480
days uh from before he was a seed dealer

697
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,799
and uh

698
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,319
the sour dub was a cross i made

699
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:57,918
of

700
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:02,319
um

701
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:05,520
the new york city diesel from soma

702
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,720
to my sour bubble clone

703
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,200
and uh

704
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,640
it doesn't have anything to do with any

705
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,798
of rezdog's genetics

706
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,400
oh there you go maybe i missed it

707
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,519
just um i might end up having to cut

708
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,679
this question out because it looks like

709
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,359
i made a blunder there but did you guys

710
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,600
do it collab i think i maybe just

711
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:27,359
misspoke when i said sourdough

712
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:29,199
um the the the question isn't uh

713
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,359
wrong man i'll tell you there's

714
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,038
definitely been some rumors

715
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,558
around about

716
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,839
uh either sour dub or sour bubble

717
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,839
somehow be it

718
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,480
some kind of joint project between a

719
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,158
rash dog and me

720
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,278
and i'm sure he would confirm that

721
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,278
that's that's really not true

722
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,798
he may have sent me a few seeds at one

723
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:54,159
time or another

724
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,679
but uh as far as the sour bubble and the

725
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,000
sour double

726
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,320
and you know with the sour double i

727
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,480
didn't take that too far

728
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,359
i gave those first cross secrets to i

729
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,599
dub

730
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,439
out here in california

731
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,639
and he worked with that first cross

732
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,759
seats and gave me credit for the strain

733
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,799
and so

734
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,879
uh

735
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,119
i can tell you that my original cross

736
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,080
that i gave him

737
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:24,000
uh was that's what it was was so much

738
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,319
new york city diesel

739
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,558
and my sour bubble clone

740
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,158
and as it turned out i should have kept

741
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,319
that and bred that and made that a

742
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,960
strain for myself

743
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,639
uh because it turned out to be really

744
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,679
darn good and you know a lot of great

745
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,600
things have descended from sour double

746
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,240
uh the name sour double is a misnomer

747
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:50,879
uh because of the fact that

748
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,120
the uh the sour diesel in my sour double

749
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,640
wasn't sour diesel but was new york city

750
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,719
diesel

751
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,960
and so you got

752
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,960
sar bubble with one sour

753
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,919
and the other one actually new york city

754
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,038
diesel

755
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,080
so

756
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,960
uh

757
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,480
i didn't name it that

758
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,759
yeah okay i understand what you're

759
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,558
saying

760
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,640
so

761
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,798
one of the other questions i wanted to

762
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,720
ask you about res is do you still stay

763
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,480
in contact with him and the the profile

764
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,000
that popped up recently or you know a

765
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,919
few months back do you know if that was

766
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,480
the actual res and if he does plan to

767
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,480
return to the scene

768
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,519
no i haven't been in touch with him

769
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,440
since before he had some problems you

770
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,519
know and

771
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,600
we were both doing you know

772
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,319
sort of the same thing so

773
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,480
no we haven't been in contact with each

774
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,720
other at all and as far as whether

775
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,679
the person who you're talking about i

776
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,278
haven't seen that or or read that

777
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,519
so

778
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:55,519
i can't help you there but it's possible

779
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,720
it's him as far as i know he's out and

780
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,278
free and

781
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,278
it could be

782
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,240
okay and so i guess the final question

783
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,960
is you feel free to decline i can cut

784
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,359
this one out if you don't want to

785
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,558
ultimately do you think he's the snitch

786
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,879
that some people label him as

787
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,359
well i don't know i honestly wouldn't

788
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,679
have any way to know that i i you know a

789
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,359
lot of these things are

790
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,240
are stuff that people read on the

791
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,079
internet and while i do know some people

792
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,798
and maybe have had

793
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:32,480
some inside stories nobody ever

794
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:35,038
convinced me that he's on anybody and uh

795
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,278
i i guess nothing that he did but i sure

796
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,720
can't say that he did

797
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,119
yeah okay

798
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,200
so if we just jump back to another point

799
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,199
you mentioned with the bubblegum story

800
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,120
your relationship with gypsy gypsy is an

801
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,960
interesting guy and there's not that

802
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,558
many people around who had like a

803
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,558
working relationship with him who was

804
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,720
still active what's your take on the

805
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,398
gypsy situation and you know have you

806
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,360
had any contact with him after he got

807
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,798
out of

808
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,798
jail i think at the start of the year

809
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,679
yes but i'm not really in regular

810
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,038
contact with him now but i did uh

811
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,360
he did

812
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,640
have an exchange

813
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,798
online

814
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,799
since he got out i know that

815
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,840
a wonderful friend of ours a buddhist

816
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:24,158
who sort of brought me into buddhism and

817
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:27,519
his name is tom

818
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,720
actually went over to the philippines

819
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,558
and sort of paid gypsy's way out

820
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,200
of this horrible

821
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:38,558
like detention facility you know he was

822
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,919
never convicted of any crime or anything

823
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,599
and the fact is that that's all it took

824
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,640
was money to get him out of their

825
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,759
corrupt

826
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
system

827
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,480
you know to be held without being

828
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,480
charged with the crime and they tried to

829
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,599
send him back to the u.s

830
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,759
and uh

831
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,000
he actually fought

832
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,919
as they were trying to board him on the

833
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,480
plane it was going to take him to the

834
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,360
u.s because the u.s wanted to extradite

835
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,120
him

836
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,119
yeah and because he caused a commercial

837
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,639
they uh they took him back to the

838
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,599
holding facility

839
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,399
and it he didn't he ended up not being

840
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,398
extradited to the us lucky film because

841
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:22,079
you know guys like him uh they they

842
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:23,359
really would throw in the book at him

843
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,639
yeah okay

844
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,038
and so

845
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,038
i think um the interesting thing about

846
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,440
gypsy is it's kind of like back at that

847
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,558
same time frame is when overgrow was

848
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,320
around and i think you have kind of the

849
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,798
uh the cool fact of being able to say

850
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,079
you were the 12th member on overgrow

851
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,639
which is obviously

852
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,158
kind of confirms your ogenes

853
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,720
do you think though that people look

854
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,640
back on overgrow with the sort of

855
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,200
rose shaded glasses and there's a

856
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,600
certain sense of romanticizing going on

857
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,038
or do you think that it is kind of like

858
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,879
what people make it out to be of like

859
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,398
where it was this mecca of information

860
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,440
and it's such a shame we don't have

861
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,439
something like that anymore

862
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,199
when overgrow opened it was like a

863
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,839
birthday present to me i mean if you

864
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,200
realized what there was before that was

865
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:16,398
practically nothing and um the british

866
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,558
columbian seed company had a forum

867
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,879
thread where there was like one page

868
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:23,278
with one constant thread where people

869
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,278
could add something to the chat line you

870
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,398
know and that was it

871
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:32,000
and i remember i posted my whole um

872
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:35,278
indoor organic grow tips uh you know for

873
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,440
for new growers on that

874
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,119
like chat forum thing

875
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,440
and even though it wasn't really meant

876
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,479
for that they didn't object

877
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,759
and then when overgrowth came out

878
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,640
um i right away had this same thread

879
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:53,278
there and it evolved into a thing where

880
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,960
for like years people would just come in

881
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,880
and ask a question

882
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,360
and it was you know these were really

883
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,519
long threats i remember they had a room

884
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,079
called the sharks tank

885
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,759
and that was where anything goes you

886
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,639
know and uh

887
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,760
i had a thread called the new world

888
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,760
order

889
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,240
and it was it you know had some

890
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,919
conspiracy theory stuff in it and stuff

891
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,719
and you know bog bush kill grower

892
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,239
i mean there was a aspect of some

893
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,559
mythology

894
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,678
i mean we were kidding around and joking

895
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:31,759
around and you know my great great great

896
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:34,079
great great great granddaddy

897
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,119
wasn't really an alien who came down to

898
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,839
egypt with marijuana seeds because the

899
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,079
sun is a perfect grow light

900
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:46,159
but we came up with stuff like that you

901
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,159
know i didn't even did me any harm

902
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,039
that's great that's a crack up and so

903
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,078
what was your kind of reaction to when

904
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,079
it all got shut down

905
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,039
well it was it was horrifying because we

906
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,000
were doing business we they had uh each

907
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,960
seed company like like weld gypsy

908
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,639
nirvana and his like seeds direct at the

909
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,960
time or whatever was called

910
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,400
and we had our own

911
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,920
forum

912
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,358
and so like before overgrow actually

913
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,159
shut down

914
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:23,039
uh rc who ran overgrow and was connected

915
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,358
with bc seed bank and stuff

916
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,119
decided to close down all the private

917
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,000
seed forums

918
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,960
which had sort of put us off of the the

919
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,639
public pages and into our own forums so

920
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,639
that we wouldn't offend it

921
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,559
but that's what overgrow was all about

922
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,118
and teaching each other how to grow i

923
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,440
wanted to talk about overgrow because it

924
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,160
was it was better than you think it

925
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,200
wasn't over romanticized it was

926
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,920
awesomely huge for the time you know

927
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,960
al gore he claims he invented the

928
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,240
internet

929
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,480
but i

930
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,519
helped to invent social networking

931
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,000
because

932
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,800
at overgrowth we had what was called

933
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
karma and you could give somebody good

934
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,920
or bad karma and giving bad karma was

935
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,039
bad but they actually could you could do

936
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,159
it okay

937
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,039
and so

938
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,399
i

939
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:17,279
quickly accumulated a lot of good karma

940
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,280
uh because i was teaching people basic

941
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,920
methods of growing indoors in a time

942
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,839
when it was all totally illegal and

943
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,838
nobody knew anything you know and it was

944
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,759
like to be able to get this off your

945
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:30,880
computer i mean people were sitting

946
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,400
around high learning how to grow and as

947
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,800
soon as they learned something they were

948
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,200
teaching it to the next guy and this was

949
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,800
really a great thing you know i mean if

950
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,118
you love marijuana

951
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,400
this is why you know so many people in

952
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,800
the world

953
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,920
know me it's because i was a big deal at

954
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,160
overgirl and you know i was just posting

955
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,480
my pictures of my

956
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,519
flowers to show off

957
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,119
and i never had planned on having a seed

958
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,519
company at all

959
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,280
i mean i was just happy

960
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,239
growing my weed and selling my weed i

961
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,240
mean prices were good

962
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:09,279
but then

963
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,078
uh gypsy nirvana who was the seed dealer

964
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,800
he

965
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,599
saw how popular i was how many views i

966
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,839
had how much karma i had i mean i was on

967
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,720
there every day i wasn't working i was a

968
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,679
grower i was spending 20 hours a week

969
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,159
and i

970
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,399
was uploading photos every day and i was

971
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,559
showing all kinds of cool stuff it was a

972
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,039
lot of fun because it was all new the

973
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,159
internet was new the idea of posting a

974
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,480
picture

975
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,358
was you know awesome

976
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,719
and uh so i just want

977
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,000
to say that

978
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,959
my teaching threads and uh my our

979
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,320
picture

980
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,119
forum show-off threads we had contests

981
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,519
and things overgrow was really pretty

982
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,000
far out and it still suffered from the

983
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,559
same kind of things we have now like we

984
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,679
have trolls and things but you know one

985
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:02,000
year we had this big contest at overgrow

986
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:06,159
and there was like five

987
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,880
or ten categories of things people could

988
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,399
win and top one was grower of the year

989
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,280
and uh

990
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,079
yours truly did win grower of the year

991
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,240
the only year that over

992
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,599
did that content and so many people

993
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,159
voted for me

994
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,240
because of popularity not really because

995
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,679
i was the best grower you see

996
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,519
and so it was because i had my fan base

997
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,039
because people liked me because

998
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,280
you could they could see that i was

999
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,159
answering everybody's questions every

1000
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,000
day

1001
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,399
and so i was providing a service where

1002
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,639
anybody could come into my thread i mean

1003
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,960
i wasn't the only one but my methods

1004
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,879
were simple and basic and it was all

1005
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,039
written so that any idiot could figure

1006
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,519
it out

1007
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,440
and so what would you say is the biggest

1008
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,519
difference in the community when

1009
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,119
comparing things between now and back

1010
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,280
then

1011
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,280
well it's changed a lot

1012
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,760
you know there are still sites like that

1013
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,760
like um

1014
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,838
still exists and runs and there's still

1015
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,000
some traffic there but

1016
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,719
social networking has evolved you know

1017
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,719
and i mean everybody's on um

1018
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:21,118
their instagram the twitters the youtube

1019
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,639
and the big sites have sort of like

1020
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,280
sucked up all the

1021
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:28,879
all the others and and overgrow was a

1022
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,880
huge mega site in its day i mean it had

1023
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,720
over a million

1024
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,640
members i guess that probably wouldn't

1025
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,000
be that big a deal now but not that many

1026
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,920
people were on the internet back then

1027
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,358
and that sounded you know even people

1028
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,358
that just came one time might have been

1029
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,838
considered a member you know who knows

1030
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,000
if they jacked it but we had a lot of

1031
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,320
people there and when you put something

1032
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,719
out you definitely got a bunch of

1033
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,800
responses in a hurry but i like the way

1034
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,838
instagram is now and i like the way

1035
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,599
things have evolved the truth is that uh

1036
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,480
it was tedious

1037
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,680
wading through the threads in the forums

1038
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,000
and now

1039
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,318
it seems like it evolved in a natural

1040
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,280
way where you decide that you want to

1041
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:11,759
follow somebody like i'm on instagram

1042
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,519
and you can just you know look for bog

1043
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,440
or bog seeds

1044
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,400
and you you can become a follower on our

1045
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,720
feed

1046
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,400
and every time i post a new picture or

1047
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,799
say something

1048
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,880
you get a little notice that hey your

1049
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,920
guys up you want to have a look

1050
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,760
so i kind of i like it it's like i get

1051
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,838
an instant response

1052
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,640
from the instagram it's where i do most

1053
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:36,639
of my stuff now

1054
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:42,078
yeah i agree with a lot of those points

1055
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,838
and so i guess kind of maybe the last

1056
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,680
question about overgrowth

1057
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,679
were there any people who you saw back

1058
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,519
in the early days of overgrow and you

1059
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,078
had a feeling they would go on to do

1060
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,519
bigger things and you know true to form

1061
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,880
that prediction has come true and now

1062
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,239
maybe they're you know some of the more

1063
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,240
relevant people in the industry

1064
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,559
well i'm sure that's true it's been so

1065
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:07,279
long ago that i mean i got most of these

1066
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,159
people like we all we knew each other by

1067
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,560
was

1068
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:13,118
was our online handles

1069
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,440
and uh you know i'm not i'm not the best

1070
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,318
with names but i've been out doing

1071
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,358
events for a long time and we run into

1072
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,239
each other

1073
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:25,440
and uh when we do it's fun and i like

1074
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,439
the fact that people recognize me

1075
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,880
from

1076
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,200
on overgrow

1077
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,400
and that they want to meet me

1078
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,118
because

1079
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,519
they really thought i was you know like

1080
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,838
a huge leader on the site and then at

1081
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,920
the time there i was and i was a good

1082
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,159
guy you know i mean i was always telling

1083
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,079
people to be nice and terrible and

1084
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:49,440
honestly i i

1085
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,240
i fooled around and maybe was a little

1086
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,599
off color sometimes about i would say

1087
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:55,919
things like

1088
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,599
that my plants you know because they

1089
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,559
were they

1090
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,039
were girls or cincinalia that they were

1091
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,679
my virgins you know

1092
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,679
and we would make jokes sometimes that i

1093
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,199
guess you know once in a while could

1094
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,919
have been a little too much

1095
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,759
but we were just having fun

1096
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,720
and it compared to some of the stuff you

1097
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,480
see out there now the overgrowth was

1098
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,559
pretty tame

1099
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,920
it seemed like that was fairly well

1100
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,880
moderated

1101
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,720
and that

1102
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,160
i know that i couldn't get away with

1103
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,279
just anything

1104
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,759
and that

1105
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,480
neither could anybody else so honestly i

1106
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,920
think that that sometimes there's less

1107
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,000
responsible

1108
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,920
uh places where they're you know there's

1109
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,079
chats all over the place every game's

1110
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,159
got one and things like that so

1111
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,640
you know there's all kinds of trolls out

1112
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,399
there being nasty we had a pretty nice

1113
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,159
place

1114
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,880
fantastic so

1115
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,199
i know that you have put out some um

1116
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,440
soil mixes of your own maybe a bit of a

1117
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,838
redundant question but are you an

1118
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,200
organic grower or more like a synthetic

1119
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:03,599
slash bottled nutrients grow

1120
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,318
well i've always promoted organic

1121
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,640
methods and while some people have said

1122
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,960
maybe i'm not always totally organic on

1123
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,440
everything you know i had a guy dispute

1124
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,480
that pete you know like peat moss in

1125
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,960
your soil

1126
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,920
that that's not organic well it seems

1127
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,318
organic to me anyhow

1128
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,880
it's not it's organic enough and i try

1129
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,960
to stay away from anything synthetic

1130
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,960
and you know like insecticides and

1131
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,480
things like that aren't even legal in

1132
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,318
california you can't even buy them

1133
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,760
so they have all kinds of alternative

1134
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,480
treatments and things that don't involve

1135
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,400
that but you know i i've been through

1136
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,800
all kinds of things and we've used all

1137
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,960
kinds of stuff different stages now we

1138
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,480
know better you know like

1139
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,079
if you know what you're doing you don't

1140
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,838
get too many pests

1141
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,079
uh because you know there are good

1142
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,599
products or if you're doing it indoors

1143
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,359
you're not letting any of that get

1144
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,920
inside anyhow

1145
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:01,119
but uh

1146
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,480
yeah so i guess my question then is

1147
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,960
because you've probably had a really

1148
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,240
wide exposure to you know over the years

1149
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,920
you've tried a whole bunch of different

1150
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,959
samples from a variety of different

1151
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,440
growers

1152
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,240
do you think at the absolute pinnacle of

1153
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,079
both organic production and synthetic

1154
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,000
production do you think there's still a

1155
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,440
difference do you think like organic is

1156
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,199
still the best when they're both at

1157
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,960
their optimal levels or do you think

1158
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,000
it's just still you know devils in the

1159
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,000
detail type of thing

1160
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,960
i think organic still best and i'll tell

1161
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,960
you why

1162
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,519
i know that

1163
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,279
yields can be larger and it's really not

1164
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,880
an issue of that

1165
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,760
but i do think that the flavor is better

1166
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,760
and you know

1167
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,960
all the

1168
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,760
growers that are are growing outdoors

1169
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,358
and growing in greenhouses are also in

1170
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,400
competition with

1171
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:01,039
organic products that are grown in

1172
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,079
yours too and

1173
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:06,639
believe me that's the the best product

1174
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,839
and the highest prices given for indoor

1175
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:08,639
organic

1176
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,960
now

1177
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,838
indoor generally brings a higher price

1178
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,440
than

1179
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:14,799
than the outdoor of course and

1180
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,480
especially

1181
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,880
you know if you think you can get the

1182
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,079
same quality i'd like i'd like to see it

1183
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,960
but a controlled environment and you

1184
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
know

1185
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,480
i know

1186
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,440
that you know

1187
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,920
but being outdoors is rougher on plants

1188
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,119
and finishing plants indoors allows you

1189
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:38,800
to get the quality higher

1190
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:41,119
and so overall are you just primarily

1191
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,519
indoor guy or is your favorite outdoor

1192
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,000
or where do you sit

1193
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:47,759
we're mainly indoor growers and now you

1194
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,159
know we're mainly just a pretty small

1195
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,400
grow to produce seeds and it's like uh

1196
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,159
not not producing a lot of we just we

1197
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,240
need for my family

1198
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:02,239
uh and a little extra

1199
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,719
but uh we are trying to uh

1200
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,799
downsize in a way that we've pretty much

1201
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,639
just produced enough seeds to keep the

1202
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,960
business going and about the level it's

1203
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,679
going right now we really don't want to

1204
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,880
uh

1205
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,719
become a huge company in fact some of my

1206
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,119
best friends you know

1207
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,000
advised me that it is best to keep it

1208
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,358
small

1209
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,760
it does seem to me that it's a lot less

1210
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,519
worrisome you know we don't have to have

1211
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,839
employees or

1212
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,000
a whole lot of complications because you

1213
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,880
know i'm i'm getting older i'm getting

1214
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,960
ready to retire i'm nearly 64.

1215
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,559
and what i would like to do is just be

1216
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,679
able to keep supplying

1217
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,599
distributors and and live economically i

1218
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,598
don't need to live large anymore i've

1219
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,079
done that

1220
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,480
no frugal man i like that

1221
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,000
so i mean just kind of touching on

1222
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,838
distributors

1223
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,838
do you ever get requests from

1224
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,440
distributors or maybe even fans and

1225
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:01,279
customers probably the more relevant

1226
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,240
person to

1227
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,680
kind of

1228
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,279
change up some of the genetics and i

1229
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,759
guess the question i always like to ask

1230
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,640
people is when i notice that a breeder

1231
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,040
tends to stick to a more old-school pool

1232
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,960
of genetics a good example is our friend

1233
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:16,800
the mad farmer he like you sticks to the

1234
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,358
old school stuff that he knows

1235
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,680
with that in mind do you ever consider

1236
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:24,078
giving in to the request to maybe bring

1237
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,799
in a strain of the month and spice

1238
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,800
things up a bit

1239
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,519
yeah but i'm still like the old school

1240
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,400
guy who does it that kind of resists

1241
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,838
that

1242
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,838
and that's because

1243
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:38,719
if i really had the time to do the work

1244
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:40,960
with something else i still think that

1245
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,279
i'd rather continue to

1246
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,000
work on and select from

1247
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,119
my old school genetics and it's not very

1248
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,719
often

1249
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,480
i mean okay

1250
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:53,199
there are great strains and they come

1251
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,240
out you think i should jump on this one

1252
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:57,118
or that one

1253
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:59,919
like when sour diesel first showed up

1254
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,480
well maybe better or get some of that

1255
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,519
wasn't really my thing okay i really

1256
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,480
would rather you know be related but not

1257
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:08,559
the same

1258
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,039
and and come up with my own

1259
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,319
now a project that i'm working on right

1260
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,279
now

1261
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:18,318
is all my old genetics but

1262
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,559
uh used in a different way and

1263
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,599
another project that i'm considering

1264
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,319
doing

1265
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,440
is taking some high quality pollens from

1266
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:30,480
another fine breeder

1267
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,159
and using that probably on my sour

1268
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,480
bubble clone

1269
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:37,118
because it seems to be have the genetics

1270
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,719
still the old clone may have declined a

1271
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,960
bit as far as the

1272
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:41,838
quality of its buds over so many years

1273
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,480
but

1274
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,000
its genetics are still throwing awesome

1275
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,000
phenotypes and

1276
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,239
so yeah there is a possibility that

1277
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
within the next year or two

1278
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,000
uh or less than a year that will at

1279
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,358
least be working on

1280
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,838
something crossed to my sour bubble that

1281
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,880
is from someone else

1282
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,400
um

1283
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,519
currently i do have a new strain

1284
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:10,318
that is across of a couple of my strains

1285
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:14,159
it's been reselected and worked on

1286
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:18,558
it's a high yielder and it's uh

1287
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:20,078
more inclined to be a great outdoor bush

1288
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,960
but these

1289
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,559
also tend to yield well inside

1290
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,400
we have

1291
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,880
a number of strains that are good

1292
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,880
yielders and mold resistant and

1293
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,280
where i'm at here

1294
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,039
the outdoor growers need mold resistant

1295
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,839
we're kind of coastal

1296
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,440
uh

1297
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,358
and there's a lot of growers in

1298
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,039
california that are

1299
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,199
and uh the

1300
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,039
other parts of the country

1301
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,960
everybody in the fall

1302
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,719
when the weather turns colder and it

1303
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,838
gets cold at night it doesn't even have

1304
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,759
to rain

1305
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,078
for the mold to set in and outdoor

1306
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,079
growers you know it's real really

1307
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,039
disappointing you know

1308
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,559
and so

1309
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:00,159
i'm working on these types of strains

1310
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,440
the strain is going to be called

1311
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,318
bluetooth

1312
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,280
and it's actually across my blue moon

1313
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,239
rocks and my sweet cindy now sweet cindy

1314
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,240
everybody

1315
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:13,838
tended to think was like mostly going to

1316
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:17,279
be like cinderella 99 and there is a

1317
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:19,759
little cinderella 99 in but it's a lot

1318
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,319
more like sweet tooth three

1319
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,400
and the fact is that that's what the

1320
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,679
sweet in the sweet cindy

1321
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,559
stands for

1322
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,000
now the blue moon rocks and the sweet

1323
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,119
cindy

1324
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,079
will

1325
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:37,358
already have shown to ingesting

1326
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,760
produce some mega fat colas and so we're

1327
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,838
pretty excited about it we know that

1328
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,839
it's good tasting

1329
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:46,480
and good weed and that it is mold

1330
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,960
resistant so we've gone ahead with this

1331
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,358
cross and we hope to be releasing it

1332
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,960
later this year

1333
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:53,679
wow that's exciting

1334
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,039
so

1335
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,480
i mean just to touch on the point you

1336
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,239
made about the mould resistance i

1337
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,760
noticed that you do list

1338
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,519
in some kind of

1339
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,200
descriptions that you like to breed for

1340
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,440
mould resistance and hardiness in

1341
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,919
general do you feel that

1342
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,480
in order to do this it's done mostly via

1343
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,079
a selection process or more of like a

1344
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,079
byproduct of the fact that you're

1345
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,839
breeding and acclimatizing them in an

1346
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,920
environment which would help to cater

1347
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,000
for that

1348
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,599
well that's a good question

1349
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,400
you know

1350
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,800
for one thing i'll tell you this

1351
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,358
a lot of times things boil down to being

1352
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,280
a little simpler than you think but

1353
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:33,358
not always

1354
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,720
the mold resistant strains

1355
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:40,000
are not the most indica sided ones okay

1356
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:41,358
in my experience the sativas

1357
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,039
being you know

1358
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:48,159
uh not so large heavy and tight of buds

1359
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:50,800
uh just tend to resist it better

1360
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,399
also the really dark green

1361
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,119
leafy types

1362
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,920
seem to me to be more likely to mold and

1363
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,880
so

1364
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,358
my most indica strains

1365
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,480
and blue moon rocks is quite indica

1366
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:06,239
sided but it doesn't mold and so it's

1367
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,440
not just that

1368
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:08,399
um

1369
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,519
we

1370
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,000
did grow in places and you asked for an

1371
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,920
indoor grower no we grew outdoors too

1372
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and some of my seeds have been made

1373
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,680
outdoors and we're made outdoors even if

1374
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,400
they're

1375
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:25,199
also been made indoors and so

1376
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,358
we were thinking about

1377
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,358
two different things in our different

1378
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,078
kinds of plants

1379
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:32,799
and

1380
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,960
that one type of plants they either have

1381
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,359
to be early finishing

1382
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,119
or mold resistant and likely to finish

1383
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,920
in most places

1384
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,960
and the early finishers are my

1385
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,240
sour strawberry my blue kush

1386
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,400
the mold resistant large yielders that

1387
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:51,439
finished in time

1388
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,800
are

1389
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,880
boggle gum

1390
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,960
you see boggle gums got nl5 with the

1391
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,160
bubble gum it's like antifreeze from the

1392
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,559
great white north and nothing stops that

1393
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,639
lifesaver which we haven't talked about

1394
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,839
very mold resistant large yield or great

1395
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:10,799
outdoors and sweet sydney also

1396
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:13,279
so uh the uh

1397
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,880
lifesaver the boggle gum and the blue

1398
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,960
moon rocks

1399
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,400
and the sweet cindy

1400
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,119
uh yield well finish in reasonable time

1401
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,519
and resist the mold now

1402
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,559
it's been true and it continues to be

1403
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:28,559
true

1404
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,720
and all i can

1405
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,079
say is that i do my best

1406
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:37,519
not to just keep inbreeding my seeds but

1407
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,720
to do a rotation where i go back to an

1408
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,400
earlier

1409
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:43,358
set of seeds that i've saved in my

1410
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,920
breeders seeds and you know i keep

1411
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:48,159
clones it's just that you know at times

1412
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,559
you have to reselect clones

1413
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:53,519
but i've kept the same

1414
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:55,519
sour bubble clone the longest which is

1415
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,000
essential to all my sour strains and

1416
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,519
blue kush

1417
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,358
yeah definitely one of the more

1418
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,039
long-held ones

1419
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:04,880
so i mean if we just touch on something

1420
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,880
you mentioned a question or two ago

1421
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,800
about i think you said you know like it

1422
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,640
would have been neat to know that sour

1423
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,760
diesel was going to be the big thing at

1424
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:13,519
the time but you know there was other

1425
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,680
reasons why you didn't get into it just

1426
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:18,079
on that general line of thought what's

1427
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:21,039
your opinion on the general trending

1428
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,960
nature of strains do you kind of keep an

1429
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,519
eye on what's on the come up and would

1430
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,280
you ever try to be ahead of the curb so

1431
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:29,519
to speak like do you ever get the

1432
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,280
feeling that maybe some bubble gum slash

1433
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,358
you know the kind of your flavors are on

1434
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,000
the rise and would you try to anticipate

1435
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:36,000
that if so

1436
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,079
well i you know i i may not be quite as

1437
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,639
up-to-date on everything as i was back

1438
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,079
in the day but

1439
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:48,239
it does seem some of the work that's

1440
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,119
being done with the couple of africans

1441
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,118
you know

1442
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,720
people are raving about and that there

1443
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,358
may be some things that you know i'm not

1444
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:58,078
aware of and that i haven't even tried

1445
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,199
but you're right about people giving me

1446
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,519
seeds

1447
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:04,798
at samples and uh

1448
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,679
events that i have a lot of people

1449
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:08,318
who

1450
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:10,159
like remember me from long ago and they

1451
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:13,119
see me and they know i'm gonna be there

1452
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:15,358
or whatever and they bring seeds for me

1453
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,240
and so a lot of other

1454
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,679
guys you know startup companies

1455
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:20,879
good growers

1456
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:22,960
i mean you know

1457
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,039
we definitely respect some of the newer

1458
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,318
companies than us so don't get me wrong

1459
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:31,039
on that it's just that there are so many

1460
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:32,838
small companies now that you know

1461
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,838
everybody seems

1462
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:38,078
to jump bandwagon with the new popular

1463
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:41,039
strain and you know i i've been a couple

1464
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,359
of times attempt i mean to me girl scout

1465
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,639
cookies is pretty remarkably my type of

1466
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:47,920
weed okay

1467
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,519
uh uh it definitely got choices of 398

1468
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,760
bubba in it

1469
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:55,119
that uh i love our bubble is it in there

1470
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,640
sorry what was that last bit you think

1471
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,640
maybe some sour bubbles in there

1472
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,760
well i just mean that the pre-98 bubba i

1473
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,680
believe is in the sour bowl and that's

1474
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,920
part of the reason i love girl scout

1475
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,039
cookies too because i think i i taste it

1476
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,798
in there

1477
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,960
yeah yeah i've heard that comment a few

1478
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:15,199
times as well so while we're on the

1479
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,199
topic of you know seed businesses and

1480
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,598
just that general nature what's your

1481
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:22,879
opinion on what some would describe as

1482
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,960
the rising nature of seed prices

1483
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,760
because some breeders have pointed out

1484
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,000
that most people are relatively charging

1485
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,319
about the same thing if you compare the

1486
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,199
prices in while accounting for inflation

1487
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:36,400
to say companies in the 90s however

1488
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,159
there's obviously a lot of clear

1489
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,240
examples where this there are people

1490
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,759
charging you know quite large price tags

1491
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,239
associated with their seeds and it's

1492
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,000
obviously not proportional how do you

1493
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,279
feel about this general idea you know do

1494
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,039
you think there should be a limit do you

1495
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,559
think it's just a capitalist thing where

1496
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,838
it's like you know if someone wants to

1497
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,839
pay where do you sit on it

1498
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,519
well i always wanted to be competitive

1499
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,119
and the thing is uh

1500
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,480
i didn't want to be the lowest or the

1501
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,720
highest

1502
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,039
i think that it's important that you

1503
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,279
provide a good value and

1504
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,719
i i don't know i think if something's

1505
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,040
brand new

1506
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:17,358
and they want to auction it off and they

1507
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,440
can get a high price for it

1508
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,440
if something's really good enough that

1509
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,200
that people will pay their prices for

1510
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,920
you can't blame people

1511
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:26,719
for i mean you know businesses business

1512
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,000
and

1513
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:29,598
they're probably going to charge what

1514
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,400
they can but

1515
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,599
i

1516
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,400
i think that there's a little bit of

1517
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:39,039
old school business morality that a lot

1518
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,280
of people could

1519
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:43,440
and that is that

1520
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,400
you want the customer to be satisfied

1521
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,760
you want them to return and use your

1522
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,639
seeds again

1523
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,119
i'm

1524
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:52,639
more about return customers than trying

1525
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,599
to

1526
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,558
to fish up a whole bunch of new guys but

1527
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:01,280
like right now in states that have

1528
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,640
gone here in the usa

1529
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,119
anybody

1530
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,199
can grow four or five plants legally and

1531
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,720
they don't need any permits or anything

1532
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,519
like that you know unless there's some

1533
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,519
local ordinance that might prevent them

1534
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,480
the state law lets people grow a few

1535
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,000
plants

1536
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,760
so it seems to me that there could be a

1537
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,559
lot of new growers

1538
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,559
and my seeds are easy to grow i tell

1539
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,280
them which ones

1540
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,119
are the easiest people usually we

1541
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,440
recommend the boggle gum we could call

1542
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,240
it bulletproof you know it tastes like

1543
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,639
bubble gum but it's got the nl5 in it

1544
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:40,078
which makes it

1545
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:42,480
uh resistant to almost everything every

1546
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,640
mistake you can make and it'll it'll

1547
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,440
produce something even if you you know

1548
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:49,838
forget to feed it so

1549
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,838
we often tell people you know it's

1550
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:54,239
really good for beginners but not for

1551
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:55,599
beginners only

1552
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,558
boggle gum

1553
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,798
was

1554
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,119
a medical strain

1555
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:02,239
and we didn't even call it matt back at

1556
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,280
the time

1557
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,798
but uh

1558
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:09,680
it was sold as such in canada online for

1559
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:11,119
350 an ounce for a number of years

1560
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,598
and i don't know how they got away with

1561
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,519
that but when i went up to vancouver

1562
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,400
i found places like

1563
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,599
the the melting point where bubble man

1564
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,838
had his

1565
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,838
vaporizers all in view in the open

1566
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:26,078
windows on the main street

1567
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,400
cops walking by had all my stuff out on

1568
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,960
the table and we were all getting high

1569
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,119
up there many years ago

1570
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,519
sounds good

1571
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,200
so you just mentioned the nl5 i wanted

1572
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:38,719
to ask you about it where did you get

1573
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,960
yours from and do you have any

1574
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:42,399
speculations on what the genetics behind

1575
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,039
it are

1576
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,480
oh that's a good question you know what

1577
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,838
there's probably somebody who does know

1578
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,119
the answer there i can tell you where i

1579
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,000
got them

1580
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,838
uh

1581
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,079
nl5

1582
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:56,719
a bc company uh british columbia seed

1583
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,720
company they sold not just northern

1584
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,118
lights it was back before they just sold

1585
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,679
northern lights and they did sell

1586
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,440
northern light five seeds which another

1587
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,078
guy obtained

1588
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,559
and transferred them to me

1589
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,960
and he had the name he had written on

1590
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,960
his own tag so i didn't get the package

1591
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,400
or anything but they were alleged to be

1592
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,519
an l5

1593
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,358
and

1594
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,199
i grew them out and they were different

1595
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:24,000
than just northern lights

1596
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:26,960
i could say this that it was pretty

1597
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
decided and the plant structure was

1598
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,159
exactly like a christmas tree and that

1599
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,280
had a lot of green

1600
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:38,078
sort of like menthol or greenness

1601
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,880
to its composition okay

1602
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,920
and

1603
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,559
it was good smoke but not quite as good

1604
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,119
as the amsterdam bubble gum that i had

1605
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:50,480
grown and gotten from drunkers

1606
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:53,039
but it was rugged and hardy and

1607
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,039
it was good so we did that cross because

1608
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,920
those were the first two

1609
01:00:55,039 --> 01:01:00,960
uh sets of imported seeds i had obtained

1610
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,079
so it was kind of a no-brainer

1611
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,240
yeah okay

1612
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,160
and it's also one which is still around

1613
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:07,679
you still you know use it to this day do

1614
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:09,519
you feel that's because it's you know

1615
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:10,960
it's still solid or it's more so because

1616
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:12,798
you kind of you want to still be able to

1617
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,519
offer those strains it was used in the

1618
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,519
creation for

1619
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:20,559
well

1620
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:22,480
we pretty much uh for our own use grow

1621
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,640
indoors and we've lately just been

1622
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,559
growing three of our strains

1623
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,798
from three clones that we've got running

1624
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:32,720
and you know one sour bubble

1625
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:35,599
ones uh this our grape and one is the

1626
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:37,919
blue moon rocks and we were running more

1627
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,160
types but we're kind of downsizing on

1628
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,559
the pot growing and and trying to just

1629
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:43,598
continue to keep up on the seed growing

1630
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,400
now

1631
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,079
so

1632
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,680
those are the three clones i have

1633
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,318
selected and that we're growing right

1634
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:54,159
now and i'm growing from seeds and

1635
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:56,000
working on the bluetooth project and so

1636
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:57,759
really we've gotten most most of the

1637
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
work done on that now and we're just

1638
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,319
doing our final

1639
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,199
uh final room full of it to come out

1640
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:07,679
with the seeds later this fall

1641
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:09,598
yeah okay so something our viewers love

1642
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:11,118
to always hear from the guests is what

1643
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,920
are some of the traits you like to look

1644
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,720
for when selecting a male

1645
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:19,519
well you know males have smell

1646
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:22,399
and of course with my strains it's not

1647
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:24,719
too hard for me to select males because

1648
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,000
i have a couple of tricks

1649
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:29,439
now

1650
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
yes you have to reselect nails and

1651
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,400
you know the fact is that

1652
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,679
it's best to go back to older seeds that

1653
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,079
you have

1654
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:39,838
than maybe the ones that you're also

1655
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,359
growing but find

1656
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:46,558
a male as close to back when it was

1657
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:48,880
early as you can and then i am not one

1658
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,559
to use just one male

1659
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,160
now i suppose somebody thinks that's not

1660
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,440
right but

1661
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,480
i am

1662
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,720
not always trying to get them all to be

1663
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,679
as identical as clones

1664
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:06,399
i mean i've had strains get that way

1665
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,519
and it gets a little boring

1666
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,639
and so i think that

1667
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:14,318
it's fun when it's my sour strawberry

1668
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,480
where you do have more than one

1669
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:17,838
phenotype that you're going to get in a

1670
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,920
pack of seeds

1671
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:21,358
and it may sound backwards as far as

1672
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,599
stability but

1673
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,759
i'll i've got plenty of strains that are

1674
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,480
quite stable i've been making them for a

1675
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,240
long time and being able to know what

1676
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,480
the right male is supposed to look like

1677
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,879
and smell like because i've done it so

1678
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,760
many times makes it easier for me to

1679
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:40,640
reselect males

1680
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,880
do you subscribe to the idea of

1681
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:46,159
trying to find a male for example which

1682
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,318
may be as closely as possible mirrors a

1683
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:49,759
female of the same strain that you find

1684
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:51,920
very desirable or do you think there's

1685
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,839
some intrinsic differences which means

1686
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,159
you can't just necessarily do what i

1687
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:56,159
mentioned

1688
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,000
it depends on on the breeding project

1689
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,719
okay

1690
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,400
like every one of my strains wasn't made

1691
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:05,759
the same way and i don't like to go into

1692
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,680
every detail

1693
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,039
about it but let me explain

1694
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,038
uh with the sour bubble

1695
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:17,038
yeah if you've if you've got a

1696
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:18,078
clone want to produce seeds like that

1697
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,200
clone

1698
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:23,760
i'm not i'm not one to feminize okay

1699
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:25,759
i don't feminize seeds we've never sold

1700
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,240
feminized seeds i have a story for you

1701
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,400
about feminizing seeds yes i did do it

1702
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,199
at one time

1703
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,318
but

1704
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,558
uh

1705
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:37,519
well the reason i don't do it

1706
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,640
is because you feminize seeds it'll be

1707
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:41,519
fine possibly for the next generation

1708
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:43,519
but

1709
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,038
if they use those seeds to make more

1710
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,519
seeds the

1711
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,720
hermaphrodite tendencies definitely come

1712
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:50,960
out and so

1713
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,919
i expected that people would take my

1714
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,920
seeds

1715
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,039
and probably make some more seeds of

1716
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,159
their own

1717
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,400
at least

1718
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:00,558
when i started this company

1719
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,480
it's more the way it was you know then

1720
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,920
then people are just gonna buy loads of

1721
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,639
seeds

1722
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,039
so

1723
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:09,519
given you've had some clones for you

1724
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,680
know 15 plus years i'd love to get your

1725
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:14,318
opinion on this topic of genetic drift

1726
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,480
do you believe that over time females

1727
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,199
and maybe even males for that matter

1728
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,119
can deteriorate in quality or do you

1729
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:23,118
feel that for the most part you know the

1730
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,920
same plan is the same plan

1731
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,440
i would say that the genetics doesn't

1732
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,240
change

1733
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,760
but that a clone the quality of its bud

1734
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:34,959
and the

1735
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,880
numbers on its thc and stuff definitely

1736
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,000
can decline

1737
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,720
uh

1738
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,280
there it's because of genetic alteration

1739
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,480
okay that's not that easy to do and you

1740
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,039
know i don't think the plan would be

1741
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,559
healthy if that was going on i think the

1742
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:52,960
genetics of clones are pretty solid uh

1743
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,119
but i do think that the process of

1744
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,079
selection is one thing

1745
01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:00,400
uh even with clones and that a line can

1746
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,640
deteriorate over time

1747
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,280
i don't think my sour bubble clone you

1748
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,679
know being like 17 years old

1749
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,599
i don't think i could get it to test out

1750
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:11,038
as high as when it was brand new you

1751
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,160
know

1752
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,520
i saw it come down some and i still love

1753
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:16,399
it i think

1754
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,280
but

1755
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,920
uh

1756
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:23,200
they there are theories of

1757
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,880
ways to take a clone that's sort of run

1758
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:26,719
down

1759
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,880
and refurbish it

1760
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:32,159
and the only one i've ever really heard

1761
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,880
is to take it outside for a summer and

1762
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:36,078
let it let it live like a real tree you

1763
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,440
know

1764
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,480
yeah

1765
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,200
so

1766
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,119
do you think that there is a poster

1767
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:45,519
child in regards to all the strains

1768
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,440
you've made that represent bog seeds

1769
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:51,280
like is there one strain which you think

1770
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,280
really embodies bog seeds

1771
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,160
oh

1772
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:57,038
well

1773
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:59,199
it's either the original bubble gum bog

1774
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:03,200
bubble or sour bubble

1775
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:06,399
the blog bubble was a flagship and

1776
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:08,719
the sour bubble kind of became the new

1777
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,318
leader and all the strains got bred to

1778
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,239
the sour bubble

1779
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,279
it's kind of a similar

1780
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:15,759
story

1781
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,079
to one that's so much old after years of

1782
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,640
all his strengths being developed

1783
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:23,200
he finally had this one male

1784
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:26,000
that he decided was so good that he had

1785
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:28,159
to cross that to all his strains and he

1786
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,239
came out with a whole second set of

1787
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:32,159
strengths

1788
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:34,959
the thing i wanted to go back to for a

1789
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:38,000
second what i didn't really answer was

1790
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,318
like the type of breeding projects and

1791
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,440
and i mentioned that with the

1792
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:46,159
trying to make seeds from a clone that i

1793
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,159
get i got off the track on to

1794
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:49,519
why i don't feminize

1795
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:52,558
but uh

1796
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:54,239
by finding that perfect match like i did

1797
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,720
for the sour bubble

1798
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,919
that really was important to getting

1799
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:59,358
those first

1800
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,039
seeds

1801
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:03,279
from the clone

1802
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,680
and that that you know was

1803
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,280
the main thing in the breeding project

1804
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:09,679
that mattered the most

1805
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,119
the different batches and the numbers of

1806
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:13,118
back crosses

1807
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,240
uh the further you get away from the

1808
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,640
clone

1809
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:18,639
uh the better they would yield

1810
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,719
uh but you know i think at a certain

1811
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,838
point like back cross four you wouldn't

1812
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,520
want to go any

1813
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,640
further away so

1814
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:29,199
we we would go back and start over again

1815
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:32,000
but with a lot of my strains

1816
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:34,000
i don't think that

1817
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,600
you know any breeding project when you

1818
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,679
started you really don't know what

1819
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:41,120
you're going to get and so it's kind of

1820
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,880
a crap shoot and i always told people

1821
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:45,599
to follow their

1822
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,199
intuitions and to to know what they're

1823
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,079
hoping for

1824
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:53,519
and and to wish for that and that it

1825
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:57,519
could make it happen and it's it's

1826
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,520
a spiritual power that we have

1827
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:03,039
yeah okay and so do you think that

1828
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:06,480
there's something more to breeding than

1829
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:07,920
just purely a say criteria of things

1830
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,838
you're looking for is there kind of a

1831
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,838
certain amount of intuition involved

1832
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:15,838
also

1833
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:19,278
yeah i i'm that type of breeder

1834
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:22,000
like soma who you know is is kind of a

1835
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:24,560
believer in a lot of things okay a lot

1836
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,798
of junk spiritualism and stuff

1837
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,279
i've mentioned to you about

1838
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:31,759
my new world order thread and how you

1839
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,719
know conspiracy theories and things like

1840
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:34,640
that

1841
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:37,679
well i worked in medicine for a number

1842
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,679
of years and i then went to alternative

1843
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:42,319
medicine for a while like

1844
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,119
a naturopathic therapist

1845
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,400
and

1846
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:49,039
i kind of believe in in the power

1847
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:49,838
that people have to help each other

1848
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:50,560
like

1849
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:52,960
like

1850
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:55,760
in massage for example

1851
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,279
um the human touch is

1852
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,480
single crave

1853
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:02,800
and is therapeutic

1854
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:04,158
and any way you do it but there's

1855
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:08,079
something called

1856
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:10,000
intention and attention and so if your

1857
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:12,640
intention were to

1858
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,840
a pain go away in his lower back or neck

1859
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,800
for example

1860
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,360
and then

1861
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,079
you paid attention to that

1862
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:22,639
by concentrating on it and working on it

1863
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:24,479
and massaging it or whatever you do

1864
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,280
manipulating it

1865
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:28,718
that

1866
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:30,880
because of your intent and attention

1867
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,880
that

1868
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,800
and it's not all science now i love

1869
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,840
science

1870
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,400
and i wish i knew more science i mean i

1871
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,279
that's the thing i like to read and i'm

1872
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:52,238
a science fiction fan and you know i

1873
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:54,238
just love

1874
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:55,359
space and rockets and everything like

1875
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:56,238
that

1876
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:59,359
so

1877
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:02,718
i don't dis science i uh

1878
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:04,238
was good at science and i liked biology

1879
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,760
and science like that but i didn't have

1880
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:09,439
a degree in

1881
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:12,159
genetics or even agriculture okay i mean

1882
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:13,519
i was like political science english law

1883
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:15,679
stuff like that

1884
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,800
regular old

1885
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:22,560
college program that eventually you know

1886
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:24,000
i ended up having my first child at 21

1887
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,719
years old

1888
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and leaving my first session in college

1889
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,760
early

1890
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,079
uh to go to work

1891
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,600
and so i ended up going back to school

1892
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:35,920
and stuff but that's a whole nother

1893
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,920
story

1894
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:39,599
so

1895
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,919
you touched on science there

1896
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,560
do you like to engage in the new

1897
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,880
emerging technology and sciences that

1898
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,039
are kind of touted to help breeders like

1899
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,119
for example do you use any of

1900
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:53,439
not just like you know an analytical lab

1901
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:55,039
testing for for cannabinoid values but

1902
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:57,599
like maybe the ones where they help you

1903
01:11:55,039 --> 01:12:00,079
to detect males earlier on or things

1904
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,079
like that

1905
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,920
no i i never use those guys and you know

1906
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:08,880
i am not saying that testing isn't valid

1907
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,359
or anything okay and we we've had plenty

1908
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,560
of tests on plenty of our strains and

1909
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:14,079
you know

1910
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,800
my my weed

1911
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,960
different kinds been sold in california

1912
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,480
by dispensaries for years and a lot of

1913
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,158
times they would they would send a

1914
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,559
sample in and get tested you know i'm

1915
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:26,719
cheap but i could pay for testing

1916
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,920
but the kind of testing i really believe

1917
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,480
in

1918
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,119
being with the medical background

1919
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,959
is more like clinical testing and that

1920
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:36,719
would be the results

1921
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,399
and i know that that's

1922
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:43,920
anecdotal and harder to nail down than

1923
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:45,839
the thc content or the cbna

1924
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,560
or whatever else new

1925
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,719
component i understand a little bit

1926
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,640
about thc

1927
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:55,359
um i understand

1928
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:58,880
enough about it to know that

1929
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:01,119
i like my strains high thc

1930
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,400
with a little bit of cbd

1931
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,880
and that

1932
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,238
indica cited strains like that like my

1933
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,039
sour bubble

1934
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:09,039
kill

1935
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:11,039
my pain at the best

1936
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:12,719
they are a bit on the couchy side for

1937
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:14,960
some people

1938
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,800
but it stimulates my brain now i got i

1939
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,679
got pretty high on it before we did this

1940
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,840
session

1941
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:23,760
and it's not like i'm sleepy or anything

1942
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,760
and i've only had a sip of coffee

1943
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:27,519
yeah there you go i mean do you consider

1944
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:28,559
yourself to have a high tolerance or

1945
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,159
more just

1946
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,640
like you know because it's for a medical

1947
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:36,238
need it helps to counteract the maybe

1948
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,679
sedative side other people experience

1949
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:40,000
some people would say we have a high

1950
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,199
tolerance because my wife and i smoke a

1951
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,719
lot

1952
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,960
but the

1953
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:47,600
truth is that you could get a higher

1954
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,679
tolerance by using more edibles and we

1955
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,640
do eat edible now and then but not that

1956
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,279
regular

1957
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,520
and you know um

1958
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:58,238
you get a high content using

1959
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,960
concentrates and things like that

1960
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:02,879
we uh we make bubble hash and sometimes

1961
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,119
we'll add a little that to our joint if

1962
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,840
we want to pep it up you know

1963
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:08,719
but

1964
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,960
i wouldn't say that we could take all

1965
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,560
that much at any one time you know i

1966
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,119
mean we're older

1967
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,520
um we like to get high and there are

1968
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:19,279
some highs that are too busy for me that

1969
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,400
i don't even like

1970
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:23,439
that are like

1971
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:25,039
um really really sativa sided strains

1972
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:26,000
sometimes

1973
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:28,960
that

1974
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,880
uh you know it just it makes me a little

1975
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,840
anxious

1976
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:36,640
or so i i kind of prefer the

1977
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,719
the uh indica high

1978
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,239
there you go that segues perfectly into

1979
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,399
my next question where i was gonna say

1980
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:44,559
that a lot of your strains tend to have

1981
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,639
this commonality of a relatively short

1982
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,640
flowering time and obviously that lends

1983
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,760
itself more towards the indica side of

1984
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,760
genetics

1985
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:55,640
was this intentional or is it just kind

1986
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,640
of how things worked out

1987
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:00,879
oh it was intentional being an indoor

1988
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:05,359
grower myself

1989
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,359
i mean i actually came up with my own

1990
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:11,919
uh cell phone a plant a strain

1991
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,320
that i called the the growers rating

1992
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,679
scale rather than the smokers rating

1993
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,519
scale okay

1994
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:20,158
and so like growers they're the ones

1995
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,480
that have to work with it

1996
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:25,119
i i like a strain

1997
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:27,439
that finishes in

1998
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:28,559
like seven and a half eight and a half

1999
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,479
weeks

2000
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,360
and it's long enough

2001
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:36,879
to get a pretty darn good yield

2002
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:38,639
you know i do have uh two or three

2003
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:42,560
i take longer to finish

2004
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:46,480
um like indoors my lsd and my lifestyle

2005
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,960
they both take uh at least 10 maybe 11

2006
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,359
weeks indoors and they're a little late

2007
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:56,079
finishing outside

2008
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:56,799
uh but the lsd is quite mold resistant

2009
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:59,039
and

2010
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,199
the uh lifestyle probably should be too

2011
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:02,079
although i'm really really not sure on

2012
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:02,879
that

2013
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,158
but

2014
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,239
yeah i

2015
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:09,279
you know being an indoor grower i want

2016
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:11,919
things to move along you know and i i i

2017
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,439
i do what's called you know continuous

2018
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,920
production now

2019
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,919
i called it bonanza green when i wrote

2020
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,679
my book back in the day

2021
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,079
it described how

2022
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:24,640
we keep the plants moving you know from

2023
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:26,238
a veg room to a flowering room and on

2024
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,159
down the line in the flowering room

2025
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:30,158
until they reach the end

2026
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,639
of the room and where they get sort of

2027
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:34,238
set aside from the lights for a couple

2028
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,119
more days where they can still see the

2029
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:37,599
light

2030
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:39,920
but finish up and could sort of get the

2031
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,520
most out of the room that way

2032
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,319
it's more efficient

2033
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,640
part of the growers scale would involve

2034
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:50,079
the amount of energy required to get how

2035
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,520
much yield back and so fewer weeks of

2036
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:54,158
flowering

2037
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,080
definitely would be a factor in that

2038
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:57,519
and so we were looking at it

2039
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,319
commercially too

2040
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,920
that you know there's some great long

2041
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,000
flowering strengths but unless the

2042
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,158
yields are going to be really big you

2043
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,399
don't want that indoors and the other

2044
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:10,319
thing is if if the oils are really big

2045
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,238
and they take a long time

2046
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:14,719
then the plants still more susceptible

2047
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,479
to problems than it will fast flowering

2048
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,319
plant like you know mold or bugs or

2049
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,238
anything

2050
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:22,639
yeah totally

2051
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:24,399
so some people may not have been aware

2052
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:26,000
of what you just referenced but you have

2053
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:27,439
written your own book called bonanza of

2054
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,600
green and i was going to ask you about

2055
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,439
it what inspired you to write it was it

2056
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,440
kind of the case that you set out to

2057
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:34,960
write the book or was it more that you

2058
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:36,399
were giving out all this info and just

2059
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,920
over time you were kind of like hey i've

2060
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:39,920
got like a book's worth of stuff here

2061
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,400
well that's exactly it i kept writing

2062
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:49,359
the same [ __ ] over and over again you

2063
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:51,599
know and i really got to thinking

2064
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:53,679
we ought to do this you know i mean

2065
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,679
my my wife was working at the time but i

2066
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:57,760
was off work and

2067
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,399
it could have never got done without her

2068
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,360
help i mean we're both literate and all

2069
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:02,238
but

2070
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:04,880
she's

2071
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:07,198
you know more perfectionistic and she

2072
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,239
made sure that the paragraphs made sense

2073
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:11,039
to everyone

2074
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:13,599
my book was meant to be simple and to

2075
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,039
entice people into growing

2076
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,880
and then also

2077
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,960
to you know show them pictures of my

2078
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,719
strains in the back of the book and

2079
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:24,800
recommend that they get seats from us so

2080
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,198
you know part of it was a promotional

2081
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,920
thing for my seats but it never turned

2082
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:32,319
out to be that big a deal and we we got

2083
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,719
a thousand copies printed and since then

2084
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:36,719
we've just been burning them on cds and

2085
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,960
sending them to people you know

2086
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:41,920
uh it was on the google play for some

2087
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:45,039
time and it may still be out there

2088
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:47,520
online it's bonanzo green by bushy old

2089
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:50,319
grower

2090
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,199
there you go check it out people

2091
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:52,719
so

2092
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:53,919
i wanted to ask you this one question i

2093
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,800
didn't know how to slow it in so we're

2094
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:58,319
just going to do it here

2095
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,719
lifesaver your cross it's an interesting

2096
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:02,319
one to me because on face value from

2097
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,079
what i can see it's one of the only ones

2098
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:05,840
where it's made using two different

2099
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:07,439
breeders genetics

2100
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,119
would you ever consider doing that again

2101
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:11,359
or was that kind of a one-off special

2102
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:11,359
thing

2103
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,719
no i would consider doing that again and

2104
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,320
and that was a time when i used sub

2105
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:21,039
coolest genetics and i'll give him all

2106
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:23,198
the credit in the world for his jcb

2107
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:26,800
jack's cleaner blueberry

2108
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:28,399
incredibly fast flowering strain and

2109
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,079
very good bud

2110
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:31,679
and you know it was good enough that i

2111
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:34,800
wanted to cross it to my bubble gum

2112
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,640
which was very fast i mean the original

2113
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,199
bog bubble it was

2114
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,800
probably faster finishing than it is now

2115
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:43,678
maybe it was a difference in the way i

2116
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,159
grew it but i mean we were getting it to

2117
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:47,039
finish in like you know seven weeks and

2118
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:49,920
so

2119
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:52,719
his he had some if he knows he claimed

2120
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,840
even finished in like 42 days 43 days or

2121
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,760
something like that

2122
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,440
and you know that's like too fast but

2123
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,320
they were fast they were at least as

2124
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,678
fast

2125
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:00,799
as my

2126
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,760
bubble

2127
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,320
so i did cross those

2128
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,480
and like i said i've been talking to

2129
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:11,439
james at seats here now

2130
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:13,678
about uh possibly using some

2131
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:14,960
pollen from a very

2132
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,880
uh

2133
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:20,079
uh well-known breeder i don't want to

2134
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:22,079
mention the name until we actually go

2135
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:22,880
forward with the project but

2136
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:25,039
at

2137
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,279
this point i've said that you know i

2138
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:30,719
might take some select pollen to work

2139
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:33,279
with on my strains

2140
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,560
ah that'd be interesting and

2141
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,399
i think i might know who you're talking

2142
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,639
about but we'll leave that to be seen

2143
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:40,079
what i did want to ask though is

2144
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,840
i don't know if you're aware but there's

2145
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:44,238
a few people in the scene who are very

2146
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,480
reminiscent about the strain bubble

2147
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:49,519
berry that was offered by saga martha

2148
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:51,678
seeds many years ago and i noticed that

2149
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,280
you essentially offer you know a very

2150
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:55,199
similar version to that strain like a

2151
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:56,079
blueberry cross to a bubble gum type of

2152
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:58,319
thing

2153
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:59,840
have you ever noticed this similarity

2154
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:02,559
and thought maybe i should try to work

2155
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,560
this a bit more

2156
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:07,039
well

2157
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,359
i am aware of his strain by name and i

2158
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:11,760
never actually tried it or worked with

2159
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,039
it but i did have some friends in

2160
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,960
amsterdam

2161
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:18,960
that told me that his bubble berry was

2162
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,920
excellent tasting okay

2163
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,198
now

2164
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,199
uh

2165
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:25,119
well there's several

2166
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:26,238
bubble gum blueberries you know it was

2167
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:28,479
not a

2168
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:31,119
intended to copy him

2169
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:32,879
uh it was done probably pretty much at

2170
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,279
the same time

2171
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:37,920
and i don't think we used exactly the

2172
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:41,039
same components or anything so

2173
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,719
uh of course they're related i mean of

2174
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:45,039
course they both have bubble gum and

2175
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,960
they both have blueberry in them

2176
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:48,238
but he and i didn't work together on it

2177
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,239
i didn't uh

2178
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:51,678
take his genetics and use them and he

2179
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,759
didn't take mine and use them i don't

2180
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:55,440
think either

2181
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,440
yeah of course

2182
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:58,879
so one question i love to ask the guests

2183
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,879
because our viewers always love to hear

2184
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,359
it is do you have any tips for fino

2185
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,840
hunting and so what i mean by that is

2186
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,839
do you for example maybe prefer to run a

2187
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,520
lot of plants in small pots and just see

2188
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,920
how they go or do you like to let them

2189
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,360
get big to get a true test of them

2190
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,880
what's what's your method when you're

2191
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:18,158
going to pop some seeds and try to

2192
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,159
determine what's worth keeping

2193
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:25,920
well what a great question you know i'm

2194
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:27,439
always doing this all right and the

2195
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,119
thing is right now

2196
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:30,399
you know like i was telling you my sour

2197
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:32,399
bubble clone

2198
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:35,119
great for breeding definitely the

2199
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:38,319
genetics are still just popping

2200
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:40,800
but we decided to again look for another

2201
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:41,920
select sour bubble mother

2202
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,079
and uh

2203
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,239
we went through a group of them

2204
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:48,559
a while back no no i don't do a big

2205
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:49,759
group at a time

2206
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,039
uh

2207
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:54,639
it might only be like 15 plants and

2208
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:55,760
a few of them are going to turn out to

2209
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,400
be males

2210
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,520
with my sour bubble the strain is about

2211
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:02,479
70

2212
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:04,320
female maybe 65

2213
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:05,359
so

2214
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:08,000
right now

2215
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:11,198
i'm doing it again and the last time

2216
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,600
i had a couple promising keepers

2217
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:16,799
and uh another guy just showed his

2218
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,400
keeper from sour bubble that he selected

2219
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,600
on the instagram

2220
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:25,039
and it's the bubble gum version of sour

2221
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:27,280
bubble and it's not an uncommon one

2222
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:30,079
and it's super delicious and sticky and

2223
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:32,079
frosty and finishes real fast

2224
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:33,198
but the one i had wasn't a very big

2225
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:34,880
yielder

2226
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:38,799
and i didn't think it was quite as

2227
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:41,119
strong as you know the other phenotypes

2228
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,159
so then there was another one

2229
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:45,760
that i

2230
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:49,039
also thought was a possible keeper

2231
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,560
and it didn't have the same taste that i

2232
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:52,719
was looking for

2233
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:55,360
but it was really strong

2234
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:57,279
and it had an interesting taste

2235
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:59,759
but we just wasn't sure it was good

2236
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,880
enough and so we're doing another look

2237
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,560
right now

2238
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,079
now the way i do it

2239
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,960
is

2240
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:06,319
i

2241
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,760
this time

2242
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,479
i

2243
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,800
had a set of sour bubble seeds i wanted

2244
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:16,479
to go ahead and check out some of the

2245
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:18,000
ones that looked marginal actually small

2246
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:20,959
and marginal that it probably wouldn't

2247
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,279
have sold anyhow

2248
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,800
and it was funny all germinated you know

2249
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:26,719
and i thought well

2250
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,800
let's just see how they grow you know

2251
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,800
and if there's runts or anything and i

2252
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,760
guess out of the bunch we might have had

2253
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:36,480
a couple that died off or were weird but

2254
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:39,199
i've got a group of plants now there

2255
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:41,119
must be about 10 of them and we what we

2256
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:43,039
do is we number them all

2257
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:45,760
and we clone them all

2258
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:48,238
and we keep the clone

2259
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,560
and you know often the males

2260
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:53,839
because you know

2261
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,960
usually they just die you know

2262
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,440
anyhow

2263
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,399
you can clone a male but it's hard

2264
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:00,000
and that

2265
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:02,319
after we find out which ones are the

2266
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,520
females we go ahead and flower out the

2267
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:06,639
big plants

2268
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,880
you see i got a limited size indoor grow

2269
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:10,719
and i'm just trying to you know do

2270
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:14,159
everything in sequence and so it can't

2271
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:16,399
be all that many at all one time

2272
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:19,039
you know when i get those

2273
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:20,638
into flour which is really soon they're

2274
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:22,960
getting huge

2275
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:25,359
uh we'll just you know finish them out

2276
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,319
we'll try the different kinds of blood

2277
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:28,639
and will

2278
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,960
will write up you know what i thought

2279
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:33,920
about each phenotype

2280
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,600
and uh see if there's something like at

2281
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,760
this point

2282
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,600
everybody wants something that's a good

2283
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,079
yield or in sour bubble

2284
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:44,960
it's just a moderate yield it's not a

2285
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:47,519
great yielder i've i've grown big plants

2286
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,198
you know to show that it's possible but

2287
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,320
it takes a while vegging it and then

2288
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:52,960
they

2289
01:25:50,319 --> 01:25:54,960
flower fast they tend to not be the

2290
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,719
biggest fielders we'd like to find one

2291
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,920
that's really good

2292
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:02,079
it has similar tastes to my old clone

2293
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:04,719
and that yields more

2294
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:07,198
and it has higher content like the old

2295
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:10,639
clone did originally

2296
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:11,519
sounds like the dream combo

2297
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,960
so

2298
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,400
this is going to be

2299
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,639
a bit of an interesting question because

2300
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:18,719
i'm not sure on the timeline but

2301
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,639
how do you feel about

2302
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:23,119
what it appears to be to me the fact

2303
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:25,760
that like barney's farm stole the lsd

2304
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:25,760
name from you

2305
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:33,679
well i didn't look at it that way you

2306
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,600
know the truth is when i named lsd hey

2307
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:37,600
here's something res dog had something

2308
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,239
to do with

2309
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,840
name instead we were talking about it

2310
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,718
and i says what am i going to call this

2311
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,880
[ __ ] i said it's lifesaver it's crossed

2312
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:47,679
with so much diesel he says huh let me

2313
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,039
see

2314
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,760
lsd

2315
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:53,600
so he actually came up with the name i

2316
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,239
went like duh

2317
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:59,039
okay good idea his idea and i did name

2318
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:01,839
it lsd and i do think it was after my

2319
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:04,319
lsd yes probably a couple

2320
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,119
years later lee the barney's farm came

2321
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:09,519
out with their lsd

2322
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:12,000
but do we know that they were even aware

2323
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,800
that there was another lsd and did they

2324
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,359
claim it was bog lsd no they didn't and

2325
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:19,679
did it have the same components no and

2326
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:22,719
did they tell what the components were

2327
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:24,399
yes they did and so even these

2328
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,399
strains are

2329
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:30,000
they came from different origins i don't

2330
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:32,479
think they just knocked off my lsd seats

2331
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,840
i think they made their own and they

2332
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:36,079
came up with their own name from the

2333
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,880
same abbreviation system

2334
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:40,319
of like lemon skunk diesel or whatever

2335
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,440
is in it

2336
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:43,759
yeah okay

2337
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:46,238
so do you think though that there should

2338
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,239
be some sort of standard by which if a

2339
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:49,678
name already exists you you know like

2340
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:51,359
there's some rules you should follow or

2341
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:53,520
do you think it's fine so long as like

2342
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:55,198
you know you state what it is and so if

2343
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:58,080
people look into the details they'll be

2344
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:58,079
able to see that it's

2345
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,199
different i think it's fine as long as

2346
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:05,279
you're not dishonest

2347
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:07,678
i think it's awful to

2348
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:10,880
to uh not give somebody the credit they

2349
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:14,319
deserve if you use their work

2350
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:16,880
i think it's off to try to steal you

2351
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:19,039
know somebody's strain but when it comes

2352
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,800
to names look there's a bunch of sour

2353
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:22,800
grapes i'm not so sure that mine was the

2354
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,480
first sour grape i sure didn't know of

2355
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,440
another

2356
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:29,279
one but the past one the thing is mine

2357
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:31,678
is box our grape

2358
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:33,439
and i can tell you what's in it and i

2359
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:35,359
have told everybody what's in it and

2360
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:37,198
it's the truth and it's the only reason

2361
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:39,679
i can remember anything

2362
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:42,479
is because i always tell the truth

2363
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,639
if i did lie to make it look better or

2364
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:47,039
sound cooler or something i could never

2365
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:49,440
keep all the lies straight i mean i'm an

2366
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:52,319
old guy and a lot of stuff you're asking

2367
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:55,678
me to remember you know was you know 15

2368
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:57,599
years ago or more

2369
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:00,880
yeah totally sorry to

2370
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,880
put you under the pressure like that

2371
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,679
well

2372
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:07,119
no i've enjoyed it just fine uh i'm just

2373
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:10,158
saying that you know

2374
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:11,840
that old stoner and in my memories the

2375
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:15,279
worst things are

2376
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:17,360
uh the actual names of people but i did

2377
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:20,479
i did meet a lot of the big breeders you

2378
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:23,119
know i i did go to amsterdam a few times

2379
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:26,678
i traveled with gypsy in his jaguar in

2380
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:30,319
europe i drove this jaguar man it went

2381
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:34,000
156 miles an hour it was a nice big car

2382
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:36,559
and man that was so cool i mean

2383
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,439
cruising the autobahn and stuff man we

2384
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,000
were

2385
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:42,879
we were uh down in switzerland we went

2386
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,039
to breeder steve's greenhouses and stuff

2387
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:48,480
just before he got up

2388
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:50,238
i i was worried that us being the

2389
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:53,119
pictures that were shown could have led

2390
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:56,638
to him getting in trouble and i thought

2391
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:58,639
[ __ ] me and we were all pretty careless

2392
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:01,199
yeah wow that sounds very much like the

2393
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,199
heyday

2394
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:06,319
well

2395
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:07,759
you know i mean it was like

2396
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:09,840
when i first

2397
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,719
got into this business with gypsy you

2398
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:16,000
know i mean he was the one that asked me

2399
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:18,639
to make seeds for him and he uh

2400
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,560
had put up a picture of this bubble gum

2401
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:21,359
because he knew i grew bubble gum you

2402
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,920
know

2403
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:26,238
and he had had a win to free pack about

2404
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:29,039
of seeds if you can tell me what this

2405
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:31,359
strain was and the picture showed how it

2406
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:33,840
was all popcorned out the bud the way

2407
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:35,519
bubblegum should look when it's done and

2408
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,119
i right away said well it looks like

2409
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,080
bubble gum to me

2410
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:42,319
and he says oh yeah you win bushy you

2411
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,880
you definitely get the the pack of

2412
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:47,599
bubblegum seeds so i got another pack of

2413
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:50,319
bubblegum seeds and they were uh simon's

2414
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,880
uh and uh i grew those

2415
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:55,759
and you know they were a lot different

2416
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,840
than than my bubble gum and they tasted

2417
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,600
and smelled like bubble gum too but a

2418
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,520
little bit more like

2419
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,440
cotton candy to me

2420
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,000
than my bubble gum

2421
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:08,238
and i also thought that while it was a

2422
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,719
large plant and everything

2423
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:13,678
it was awfully woody like it was more

2424
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:15,920
wooden tree than it was bud you know but

2425
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,600
of course phenotypes vary a little bit

2426
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:20,000
who knows how many

2427
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:21,920
i had to work with just one pack i think

2428
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,238
of those

2429
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:27,119
yeah okay i've heard people comment

2430
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:29,839
about that about how i think um there's

2431
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:31,519
kind of a more indicating bubblegum and

2432
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:34,639
i think simons may have been the more

2433
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,639
sativally anyone

2434
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:40,158
i don't know if it was more sativa or

2435
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:43,199
not it definitely had this woody and

2436
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:45,679
stout structure

2437
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:47,759
uh it definitely was you know a pretty

2438
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:51,359
good size player but i thought it was

2439
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:53,520
just as indica sided in my opinion

2440
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:56,079
yeah okay i could be offered that one

2441
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,080
so i mean while talking about you having

2442
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:00,319
your little holiday in europe is the

2443
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:02,079
european market something you want to

2444
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:05,599

2445
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:08,639
busy trying to keep up with domestic

2446
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:10,239
well we've been limited in our ability

2447
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,760
to stay

2448
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:16,158

you know some problems that res dog had

2453
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:25,439
we decided to go domestic for a while

2454
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:27,119
and we're entertaining the notions of

2455
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:29,279
certain countries

2456
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:30,800

2457
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:33,439

2492
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:54,479
the best service around

2493
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:57,119
that's the one

2494
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:59,119
so sorry just to uh jump back to the

2495
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:01,119
question i was gonna ask i've got a

2496
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:02,399
legal question here so it's it's a bit

2497
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:04,800
of an interesting one but i want to hear

2498
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:07,519
your opinion on it where do you see the

2499
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,639
future of cannabis going in california

2500
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:11,440
because obviously that's what you're

2501
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:13,279
probably more familiar with and do you

2502
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:16,319
think that the world will follow

2503
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:16,319
california's suit

2504
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,800
i hope not

2505
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:22,238
honestly

2506
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,880
uh

2507
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:28,718
and eddie lev is a good fight he's a

2508
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:30,239
cannabis activist out here as am i

2509
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,000
in california

2510
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:33,919
we had the longest running medical

2511
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,600
marijuana system

2512
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,560
of any state

2513
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,679
we ran it for like 15 years with no

2514
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,920
problems

2515
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,679
believe me a cottage industry

2516
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,679
people could take their

2517
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:47,118
half a pound or whatever to a local

2518
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:49,359
dispensary

2519
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:51,279
they could be paid for it

2520
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:54,079
they could go home and they could afford

2521
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:55,599
to have a roof over their head

2522
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:57,359
legalization

2523
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,880
well we've always all wanted

2524
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:00,799
legalization

2525
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:03,039
but we want sanity

2526
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:06,480
this kind of legalization

2527
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:08,560
is just regulating it far too much

2528
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:11,039
taxing it far too much

2529
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,800
with no exceptions for medical users

2530
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:15,679
senior citizens

2531
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,840
or people that want to grow be limited

2532
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:20,158
to like four plants

2533
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:22,159
no this isn't going to stand

2534
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:24,479
eddie lep and i and a lot of other

2535
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:26,559
people involved in the medical

2536
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:28,638
industry out here furious

2537
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:31,520
with the fact that they lied about the

2538
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:34,000
promises that our medical rights would

2539
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,960
not be lost well maybe not for a year or

2540
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,039
so

2541
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,639
yes they are threatened and we are

2542
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:40,238
working on

2543
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,520
ballot initiatives

2544
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:44,158
to get

2545
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,600
our medical rights protected and listen

2546
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:49,519
i'm naturopathic i'm into health and i

2547
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,079
believe in medicine and doctors and all

2548
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,400
that but i believe in the personal right

2549
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:57,359
of a person to grow herbs for their own

2550
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:58,638
use and i mean any plan and i don't care

2551
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:00,559
what plan

2552
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:02,800
the fact is that if it's for your own

2553
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:05,119
use and you're not even selling it it's

2554
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:07,119
nobody's business but your own

2555
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:08,479
and there's a lot of people that think

2556
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:10,479
it's healthier

2557
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:13,118
than a lot of the medicines that people

2558
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:15,359
use for god's sakes

2559
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:17,839
this this pharmaceuticals that got

2560
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,599
everybody addicted on opiates if people

2561
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,199
were growing their own

2562
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,440
opium poppies

2563
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:24,879
and bleeding them and putting that on

2564
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:26,960
their weed and smoking it they wouldn't

2565
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,800
even get addicted to it because it would

2566
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:32,399
be at such a low level

2567
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:34,639
but it's not in its natural form

2568
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:37,439
you know that's why i like raw cannabis

2569
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:40,239
much better than concentrates yeah i

2570
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:41,919
know raw cannabis it's a fresh produce

2571
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:43,759
and it doesn't last forever and we got a

2572
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,399
lot of it and we need to turn a lot of

2573
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:47,280
it

2574
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:49,679
into concentrates but

2575
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:52,079
what i like is fresh cannabis and i

2576
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:53,920
honestly think that it's it's healthy

2577
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:56,238
and maybe it's healthier to vape than to

2578
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:58,960
smoke but i still smoke it after all

2579
01:36:56,238 --> 01:37:01,599
these years of my wife and i sm

2580
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:04,158
smoking all kinds of marijuana it hasn't

2581
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,400
harmed us it kept us from getting cancer

2582
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:09,359
i smoked cigarettes for years and i had

2583
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:12,079
a heart bypass operation 25 years ago

2584
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:14,079
but cannabis has kept me alive since

2585
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:17,920
then

2586
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:19,118
yeah wow what an incredible testimony

2587
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,039
so

2588
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:23,279
with that being said

2589
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:25,760
what legal changes do you think need to

2590
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:30,639
occur to facilitate a more productive

2591
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:32,480
cannabis industry and just culture

2592
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:33,920
well to tell you the truth i agree with

2593
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:36,399
governor brown and the governor of

2594
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:39,199
colorado and a lot of people and this

2595
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:42,319
may sound crazy to you but i was not for

2596
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:44,719
this legalization proposition and a lot

2597
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:46,719
of people in oregon and ohio you know

2598
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,239
the horrible thing they set up in ohio

2599
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:51,439
where just five farms would have a

2600
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:53,519
monopoly growing all the wheat in ohio

2601
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:55,599
and the voters voted down just like

2602
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,800
california voted legalization down the

2603
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,400
first time

2604
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,320
and they voted it down because it was

2605
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:02,479
all commercialistic it was all about

2606
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:05,198
taxes there's only reason they're doing

2607
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:07,198
it and you know i don't begrudge a

2608
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:09,519
recreational system

2609
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:10,399
there can be a recreational system of

2610
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:13,199
legal

2611
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:16,000
weed and there can also be the medical

2612
01:38:13,198 --> 01:38:16,799
marijuana system where people don't have

2613
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,960
to

2614
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:22,320
work in the same fashion and it doesn't

2615
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:25,118
have to be taxed so heavily

2616
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:27,359
yeah of course and so do you think that

2617
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:29,039
that is a potential for california to go

2618
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:32,719
back to like the former model or do you

2619
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:34,238
think you've almost come too far

2620
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,000
well tell you the truth i don't know

2621
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:38,479
what the future will bring i do think

2622
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,039
that a nationwide medical marijuana

2623
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:42,000
system would make more sense

2624
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:43,920
but

2625
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,600
i understand they just think everything

2626
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,480
commercially in the business world like

2627
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,039
making

2628
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:51,359
fewer producers to make sure you're able

2629
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,039
to collect all your taxes you know we

2630
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:53,839
could have made sure that all the all

2631
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:56,000
the

2632
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,880
was safe so there could have been a

2633
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,198
system set up that would have preserved

2634
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:03,920
the cottage industry it's going to

2635
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:05,839
create and is creating a disaster

2636
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,158
in the states where they took away the

2637
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,920
medical marijuana and put in effect

2638
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:12,479
legal marijuana the same thing's

2639
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,000
happening in canada right now and that's

2640
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,559
a whole country you know they just

2641
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,639
legalized it well one of the seed

2642
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,199
companies that i sell seeds to up in

2643
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:23,679
canada just informed us that she's not

2644
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:27,519
allowed to sell seeds anymore now how is

2645
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:30,000
that legalization man yeah it's

2646
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:32,159
one step forward three steps back

2647
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,118
well that's exactly what i mean

2648
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:37,279
everything was just fine in california

2649
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:39,039
with the medical system that we had

2650
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:42,079
and i didn't hear anybody complaining

2651
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:43,920
you know but real commercial interests

2652
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,439
you know it's like the politicians

2653
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,279
didn't want to pass a bill to legalize

2654
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:49,359
marijuana so what'd they do

2655
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:52,079
you can't change a ballot initiative in

2656
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:54,479
california in congress without having

2657
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:57,039
like a two-thirds vote in both house so

2658
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:58,959
they got another ballot initiative up it

2659
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:00,479
made it look like this was going to be

2660
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,719
good you know

2661
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:04,879
and all people can buy now

2662
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:07,359
is a lesser grade of marijuana at a

2663
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,880
higher price or they have to go back

2664
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:12,079
underground

2665
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:14,079
to the black market to get good weed at

2666
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:16,479
a reasonable price from one of their

2667
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:17,519
friends

2668
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:19,359
yeah

2669
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,560
just as a bit of a change of pace

2670
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:22,000
because that's all the legal questions

2671
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,560
we had we've got a question here that

2672
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,520
was submitted by one of our patreon

2673
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,080
viewers

2674
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,199
however i'm actually not that familiar

2675
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:30,639
with it so i'm hoping you're just going

2676
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:31,839
to be able to take the reins and answer

2677
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:33,520
this one here

2678
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,360
the question is

2679
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,199
what are the common mistakes you see

2680
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:41,118
people making when they're making water

2681
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:41,118
hash at home or bubble hash

2682
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:46,079
oh okay i love bubble bash and i still

2683
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:48,559
make that all the time and

2684
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:51,118
i'm just getting ready to make a whole a

2685
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:53,600
whole bunch of it to put away and store

2686
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:55,198
for myself right now don't even have any

2687
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:57,360
plans of selling it

2688
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:59,279
i'll tell you how i do it first of all

2689
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:01,679
you know a bubble man is a friend of

2690
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,759
mine from back in the days of either

2691
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:05,600
overgrow or icy mag whenever he came out

2692
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,520
with his bags inhale

2693
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:09,760
i was one of the first guys that he

2694
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,800
wanted to send a free set of three bags

2695
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,280
to

2696
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:15,039
because he knew i'd make the hash and

2697
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:17,118
how many followers i had at the

2698
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:20,079
overgrower or i see mine

2699
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:22,158
and so i appreciated that and i read his

2700
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:24,319
thread about how you do it

2701
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:25,920
and i pretty much followed his

2702
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:28,079
directions and

2703
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:31,039
found that my different strengths

2704
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:33,840
produced the different hashes and that

2705
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:36,560
for a while you know we were uh mostly

2706
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:39,360
making bubble hash and then switched

2707
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:41,360
over to making sour bubble hatch

2708
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:42,719
the sour bubble hash

2709
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:45,359
it turned out

2710
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:47,198
it we did get that tested and it did

2711
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:50,079
turn out to be uh

2712
01:41:47,198 --> 01:41:52,719
pretty darn good for bubble hash and the

2713
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:55,118
way i made it wasn't all that special

2714
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:57,359
but it was it was nearly 60 percent

2715
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:59,039
still it's nearly 60 percent

2716
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:01,359
thc

2717
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,158
and not too much cbd

2718
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:04,719
but

2719
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:07,039
it comes out really dark like a really

2720
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:09,840
dark red to black

2721
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:11,760
and i really like

2722
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,960
the hash that comes from the sour bubble

2723
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,760
but my process is pretty simple and you

2724
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:18,480
know

2725
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:21,679
i really think that it's not necessary

2726
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:23,759
to use a whole large number of bags

2727
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:25,760
i just used two bags

2728
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:27,840
i mean three

2729
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,239
i think one of the mistakes people make

2730
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,840
is is taking out

2731
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:35,599
and separating away from the hash

2732
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,119
uh

2733
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:39,840
resins that are

2734
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:45,118
in the like 120 range okay

2735
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:47,760
like i mix and strain my weed in a 220

2736
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:50,000
and then that bag

2737
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:53,199
goes into a 160

2738
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:56,238
and i do a second strain with the 160

2739
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:57,198
and then i just catch it all in a 45.

2740
01:42:56,238 --> 01:42:58,959
now

2741
01:42:57,198 --> 01:43:00,238
unless your strain is really high

2742
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,039
quality

2743
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,799
and your trim is just sugar leaves like

2744
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:05,920
i use really

2745
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,320
upgrade

2746
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:11,039
trim this won't work for you but it

2747
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:12,880
works for me in sour bubble and what it

2748
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,000
does to improve the hash

2749
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,520
is

2750
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,679
the larger stuff like the 130 140 that

2751
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:22,719
gets through the 160 bag

2752
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:24,239
there's a lot of flavor in that and that

2753
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:26,239
that's what people are realizing they're

2754
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:29,359
just going ahead separating that out and

2755
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:31,439
using it in their edibles or whatever

2756
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:34,000
because it's lighter weight hash and

2757
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:35,599
then a lot of them collect in the 73

2758
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,118
which is good

2759
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:40,000
but believe me

2760
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:41,920
there's stuff going through the 73

2761
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,719
that's also good

2762
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,118
so

2763
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:48,000
if you catch it all in the 45

2764
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:51,198
from the 160 to the 45 and it's really

2765
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,639
high quality trim that you put in there

2766
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:56,879
then you can get a good amount of a more

2767
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:59,440
flavorful bubble hash see the thing

2768
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:01,118
about bubble hash is you don't want them

2769
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:02,638
to all be the same and that's what i

2770
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:04,880
find

2771
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,880
sometimes a lot of concentrates is hash

2772
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:08,480
gets to be hash you know

2773
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,800
well

2774
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:13,118
more flavor like if if you've smoked the

2775
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:16,000
old conventional hashes and you know how

2776
01:44:13,118 --> 01:44:17,920
good they taste like these fingers like

2777
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,800
good moroccan or good

2778
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,560
lebanese or lebanese these ganaches

2779
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,239
weren't as strong as bubble hashes we

2780
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:27,199
make now by any means

2781
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:29,359
but they were delicious and you know to

2782
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:31,759
me that's a big deal

2783
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:33,679
uh i don't often agree with everything

2784
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,880
that dj short says

2785
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:36,880
and you know

2786
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:40,239
so one time he was talking i was

2787
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:42,480
listening i know him slightly

2788
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:44,000
about how people are trying to just jack

2789
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:46,959
up and get these

2790
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:50,880
highest potency strains like it's like

2791
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:52,399
adding neutral spirits to fine wine or

2792
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:55,760
something you know

2793
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:57,198
well i i see his point you know but my

2794
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,679
sour bubble's really strong and it's

2795
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:01,519
really good and so i i don't think

2796
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:03,760
there's a problem with them having good

2797
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,040
power

2798
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,199
yeah and i agree

2799
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:09,439
so on to the last question before we do

2800
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:11,039
our last little quickfire ones

2801
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:13,198
so we've kind of already touched on this

2802
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:15,118
but just to get a clarification where do

2803
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:17,839
you sit on the issue of people breeding

2804
01:45:15,118 --> 01:45:20,319
with your work specifically

2805
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:21,679
do you like it if someone comes to you

2806
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:24,158
and says you know hey i've got this

2807
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:25,760
thing i'm doing is that okay or do you

2808
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:27,198
kind of think like there's no onus for

2809
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,880
them to contact you and ask for

2810
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:30,399
permission or anything like where do you

2811
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,800
sit

2812
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:34,638
well i like it when a person shows me

2813
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,880
the respect to expedition but i don't

2814
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:39,520
expect that and you know the truth is

2815
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:41,840
when i sell you my seeds

2816
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:44,960
you've bought them and you own them and

2817
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:48,319
you can do what you please with them now

2818
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:49,920
if you actually make see my seeds i hope

2819
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:52,559
that it'll at least be across with

2820
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:55,520
something else and not just a knockoff

2821
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:57,760
of my strain and they wouldn't just make

2822
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:59,760
a knock off of my strain and call it

2823
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,119
exactly the same but i wouldn't mind if

2824
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,440
you made a strain

2825
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:06,479
and then you told what was truthfully in

2826
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:08,238
it and gave me a little credit now

2827
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:11,359
that's good enough for me

2828
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:13,919
because you know i'm i'm actually more

2829
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:16,399
part of the past this industry than i am

2830
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:18,880
the future i mean i know what i'd like

2831
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:21,359
to see and what i'd like to see is that

2832
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,440
everybody contributing and coming up

2833
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:25,279
with new stuff on their own

2834
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:27,839
like back in the day having so much fun

2835
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:31,039
doing it

2836
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:34,000
yeah fantastic what a great sentiment

2837
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:36,000
so on to our last little few questions i

2838
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,039
call them the quickfire section

2839
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,560
so

2840
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,800
let's jump into them it's just five

2841
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:43,039
quick little questions so what is your

2842
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:46,000
favorite strain that you think has got a

2843
01:46:43,039 --> 01:46:46,000
bit of a bad rap

2844
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:58,800
i'm thinking i'll tell you i do think

2845
01:46:55,118 --> 01:47:00,960
that uh sometimes bubble gum doesn't get

2846
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:03,360
the wrap it deserves

2847
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,480
now maybe you think it never got a bad

2848
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:06,479
rap but

2849
01:47:04,479 --> 01:47:09,759
the truth is i remember

2850
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:11,439
uh things like you know it's kind of

2851
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,000
inconsistent or

2852
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:16,479
or or runts or mutants or something like

2853
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,920
that and i don't ever remember any of my

2854
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:18,799
seeds being that way that they were

2855
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,399
always

2856
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:22,960
hearty and healthy

2857
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,799
other complaints that it really wasn't

2858
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:28,560
very strong you know

2859
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:30,239
well i i remember i had people say to me

2860
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:31,600
why do you like to grow bubble gum you

2861
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:33,599
know i mean

2862
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:36,159
it's really not that strong

2863
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:38,880
well it seems strong to me i mean it's

2864
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:41,599
got the indica high it's very relaxing

2865
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:43,920
and you know i

2866
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:46,719
i'm not so sure i know

2867
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,960
many strains that have gotten such a bad

2868
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:51,520
rap you know i mean

2869
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:54,399
uh well i i think of

2870
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:57,040
do i don't want to any negativity on any

2871
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:59,439
other straights from any other breeders

2872
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:01,198
you know i'm a really nice guy and i

2873
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:03,198
wouldn't want to point out

2874
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:06,158
you know some bad work that some other

2875
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:06,158
breeder did okay

2876
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:09,198
you just answered the next question

2877
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,679
which is going to be

2878
01:48:09,198 --> 01:48:12,960
what is the your least favorite strain

2879
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:14,079
maybe you know it doesn't have to be

2880
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,158
something from someone else could just

2881
01:48:14,079 --> 01:48:19,439
be a general thing you know you might oh

2882
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:20,719
well to tell you the truth uh

2883
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:23,359
even though

2884
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:24,399
uh i recognize how strong it is and how

2885
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:28,000
good it

2886
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:28,000
there are i really don't like that much

2887
01:48:28,479 --> 01:48:34,238
most sour diesels are too fuelly for me

2888
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,760
and i won't smoke them i smoked one so

2889
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:37,599
strong one time it practically put me

2890
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,079
down on my knees okay

2891
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:41,840
i know how strong it can be

2892
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:43,840
uh

2893
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,600
some of the canned dog stuff i really

2894
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:48,880
don't like the taste

2895
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:51,119
and uh no i i like train wreck and

2896
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:53,840
people got sick of the taste of that and

2897
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:55,519
maybe it got a bad rep but trainwreck is

2898
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:59,039
a great old strain

2899
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:00,719
that i would still consider working with

2900
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:03,600
yeah well maybe we need that because no

2901
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:05,600
one is working with it really

2902
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,440
well the truth is that it has a great

2903
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:08,639
painkilling effect

2904
01:49:07,439 --> 01:49:11,519
and uh

2905
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:13,920
i like the taste but people get sick of

2906
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:16,960
the taste and you know of my strengths

2907
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:21,039
like one of the best tasting ones

2908
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:23,279
that has like a lot of nose and flavor

2909
01:49:21,039 --> 01:49:24,960
is the blue moon rocks

2910
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:26,559
but

2911
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,359
i love this stuff but i couldn't just

2912
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:31,599
smoke it all the time it's like after a

2913
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:33,039
while you definitely want something else

2914
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:37,679
because it's just

2915
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:39,439
so strong of kind of blueberry taste

2916
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:42,399
yeah well that sounds like what i need

2917
01:49:39,439 --> 01:49:44,319
in my life

2918
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:46,399
oh it's beautiful stuff you know the

2919
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:47,920
blue kush yields a little less but it's

2920
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:50,879
even stronger

2921
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:53,039
they're both related and it didn't talk

2922
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,639
about it but the blue moon rocks one of

2923
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:57,760
my old strains

2924
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,118
that it was an old clone blue moon

2925
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,840
uh

2926
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:04,799
and that had a blueberry in it that

2927
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:07,360
wasn't dj's it was vic's blueberry

2928
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:09,520
and so it makes my blue moon rocks

2929
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:13,279
considerably different blueberry that's

2930
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:15,599
not as dark purple as dj's but

2931
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:17,840
yields real well

2932
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:19,679
yeah okay i might need to take a little

2933
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:21,360
investigation into that one myself by

2934
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:25,599
the sounds of it

2935
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:26,719
so well the blue moon clone was gets me

2936
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:29,760
either

2937
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:32,158
by one or two guys okay and i'm not sure

2938
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,199
if those seats were given to me by sub

2939
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:35,279
cool

2940
01:50:33,198 --> 01:50:37,839
but i had a friend in florida named

2941
01:50:35,279 --> 01:50:39,198
tommy and i think he sent me the seeds

2942
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:42,159
and he told me

2943
01:50:39,198 --> 01:50:44,960
that the blue moon was a cross

2944
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:47,519
of this vix blueberry and i remember vic

2945
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:50,880
from back in the overgrown times

2946
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:53,520
and a mcgannopy moonbeam and you know

2947
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:55,118
there was a blue moonshine that came out

2948
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:56,960
after blue moon

2949
01:50:55,118 --> 01:50:59,759
which was different okay it was probably

2950
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:01,599
blue moon crossed with something else

2951
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:04,239
but anyhow i got the seeds of the blue

2952
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:06,800
moon and i didn't want to change it that

2953
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:07,759
much you know that would be my bubble

2954
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,880
berry

2955
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:12,639
but the fact is that i kept it more like

2956
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:16,239
the blue moon

2957
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:17,520
than bringing it to my bubble gum side

2958
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:20,959
yeah okay

2959
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:23,360
so the next question is desert island

2960
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,719
situation you can only take two strains

2961
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:26,238
with you to this desert island you have

2962
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:28,960
unlimited amounts of it but you can only

2963
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:31,118
pick two strains which two

2964
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:32,239
well sour bubble would definitely be one

2965
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:33,519
of them

2966
01:51:32,238 --> 01:51:34,559
uh

2967
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,719
there

2968
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:39,119
there's a several others that i really

2969
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:39,920
like a lot and you know it's really fun

2970
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:42,000
to

2971
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:45,199
grow the strawberry and

2972
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,840
the sour grape is of nearly comparable

2973
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:49,598
quality those three the sour bubble the

2974
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:52,400
sour grape and this

2975
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:53,840
strawberry but i wanted to mention sour

2976
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:56,000
boggle because

2977
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,480
you know my boggle gum was one of my

2978
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,158
original streets that we crossed to the

2979
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:02,559
sour bubble

2980
01:52:00,158 --> 01:52:05,039
and the sour bottle came out

2981
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:08,560
surprising results

2982
01:52:05,039 --> 01:52:12,079
in that it's very bubble gummy flavor

2983
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:15,280
uh it's very up daytime high unlike most

2984
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:18,079
of the mostly bubblegum flavored ones

2985
01:52:15,279 --> 01:52:19,840
and you know it's got a taste

2986
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:22,479
that there's something besides the

2987
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:25,119
bubble gum but uh i kind of call it a

2988
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:28,079
champagne bubble gum for some reason

2989
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:30,639
kind of like a gold bubble gum

2990
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:33,359
yeah that sounds great so that might be

2991
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:33,359
the other one no

2992
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:38,079
yeah okay so you got your two

2993
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:40,560
bog bubble and the uh sour bubble i i

2994
01:52:38,079 --> 01:52:42,639
think i think sour bubble

2995
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:45,520
and the sour

2996
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:47,440
boggle which is sour boggle gum

2997
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:50,320
uh yeah that's the one

2998
01:52:47,439 --> 01:52:53,118
so this is one of my favorite questions

2999
01:52:50,319 --> 01:52:55,279
if you could go back to any point in

3000
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:57,198
time and history as well as anywhere in

3001
01:52:55,279 --> 01:52:59,039
the world to presumably collect some

3002
01:52:57,198 --> 01:53:00,638
land race seeds where would you go and

3003
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:02,479
what period

3004
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:03,359
that's a good question

3005
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:05,678
you know

3006
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:08,158
land raised seeds working with them it's

3007
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:09,920
definitely like would be very rewarding

3008
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:12,399
you know to say

3009
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,480
this is you know the congo bongo you

3010
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:16,158
know this is what they grew there for

3011
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:18,718
hundreds of years

3012
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:21,118
and you worked with it and you

3013
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:23,760
you know bred and selected until you got

3014
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:26,399
it even more potent you know most of the

3015
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,440
land race strains really start out not

3016
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:30,960
being

3017
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:32,479
all that great and i'm not sure but it

3018
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:35,118
seems to me that

3019
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:37,919
it would have been a long time ago and i

3020
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:38,719
would be thinking asia you know like you

3021
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,719
know

3022
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:44,000
one of the things maybe

3023
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:45,760
maybe mountainous regions where you know

3024
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,039
the the uh

3025
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:51,440
the fast flowering uh cushes

3026
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:53,519
it seems like in india

3027
01:53:51,439 --> 01:53:54,719
where the hindu religion

3028
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:56,960
do you know

3029
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:58,239
that when they were

3030
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:01,039
their students

3031
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:03,359
in religion and spirituality

3032
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:07,599
that they would drink bang

3033
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:10,719
which was a mild cannabis beverage

3034
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:12,639
to make them more astute more able to

3035
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,840
learn

3036
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:17,039
so

3037
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:18,639
maybe an indian strain

3038
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:21,039
yeah okay that's certainly one that's

3039
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:23,840
not not explored much currently the

3040
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:23,840
indian genetics

3041
01:54:24,158 --> 01:54:27,679
oh well it's just that they have an

3042
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,520
ancient history

3043
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:31,840
of cannabis use

3044
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:35,440
and it's interesting to me

3045
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:38,400
and i am kind of a history buff but most

3046
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:41,118
kind of history that i study is like

3047
01:54:38,399 --> 01:54:41,920
ancient aliens and stuff man have you

3048
01:54:41,118 --> 01:54:44,319
seen

3049
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,199
that there's like pyramids all over the

3050
01:54:44,319 --> 01:54:47,840
world

3051
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:50,238
and there's pyramids on the moon and

3052
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:52,239
there's pyramids on mars and out in the

3053
01:54:50,238 --> 01:54:55,678
asteroid belt

3054
01:54:52,238 --> 01:54:58,879
there's a dwarf planet called sirius

3055
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:00,639
and they show pictures of one of our

3056
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,880
probes went out through the asteroid

3057
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:06,239
belt and took pictures of this planet

3058
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:09,118
there is a six mile high pyramid on

3059
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:11,118
sirius man

3060
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:12,559
all i can say is i'm so happy you just

3061
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:15,198
said all of this

3062
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:18,239
yeah i think it's great

3063
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:20,638
well i tell you the aliens are out there

3064
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:22,799
man and they're already here too

3065
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:26,400
and the fact is that i don't really

3066
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:29,520
trust them but they have telepathy they

3067
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:31,920
can look just like regular people

3068
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:34,239
and i don't trust them but they seem

3069
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,239
nice

3070
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,880
wow yeah you want to

3071
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:41,198
just shine the spotlight on someone name

3072
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:44,079
and shame someone

3073
01:55:41,198 --> 01:55:46,719
well i can tell you you know like i

3074
01:55:44,079 --> 01:55:48,158
actually had experiences

3075
01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:50,719
that are real

3076
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:52,879
not just made up mythical stuff about

3077
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,840
bog living in a cave or anything like

3078
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,880
that

3079
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,239
but

3080
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:00,159
that when i was just seven years old

3081
01:55:58,238 --> 01:56:02,799
and i was in a kresge store in

3082
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:04,479
birmingham michigan my mom let me go

3083
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,599
look at the toy section while she was

3084
01:56:04,479 --> 01:56:07,839
shopping

3085
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:10,319
which was usual today

3086
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:13,039
and i'm walking down the aisle

3087
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:15,599
and here a man in a business suit

3088
01:56:13,039 --> 01:56:16,800
is facing me down the aisle like 15 feet

3089
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:19,119
away from me

3090
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:21,440
and has telepathy to me you know we have

3091
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:24,158
an eye contact

3092
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:25,198
and this is what he said i swear to god

3093
01:56:24,158 --> 01:56:27,118
he said

3094
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:30,079
i'm from another planet

3095
01:56:27,118 --> 01:56:31,920
he says there's a million of us here and

3096
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:33,279
we're here to help you and he walked

3097
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:35,920
right

3098
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:37,599
on by and mouth dropped open and i told

3099
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,199
my family about it

3100
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:41,199
and they knew

3101
01:56:39,198 --> 01:56:43,678
that i didn't make up stories when i was

3102
01:56:41,198 --> 01:56:46,638
a little kid or anything

3103
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:49,599
so that happened and then when my wife

3104
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:50,960
and i were first married it was 1974

3105
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:53,119
we've been married a couple years we

3106
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:56,319
were in central michigan it's just one

3107
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:57,279
summer where we saw a bunch of ufos and

3108
01:56:56,319 --> 01:56:59,359
i mean

3109
01:56:57,279 --> 01:57:02,479
i i had other people at my house see him

3110
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:03,759
too and and my family my parents my

3111
01:57:02,479 --> 01:57:06,158
sister her

3112
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:08,320
husband her kid the darn things were

3113
01:57:06,158 --> 01:57:11,118
flying around and they were triangular

3114
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:14,000
most of them and then one night

3115
01:57:11,118 --> 01:57:16,000
uh my wife and i just alone

3116
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,238
and we had taken some shrooms so you

3117
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,079
could say wow you were just tripping but

3118
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:20,799
we didn't see [ __ ] like this when we

3119
01:57:20,079 --> 01:57:23,198
took

3120
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,800
rooms okay we saw

3121
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:26,399
something come down

3122
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,560
and land on the road in front of our

3123
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:30,079
neighbor's house which is like a quarter

3124
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:33,119
mile away okay

3125
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:34,000
and this wasn't triangular and it landed

3126
01:57:33,118 --> 01:57:36,479
and

3127
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,639
it looked kind of like a bus you know

3128
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:40,959
like a short bus or something or

3129
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:42,159
shuttlecraft from the starship

3130
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:45,039
enterprise

3131
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:47,759
and it landed on the road like

3132
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:49,760
i guess facing away from us and i got

3133
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,960
binoculars we're up in our yard and i'm

3134
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:54,000
looking at it

3135
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,520
and the thing rotated like an army tank

3136
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,719
in the road

3137
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:01,840
and a a hole opened up it had sort of a

3138
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:05,198
hood on the front that stocked out and a

3139
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:07,520
hatch opened up on the front of its hood

3140
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:10,960
and i had to pull the binoculars away

3141
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:12,800
real quick as a giant light a bright arc

3142
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:15,039
light came up through the hole in the

3143
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:17,440
front of that thing and after it turned

3144
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:19,679
on this huge bright light

3145
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:21,919
it was the craziest thing you ever saw

3146
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:23,520
man i swear to god it's the whole truth

3147
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,599
my wife and i

3148
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:27,440
there was a large field a kitty corner

3149
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:29,279
from our house we're out at a farm in

3150
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:31,039
the country on dirt road

3151
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:33,198
and this large field across from the

3152
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:35,439
neighbor's house it went out in that

3153
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:37,118
field and it skimmed it like an air

3154
01:58:35,439 --> 01:58:38,559
cushioned vehicle

3155
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:40,639
or like something that could have been

3156
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:43,039
making a circle zipping around the field

3157
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:44,880
back and forth so fast that it looked

3158
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:46,479
like a cartoon like it couldn't be real

3159
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:48,560
or something you know

3160
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:51,118
and then the thing actually went down to

3161
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:53,840
the river a creek anyhow

3162
01:58:51,118 --> 01:58:55,839
and it's turned off its light and it sat

3163
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:58,400
on the ground and the river there

3164
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:00,480
for possibly a half an hour

3165
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:03,279
and while it was on the ground

3166
01:59:00,479 --> 01:59:05,118
it had little remote sentry vehicles

3167
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:07,759
marching back and forth

3168
01:59:05,118 --> 01:59:09,359
to a corner right over us basically on

3169
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,119
its perimeter

3170
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:12,319
and after it was there for about a half

3171
01:59:11,118 --> 01:59:14,559
an hour

3172
01:59:12,319 --> 01:59:17,198
it it took off

3173
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,560
and this was the strangest part you know

3174
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:20,638
the other ones

3175
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:22,480
they were always pretty quiet you know

3176
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,880
nothing but a low hum

3177
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:26,919
this one when it took off the ground it

3178
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:30,159
was going straight up

3179
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:33,039
slowly and the lights revolving around

3180
01:59:30,158 --> 01:59:35,198
each other and it had a whining sound

3181
01:59:33,039 --> 01:59:36,960
noise building up like we'd never heard

3182
01:59:35,198 --> 01:59:39,039
from one of them and it reached a

3183
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:40,880
certain altitude and the red lights were

3184
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:43,359
spinning real fast and the whining was

3185
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:44,480
real loud and all of a sudden it shot at

3186
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:47,118
an angle

3187
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:49,439
really high like for orbit

3188
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:50,799
and it took off so fast i swear it would

3189
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:52,960
have killed a human

3190
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:55,599
it set three shock waves it almost broke

3191
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:57,599
my front window it buckled in and out

3192
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:58,880
three times and later did break in a

3193
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:00,239
storm

3194
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:02,639
and that thing

3195
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:04,158
shot across the sky at the highest angle

3196
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:05,920
like

3197
02:00:04,158 --> 02:00:07,839
jail it was going up and then just

3198
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,880
disappeared it was so fast

3199
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,840
and

3200
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:15,920
you know that's

3201
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:15,920
my well that was full-on

3202
02:00:16,079 --> 02:00:18,639
it's true

3203
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:21,198
yeah no i

3204
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:22,960
don't think you can make that up

3205
02:00:21,198 --> 02:00:25,198
believe me i wouldn't and i know how

3206
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,560
crazy it sounds all right

3207
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:28,719
i even admit that we took a couple

3208
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:30,400
shrooms that night but maybe it somehow

3209
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:32,960
allowed us to see something that we

3210
02:00:30,399 --> 02:00:34,719
normally wouldn't have seen now the next

3211
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:37,118
day i went and looked around out that

3212
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:39,520
field on a dirt bike like did it knock

3213
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:41,439
down a fence or anything did it make any

3214
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:42,400
marks in the weeds and

3215
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:44,719
nothing

3216
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:46,079
there was no trace of anything so

3217
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:47,599
it might have been an encounter the

3218
02:00:46,079 --> 02:00:49,359
second kind because it did make my

3219
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:51,679
window bounce in and out and the

3220
02:00:49,359 --> 02:00:53,598
shockwave did hit us in the chest like

3221
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:55,679
uh air cannon you know it's what it felt

3222
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:57,440
like it broke the sound barrier

3223
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:58,480
instantly

3224
02:00:57,439 --> 02:01:00,559
wow

3225
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:02,158
yeah okay

3226
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:04,000
so i think we could probably get stuck

3227
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:06,399
on this all day maybe maybe we should

3228
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,760
jump back to the last question

3229
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:10,479
yeah

3230
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:11,280
so absolute last question it's a good

3231
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:14,479
one

3232
02:01:11,279 --> 02:01:16,079
if you could recommend one bog strain to

3233
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:18,319
anyone out there regardless of their

3234
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:20,319
skill level their experience all that

3235
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:21,519
what would it be

3236
02:01:20,319 --> 02:01:23,679
well i guess you would say would be

3237
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:25,679
boggle gum because

3238
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:27,359
i i want them to be successful if

3239
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:30,319
they're novices

3240
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:32,319
i want them to have a nice yielding

3241
02:01:30,319 --> 02:01:34,960
good product that they would probably be

3242
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:38,079
happy to grow if they're not novices

3243
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:39,118
and i think that it is exemplary of our

3244
02:01:38,079 --> 02:01:41,840
strengths

3245
02:01:39,118 --> 02:01:44,559
because it does very much

3246
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:50,480
have the bubble gum taste that i love

3247
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:53,119
and it also is easy for anybody to grow

3248
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:54,319
what a great answer

3249
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:56,000
so

3250
02:01:54,319 --> 02:01:57,279
brings us to about the end of it did you

3251
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,000
have any comments or shout outs you

3252
02:01:57,279 --> 02:02:00,000
wanted to make at all

3253
02:02:00,399 --> 02:02:04,319
well i didn't really plan on talking

3254
02:02:02,158 --> 02:02:06,559
about the aliens or anything and you

3255
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:08,238
know if i was crazy i'd still be seeing

3256
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:10,560
them and i'm not so

3257
02:02:08,238 --> 02:02:13,039
i'm pretty sure they're still around

3258
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:15,280
but i'm not trying to say i know what

3259
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:17,198
their agenda is or anything

3260
02:02:15,279 --> 02:02:18,639
you know i'm kind of a buddhist

3261
02:02:17,198 --> 02:02:21,198
christian

3262
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:22,159
and i'm just a believer in the golden

3263
02:02:21,198 --> 02:02:24,638
rule

3264
02:02:22,158 --> 02:02:28,079
and i i really don't believe in

3265
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:29,920
in accumulating wealth i mean i've lived

3266
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:32,000
pretty well all my life i've been a

3267
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:34,800
pretty lucky kid

3268
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,520
i appreciate that i've had the love of a

3269
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:40,079
good woman for 48 years

3270
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:41,599
and that until one of us dies we'll

3271
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:42,800
still have that

3272
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:45,039
and you know

3273
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:47,599
we shared our marijuana

3274
02:02:45,039 --> 02:02:50,000
every day that we could i mean almost

3275
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:51,920
every day all those years

3276
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,599
and i have to say that it's been a

3277
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,399
sacrament for us

3278
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:58,560
that it's it's been

3279
02:02:56,399 --> 02:03:01,198
uh a right

3280
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:03,119
that we do and soma says the same thing

3281
02:03:01,198 --> 02:03:04,799
his daily sacrament

3282
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:06,319
and you know that's the way we look at

3283
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:09,679
it it's not like

3284
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:12,479
it's not like i really want to get

3285
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:15,440
blasted all the time and it's not like i

3286
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:17,759
really have to get high

3287
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:19,919
but we get up in the morning and after a

3288
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:21,520
while you know drinking some coffee and

3289
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,520
watching tv

3290
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:25,760
when we do smoke some

3291
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,760
then it does open our minds and the good

3292
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:30,480
thing about cannabis

3293
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,440
is that it does stimulate creative

3294
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:33,839
thinking

3295
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:36,719
and the biggest miracle of cannabis is

3296
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:38,800
to allow you to forget and you know it's

3297
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:40,399
hard to forget the things that are

3298
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:42,719
worrying you the things that are

3299
02:03:40,399 --> 02:03:45,039
bothering you a lot of people feel

3300
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:47,439
depressed a lot of the time a number of

3301
02:03:45,039 --> 02:03:49,760
my strains are very antidepressant in

3302
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:52,319
effects and i don't think it's a phony

3303
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,599
thing you know honestly we use medicines

3304
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:54,399
all the time

3305
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:56,800
and

3306
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:58,719
it's more like aromatherapy

3307
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:01,119
therapy it doesn't take that i mean a

3308
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:02,960
really small amount of cannabis

3309
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:05,039
can be enough to completely change

3310
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:07,279
someone's frame of mind because believe

3311
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:08,960
me that's an internal thing whether

3312
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:10,559
you're happy or not

3313
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,719
look in the mirror

3314
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:15,280
can you smile at yourself can you give

3315
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:17,198
yourself a big smile do you know

3316
02:04:15,279 --> 02:04:20,399
that you'll feel happy

3317
02:04:17,198 --> 02:04:20,399
just by smiling

3318
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,920
well you know it's just a thought from

3319
02:04:23,679 --> 02:04:28,719
an old guy that has a few mood swings

3320
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:31,599
now than himself and uh

3321
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:34,158
anxiety and worries and pressure and

3322
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:37,360
that's what cannabis is for i mean it's

3323
02:04:34,158 --> 02:04:39,759
an anti-stress thing it's like that's

3324
02:04:37,359 --> 02:04:41,839
why you get the munchies because now

3325
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:43,599
it's time to relax and that means that

3326
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:46,159
we can stop fighting for a while and we

3327
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:47,840
can we can stock up on food and we can

3328
02:04:46,158 --> 02:04:50,559
have some sleep

3329
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:53,360
