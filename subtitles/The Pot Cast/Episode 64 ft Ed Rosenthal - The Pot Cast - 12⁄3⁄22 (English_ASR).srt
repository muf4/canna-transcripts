00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,259
guru of ganja Ed Rosenthal thank you for

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,299
joining us

98
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,579
thank you for having me

99
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,620
not a problem the first question I love

100
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,840
to ask our guests these days what have

101
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,180
you been smoking on recently

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,000
uh I've been smoking some G4 and then a

103
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:24,660
proprietary variety of a friend of mine

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,379
j27 that's pretty good as well that's uh

105
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:32,220
in fact that's my favorite it's a very

106
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:36,000
socializing and upbeat

107
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,060
and G4 tends to be that way as well

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,399
nice would you say that in general you

109
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,860
prefer more sort of uplifting varieties

110
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:48,239
over the relaxing ones

111
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:51,840
well you know uh uplifting and relaxing

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,500
are not mutually uh exclusive

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,439
so does something can be uplifting and

114
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,360
not make you nervous or paranoid and

115
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,000
those those are the kinds of uplifting

116
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,360
but you know everything depends upon

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,040
mood there are times if you want if

118
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,660
you're if it's evening you probably

119
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,560
don't want wouldn't want to smoke

120
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,600
something you know that's too uh upbeat

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,160
so you wanted something a little more

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,800
relaxing

123
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,560
and there are a lot of wonderful

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,699
indicators that have that one of the

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,780
interesting things about what you just

126
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,000
mentioned about your friend's

127
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:30,000
proprietary blend is it got me thinking

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,620
I read on your website recently you

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,839
wrote a nice article about Paradise

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,418
seeds and one of the things that stood

131
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,119
out to me was Scentsy star it was such

132
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:40,500
an amazing commercial hit and it was one

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,840
of those strains where they never

134
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,639
released the genetics behind it and it

135
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,258
got me wondering do you think that we're

136
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,460
going to see more things like what your

137
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,479
friends done where there's sort of

138
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:53,159
proprietary genetics

139
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,740
well there's a way of solving that

140
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,460
problem and there are these uh firms

141
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:03,418
that uh do genetic mapping so you could

142
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:06,418
send in a sample and they could place

143
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:11,099
where it is on this genetic map

144
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:14,519
so uh so those sent so low Paradise

145
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:18,180
hasn't released re released it anybody

146
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:22,258
could send in uh a sample of it and then

147
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,840
get see where it is on the genetic map

148
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,240
yeah certainly the technology today is

149
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,818
fantastic in that regard I guess more

150
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,620
from like the commercial success point

151
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,660
of view do you think that that sort of

152
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,538
thing would fly or do you think Growers

153
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,220
are so like pedantic about what am I

154
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:39,360
growing I want to know the lineage or do

155
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,039
you think like it could work

156
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,319
commercially

157
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,279
I think that it all depends where you

158
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,139
are and either the industry or the hobby

159
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,119
and

160
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,360
um do you really have to know the

161
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,478
progenitors if you have a high quality

162
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,699
uh but does it really matter to most

163
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,818
people I don't think so

164
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,819
yeah certainly a good quality bud is a

165
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,759
rain Supreme doesn't it you know what

166
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,100
else about good quality bites they're

167
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,520
more popular than any politician

168
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,400
whatever there's an initiative in in the

169
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:21,019
United States for for marijuana and you

170
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,638
see the politicians 58 46 or something

171
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:27,000
and even in Oklahoma the most

172
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,360
conservative State uh medical one by

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,399
seven seventy percent

174
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,759
that's why politicians hated it's more

175
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,899
popular than they are that's a good way

176
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,199
of viewing it I hadn't thought about

177
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:42,959
like that I like that a lot

178
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,419
so I I wanted you to take me back if

179
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,159
possible what was your first experience

180
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,519
with cannabis

181
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,439
uh you know that was a long time ago

182
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,560
and uh

183
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,199
what when I met cannabis within a very

184
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,959
short time I knew it was going to be a

185
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,740
great friend and Ally and that it would

186
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:09,299
be a long-term relationship

187
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,519
and it's lasted any of my uh my romantic

188
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,680
relationships

189
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,038
that's a good way to view it I like that

190
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,918
as well true friend

191
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:22,139
so when was it that you decided you

192
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,359
wanted to dedicate yourself and your

193
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,939
life to cannabis law reform and to just

194
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,400
cannabis in general well it was a

195
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:35,099
specific answer I was hitching

196
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:39,899
hitchhiking from Florida to

197
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:45,000
um my home in New York and I had in my

198
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:48,000
suitcase a bamboo pipe that uh we smoked

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,039
that somebody gave me and we smoked out

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,240
of once

201
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,860
and while hitchhiking I was picked up by

202
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,220
the police and they searched the

203
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:02,459
suitcase and they charged me with

204
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,080
possession and all kinds of other things

205
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,199
and um

206
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,139
we went to trial and the judge said to

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,640
the cop I don't want to ever see

208
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,980
a

209
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,740
I don't ever want to see a case like

210
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,860
this in this courtroom ever again

211
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,339
really wise judge and that was before

212
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:27,000
the drug war really was heading was

213
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,860
hitting its hardest so then um

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,500
I was leaving the Cardinal with my

215
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,980
mother and my aunt on either side of me

216
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,740
and the uh so the sergeant who arrested

217
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,440
me and who testified against me Sergeant

218
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:45,120
Edwards of Bowling Green Virginia

219
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:49,440
he's uh marijuana people have a lot to

220
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:54,120
thank him for well he came and stood in

221
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,820
the way of our path and she put out his

222
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,839
hand to shake hands with me or something

223
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:04,140
like that and I said to him

224
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,080
get out of my way Pig

225
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:10,379
and my aunt who's very polite person

226
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:14,820
said Eddie you shouldn't talk to the

227
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:18,120
officer like that and I said but NLC he

228
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,480
tried to put me in prison

229
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,179
for and she said she looked at the cop

230
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,980
and she said officer could you please

231
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:27,979
remove yourself from that path

232
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,660
but that was it

233
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,820
the making of an activist but I mean I

234
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,919
was activated before but not the way

235
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,060
that that got me

236
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:48,778
so yeah and you know and I really felt

237
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:52,859
that cannabis was an ally from the very

238
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:54,419
first time that I uh that I used it and

239
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,259
so um

240
00:10:54,419 --> 00:11:00,539
I mean but he he uh he confirmed what I

241
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,879
should be doing

242
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:05,099
yeah I love that sentiment you know we

243
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,919
we all have a lot to thank that officer

244
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,019
for getting the the stone rolling on

245
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,199
that one so how did you progress from

246
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,639
that point up until you first started to

247
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,959
learn about growing and you sort of

248
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,519
thought to myself God I've got to write

249
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,099
about this

250
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,220
well I had always been interested in

251
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,839
Horticulture and had taken classes in it

252
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,079
when I was a kid

253
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,000
so I was not I was familiar with plants

254
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,199
and growing plants and growing plants

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,059
and doors

256
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,459
so

257
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,599
um cannabis was just another planet I

258
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,139
mean well

259
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:45,379
it is because it's a green plant and it

260
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:49,740
observes the same uh natural

261
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:53,278
uh laws that uh other green plants do

262
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:57,000
and so uh

263
00:11:53,278 --> 00:12:00,360
so I had a spare bedroom in my apartment

264
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,120
and I decided to convert that spare

265
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,539
bedroom into a growth space and that's

266
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,120
how it started and then

267
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:12,838
I wanted to make little grow tents for

268
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,220
people to grow their own and I got some

269
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,260
publicity from the newspaper

270
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,320
no woman was in existence for a long

271
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:25,559
time called Village The Village Voice

272
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:29,040
and then at the same time they had an

273
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:31,338
article about how to grow by this other

274
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:35,879
uh uh

275
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:37,740
well they well um so they gave me a lot

276
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,078
of publicity and then I got some

277
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,120
publicity in Rolling Stone and at the

278
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,458
same time they had an article on how to

279
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,100
grow by another fellow and they asked if

280
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:49,619
we would like to meet and when he you

281
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,659
know we both decided to meet each other

282
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,120
and then we decided to write a book

283
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:56,699
about how to grow indoors

284
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,560
and that's what we did and then that

285
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,000
book was a great success

286
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:05,638
and after that book came out you know if

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,320
if you're success if you enjoy doing

288
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:11,339
something and you're successful at it

289
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,560
you tend to stay doing it so

290
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,820
and I really like being around the plant

291
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,059
and

292
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,720
being in in the whole movie every part

293
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:23,819
of that mail you around the plant

294
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,500
including and cultivation is a big part

295
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,500
of that

296
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,059
yeah hugely and I mean what a meeting of

297
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,519
the minds you know yourself and Mel

298
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,559
Frank one of the questions that was

299
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,720
really itching my brain when I was

300
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,059
thinking about our chat today was when

301
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,100
you were writing this book did you have

302
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:43,739
any sort of inkling that it was going to

303
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,899
cause this Mammoth you know change in

304
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,278
the scene and Inspire millions or did it

305
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,620
just seem like you know sort of the

306
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,958
average book

307
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,419
well

308
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:57,899
you know

309
00:13:54,419 --> 00:14:01,519
um people's goals change and this was a

310
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:05,759
long time ago but I assured my author

311
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:09,659
that we would be able to make

312
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:12,539
about 200 a week each

313
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:15,419
which at that time

314
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,379
um was a lower middle class salary or

315
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:19,620
something

316
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:22,379
from writing that book and little did I

317
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,879
realize that it would be much more than

318
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,159
that

319
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:29,759
and that was the first book indoor

320
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:33,019
outdoor marijuana growers guy and it was

321
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:36,059
a it was a thin book and then we wrote

322
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:39,379
the thicker book the marijuana growers

323
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:42,778
guide that people recognize all the time

324
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:47,458
and that that book was um

325
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:49,078
that book was a huge success because it

326
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:52,018
uh

327
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:56,278
was more scientific than any of the

328
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,899
other books and had more substance to it

329
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:58,620
and so

330
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,620
um

331
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:05,159
I stayed on that half

332
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,778
yeah fantastic and out of curiosity back

333
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,120
you know when you were first writing it

334
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:12,120
what sort of strains were you growing

335
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,480
back then did they have names

336
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,299
well well we were in New York City it

337
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,480
was all either Colombian or Mexican or

338
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:23,759
Panama and it was all these Imports so

339
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,320
the first plants

340
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,659
um that I grew were from uh seeds in

341
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,660
imported marijuana

342
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:36,360
and the on the west coast there was more

343
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:38,698
of a culture and we became acquainted

344
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,620
with it when both of us moved Mel Frank

345
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:47,039
and I both moved to uh uh to

346
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,799
um first Berkeley then Oakland and that

347
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,078
was a different value

348
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:54,000
where there was already breeding going

349
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,620
on

350
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,320
and uh

351
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:04,198
uh the skunk band uh uh

352
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,959
uh

353
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:10,259
who is a fellow who invented skunk

354
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:12,659
number one and some other varieties he

355
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:15,419
was in the area as well

356
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:17,338
and 10 other people

357
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,278
yeah it sounds like you were in the hot

358
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,440
spot when you got to California

359
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,539
I'd be interested to quickly ask you did

360
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,760
you have any personal interactions with

361
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:28,620
Sam the skunk man he's a very mysterious

362
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,659
figure in the scene

363
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,899
yes

364
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:36,778
yeah yeah but now and I were good

365
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,480
friends with them and then when he moved

366
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:44,600
to um

367
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,399
uh when he moved to uh oh to uh

368
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,278
Holland we saw each other quite a bit

369
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,839
when I was over

370
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,838
I haven't seen him much in recent years

371
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:58,620
yeah yeah I think he has been a little

372
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,000
more active in the past than he is

373
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,799
recently

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,899
well if we fast forward a little bit

375
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,000
your newest book has just been released

376
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,039
the Cannabis Growers handbook which our

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,558
listeners can purchase from your website

378
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,899
at rosenthal.com so first of all huge

379
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,480
congratulations on the new book and

380
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,280
secondly what sort of topics does the

381
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,959
book go into what can people expect to

382
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,798
be able to read about

383
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,318
well it follows the template of the last

384
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:28,679
book of marijuana growers handbook

385
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:31,500
but it goes it covers things in a

386
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:36,538
different way for instance um it covers

387
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:39,538
light in terms of uh the uh Radiance of

388
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:43,019
the light you know how how intense it is

389
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:45,419
in terms a more scientific terms and

390
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:50,220
before for instance indoors we would say

391
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:53,520
a 60 watts or 600 watts or so many watts

392
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:57,058
but but instead of using an input

393
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,819
measurement for instance we use uh the

394
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:02,579
actual light measurement and then there

395
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:07,319
everything about the book has been

396
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:11,480
upgraded and we have uh we have a lot on

397
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:15,960
different ways of growing sustainability

398
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:20,339
uh changes and you know changes in

399
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:24,120
scientific thought it's it's not like it

400
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:27,298
was updated it was totally Rewritten

401
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:29,879
it's a major difference now

402
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:31,319
yeah what a fantastic answer I was gonna

403
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,700
actually ask you that question you know

404
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,678
what was the difference between the

405
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,240
Cannabis Growers handbook and the

406
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,580
marijuana growers handbook but there you

407
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,099
go you answered it for me a perfect

408
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:43,259
segue into the next question is that you

409
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,058
know many technologies have evolved over

410
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:47,099
the time since your first book was

411
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:49,019
published in the late 70s and I think in

412
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:50,879
recent years most notably the lighting

413
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:52,980
technology has really come a long way

414
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,380
with the Advent of LEDs and whatnot

415
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,380
what's your preferred lighting Source at

416
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:02,340
the moment or do you prefer outdoor

417
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:05,039
I like to grow so uh

418
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:07,980
um it you know it depends on the area

419
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:11,839
for instance I'm helping some people in

420
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,460
Jamaica and for and a lot of the

421
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,699
companies there

422
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,798
um are using greenhouses all the time

423
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:24,480
and I don't think that

424
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:25,740
that that's as useful as mostly growing

425
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,980
Outdoors

426
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,740
in that situation but then if you're up

427
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,019
in Canada if in order to extend the

428
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,660
season you're going to want to grow on a

429
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:38,940
greenhouse on the other hand I know

430
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:44,038
people who grow outdoors in the Arctic

431
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:47,700
and they have about 95 days of uh

432
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:51,480
favorable weather and they uh they grow

433
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,120
within that period of time they they

434
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,700
start indoors they used to start indoors

435
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:59,038
and put plants out I think they still do

436
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,200
but now they're using autoflowers which

437
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:06,960
makes their life a lot easier

438
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:10,259
but so you have to you have to there's

439
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,460
one has to look at what the situation is

440
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,279
if

441
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,819
whether you have space Outdoors whether

442
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:20,220
you have Greenhouse space indoor space

443
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:22,399
but whatever you know growing is is a

444
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,259
lot of fun and also

445
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,080
you know I've mentioned this before and

446
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:31,019
it's in the last book in this book that

447
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:33,659
it is a warning that using marijuana may

448
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,220
not be habit forming but growing it's

449
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,940
addictive

450
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,160
and so anybody who just puts that seed

451
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,500
in the ground soon enough they'll be

452
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,660
addicted and they'll always have a plant

453
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,240
in their life

454
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,279
here here I can I can certainly vouch

455
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,980
for that on a personal level very

456
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,839
addicting indeed and heck it's a one of

457
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,179
our other guests said uh cannabis is a

458
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:59,579
gateway to just gardening in general so

459
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,860
I thought that was cool too that's true

460
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:05,759
you know I I've met a number of people

461
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:08,000
who uh they started with uh cannabis and

462
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,819
then uh before you know it they were

463
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,119
working and what uh agricultural area or

464
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,740
another not necessarily uh with cannabis

465
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,558
but you know what kind of you know what

466
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,179
marijuana is a gateway drug too

467
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:23,960
well hash

468
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,960
hash

469
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,619
that's a good one I hadn't heard that I

470
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,500
like that but but you know in New York

471
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:34,319
City

472
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,759
uh uh you know where they have well all

473
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,700
over the United States is this big

474
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:42,480
opioid problem but in New York City they

475
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,419
said that if you have a prescription for

476
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,419
opiates any kind of well-being you can

477
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:50,340
use it to go to a marijuana dispensary

478
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,500
so you know how they used to say

479
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:55,859
marijuana you'd see these hard drugs

480
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:59,460
well what they're saying now is if you

481
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:01,918
have hard trucks how about trying pot

482
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,200
so

483
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,799
I like that a lot that's good that's

484
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,558
good but it's true you know that

485
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:13,700
the weirdest thing right we do that all

486
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:16,740
along right we knew that

487
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,019
everybody had known people who had

488
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,679
serious drug problems who saw them but

489
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:25,319
with marijuana but but the

490
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,440
um the

491
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,200
um medical professionals just could not

492
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,200
they they just couldn't tolerate that

493
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,240
you know

494
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,419
give them give them some kind of pill

495
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,120
that's addictive instead you know that

496
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:45,799
their policy oh no that's not addictive

497
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:45,798
but you better take it every day

498
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,880
yeah it's quite shocking when you read

499
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:52,859
about some of the early you know farmer

500
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,179
reports about the uh you know opioids

501
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,199
like percocet and all that and they were

502
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:59,759
like oh it's just it's not addictive

503
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,000
well um

504
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:05,700
you know the the people who perpetrated

505
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,419
that their corporations are coming to

506
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,819
agreements to pay back a lot of the some

507
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:14,759
of the money that they I feel that they

508
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:17,579
stole from the American people but the

509
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,740
problem is that the the people who

510
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:21,839
perpetrated it the handling it

511
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:25,319
corporately and they should be handling

512
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,599
it as a criminal matter and these people

513
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:31,379
knew that a certain percentage of their

514
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:34,259
uh of their victims would die from it so

515
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:37,200
they should be charged with with some

516
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:39,419
sort of homicide or murder charge

517
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,298
and you know what any district attorney

518
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,700
in the United States could do it they're

519
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:46,740
not bound to any agreements that the

520
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,740
government they they could just charge

521
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,980
any of these people criminally and see

522
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,659
and see where that goes

523
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,839
I mean if you put

524
00:23:54,659 --> 00:24:00,059
like you would think

525
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:03,418
in both Australia and the United States

526
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:06,538
it's a serious criminal penalties for

527
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:08,820
for murder right but is it not for

528
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:12,919
executives is that it they gotta get out

529
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:16,319
of freak out I don't think they should

530
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,419
yeah hugely hugely and I I was thinking

531
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,639
to myself even if they pay adequate

532
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,740
compensation whatever that is who knows

533
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,200
that there's still yeah this this

534
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,819
pandemic of people addicted to opioids

535
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,919
and like how do you clean that up it's

536
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:30,779
it's a tough one but I guess while we're

537
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,520
on the topic of sort of drugs and the

538
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,158
effect on society I'd be interested in

539
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,379
hearing your opinion on it seems as

540
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,600
though Federal legalization of cannabis

541
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,520
in the United States is becoming a

542
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,500
possibility I know that there's been

543
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,298
some back and forth from Biden as to

544
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,380
whether he wants to do it but I guess in

545
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:48,298
general you could say it looks like

546
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,059
we're getting closer to the War on Drugs

547
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:53,339
at least for cannabis ending do you see

548
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:56,418
that in the future or do you think it's

549
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:56,418
still too hard to say

550
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,460
hmm

551
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:06,418
well I

552
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,140
you know in the year 2000

553
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,140
um

554
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:14,100
the uh the cat the Democratic president

555
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,059
the presidential candidate

556
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:17,699
um

557
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:20,460
who use pot

558
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,220
we're familiar with pot went to Grateful

559
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,579
Dead concerts with his wife

560
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,460
right said that marijuana had no medical

561
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:32,158
use

562
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:35,278
and uh of course he lost

563
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:39,299
and uh then

564
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:41,819
uh Clint uh Hillary Clinton refused to

565
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:44,339
endorse cannabis on any level like

566
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:47,939
saying well maybe we should investigate

567
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:51,899
medical use and you know she won lost by

568
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,798
a few votes supposedly she she would

569
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,159
have

570
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,759
uh she would have won if she had just

571
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,039
said we should have you know we should

572
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:05,400
legalize medical use federal

573
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:07,558
so there's no reason to believe that the

574
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,259
Democrats won't shoot themselves in the

575
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:13,319
flood again by refusing to

576
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:16,259
to go positive on the issue now they

577
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,339
have on a local level but not on a

578
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:19,740
national level

579
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:22,558
and basically it seems to mean

580
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,319
everybody's predicting tremendous losses

581
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,178
for Biden and the only way out of it is

582
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:30,058
marijuana legalization

583
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,980
it saw so many people's problems you

584
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:34,558
could solve the problems of the

585
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,120
Democratic Party

586
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,579
um

587
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:40,678
yeah hugely hugely and hopefully we can

588
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:42,658
see that happen in the coming years I

589
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,038
just want to look back for a moment a

590
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,840
few questions ago you were talking about

591
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:47,940
you know people in the Arctic with

592
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,439
limited time frames for growing and just

593
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,620
in general you know people in sort of

594
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,659
more specific grow environments we've

595
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:57,058
had guests in the past talk about how

596
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:58,980
autoflowers might be a good solution to

597
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:01,619
some of these interesting climates that

598
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,960
have short windows of you know favorable

599
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:05,519
weather and whatnot do you what's your

600
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,360
thoughts on Autos in general and do you

601
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,139
think we're going to see them

602
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:13,319
increasingly become more popular

603
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:15,240
well they uh when I was talking about

604
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:18,240
the audit that's what people were using

605
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,579
because if they didn't use autoflowers

606
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,159
they would have had they were growing

607
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:25,500
some acreage if they weren't using

608
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,720
autoflowers they would have had to do

609
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,599
light deprivation and that would have

610
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,360
been arduous and costly

611
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:36,558
and so

612
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,719
you know I I've never

613
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:42,538
smoked in Autoflower that I knew was an

614
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,679
Autoflower that I thought was a super

615
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:45,538
duper

616
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,140
hi

617
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,140
but

618
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:53,460
um I think that they would be very good

619
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,960
for concentrates

620
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,960
and uh

621
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:03,359
and let's see something or nothing let's

622
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,538
see

623
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:10,558
so I could have something that's okay

624
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:12,240
you know that I could concentrate or I

625
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,019
could have nothing

626
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,019
let's see

627
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,400
it's a hard one there

628
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:26,339
that's that's interesting you you raised

629
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,960
that question because one of the it's

630
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:30,000
sort of not related to orders but that

631
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,538
underlying principle is at play we're in

632
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,480
Australia where being given this medical

633
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:38,158
system which for a long time was very

634
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,860
restrictive and non-functional at all

635
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,480
but basically the idea is

636
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:44,278
you're never going to be able to grow at

637
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,579
home they're just not going to allow it

638
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:49,339
but you can buy like sort of mid-tier

639
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:51,240
products from one of the registered

640
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:52,859
dispensaries like it's not a dispensary

641
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,720
they're just producers and you get the

642
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:56,219
bud from the pharmacy so the question

643
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,278
sort of becomes

644
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,679
do you see that right to grow yourself

645
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,740
in order to get access to the mid-tier

646
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,360
government stuff or do you hold out and

647
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,980
sort of grow your own and be like no I'm

648
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:09,899
not making that compromise like I want

649
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,679
to be able to grow at home where would

650
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,679
you sit on that one

651
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:17,038
if there hadn't been home Growers

652
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:19,980
violating the law

653
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,298
in the United States so I would never

654
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,399
have changed

655
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:26,879
so

656
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:29,219
I think that people in Australia should

657
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,360
take a hint from them and overgrow the

658
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,759
government

659
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:35,898
as much as the government tries to Stamp

660
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,460
Out you know and nsw

661
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:40,739
although they try to stamp it out and

662
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:45,179
they have those campaigns and everything

663
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,980
but they seem to supply Sydney okay so I

664
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,600
mean it's the equivalent of Humboldt

665
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,120
here in California

666
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,939
now here's the thing but it becomes

667
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:57,000
legal those people on nimbin will be

668
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,480
sadly disappointed because

669
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,538
that's not really an agricultural land

670
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,298
and it's very tropical and has very high

671
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:09,720
humidity so it's not the ideal place to

672
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:11,700
grow and so I think that

673
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,339
um what's happened in the United States

674
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,798
is more of it it's growing when it's

675
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:18,599
being grown Outdoors it's being grown on

676
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:22,079
agricultural land

677
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:27,058
I I went uh I met a fellow in nambion

678
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:30,240
who uh took me up to his garden that was

679
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:34,200
in um in one of the national parks in

680
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,558
nsw and it was a joint you know his

681
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,899
route was exhausting it was just I mean

682
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:43,379
totally exhausting and he'd have 10

683
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:45,418
plans here and 20 plants out and he

684
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,720
figured that even if the government saw

685
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:51,000
other plants they weren't going to

686
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,538
Grapple down you know down from a

687
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,558
helicopter to get them so

688
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:59,759
that totally changes with legalization

689
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:04,158
and one negative thing about

690
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:07,079
legalization is this that as it is now

691
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,419
to to a great extent the money stays in

692
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,480
the commit within the community

693
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:16,200
you know you're buying a good part of

694
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:20,599
that community of consumers and small

695
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:23,580
time dealers and Growers and you know

696
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:25,079
do you have more commonality than that

697
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:27,720
maybe

698
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:30,119
um you have a cultural commonalities

699
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,759
also but what's happened in the United

700
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:35,219
States and Canada is that it's become

701
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:38,640
legal they've become billionaires from

702
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,038
this many the number of billionaires so

703
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,380
obviously the money is falling out out

704
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,000
of the community I mean it's a larger

705
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,820
community so you're getting more middle

706
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,339
class people into it but still there's

707
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:52,619
money flowing out of that you know that

708
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:55,079
money isn't circulating as much so

709
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:58,619
that's a negative sign in legalization

710
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,839
and so somebody asked me well how do you

711
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:04,158
deal with that and I said oh it's simple

712
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:04,158
make it illegal

713
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:10,019
so Creative Solutions yeah I like it I

714
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,000
like it I mean on the topic of

715
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:13,980
legalization

716
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,460
um you know since recreational laws have

717
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,980
passed in the states we see a wide

718
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,079
diversity and volume of clones being

719
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,140
swapped and traded certainly more so

720
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:28,079
than back you know in the the prop 62

721
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,940
days or 64 days one of our Canadian

722
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,759
guests who was on the show recently

723
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,679
Kevin Cullum he commented on how since

724
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,019
there's all this trading of clones and

725
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,659
genetics he's certainly noticed an

726
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:42,538
increase in the emergence of the

727
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:44,278
Cannabis specific aphid and I guess I'm

728
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:46,500
sort of wondering from your point of

729
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:49,079
view do you think that Growers need to

730
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,240
be quite mindful of the fact that with

731
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,460
this increase in volume of genetic

732
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,980
material being traded we could very well

733
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,319
inadvertently generate more cannabis

734
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,839
specific pests and things that are more

735
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,139
resilient the more milder forms of pest

736
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,139
treatment

737
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,000
well that's happened the the some of the

738
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,599
new races of

739
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,019
of uh

740
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:19,500
powdery mildew you know a much more

741
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:21,778
dangerous and for all the races of it

742
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:26,278
and I think that either cannabis

743
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:28,980
specific or may have evolved on on I

744
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:31,500
think they transferred from pots to

745
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,319
cannabis and then now they've gotten

746
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:37,500
more very young and yeah the rush at

747
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:40,319
night and that you know

748
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,038
that that I'm not saying it's specific

749
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:48,240
to cannabis but it really

750
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:52,619
feasts on it and so um that is that

751
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,980
always happens it's you know as I said

752
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:57,898
well when you're dealing with the plant

753
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,640
issue of cannabis it's just like any

754
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:02,699
other plant the problem with the same

755
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:05,820
rules and that's going to and same thing

756
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:08,099
in the industry there's no way to stop

757
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:10,219
the spread of these uh

758
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:15,659
of these

759
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:18,418
diseases and pests parasites

760
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,000
yeah so I mean you just touched on it

761
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:23,219
you know things coming from hops The Hop

762
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,960
latent virus is like a very you know

763
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,279
popular sort of buzzword in the

764
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,918
community at the moment I think I read

765
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,320
an article that said it has knocked off

766
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,239
like up to a billion dollars off the USA

767
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,460
market value over the past few years

768
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,138
just due to like plants underperforming

769
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,838
from it and whatnot

770
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:42,179
how do you think we overcome what is

771
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,398
sort of comparable to like the covert of

772
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,740
plants like do you think there's a risk

773
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,960
it could ramp up to pandemic proportions

774
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:53,000
where like just all plants have it or do

775
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,000
you think it's probably not that serious

776
00:34:54,858 --> 00:35:02,400
you could become serious I I don't

777
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:05,460
really know that much about it about

778
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,139
uh that particular thyroid but I think

779
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,260
that

780
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,259
um

781
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,019
that

782
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,900
we talked for to develop plants with a

783
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:21,900
resistance providers

784
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,740
much harder than let's say to fund yes

785
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,660
or

786
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,779
certain bacteria

787
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:30,000
so it's very it's very serious it also

788
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,920
depends how

789
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,659
um how

790
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,320
uh

791
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:39,319
how uh effective it is at

792
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
um

793
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,960
spreading

794
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:49,019
I have it

795
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,240
although uh people Outdoors

796
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,460
I know that a number of phones have

797
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,279
really suffered from and I don't know

798
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,679
what the solutions yeah there isn't you

799
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,019
know it's not like a fungus where you

800
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:04,319
can say oh spray this or do this or

801
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:07,800
practice a different cultural technique

802
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,900
as well as you know that but you know

803
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,339
you can be living in clean healthy life

804
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,440
and still get

805
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:19,139
a virus right okay

806
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,619
I know that I I there are people that I

807
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:26,118
know who said oh I'm you know taking

808
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:26,119
good care of myself and

809
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,940
um avoiding any way of getting it in

810
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:36,960
multiple means in ICU for six weeks

811
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:39,420
so you know but he up until the point

812
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,760
where we got it he was sure that he

813
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,559
would be able to resist it because of

814
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,339
his helpful lifestyle

815
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:50,820
and I don't think viruses respected

816
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:54,119
in humans or in plants

817
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,160
yeah certainly some some wise words to

818
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,820
heed there I mean if we just talk about

819
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:01,980
General pests and pathogens I I see in

820
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,320
all the growth stores I go to your Zero

821
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,480
Tolerance product which is you know

822
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,760
really good General strategy for Pest

823
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,858
Management I'm wondering what are some

824
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,720
of the general strategies you advocate

825
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:15,500
for Growers to help keep just general

826
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,899
bugs at Bay

827
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:21,838
well it's it's um you know it's

828
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,559
isolation strategies especially indoors

829
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:30,799
because in indoors and greenhouses once

830
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:33,960
in an insect or a disease gets in there

831
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,960
there isn't the uh

832
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,280
the natural resistance that nature

833
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,900
provides in that situation

834
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:46,079
so

835
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:48,660
I'll show the main uh main things I

836
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,019
would do is you prevention method which

837
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:55,199
is isolating the the growing area and

838
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:59,039
the cultural area from the rest of the

839
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,779
world and that's done through the you

840
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,199
know there are a lot of things first of

841
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:07,619
all change of clothing and spirit Nets

842
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:10,319
uh having people in actually in the

843
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,960
garden and as little as possible so if

844
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,960
you have a garden technique which

845
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,539
requires constant Care by humans we

846
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,780
might consider getting a different

847
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:25,199
technique because there's a good

848
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,960
possibility when something occurs that

849
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,000
it's occurred because of it was carried

850
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,199
by humans and then you know of course

851
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,559
isolation of uh

852
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:42,598
um isolation of any new plants coming in

853
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:47,338
uh you know uh if you're importing plans

854
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:51,119
um also uh preventative spraying

855
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:53,460
um then then we get to the point of uh

856
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,579
uh when I say spraying I'm not

857
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:59,880
necessarily talking about pesticides as

858
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:04,940
much as with beneficial bacteria

859
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:08,280
beneficial fungi and then um uh through

860
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:12,119
inspections all the time isolating any

861
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,040
plants that that seem to be diseased get

862
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,338
getting rid of any plants that are

863
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:19,380
performing well let's take it

864
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:22,019
you know every once in a while you get a

865
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,820
plant in Australia you can thrive

866
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:26,159
removing

867
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,700
don't don't wait to see how it does in

868
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,699
three weeks

869
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,300
so um

870
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,300
those are some of the similar things

871
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:40,619
fantastic and I've got a bit of a tough

872
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,358
question that I give to all our guests

873
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:43,800
because I think the answer is we're

874
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:45,179
still looking for an answer but if

875
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,420
someone came to you and said hey look

876
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:51,659
I'm in week five of flower and I've just

877
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,400
noticed a pest infestation what sort of

878
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,139
strategies do you think people can use

879
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,240
in those situations or do you feel like

880
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,980
it's a bit too far and anything you do

881
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:00,419
is going to be pretty detrimental to the

882
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,320
crop

883
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:06,240
well it depends what the test is

884
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,960
you know it really depends what the

885
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:13,019
question is uh and it depends um the

886
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,720
second thing is it depends how uh

887
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:19,619
widespread the past is you know within

888
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:23,098
the how big a population is next so it

889
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:25,440
might just remove a few plants

890
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,619
if it's in a very specific area you

891
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,559
might want to move a few clouds or uh

892
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:33,420
and um

893
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,539
then

894
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:40,320
um there might be you might be able to

895
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:42,838
use some sort of bacterial or fungal

896
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:45,960
spray against the breasts

897
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:46,920
uh that's another possibility I will I

898
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,519
wouldn't

899
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,639
um advise on

900
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,639
bringing in

901
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:01,140
bringing in uh beneficial uh insects or

902
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:04,320
other creatures like that because

903
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:08,159
they'll they usually take too long to

904
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:12,900
develop but the population where they

905
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:15,299
can handle the uh the past so

906
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:19,079
um I would go with um

907
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,000
with uh so also washing you know it's

908
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:24,180
like let's say you were week six or

909
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,699
something you may be able to

910
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:30,179
um and you see your population you might

911
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:33,179
be able to watch the population off

912
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:35,759
that's thank you you know it's not going

913
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:38,940
to eliminate it but it's going to bring

914
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,400
down the stress on your plant

915
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,139
yeah really really great words there

916
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,940
that's something which I've always say

917
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:47,159
to people myself you know people always

918
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,019
buy predator bugs and I'm like before

919
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:50,759
you release I'm like just try to get a

920
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:52,500
damp cloth and like wipe off the

921
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,240
majority of the bugs you can see right

922
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,880
like it's only gonna help

923
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,519
but I guess yeah not not as commonly

924
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,559
known as maybe we might expect well

925
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:04,858
especially Outdoors you know if you're

926
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:07,858
it's a sunny day outdoors and you have

927
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:10,699
mates you know the best thing that you

928
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,699
know you're not going

929
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,720
if you have a lower population to

930
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:18,480
control it's easier to do it so the

931
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:21,419
first thing to do is to get as much as

932
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,659
many of them off as possible

933
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:26,760
you know get rid of you know and uh also

934
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:29,338
I didn't mention herbal sprays like zero

935
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,320
tolerance but but herbal sprays are

936
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:34,380
pretty good they'll knock down the

937
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:37,200
population not

938
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,838
nothing eliminates you're not going to

939
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,118
eliminate your problem with that problem

940
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,219
but you are going to get it under

941
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:46,680
extreme control

942
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:48,480
and in a lot of greenhouses that are

943
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,279
that are open you know they're

944
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,980
constantly getting reinfested from

945
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:57,060
outside especially in mid-summer and

946
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:59,159
admitting late summer so uh so people

947
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:00,779
might take preventive reaction for

948
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,598
instance

949
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,300
um

950
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:09,240
uh people I know use uh take to zero

951
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,880
take zero tolerance and dilute it down

952
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:13,818
and filed it into greenhouses a couple

953
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,200
times a week

954
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:18,199
and that also repels your insurance

955
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,980
yeah some great advice there

956
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,318
so if we change topics for a moment I I

957
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,119
really enjoyed reading your Beyond buds

958
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,500
book a few years ago at the time I

959
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,818
remember thinking this is really sort of

960
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,400
groundbreaking because there really

961
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:37,800
isn't another mainstream book for

962
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,900
Growers to learn more about concentrates

963
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,000
and like the very finest specific points

964
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,858
you touch on you know producing and

965
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,380
consuming them it got me wondering

966
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:49,338
overall are you more of a flower guy or

967
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,338
a concentrate guy

968
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,559
um

969
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:58,318
you know

970
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,318
gee I love cannabis so much uh

971
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:08,239
uh it's the quality of the product

972
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:12,838
so I I don't like low quality

973
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:16,039
concentrates nor buds but love the high

974
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:16,039
quality behind

975
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:21,420
that's that's a good answer I really

976
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:25,619
like that one and as a follow-up we've

977
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:27,900
seen a lot of uh rise of uh the common

978
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:29,818
consumer I.E people who don't live and

979
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,800
breathe cannabis but maybe just enjoy it

980
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:33,838
every once in a while there's been a

981
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,640
really big uptake of this sort of

982
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:38,159
consumer especially around the use of

983
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:40,679
like vape pens really easily accessible

984
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,199
devices like that and it has me thinking

985
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:45,239
where do you see the future of cannabis

986
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,399
consumption going across the whole

987
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:50,578
population do you think we're going to

988
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,760
see more concentrate style ingestion or

989
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:56,720
flowers will always be Supreme

990
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,720
I

991
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,539
think that it will float back and forth

992
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,640
um

993
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:08,759
with different both with with different

994
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:09,980
Technologies and just Trends you know

995
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,260
but

996
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:16,079
people always like novelty so if you

997
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:20,099
have if there hasn't been much action

998
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,660
with uh but at some point people will go

999
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:25,700
back to it you know everything

1000
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:25,699
everything life is retro

1001
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,559
no I'm not just talking about

1002
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:33,618
but you know but something about

1003
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,539
life

1004
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:39,900
everything repeats

1005
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:42,779
with a little bit of change

1006
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,818
yeah isn't that the truth

1007
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:47,819
so one of our viewers submitted

1008
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:50,880
questions was they they wanted to know

1009
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:52,679
uh do do you still combust cannabis

1010
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,599
these days I think a lot of people as

1011
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:57,059
they get a bit older they they move away

1012
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,980
from combustion and look at that right

1013
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:00,980
on cue he hits a hammer I love it

1014
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,079
why would people do that when they can

1015
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,079
take comic damage I mean why would

1016
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,420
people you know

1017
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,700
burn cannabis I just can't understand

1018
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,700
how people would do that

1019
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:17,699
laughs

1020
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:25,338
uh look it was like you were ready for

1021
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,339
that one you hit it out of the park

1022
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:30,780
that's brilliant that's brilliant

1023
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,000
so likewise if you check out Ed

1024
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,920
rosenthal.com you can see there's a

1025
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,260
really touching tribute to Frenchie

1026
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,619
cannoli who sadly passed away not too

1027
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,540
long ago and it really got the brain

1028
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:45,599
juices flowing for me and I was thinking

1029
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:47,338
is this the last true hash Pioneer we're

1030
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,579
gonna see you know a lot of people talk

1031
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:52,920
about the the fine hash Market becoming

1032
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:55,440
harder and harder to find good quality

1033
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,818
products in do you think Frenchie might

1034
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,358
have been the last of the true hash

1035
00:46:56,818 --> 00:46:59,358
pioneers

1036
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,900
well

1037
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,838
I think that um

1038
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,578
the market

1039
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:15,059
will determine what

1040
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:18,119
products are out there that that

1041
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:21,900
you know it's not it's not theoretical

1042
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:25,260
when when people are at the counter they

1043
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:29,818
make a conscious decision about what

1044
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:33,300
they they like and so you know as with

1045
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:36,960
any consumer product the trends go one

1046
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,579
way then they go the other way and they

1047
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,480
go back and forth

1048
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:42,839
okay

1049
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,358
so I think that you know

1050
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:48,659
there'll be a market there'll always be

1051
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:51,598
a market for telling a certain house

1052
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:53,940
and when there's a market there'll

1053
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,420
always be somebody there who is willing

1054
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,420
to make it

1055
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,539
and I think that he did lead the way in

1056
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,440
many areas he had left a lot of videos

1057
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:12,139
and uh he did leave with appreciation in

1058
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,880
people for fine quality houses

1059
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:17,039
hugely hugely

1060
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,200
and I mean while we're on the topic of

1061
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,358
the market one of the common discussions

1062
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,118
I'm having with a lot of smaller Growers

1063
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,039
at the moment is how they feel like with

1064
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:28,260
the opening up of new markets like say

1065
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,960
Oklahoma for example as well as just the

1066
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,700
existing markets growing really feels to

1067
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,858
them like there's a bit of a race to the

1068
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:36,539
bottom in regards to pricing and a lot

1069
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:39,480
of them are getting quite concerned

1070
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:42,420
about how they will continue to to make

1071
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,460
a livelihood from this if price has

1072
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,079
continued to go down do you have any

1073
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,539
advice for people who might feel like

1074
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,680
they're in that position well

1075
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:54,539
I want to take it in another way I think

1076
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:58,318
it's really good that prices are down

1077
00:48:54,539 --> 00:49:01,440
for the consumer I think and frankly I'm

1078
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:04,318
more interested in the consumer than uh

1079
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,519
big corporations and

1080
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:11,519
um as far as prices being down well you

1081
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,920
know the only reason prices were up was

1082
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:16,019
because of the risk factor factor

1083
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,280
dealing with

1084
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:24,659
um uh dealing with uh the legality of of

1085
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:27,119
the product so that so farmers who were

1086
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:30,539
growing it were making an economic

1087
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:34,019
profit from that risk factor and that

1088
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:37,079
that risk factor uh

1089
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:40,199
you know that that was like a price

1090
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,539
support system for instance let's say

1091
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:49,078
you know Australia the government said

1092
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:53,519
it was going to fire bomb one wheat farm

1093
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:54,960
one refund and all of us right all the

1094
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,920
farmers would get out a week wouldn't

1095
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,220
they

1096
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,858
weed prices would go up right

1097
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:04,318
so anybody who was still in wheat would

1098
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:07,259
be doing pretty well

1099
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:09,800
well some marijuana Farmers had that for

1100
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,800
40 years

1101
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,680
so

1102
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,539
they were being one way or another they

1103
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,759
were being paid for the risk they were

1104
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:18,960
taking not just for their farming

1105
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,140
ability

1106
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,480
so you ever hear any songs about how

1107
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:26,400
wonderful it is to be a farmer or are

1108
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,240
they all laments

1109
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,240
sadly no

1110
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,900
you know like

1111
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,900
yeah and you know the foreign

1112
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:55,460
so nobody said marijuana farming has to

1113
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:59,400
be profitable

1114
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:01,858
and frankly what I'd like to see is some

1115
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,440
of the big corporations doing the

1116
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:07,739
farming to see when they really have the

1117
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,500
metal to to do it whether the people

1118
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:14,519
that they hire really have the ability

1119
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:17,639
to grow quality product or not and in a

1120
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:19,318
free market like that so I think that a

1121
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:22,039
lot of the big corporations were looking

1122
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:22,039
left behind

1123
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:27,000
yeah yeah look I can understand that and

1124
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:29,039
hopefully with that scale you know they

1125
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,800
can sort of bring the price point down

1126
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,539
and make it accessible I guess as a sort

1127
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,880
of general question I'd be interested to

1128
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:38,699
hear your thoughts on whether you felt

1129
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,858
the change from the old medical system

1130
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:43,139
to the new recreational system in

1131
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:45,358
California has been an overall net

1132
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:48,679
positive or do you feel like there's

1133
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:48,679
been pros and cons

1134
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:54,000
well the big net positive is fewer

1135
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:57,980
people in jail

1136
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,440
and but by any

1137
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:03,659
uh by any measure that

1138
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,179
any any way that you want to measure it

1139
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:09,179
that's in that positive that has to make

1140
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:12,539
it net positive could it be could it be

1141
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:15,500
a better system it could be but here's

1142
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:15,500
the other part of it

1143
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:20,940
being sold in California it's estimated

1144
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,880
or more than half of it

1145
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,579
is

1146
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,440
not coming from

1147
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:31,559
registered funds

1148
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:34,400
so the reason why prices have gone down

1149
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:38,180
so much in California is this

1150
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,180
that for instance

1151
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:44,759
you know Mendocino and Humboldt

1152
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:48,059
marijuana it's outdoor marijuana and

1153
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,800
it's grown in an area where the weather

1154
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:52,440
is not

1155
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:56,300
really agricultural weather not in the

1156
00:52:52,440 --> 00:53:01,260
way that you really like it so indoor

1157
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:04,559
and uh and Greenhouse marijuana

1158
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:07,700
is considered by most Californians who

1159
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:11,819
Preferred Quality so most of the humble

1160
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:14,279
material travel of East that's why

1161
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:16,259
how about got such good reputation of

1162
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,140
people in New York

1163
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:22,800
to Californians oh look I have some

1164
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:25,618
beautiful Humboldt weed and you know the

1165
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,980
California we go here and say well uh

1166
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:32,519
why don't you try some of this instead

1167
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:36,300
you know and uh because uh and so the

1168
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:39,059
humble it was like explore quality like

1169
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:42,300
it couldn't be sold in California so we

1170
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:44,940
have to export it so now

1171
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,980
all that weed

1172
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:50,338
um you know now that New York is legal

1173
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:53,818
and Massachusetts and you know all of

1174
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:57,838
these states were formerly illegal where

1175
00:53:53,818 --> 00:54:03,358
in which the California pot was filling

1176
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:06,179
uh filling the surprise sign well now uh

1177
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:08,759
people can grow their own or and you

1178
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:10,980
know corporations and flowers are

1179
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,079
getting into it so there's not as much

1180
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,838
market for the Humboldt weed and that's

1181
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:18,000
why those humbled and Mendocino weep

1182
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,699
that's why those prices have fallen

1183
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,039
precipitously

1184
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:25,219
so

1185
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:25,219
um

1186
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:31,098
you know

1187
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:33,780
it's a problem but

1188
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:36,500
you know nobody said that you have to

1189
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:40,019
make a living I mean

1190
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:42,659
farming for most farmers who are not

1191
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:45,239
following cannabis sometimes it's a

1192
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:47,818
pretty rough road and with legalization

1193
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:50,279
in the normalization of cannabis I could

1194
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:53,400
see that because uh

1195
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,859
like prices are falling when you do you

1196
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,480
have gun control over it so it's a

1197
00:54:55,858 --> 00:55:00,119
marketing

1198
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,338
yeah I think sometimes people are quick

1199
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,440
to lose sight of the fact that yeah the

1200
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:08,039
trade-off is less people in jail and

1201
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,679
that is undeniably a net positive no

1202
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:13,199
questions there there's a lot of people

1203
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:14,879
get to use it because not everybody

1204
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,219
knows somebody who can give them

1205
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,980
marijuana and also

1206
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:21,719
medic it's really good for medical users

1207
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,240
because they might want something

1208
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,858
specific and even

1209
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,019
um well even if you grow your own

1210
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:29,880
Tomatoes you might buy some Tomatoes

1211
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:32,219
once in a while

1212
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,960
that's true isn't it very few people are

1213
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:35,338
entirely self-sufficient even with the

1214
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,099
crops they grow

1215
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:43,380
well sort of an extension of this topic

1216
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:46,019
is the the generalization uh or maybe

1217
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:48,180
you could even call it gentrification of

1218
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:50,039
the Cannabis industry it's it's a

1219
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:52,199
persistent topic that comes up on our

1220
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:54,719
show the idea of how the industry is

1221
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:57,779
being morphed to cater more to the

1222
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,578
Casual Enthusiast as opposed to in the

1223
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,500
past where you could maybe argue it was

1224
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:03,960
more for the Growers and the hardcore

1225
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:07,019
enthusiasts and I guess this is most

1226
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,358
evident by going to dispensaries you see

1227
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:12,000
there's a lot of sort of mid to low tier

1228
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:13,980
Brands not as many high tier Brands

1229
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,079
anymore and even some of the events like

1230
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,240
the emerald cup which are sort of

1231
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,940
Shifting to be more of like a half Music

1232
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:23,459
Festival half cannabis festival and not

1233
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:26,400
just about breeders selling seeds for

1234
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:28,740
example do you feel this shift yourself

1235
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,539
and do you have any thoughts on how this

1236
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:32,639
might play out long term for the

1237
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:35,759
hardcore cannabis community

1238
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:39,598
well I think that that Community is

1239
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:43,040
served by uh independent dealers right

1240
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:48,180
so it's not it's not that

1241
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:50,519
uh it's not that that product is now and

1242
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:55,259
it isn't that people who want it aren't

1243
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:58,500
getting it it's at the dispensaries and

1244
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:01,079
shops are catering more to people who

1245
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:05,639
don't have connections and who are

1246
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:07,980
casual users but the the heart for you

1247
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:10,078
know the chronic users they're usually

1248
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,420
going to Independent dealers because if

1249
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:15,380
they're buying because your product is

1250
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:15,380
so much cheaper

1251
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:24,780
you know a few grams every month or

1252
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:29,400
something but if you're using

1253
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:33,180
uh 10 grams a day then price does matter

1254
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:34,740
yeah hugely I mean another related topic

1255
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:37,980
that gets brought up in these same

1256
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:40,019
conversations is how the market is more

1257
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,019
largely becoming dictated by the

1258
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:45,480
cannabinoid percentage numbers

1259
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:48,480
especially the idea that a larger number

1260
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,400
is synonymous with better quality do you

1261
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,460
think we need to move away from this and

1262
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:57,240
how might we try to do that well in

1263
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:59,940
California uh most dispensaries that I'm

1264
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:02,818
required to unless the threatening

1265
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:06,059
percentages and so that's been some of

1266
00:58:02,818 --> 00:58:09,719
the major factor both the both the um

1267
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:12,180
the cannabinoids white cannabinoids are

1268
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,699
in there and the Terrapins so people are

1269
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:18,299
looking at it more politically

1270
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:20,460
yeah hugely hugely and I will touch on

1271
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,440
terpenes in in just a moment I just had

1272
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:25,318
one final question around that which was

1273
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,599
do you think that the labs are being

1274
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,159
honest when they give their testing

1275
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,500
results because we're starting to see

1276
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:34,679
results that are you know really high

1277
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:37,019
30s low 40 percent cannabinoids for like

1278
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:40,019
a flower sample and it makes me wonder

1279
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:42,119
like there's this huge variability do we

1280
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:44,338
just need to get a standardized testing

1281
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:47,780
model or are some of the labs maybe not

1282
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:51,779
quite being as truthful as we might hope

1283
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:54,359
well I think there's been I think

1284
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:57,420
among the people that I know who do

1285
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:59,699
testing I think that they want to

1286
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,099
produce accurate results

1287
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:04,078
but I think more standardization is

1288
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:06,599
required

1289
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,660
yeah certainly certainly

1290
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,700
so recently we've seen the re-emergence

1291
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:13,920
of some really old school genetics

1292
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:15,480
coming really to the Forefront of a lot

1293
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,119
of modern breeders palettes they're

1294
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:21,659
looking to work with things like the nl5

1295
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:24,358
haze with the skunk even the pure Haze

1296
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:26,578
for example do you think these varieties

1297
00:59:24,358 --> 00:59:29,519
are really as good as the current ones

1298
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:31,760
or maybe a bit of Rose shaded glasses at

1299
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:31,759
Play

1300
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:37,440
there's two complex a question it

1301
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:41,818
doesn't seem like a good thing but

1302
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:44,338
answering it gets really sticky so to

1303
00:59:41,818 --> 00:59:47,759
speak because

1304
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:49,139
there's one thing that uh that I'll

1305
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,180
mention

1306
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:53,279
that years ago

1307
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:56,879
you would sometimes

1308
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:59,460
there'd be a bag of cannabis that was so

1309
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,220
fragrant it would

1310
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:04,920
smell up the room and you remove the

1311
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:07,019
Cannabis from the room you open up the

1312
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,500
windows and that

1313
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:13,139
odor was still there for a while

1314
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:17,400
I haven't experienced anything like that

1315
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:19,519
in more than 10 10 15 years

1316
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:23,039
there you go that's maybe a hint

1317
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:25,139
but you know you speak with with older

1318
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,239
cannabis shoes you ask them if they've

1319
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:29,639
ever had that experience and they'll

1320
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:32,098
tell you that in

1321
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:34,259
you know before the turn of the century

1322
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:36,240
they've had they had that exposed

1323
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:39,059
experiences

1324
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:41,219
that experience you mentioned we we hear

1325
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:43,798
other people talk of similar events

1326
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:46,739
specifically often related to the

1327
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:49,460
roadkill skunk have you ever smelt what

1328
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:53,159
you think is the roadkill skunk

1329
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:56,039
well there are a lot of variations on it

1330
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:58,920
but yeah where it's actually spunky

1331
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:02,159
yeah I mean something more

1332
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:05,159
uh people from

1333
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:06,980
um uh the Americas would be familiar

1334
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:10,379
with in

1335
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:12,619
Australians or people in Europe but yeah

1336
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:15,960
that's right I

1337
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:17,000
discussed Scouts come visit my

1338
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:21,139
um

1339
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,139
my garden at night every night

1340
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:26,699
there you go no not right now but you

1341
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:31,079
know just forever

1342
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:33,598
but uh shots of Parsons that you know

1343
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:35,940
that's uh more like so many uh animals

1344
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,838
that you have with my Superior in the

1345
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,400
apartment

1346
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:40,920
and uh

1347
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,260
raccoons you don't have raccoons you

1348
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,780
know but I you know they they've made

1349
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,640
their peace they're living in cities now

1350
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:50,220
you know

1351
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:52,259
they figured out how to do it

1352
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:54,239
yeah they're smart are they they've

1353
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:57,420
adapted yeah

1354
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:59,639
while we're on the the topic of terpenes

1355
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:01,740
you know as you alluded to a little

1356
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:03,598
earlier terpenes are becoming a more

1357
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:06,118
focal part of what people are looking

1358
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,460
for in high quality cannabis however

1359
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:11,220
from my point of view it still feels

1360
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:13,440
like there's a fairly large ambiguity

1361
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:16,139
around the language we use like I might

1362
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,480
call it sweet you might call it floral

1363
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:21,000
do you think we need to try to get some

1364
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,099
sort of standardization and if so would

1365
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,940
it be of any benefit to customers or not

1366
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:26,280
really

1367
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:28,920
well I think better than that would be

1368
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:31,920
an actual test

1369
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:35,280
that would you know so people wouldn't

1370
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:40,500
have to rely on them support

1371
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:46,260
and um and as I said in dispensaries and

1372
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:48,239
uh and stores in the U.S now uh that I

1373
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:51,480
mean in California they listed the

1374
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:53,639
turkeys and the percentages so and

1375
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,559
people are becoming more familiar with

1376
01:02:53,639 --> 01:03:01,139
the effects of different track meetings

1377
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:03,359
so it is uh presenting that information

1378
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:05,420
um is useful to the knowledgeable

1379
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:08,759
consumer

1380
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:10,680
this one might be a little bit left of

1381
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,480
field to answer but I've had discussions

1382
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:15,539
with people in the past and we're trying

1383
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,760
to figure out what is it that makes a

1384
01:03:15,539 --> 01:03:20,099
certain strain feel the way it does one

1385
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,720
of our past guests said you know I've

1386
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:28,680
got a an Afghani that's 20 THC and a tie

1387
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:31,500
that's 20 THC and they largely smell the

1388
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:33,659
same both sort of mango smelling but

1389
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,000
obviously one feels like a very sedating

1390
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:39,118
sort of feel one feels very uplifting

1391
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,760
and it begs the question you know what

1392
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:45,660
is It ultimately in your mind that makes

1393
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,819
us feel like a cannabis is a thin Leaf

1394
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:50,338
variety or a broadleaf variety do you

1395
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:52,259
have any thoughts on that one well it's

1396
01:03:50,338 --> 01:03:55,019
like yes you know your friends who have

1397
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:58,380
those two varieties that smell the same

1398
01:03:55,019 --> 01:04:00,139
so that the chemistry producing the

1399
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:05,599
mango owner

1400
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:09,298
was probably masking other other

1401
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:11,818
that causes different effects

1402
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:12,780
and that's what I say the only way to

1403
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:17,039
really

1404
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:18,920
[ __ ] well what's in it is to test it

1405
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,058
hmm

1406
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,059
yeah certainly

1407
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:26,339
and I mean while we're on the topic

1408
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:29,760
I feel like the Instagram platform

1409
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:32,578
itself has done huge huge work in terms

1410
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,380
of getting cannabis out to the consumers

1411
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:36,420
at least in Australia I feel like a lot

1412
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:38,099
of people realize there's really good

1413
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,780
quality Bud out there just from seeing

1414
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:43,318
it on Instagram and being like Oh that's

1415
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:45,599
possible the trade-off though is that on

1416
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:48,420
Instagram things can look really good

1417
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,220
but you can't smell them or smoke them

1418
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:52,139
so you can really only go off the

1419
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:55,318
visuals and some people criticize this

1420
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:58,318
and say you know it's caused things to

1421
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:00,719
shift to things that look good but maybe

1422
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:02,639
don't necessarily have the terpenes to

1423
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,419
back it up have you noticed anything

1424
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:05,420
like this

1425
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:11,818
well

1426
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:15,920
I'm not really in the um

1427
01:05:11,818 --> 01:05:15,920
in the buyer mode

1428
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,298
so so I don't get as affected by things

1429
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,779
like that

1430
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:27,000
perhaps so I might not be the right

1431
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,700
person to answer

1432
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,139
no understandable I it's probably been a

1433
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:32,578
long time since you've had to purchase

1434
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:34,759
some cannabis

1435
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:34,760
foreign

1436
01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:44,818
in Holland

1437
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:49,140
that's a few years ago and uh with a

1438
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:52,920
friend we were temporarily out and we

1439
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:55,618
went into Greenhouse coffee shop and you

1440
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,720
know we spent about

1441
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:59,940
I don't know fifty dollars and we got

1442
01:05:57,719 --> 01:06:02,838
this little bag and the two of us

1443
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,838
started laughing

1444
01:06:05,298 --> 01:06:12,679
uh but it was just really that that's

1445
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:12,679
fifty dollars

1446
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:18,298
there you go times are changing my my

1447
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,059
final question sort of related to

1448
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:23,338
Instagram is that in the past two years

1449
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:25,440
or so we've really seen a big clamping

1450
01:06:23,338 --> 01:06:27,719
down of Instagram on cannabis related

1451
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,740
businesses sometimes even Banning their

1452
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:31,439
accounts

1453
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:34,259
and it feels as though the platform

1454
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,059
itself of Instagram is quite vital to a

1455
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:38,520
lot of Brands it seems like it would be

1456
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:41,280
hard to exist without it so my question

1457
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:43,920
is how do we navigate this space given

1458
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:46,140
we're so heavily dependent on it but

1459
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,420
they're also not necessarily looking to

1460
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:51,118
play ball with us as an industry

1461
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:55,380
well Amazon said that they're not

1462
01:06:51,119 --> 01:07:00,720
testing their employees for pot anymore

1463
01:06:55,380 --> 01:07:01,500
well maybe the maybe the uh people uh on

1464
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:03,838
the

1465
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,699
Department of Transportation maybe truck

1466
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,798
drivers or something but in general

1467
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:12,179
they're not going to

1468
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:14,579
test their workloads so isn't that one

1469
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:16,139
step away from saying Amazon is going to

1470
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:17,640
deliver

1471
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:20,940
so

1472
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:24,480
um and so Amazon does that then what's

1473
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:26,220
instant Instagram going to do

1474
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,980
so I think they're all going to perform

1475
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:30,899
online but but you know those companies

1476
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:35,760
have had

1477
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:38,099
um you you know that they uh earn a good

1478
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:43,619
part of their living either off of drugs

1479
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:45,960
or or porn and yeah you know the show uh

1480
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:48,059
straight at least about especially about

1481
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:52,260
drugs it's it

1482
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:55,980
you know if they had uh given a little

1483
01:07:52,260 --> 01:08:00,420
more support to legalization we would be

1484
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:03,298
much further ahead than me on that

1485
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:05,460
it's really a shameful to you know it's

1486
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:09,780
natural that they

1487
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:12,900
should join you know to tell make it

1488
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,460
legal all over but but then we've been

1489
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:17,880
doing that

1490
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:19,439
yeah as soon as this body to be made

1491
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,819
they want to get in on it yeah I can

1492
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:24,899
understand that

1493
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:27,539
so as legalization rolls out worldwide

1494
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:29,639
over the coming years do you think that

1495
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:31,798
we'll see more institutes like the

1496
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,359
oaksterdam university sort of pop up

1497
01:08:31,798 --> 01:08:36,960
around the world

1498
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,719
oh yes and I think that there are a few

1499
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,239
other

1500
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:45,060
universities like that there's one in

1501
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:46,500
Colorado and I don't know where others

1502
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:49,259
are but there might be one in Michigan

1503
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,100
but also

1504
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:53,100
um

1505
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:58,039
uh colleges and universities are opening

1506
01:08:53,100 --> 01:09:00,719
up degrees in there so UC Davis which is

1507
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:01,679
perhaps your best agricultural School in

1508
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:06,899
the country

1509
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:10,079
UC Davis has a curriculum in Canada so

1510
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:10,979
that so that's that's going to happen as

1511
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,298
well

1512
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:16,259
and

1513
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:18,600
so now here's what is we hope that they

1514
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:20,460
use this particular growth as their

1515
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,279
textbook

1516
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:25,920
cannabis Growers handbook that

1517
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,380
and uh it just came out we're shipping

1518
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,460
it out to people who pre-ordered

1519
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,560
so

1520
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:33,420
there it is

1521
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,719
I don't think you could go wrong if

1522
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:39,060
that's your prescribed textbook yeah I I

1523
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:42,380
think it will be because you know we we

1524
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:47,819
had the three co-authors but we also uh

1525
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:49,520
uh we collaborated with for specific uh

1526
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:51,080
areas

1527
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,080
Hydroponics

1528
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:54,079
nutrients

1529
01:09:55,219 --> 01:10:02,640
air air quality we we uh we collaborated

1530
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:05,159
with University with a lot of professors

1531
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,679
University professors and people in the

1532
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:11,659
industry so there are three authors

1533
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:15,359
listed there were probably 30

1534
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:17,819
people who uh also put contributions

1535
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:21,539
into both

1536
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:23,279
it's more than one person's opinion

1537
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:25,619
yeah it sounds sounds quite

1538
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:28,439
comprehensive which is always reassuring

1539
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:30,059
I mean on the question of sort of

1540
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:32,279
getting into growing a bit I'd be

1541
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,320
interested to hear what sort of style of

1542
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:36,238
growing do you like to do and what do

1543
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:38,880
you advocate for are you an Organics

1544
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,399
person assaults or is it just not really

1545
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:44,159
meaningful

1546
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:46,460
oh uh

1547
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:50,399
you know really depends on the situation

1548
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:53,460
but uh for instance uh

1549
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:55,920
this year uh well for the past few years

1550
01:10:53,460 --> 01:11:00,600
I've been growing all my tomatoes uh

1551
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:03,060
hydroponically and I really like uh I

1552
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:06,060
live really like Hydroponics of growing

1553
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:10,940
for indoor and some Greenhouse

1554
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:14,400
situations because uh you can

1555
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:16,859
there are two things about it uh that

1556
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:20,339
not dealing with the crop or the yield

1557
01:11:16,859 --> 01:11:24,839
but the input one is that it really

1558
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:28,140
conserves water tremendously the amount

1559
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,020
of water used to produce an ounce of

1560
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:33,600
cannabis goes way down when we grow

1561
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,699
hydroponic when you're growing in a

1562
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,840
sustainable hydroponic system

1563
01:11:35,698 --> 01:11:41,579
and then the the other part about it is

1564
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,100
that

1565
01:11:41,579 --> 01:11:46,439
um

1566
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:48,780
uh it's very change you can change

1567
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:51,359
you can change the situation really

1568
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:54,960
quickly with it for instance when you go

1569
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:56,698
from vegetative to flowering it becomes

1570
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,520
very easy to do that when you have a

1571
01:11:56,698 --> 01:12:01,339
hydroponic system and they're very easy

1572
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:06,600
to shut up

1573
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:08,039
and uh they appreciate music and you

1574
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,320
know

1575
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:11,760
as I said I've been growing hydroponic

1576
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:13,340
tomatoes and

1577
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:17,480
uh

1578
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:17,480
people love them so

1579
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:22,379
proof's in the Tomato yeah and I have

1580
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:26,460
this theory about cultivation which is

1581
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:29,520
this so you know uh

1582
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:33,719
so basically

1583
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:36,300
during its lifetime the plan allocates

1584
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:38,819
your carbon that it captures from the

1585
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:41,100
air you know it captures carbon dioxide

1586
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:44,460
that's your carbon that contains your

1587
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:47,280
carbon and then it allocates its use so

1588
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:51,000
let's say

1589
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:55,439
um so if let's say you look at a plant

1590
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,619
and if the plant has grown uh all these

1591
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:02,698
branches and leaves and everything well

1592
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:05,539
in terms of calc carbon allocation for

1593
01:13:02,698 --> 01:13:08,639
the yield we're looking at we're not

1594
01:13:05,539 --> 01:13:10,979
harvesting the branches or the leaves

1595
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,900
we're harvesting the buds right

1596
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:16,198
so

1597
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:18,839
um what percentage of the carbon is

1598
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:21,178
going to blood production and what

1599
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,920
percent is growing to plant

1600
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:27,119
infrastructure

1601
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:30,960
and so when you look at that you realize

1602
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:33,238
that if you grow small plants that don't

1603
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,640
have much infrastructure but for

1604
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:39,238
instance single stem plants

1605
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:42,000
then a much higher percentage of the

1606
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:45,718
carbon that the plant is allocated is

1607
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,539
using is going to bug production and so

1608
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:51,380
and the plant spends a greater

1609
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:54,899
proportion of its time in in bad

1610
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:58,380
production is compared with vegetative

1611
01:13:54,899 --> 01:14:02,279
production so really into growing these

1612
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:05,100
small plants really close together

1613
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:08,399
and one way to do it you know like let

1614
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:11,100
it you know like lettuce wraps

1615
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:14,639
growing in like like they were single

1616
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:19,079
stem plants on lettuce wraps and then

1617
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:21,980
won't be about 65 centimeters

1618
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:25,319
tall when they're done with no branching

1619
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:28,339
and so the other advantage of that is

1620
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:31,380
that there's very low

1621
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:34,460
very small amount of

1622
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:37,920
um of manicuring

1623
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:40,679
so that's a money saver as well so

1624
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,399
that's industrial that's how I like to

1625
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:43,399
grow plants

1626
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:48,780
so interesting I mean the the sea of

1627
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:51,119
green method you know really proven

1628
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:53,639
itself over the years as far as I could

1629
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,960
tell there wasn't a ton of people still

1630
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,280
really doing it do you think it's

1631
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,520
something that's going to get more

1632
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:58,519
popular

1633
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:09,839
well uh my writing partner uh Rob

1634
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:12,000
Flannery we we uh have been doing a

1635
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,819
little bit of future we're planning to

1636
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,340
do a little bit of Consulting on that

1637
01:15:13,819 --> 01:15:20,519
and we think that

1638
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:21,840
um the problem for it is you need a

1639
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:26,460
really skilled

1640
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:30,539
um manager and uh not so much staff but

1641
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:32,399
but management and Excellence SLP so

1642
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:34,679
that everybody knows what's happening

1643
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:38,579
because there's a lot of action in that

1644
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:40,679
because you have the

1645
01:15:38,579 --> 01:15:43,319
um if

1646
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:48,658
if you're growing clones which most

1647
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:51,539
farmers will do then you need a large uh

1648
01:15:48,658 --> 01:15:55,139
you either have to have a good cold

1649
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:55,760
supplier well you have to have a large

1650
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:59,640
um

1651
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:02,840
mother room to produce your clothes and

1652
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:06,619
a lot of action in that room and most

1653
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,619
most farmers

1654
01:16:07,579 --> 01:16:13,198
they don't understand it

1655
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:16,860
they just even though they might have

1656
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:20,460
done sea of green you know in a smaller

1657
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:23,339
setup they can't see it expanding it you

1658
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:26,279
know when they upscale but I I think

1659
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:29,219
that's the way to go

1660
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:30,779
yeah maybe I'll watch this space sort of

1661
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:34,739
thing

1662
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:36,840
yeah well um you know there there are

1663
01:16:34,738 --> 01:16:39,359
companies you know that are doing it and

1664
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,739
it's just an incredible system for them

1665
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:43,500
because

1666
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:48,419
um they don't have they don't have any

1667
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:50,880
uh plant care during the vegetative and

1668
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:54,060
flowering Foods what's what they set the

1669
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:58,020
plan they don't have to do anything

1670
01:16:54,060 --> 01:17:01,739
so as compared with you know people that

1671
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:05,640
go deleafing and all of that and the

1672
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:08,459
reason that they you know and uh a lot

1673
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:10,199
of that even if you were delicious what

1674
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:13,859
you wouldn't have to do as much of it

1675
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:16,399
this with this system is relatives and

1676
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:16,399
it's faster

1677
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:22,679
yeah it'll be really interesting to see

1678
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:24,479
that sort of come to life more so if we

1679
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:27,239
fast forward to the other end of the

1680
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:28,678
grow cycle when you're harvesting I

1681
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:31,559
remember a discussion I had with someone

1682
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:33,420
for a long time was they uh they read

1683
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,000
your books and they were like oh did you

1684
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:37,980
know that Ed says you should uh you

1685
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,079
should wet trim and I said oh I didn't

1686
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:41,759
know if I'd read that I'd be interested

1687
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:43,380
to hear you know do you believe wet

1688
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,640
trimming is better than dry trimming do

1689
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:45,960
you fall one way or the other or do you

1690
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,560
think it's sort of situationally

1691
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,560
dependent

1692
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:57,899
well it depends it situationally

1693
01:17:53,238 --> 01:18:00,959
dependent uh certainly it's easier to um

1694
01:17:57,899 --> 01:18:05,099
take your if if you've

1695
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:08,880
um if you've um it's easier to run uh

1696
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:11,159
but uh through uh some of the trimming

1697
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,420
machines when they're wet although they

1698
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:14,939
do have a

1699
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:17,158
they do have other models but the thing

1700
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:19,439
is when you trim when you drop when it's

1701
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:22,738
dry you have more brittle rest of the

1702
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:26,039
crumb of the trichomes so that you're

1703
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:29,899
going to have more forward from tritone

1704
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:32,399
to draw each other

1705
01:18:29,899 --> 01:18:35,099
yeah there's certainly sort of pros and

1706
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:36,799
cons in each situation isn't it but you

1707
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:41,539
know uh

1708
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:47,760
the way that you uh the way that you um

1709
01:18:41,539 --> 01:18:51,060
uh dry and and cure has a significant

1710
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:54,480
uh effect upon your

1711
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:58,039
um the the amount of uh terpenes that

1712
01:18:54,479 --> 01:19:01,218
are present at the end and the

1713
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:01,219
method that

1714
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:06,260
um that seems to be most effective seems

1715
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:09,060
to be uh

1716
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:11,600
uh freeze drying

1717
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:14,680
so like the cryogen

1718
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,940
where the bud is dry and

1719
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,520
[Music]

1720
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:19,979
um

1721
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:22,440
you get a higher percentage of

1722
01:19:19,979 --> 01:19:26,879
Therapeutics left

1723
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:30,119
bottom double like from normal Drive

1724
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:32,400
yeah that's that's hugely become a major

1725
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:35,039
discussion point in sort of the the

1726
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:38,039
recent year or so especially for the the

1727
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:40,198
bigger commercial producers if we focus

1728
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:41,819
on the smaller home grower for the

1729
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:43,799
moment I'd be interested to hear your

1730
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:46,319
perspective what are some of the big

1731
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,480
mistakes you see Growers making that you

1732
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,099
think are holding their cultivation back

1733
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,399
from you know being that really next

1734
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,400
level

1735
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:00,179
well one thing is being too ambitious

1736
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:03,719
about it I mean uh

1737
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:06,119
can't don't build the system that you

1738
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:07,739
can't take care of it's so big that you

1739
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:09,840
can't take care of it

1740
01:20:07,738 --> 01:20:11,399
that you're always behind because you're

1741
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,579
going to lose quality

1742
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:19,639
happens to me all the time I I have

1743
01:20:14,579 --> 01:20:21,719
bigger eyes and my effort so so you know

1744
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:25,020
so you're

1745
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:27,840
so you shouldn't do what I what happens

1746
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:30,060
to me especially if

1747
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,579
you know

1748
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:34,260
if I do an experiment and it doesn't

1749
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:37,619
work out it doesn't really affect

1750
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:39,860
whether I have thought or not right so

1751
01:20:37,619 --> 01:20:43,439
so I have a different

1752
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:45,779
way of looking at it on a personal level

1753
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:49,019
but you shouldn't do something that's so

1754
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:51,059
ambitious if it has good chance of

1755
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:54,179
failure it's better to do something

1756
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:57,000
smaller really perfect and that's number

1757
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:59,899
one that I mean that that is number one

1758
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:05,300
and then

1759
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:08,279
the most important part of growing

1760
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:13,560
uh for the most important factor in

1761
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:17,039
growing is the quality of the genetics

1762
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:19,739
because no matter how could our garden

1763
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:22,859
you have if you don't have the genetics

1764
01:21:19,738 --> 01:21:26,178
you're not going to have good product so

1765
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:26,179
genetics is number one

1766
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:31,679
yeah and what a brilliant segue you've

1767
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:35,218
just given me because I wanted to ask

1768
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:38,819
you a little bit about popping seeds do

1769
01:21:35,219 --> 01:21:40,739
you think specifically that it's sort of

1770
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:42,779
important for Growers to be popping

1771
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:45,059
seeds and keeping the wheels churning on

1772
01:21:42,779 --> 01:21:46,800
things finding new clones or do you

1773
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:48,600
think that there's not really an issue

1774
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,260
with people just growing the same clones

1775
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,260
repeatedly

1776
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,300
well

1777
01:21:54,779 --> 01:22:01,198
let's go back to tomatoes

1778
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:03,000
so you might try new varieties and then

1779
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:06,859
you might grow some of the same old

1780
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,859
varieties because you like them right

1781
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,960
so I don't see Canada something

1782
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:14,939
different

1783
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:17,219
and so I guess the next question would

1784
01:22:14,939 --> 01:22:19,678
be do you have any advice for any

1785
01:22:17,219 --> 01:22:22,439
aspiring breeders out there how might

1786
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:24,600
you advise them about how they go about

1787
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:25,919
creating their crosses or collecting

1788
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,539
their seed stock do you think there's

1789
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,539
any tips you might be able to offer

1790
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:37,380
tag everything and keep uh keep

1791
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:40,619
Immaculate records

1792
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:42,719
and don't wait to tag something don't

1793
01:22:40,619 --> 01:22:45,658
tag it tomorrow

1794
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:48,359
what when you work on the project right

1795
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:51,479
then you're not done until everything is

1796
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:53,880
tan and I would even tag things as

1797
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:57,178
you're doing the project you know like

1798
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:01,699
don't wait till all you know

1799
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:05,399
don't avoid all mixture by

1800
01:23:01,698 --> 01:23:08,099
keeping accurate records at the time

1801
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:11,279
that you're doing it don't don't say oh

1802
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:12,840
I'll write it all out tomorrow

1803
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:17,158
let's see

1804
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:19,860
was the yellow one the G4 or was it

1805
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:22,339
it's conflicts

1806
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:22,339
yeah

1807
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:29,099
oh right and you know and and don't

1808
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:31,639
smoke to George before you you start

1809
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,640
doing it

1810
01:23:31,698 --> 01:23:35,460
that's some great advice that's some

1811
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:37,980
great advice there's someone myself

1812
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:39,960
who's very particular about getting the

1813
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:41,218
lineages corrected I can throw my weight

1814
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:44,039
behind that one

1815
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:46,319
so I'd be curious to know are there any

1816
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:48,779
breeders who you really back the work of

1817
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,658
like who are your favorite breeders

1818
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:53,460
well uh

1819
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:55,099
there are there are some local people

1820
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:59,840
who are

1821
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:59,840
migration I really like his stuff

1822
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,300
uh shavensky he's he's stuck you know of

1823
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:10,380
course everybody loves it

1824
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:13,860
they just met him very briefly uh

1825
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:16,500
three weeks ago of all places that sell

1826
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:20,158
Asylum conference

1827
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:24,000
but he was leaving as I was coming in so

1828
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:27,179
but that was the first time I met him

1829
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:31,140
yeah very nice I'm a huge fan of that

1830
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:33,719
gelato 41 really nice stuff yeah

1831
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:35,219
one of the fan submitted questions as we

1832
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:37,619
sort of get towards the end of our

1833
01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:39,119
questions was they were hoping you might

1834
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:42,059
be able to give us a little bit of the

1835
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:44,279
back story on the Ortega clone that came

1836
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:46,199
from you you know like what was it like

1837
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,059
how would you describe that and was

1838
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:49,879
there any backstory behind how you found

1839
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:52,340
it

1840
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:54,719
was given to me

1841
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:57,600
uh by

1842
01:24:54,719 --> 01:25:01,500
the fellow who said he was just passing

1843
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,460
through and uh then I never saw him

1844
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:07,079
again

1845
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:09,539
he came he came up to give out varieties

1846
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:11,399
to different people different varieties

1847
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:15,840
to different people

1848
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:19,559
and a friend of mine got another plan uh

1849
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:21,840
a sort of uh another Indica that was

1850
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,820
very good and um

1851
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,579
I don't know

1852
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:28,439
I think she lost that after a while but

1853
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:32,219
and and I don't know where the

1854
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:34,079
entertainment is but the j-27 it came

1855
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:36,060
from a different group but from that

1856
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:40,619
time you know I was saying that

1857
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:43,739
that now proprietary variety it's not my

1858
01:25:40,619 --> 01:25:47,219
proprietary well

1859
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:49,979
it it's that you know how there can be

1860
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:52,739
complexity to things but it was

1861
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:55,139
originally my variety and then the afro

1862
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:58,198
was rated I lost it and then somebody

1863
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:02,060
gave it back to me like 20 years just a

1864
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:02,059
year ago 20 years later

1865
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:08,718
and and now it was the same plant it was

1866
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:11,819
it's a very

1867
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,800
its quality is good but it's a very weak

1868
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:16,679
plant

1869
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:20,520
it's been a clone you know clone to

1870
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:24,060
clone from and so um

1871
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:28,639
uh would we just

1872
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:28,639
using genetics to strengthen the plant

1873
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:33,380
and I hope to get that plant down to the

1874
01:26:31,738 --> 01:26:36,419
market so

1875
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:39,659
that's that's amazing stuff right there

1876
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:42,539
it makes me wonder what's the oldest

1877
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:44,579
clone that you're aware of

1878
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:48,238
well

1879
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:50,760
um I would say these j-27s that I was

1880
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:55,579
talking about I know that that has only

1881
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,579
been a throne plan for over 20 years

1882
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:03,000
quite some time yeah yeah more than that

1883
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:05,760
probably 23 24 years

1884
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:09,238
so yeah I mean it's prone to clone to

1885
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:12,239
clone but it yeah but what I saw that

1886
01:27:09,238 --> 01:27:16,559
plant I I recognized it immediately you

1887
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:20,279
know uh from from that time

1888
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,719
yeah wow that's beautiful to hear I'm

1889
01:27:20,279 --> 01:27:24,179
curious to hear because you you must

1890
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:26,939
have seen so many plants over the years

1891
01:27:24,179 --> 01:27:29,520
are there any old varieties that we

1892
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:31,859
don't see anymore that just really hold

1893
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,920
a special spot in your mind

1894
01:27:31,859 --> 01:27:37,439
well Romulan was pretty good

1895
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:41,039
and you don't see that anymore

1896
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:42,779
and then I had a plant uh well I mean

1897
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:45,840
there are so many good plants out there

1898
01:27:42,779 --> 01:27:47,880
now but really what I'm looking for you

1899
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,699
know I mentioned that those plants it

1900
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:53,400
could smell up their own I'm I'm looking

1901
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:56,879
to find those

1902
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:59,539
over those original plants put something

1903
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:02,880
close to them yeah

1904
01:27:59,539 --> 01:28:05,819
just get in touch with me

1905
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:08,699
please reach out that yeah that's great

1906
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:11,219
we've heard other guests talk about how

1907
01:28:08,698 --> 01:28:13,439
the focus of breeding going forward

1908
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:16,800
might be to try to produce some of these

1909
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:20,039
thile rich plants which are hypothesized

1910
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,860
to maybe be the plants that you know

1911
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:25,079
really stink up the whole room have you

1912
01:28:22,859 --> 01:28:27,420
done any research or looked into thile

1913
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:30,359
Rich plants at all

1914
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:33,539
you know it's finding the Champions that

1915
01:28:30,359 --> 01:28:35,399
uh that contain that because it was

1916
01:28:33,539 --> 01:28:37,679
within the terpenes

1917
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:42,359
yeah

1918
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:48,440
okay sure but but uh

1919
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:51,479
my most recent Studies have been on um

1920
01:28:48,439 --> 01:28:53,000
industrialization processes

1921
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:56,539
so

1922
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,359
growing methods that um

1923
01:28:56,539 --> 01:29:02,039
that can be integrated with growing

1924
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:05,039
methods that can be integrated with

1925
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:06,719
Machinery to uh like for instance for

1926
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:09,238
harvesting

1927
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,460
so I've been spending my time on that a

1928
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:13,859
little bit I mean one of the questions

1929
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:16,079
we got from one of our listeners was are

1930
01:29:13,859 --> 01:29:17,698
there any current grow technologies that

1931
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:19,920
you think are going to become outdated

1932
01:29:17,698 --> 01:29:22,138
quite quickly or at least we'll look

1933
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,579
back on and be like man why are we doing

1934
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:26,460
it that way

1935
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:29,760
big plans see the reason we had big

1936
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:31,500
plans was because of prohibition if

1937
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,239
you're only allowed to grow 10 plants

1938
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,639
you want to grow the biggest 10 plants

1939
01:29:33,238 --> 01:29:40,138
you could ever grow right but if you

1940
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:44,100
have but if you don't have those

1941
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:45,420
um but that is totally an artifact of

1942
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,520
prohibition

1943
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:51,658
so you wouldn't naturally grow big

1944
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,980
plants if that is if plant count wasn't

1945
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:55,799
de facto

1946
01:29:52,979 --> 01:29:58,379
so I think that especially with

1947
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,360
industrialization the big plants are

1948
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:03,000
going to go

1949
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:04,319
and those first those regulations

1950
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,560
chapter

1951
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:10,079
will be eliminated

1952
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:13,080
for instance I was from a farm called

1953
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:15,359
Roswell news in Colorado it's about 30

1954
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:19,019
acres and they're limited to something

1955
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:21,920
three or four hundred plants per acre

1956
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,920
and so

1957
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:32,158
um so that was not I mean it was a very

1958
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:35,880
productive Garden but it would be much

1959
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:38,399
more effect efficient ways of doing it

1960
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,500
um yeah certainly it'll be interesting

1961
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:42,179
to see how those changes roll out over

1962
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:44,760
the coming years especially if we get

1963
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:46,619
the abolishment of plant numbers we've

1964
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:49,020
just got a few fan submitted questions

1965
01:30:46,619 --> 01:30:50,760
before we get on to our final five which

1966
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:53,460
are you know pretty quick yes no type

1967
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:54,960
questions so one of the questions our

1968
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:56,819
listeners were interested in hearing is

1969
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:00,300
are you able to give us a bit of the

1970
01:30:56,819 --> 01:31:04,340
back story or at least demystify what is

1971
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:04,340
the real story behind Durban Poison

1972
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:08,638
Okay so

1973
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:09,679
[Music]

1974
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,779
um

1975
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:15,119
before the turn of the century early on

1976
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:15,779
in the

1977
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:20,158
um

1978
01:31:15,779 --> 01:31:23,039
in the 80s there was a coffee shop in

1979
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:25,259
Amsterdam called transvault and your

1980
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:26,819
trans vowel is one of the provinces in

1981
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:32,280
South Africa

1982
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:34,979
and so uh and sure enough it was run by

1983
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:38,819
South Africans and they were importing

1984
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:41,158
South African wheat and I bought and all

1985
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:43,559
of the Wii came with g

1986
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:45,839
and I bought

1987
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:49,699
all their varieties

1988
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,699
and that was

1989
01:31:49,939 --> 01:31:56,939
planted a number of them and just and

1990
01:31:54,658 --> 01:32:00,000
the German poison was outstanding and

1991
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:02,519
relevant and that's how it happened and

1992
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,100
I've read in um

1993
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:07,219
in uh different

1994
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,219
um

1995
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:12,600
uh different things on the internet that

1996
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:14,819
I've traveled to South Africa and got

1997
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:18,239
that and everything and that sounds

1998
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:20,340
really good and I wish I had but I

1999
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,500
traveled to Amsterdam and went to the

2000
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,719
trans Mall

2001
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:27,000
there you go and were there ever any

2002
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,039
additional genetics mixed in with it or

2003
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,119
it's just pure South African as far as

2004
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:32,300
you know

2005
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:35,939
well when I

2006
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:38,880
when I presented it to the world it was

2007
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:41,279
pure self-help

2008
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,679
yeah awesome what a what a cool story

2009
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:45,899
one of the other questions we got is

2010
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:48,060
sort of along the same lines and The

2011
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:50,819
Listener asks are there any early or

2012
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:52,800
modern varieties that Eddie's likewise

2013
01:32:50,819 --> 01:32:55,979
responsible for bringing sort of to the

2014
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:57,960
community well

2015
01:32:55,979 --> 01:33:02,519
um

2016
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:04,819
um the old uh J1 and J2 but they're not

2017
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:08,340
really available anymore

2018
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:11,039
Romulan which I uh I wasn't the

2019
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:13,679
originator of Romulan but

2020
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:15,899
um it was you know it was obscure until

2021
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:18,960
I started cloning it

2022
01:33:15,899 --> 01:33:21,238
so those varieties but it's been a long

2023
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:25,380
time you know it's been uh I haven't

2024
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:26,158
been doing that for 20 years and so you

2025
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:29,940
know

2026
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:33,179
not many people drive a 20 year old car

2027
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:34,738
look I adore J1 I think it's one of the

2028
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:37,260
best plants ever and I don't know why

2029
01:33:34,738 --> 01:33:41,939
it's not still popular

2030
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:44,639
well you know uh it it was it was a

2031
01:33:41,939 --> 01:33:45,899
harder plan to grow because it had a lot

2032
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,480
of sativa

2033
01:33:45,899 --> 01:33:52,079
so it was pretty hard to grow you need

2034
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:55,439
the best place to grow would be like

2035
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:57,000
Spain or Italy something like that

2036
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:59,219
Outdoors

2037
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,158
the day two is much more manageable

2038
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:04,859
because you've had a lot of vindicating

2039
01:34:01,158 --> 01:34:06,658
yeah okay sorry what's the J2 is it J1

2040
01:34:04,859 --> 01:34:11,219
crossed to an indica

2041
01:34:06,658 --> 01:34:13,439
no it was uh day two uh two and two

2042
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:16,679
indicators were crossed and then they

2043
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:18,960
both crossed with this

2044
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:21,359
see I'd have to look in my records I

2045
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,079
forget what they were crossword but it

2046
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:25,859
was

2047
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:28,019
um it wasn't enough it wasn't an

2048
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:30,179
outstanding plant that they were crossed

2049
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:33,420
with there was a plant that had certain

2050
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:35,880
other qualities that made it uh made it

2051
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:36,719
a valuable time they've increased in

2052
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:41,340
yield

2053
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:42,539
and um the the other plant uh had a lot

2054
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:46,860
of um

2055
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:50,279
hidden stability which made it it sort

2056
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:52,639
of stabilized your day too and like once

2057
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:55,679
it was hybridized it was pretty uniform

2058
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:57,960
which was very unusual

2059
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,619
you will usually have that usually you

2060
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:02,300
know when the F2 you know you

2061
01:35:00,619 --> 01:35:05,698
the the

2062
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:08,340
you know the F1 generation is uniform

2063
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:11,158
and then the F2 Generation sorts out

2064
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:14,880
into all kinds of ways but but with the

2065
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:17,460
J2 it remained pretty uniform throughout

2066
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,560
a little unusual

2067
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:20,880
yeah it does sound unusual doesn't it

2068
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:23,219
yeah

2069
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:25,260
so the next question we had from one of

2070
01:35:23,219 --> 01:35:28,760
our listeners is where does Ed see the

2071
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:28,760
Cannabis scene in 10 years time

2072
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:33,479
um I don't think people will regrow the

2073
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:36,658
Cannabis anymore

2074
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:40,738
I think that they I think that

2075
01:35:36,658 --> 01:35:43,500
most uh I think that or you get were in

2076
01:35:40,738 --> 01:35:45,599
addition to growing cannabis they I

2077
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:49,079
think a lot of the collaboroids are

2078
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:52,500
going to be produced by growing beer and

2079
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:54,840
that the uh the genes for the

2080
01:35:52,500 --> 01:36:00,000
cannaboroids and food Terrapins will be

2081
01:35:54,840 --> 01:36:02,400
transferred to uh uh to yeast and so

2082
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,560
that you know people say oh that's

2083
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:05,759
terrible but just think about it no

2084
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,520
lights

2085
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:11,219
right because you don't need lights so

2086
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,980
sugar water and a pail

2087
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:17,520
then you're in business

2088
01:36:13,979 --> 01:36:20,638
I mean and the east and then seven days

2089
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:22,679
later or a few days later you you know

2090
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:25,560
the yeast have expressed the

2091
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:27,179
cannabinoids that uh have been

2092
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:32,100
transferred to their

2093
01:36:27,179 --> 01:36:33,840
uh to their chromosomes and so that's

2094
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:34,500
much easier than

2095
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:37,380
um

2096
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:39,420
growing your own I mean growing you you

2097
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:43,319
don't have the light set up you don't

2098
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:48,480
have the time set up the space

2099
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:50,819
be a game changer won't it yes yeah

2100
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:52,738
well that's that's something to to look

2101
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:55,738
forward to seeing how that works that'll

2102
01:36:52,738 --> 01:36:58,319
be interesting indeed and you know yeah

2103
01:36:55,738 --> 01:37:01,218
you know a lot of our medicines you need

2104
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:05,399
that one so what point uh

2105
01:37:01,219 --> 01:37:08,939
why not cannabis yeah hugely

2106
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:11,879
everybody will have to wear a white uh a

2107
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:14,099
white lab jacket it would definitely

2108
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:16,260
change or the producer image

2109
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:18,800
well it will it will be something

2110
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:20,600
totally different I mean

2111
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:25,560
I went

2112
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:27,179
I visited uh Genentech a few years ago

2113
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,860
and

2114
01:37:27,179 --> 01:37:30,960
you know that we're just sprawling

2115
01:37:28,859 --> 01:37:34,819
buildings and everything but you know

2116
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:37,139
the actual place where they uh make the

2117
01:37:34,819 --> 01:37:40,920
where where the

2118
01:37:37,139 --> 01:37:43,980
the actual place the space where the uh

2119
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:46,500
the medicines are made

2120
01:37:43,979 --> 01:37:51,319
are basically

2121
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:52,979
um uh it's basically a

2122
01:37:51,319 --> 01:37:55,799
Brewing

2123
01:37:52,979 --> 01:38:00,178
the bromine either either bacteria or

2124
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:03,060
yeast and then then they refine them so

2125
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:06,119
um I think that we'll be able to do that

2126
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:09,300
as consumers

2127
01:38:06,119 --> 01:38:12,238
yeah exciting times ahead for sure

2128
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:17,279
and then the big thing will be

2129
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:20,519
um uh uh by the yeast Sports you know

2130
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:23,639
the yeast so it will all depend upon

2131
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:26,460
what yeast you get because Japanese will

2132
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:28,079
have different cannabinoid and terpene

2133
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:30,658
recipes

2134
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:33,420
so um

2135
01:38:30,658 --> 01:38:36,179
they become the strains they are the

2136
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:38,779
street yeah exactly yeah

2137
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:41,819
that's cool that's cool

2138
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:44,039
uh enough topic sort of question we got

2139
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:46,679
from one of our listeners was

2140
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:49,920
could Ed tell us a little bit about what

2141
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:51,960
was some of the worst advice he believed

2142
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,719
to be correct for the longest time

2143
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:57,380
before realizing it wasn't true

2144
01:38:54,719 --> 01:39:00,239
I'm not going into that

2145
01:38:57,380 --> 01:39:01,440
because because somebody will hear it

2146
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:03,959
and they'll

2147
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:07,919
take that advice so

2148
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:10,319
it's better to let it lie buried there

2149
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,480
you go good answer good answer

2150
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:14,219
so the listener was wondering would Ed

2151
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:18,599
be able to tell us a little bit about

2152
01:39:14,219 --> 01:39:21,420
how Sensi came to offer the Ed Rosenthal

2153
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:24,659
superbud strain were you involved in

2154
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:27,239
that or was it a namesake sort of thing

2155
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:30,059
well I actually had given them the

2156
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:32,359
original seeds from that many years

2157
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:35,760
before

2158
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:36,599
you know before they introduced it and

2159
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,400
so

2160
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:40,860
um

2161
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:43,019
I gave them the original genetics but

2162
01:39:40,859 --> 01:39:46,380
they worked on it for perhaps 20 years

2163
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:50,639
before releasing it and the thing about

2164
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:52,920
the uh superbride is that it comes in

2165
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:57,119
very early it will come in a month or

2166
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:59,699
earlier than your other varieties and so

2167
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:04,019
you know in northern areas in a woman

2168
01:39:59,698 --> 01:40:04,698
it's uh the the weather threat

2169
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:07,440
um

2170
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:12,359
yeah hugely advantageous for cash

2171
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:16,259
croppers yeah and for everybody I mean

2172
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:20,399
uh no home Gardener likes to see their

2173
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:24,000
Bud turn to Marsh overnight because the

2174
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:26,879
weather changed so this eliminates that

2175
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:30,238
problem in that case certainly

2176
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:33,060
and so also you know uh in that line

2177
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:35,779
there's a Jack Jack Herer which is very

2178
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:39,600
popular and there's the Michigan line

2179
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:44,059
for Michigan and France so there are a

2180
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:44,060
number of people in that in that series

2181
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:50,460
yeah certainly certainly I mean while

2182
01:40:48,539 --> 01:40:52,859
we're on the topic of cash cropping or

2183
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:54,539
sort of in that general area this was an

2184
01:40:52,859 --> 01:40:56,880
interesting question someone was

2185
01:40:54,539 --> 01:41:01,738
wondering what's the most you've ever

2186
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:05,340
seen yielded off one plant indoor

2187
01:41:01,738 --> 01:41:08,399
I don't know uh I I haven't seen

2188
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:11,300
gigantic I know a friend of mine used to

2189
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:14,399
go grow these gigantic plants indoors

2190
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:18,000
and but they were sure they weren't

2191
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:21,000
yielding that much so uh I I haven't

2192
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:24,300
seen any really giant plants to dream

2193
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,939
about not endorsed

2194
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:29,400
sure so I can understand that

2195
01:41:26,939 --> 01:41:32,339
so the second last viewer submitted

2196
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:34,319
question was they say oh about a year or

2197
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:37,260
more ago I remembered seeing a post

2198
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:40,319
about Ed creating his own bagged soil

2199
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:42,300
blend alongside vital Garden Supply is

2200
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:43,679
that still going ahead or is that paused

2201
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:46,079
for the moment

2202
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:49,079
well it was paused for this season

2203
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:52,979
because of supply chain problems

2204
01:41:49,079 --> 01:41:54,779
but we're planning to go ahead next year

2205
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:57,178
ah exciting so they can still probably

2206
01:41:54,779 --> 01:42:01,019
get it next year yes

2207
01:41:57,179 --> 01:42:03,600
fantastic and the final viewer submitted

2208
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:06,239
question before we do our final five is

2209
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:09,239
how do you feel the effects of the older

2210
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:12,539
varieties versus the present day Elite

2211
01:42:09,238 --> 01:42:14,579
Cuts Fair many people nowadays talk

2212
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:16,439
about modern cannabis as having a

2213
01:42:14,579 --> 01:42:18,420
similar sort of feeling or effect

2214
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:20,539
whereas the older varieties it's like

2215
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:23,399
they had their own sort of personality

2216
01:42:20,539 --> 01:42:26,399
do you feel this sort of sentiment is

2217
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:29,099
true or do you think that there's still

2218
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:32,779
variance in the modern varieties it was

2219
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,780
incredible amounts of variation

2220
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:38,579
yeah I mean

2221
01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:40,859
um especially if you go off the beat and

2222
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:42,179
try track because there are so many

2223
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:44,399
breeders

2224
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:47,399
there are thousands and thousands of

2225
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:50,158
breeders there's no other crop that is

2226
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:54,179
bred the way this one is you know with

2227
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:56,899
so many people treating it so there's so

2228
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:56,899
much variation

2229
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:01,439
yeah that's great to hear all right well

2230
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:04,019
that brings us to our final five quick

2231
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,118
fire questions that we ask all guests so

2232
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:08,699
the first one is what is the most

2233
01:43:06,118 --> 01:43:10,439
memorable cannabis experience you've

2234
01:43:08,698 --> 01:43:12,238
ever had it might be smoking hash it

2235
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:14,158
might be smoking flour what's the one

2236
01:43:12,238 --> 01:43:16,399
that just stands out the most in your

2237
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:16,399
mind

2238
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:23,399
well I was with Neville and I was

2239
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:24,658
smoking some nl5 Haze and it was like I

2240
01:43:23,399 --> 01:43:27,000
was tripping

2241
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:29,039
on his face now

2242
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,939
um maybe that wouldn't have the same

2243
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:35,158
effect now but it was extraordinary

2244
01:43:31,939 --> 01:43:37,618
marijuana we were at his mansion

2245
01:43:35,158 --> 01:43:40,759
you know in my making

2246
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:40,759
I'm so jealous

2247
01:43:41,698 --> 01:43:46,500
that's beautiful okay so on the other

2248
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:48,780
end of the spectrum was there ever a

2249
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:50,460
time when everyone you knew was like oh

2250
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:52,319
you got to try this new thing it's so

2251
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:55,279
good and then you finally tried it and

2252
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:59,219
you were like ah is that it

2253
01:43:55,279 --> 01:44:01,319
I try to remember the good experiences

2254
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:05,460
yeah that's a good that's a good rule to

2255
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:07,500
live by so next one was if I had to drop

2256
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:10,260
you off on a desert island with just

2257
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:11,819
three strains to cultivate and to smoke

2258
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:14,579
for the rest of your life which three

2259
01:44:11,819 --> 01:44:18,299
would you take well definitely take the

2260
01:44:14,579 --> 01:44:20,279
G27 I might take the superbug

2261
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:22,560
and

2262
01:44:20,279 --> 01:44:26,759
I would probably

2263
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:29,400
um I go after a sativa variety one of

2264
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,199
this one of the modern sativa varieties

2265
01:44:29,399 --> 01:44:33,420
as well

2266
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:35,960
yeah it's a nice little palette you've

2267
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:39,300
got there to mix and match yeah

2268
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:41,158
so was there ever a variety that you

2269
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:42,960
really wanted to get your hands on but

2270
01:44:41,158 --> 01:44:44,638
it just always eluded you and you could

2271
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:47,520
never get it

2272
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:50,579
the original White Widow and there was a

2273
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:53,219
fellow who had it and sold

2274
01:44:50,579 --> 01:44:54,779
the seeds to a number of different

2275
01:44:53,219 --> 01:44:58,920
companies

2276
01:44:54,779 --> 01:45:00,359
but but he never saw the exact PRC

2277
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:03,960
itself

2278
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:06,118
there was some variation but he had a

2279
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:07,679
pure variety of it and I don't know what

2280
01:45:06,118 --> 01:45:11,039
happened to him

2281
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:13,440
people didn't like him because he saw

2282
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:17,158
this same variety to everybody

2283
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:19,559
exclusively very exclusive then he

2284
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:23,039
disappeared was his name was that

2285
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:25,500
ingenmar yeah all right yeah

2286
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:27,179
yeah there you go yeah you read his

2287
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:29,939
names on the forums but as you said he

2288
01:45:27,179 --> 01:45:31,859
just completely disappeared right

2289
01:45:29,939 --> 01:45:34,138
all righty well it won for the ages well

2290
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:36,839
on to our final question before we wrap

2291
01:45:34,139 --> 01:45:39,239
things up for today if you had a time

2292
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:40,920
machine and you could go back anywhere

2293
01:45:39,238 --> 01:45:43,379
in time anywhere around the world

2294
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:45,600
presumably to collect some seeds or

2295
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:48,739
maybe even a clone where would you go

2296
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,739
and what would you collect

2297
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:52,679
well

2298
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,380
you know

2299
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:58,618
um

2300
01:45:54,380 --> 01:46:01,639
the original area where a plant or an

2301
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:01,639
animal uh

2302
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,658
uh started usually has the most

2303
01:46:04,979 --> 01:46:14,118
diversity

2304
01:46:06,658 --> 01:46:14,118
so I would like to um so I would

2305
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:23,539
uh I'd like to go back into Bhutan and

2306
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:27,139
uh a little further east of that

2307
01:46:23,539 --> 01:46:27,139
and uh

2308
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:30,920
maybe 50 years ago

2309
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,840
because

2310
01:46:32,579 --> 01:46:38,579
um

2311
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:39,719
that was before there was uh before all

2312
01:46:38,579 --> 01:46:43,939
those uh

2313
