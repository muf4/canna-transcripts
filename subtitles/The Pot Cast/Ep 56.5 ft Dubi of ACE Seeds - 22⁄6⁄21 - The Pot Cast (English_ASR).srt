without further delay

67
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,400
let's get into it

68
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,640
that's a great answer because my next

69
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:06,120
question was gonna be exactly about that

70
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,859
the killer A5 Haze I've been reading

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,200
about this because

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,040
it looks like it could be you know the

73
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,780
holy grail for sativa heads like myself

74
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,359
would you recommend this cross for

75
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,459
people who like the really sort of racy

76
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,739
uplifting High

77
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,920
yeah yeah definitely if you are looking

78
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,920
for extremely powerful and intensive

79
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,939
face hybrid that combines the enabled

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,319
world with us

81
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:38,539
with extreme potency is killarified for

82
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,699
sure

83
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:44,818
5 and how would you describe that one

84
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:49,039
for people in terms of the smells and

85
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,039
the type of high and the flower time

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,640
uh well the originally fight Colombians

87
00:03:52,739 --> 00:04:02,459
along flowering planting it can go over

88
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:06,018
100 days and here we Harvest in in my

89
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,819
city in my in the coast last week of

90
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,819
August yeah sorry last last week of

91
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,619
November early December they are

92
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,719
although they are half Northern Lights

93
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,899
they are very Haze dominant and very

94
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:22,978
long flowering

95
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,799
um the if a case is the only plan I have

96
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:29,939
found I can compete with extreme potency

97
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,879
of the Malawi that was when I

98
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:37,139
experience also the efficacy

99
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:40,199
the first time I say my goal I say one

100
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:43,259
this has the type of thing the intense

101
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,419
and the low in terms I'm looking from

102
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,180
the Neville's close because the others

103
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,859
don't have the C5 is not so intensive

104
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,500
do you remember it

105
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,720
that is not so intensive is the Taste is

106
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,439
quite lemony Thai yeah but it's not

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,900
sorry yeah but and I say wow the A5 is

108
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,060
the one for infants and it's also the

109
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:06,120
one for the most extreme potency from

110
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,720
the naval world so if I want to keep

111
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:14,160
this extreme potency for A5

112
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,160
and I won't even make it a stronger

113
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,419
the only way is Malawi I we we roll the

114
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,720
A5 to

115
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,698
to the lab and it tested 25 percent but

116
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,580
it hits like 30.

117
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,780
I brought the new Malawi killer to the

118
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,339
same lab

119
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:35,519
and it was 30. so by Crossing A5 with

120
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:39,119
with my killer Malawi parental plans I

121
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:42,240
can increase even more the THC both the

122
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,699
type of ball effects are similar super

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,280
trippy but with narcosis

124
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm very profound I'm super long nasty

125
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,319
very heavy in the head and in the body

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,160
both have this

127
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:59,759
so it was very natural for me to to to

128
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,220
blend them and the Malawi contributes

129
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,639
increasing even more the

130
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:08,340
the THC making it more richness then my

131
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,800
killer Malawi's are on the 8080 plus

132
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:14,219
fluorine drains so the flowering time of

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,699
day five is shortened down also

134
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:22,139
on the A5 contributes with the the

135
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:25,139
signature loading fence face heater pins

136
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,500
and that's killer E5 is so extremely

137
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,379
important in Sensei very high yielding

138
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,220
and and a bit easier to cultivate than

139
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:37,620
A5 and probably a bit stronger if you do

140
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,319
proper selection

141
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,180
yeah great information there I think

142
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,000
that's gonna be the one that I'm

143
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,759
probably gonna jump on the photos of it

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,639
look great as well in the last answer

145
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,220
you mentioned the hash plant Haze and

146
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,660
this is an interesting one because I

147
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,900
don't know if many people have heard

148
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,360
about it maybe unlike the C5 or the A5

149
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,478
which they might have heard about I

150
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,860
remember I got to smell it and I tried a

151
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:06,839
little bit of it but I think it was

152
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,538
seeded so it's a little different but it

153
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,560
smelt a bit like the C5 to me in the

154
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:12,560
similar Terrapins

155
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,079
um what was interesting about it was it

156
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,479
it felt like a real hybrid like it was

157
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,779
kind of you know the hash plant brought

158
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:27,538
some Indica the C5 was sort of sativary

159
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,279
what do you think it's gonna breed well

160
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:31,860
with would you want to pair it with a

161
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,198
sativa with an indica and how do you

162
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,098
describe the hash plant Haze to people

163
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,660
who haven't tried it

164
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:41,279
that's a very good question

165
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm glad you

166
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:48,418
you you know both

167
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,819
and as you said uh both the the plan KC

168
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:53,639
from nebulance c5h which is Northern

169
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,080
live five I see are very similar they

170
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,538
have the same that

171
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,758
and we

172
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:02,279
um definition product is also very

173
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,500
similar the northern light five the C5

174
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:10,379
sorry has the lemon in terms a bit more

175
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:12,959
alive okay the husband case is a bit not

176
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:16,740
you can detect the same tie like Terps

177
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:20,939
from the hazy that but it's more

178
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:24,120
no more dark more dry but it tastes more

179
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:27,899
like uh the house plant I think is more

180
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:33,259
like Moroccan pollen taste the the jello

181
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:34,879
Moroccan hash taste okay is more

182
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:38,939
dry

183
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,740
earthy Hashim Moroccan kind of terpenes

184
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,560
that has plant yeah and they are quite

185
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:48,600
similar and as you say this the [ __ ]

186
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:53,099
adds this highlighter pins we brought to

187
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:56,159
the lab for terpen analysis both and and

188
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,519
we saw that they were very similar there

189
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,199
and for uh um for Canada they are also

190
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,899
very similar

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,959
um both are very similar in chemotype

192
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,299
and in terpene profile the effect of the

193
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:13,139
hash plant is slightly more funny both

194
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:16,439
very similar while the C5 smoke is more

195
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,240
tasty yeah I definitely definitely feel

196
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,120
like I picked up on some of those things

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,940
you mentioned one of our listeners was

198
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,778
wondering if you had any tips to help

199
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,640
them grow long flowering sativas indoors

200
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:32,939
and one of the things they wanted to

201
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,620
know is if they had maybe an a strain

202
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,260
that said it was going to go you know

203
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,159
say 16 or more weeks

204
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:43,559
would you recommend putting it in 1212

205
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,699
from seed or does that have negative

206
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,699
effects on the plant

207
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,360
yes because

208
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,580
it depends a lot long flowering

209
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,580
yeah I think anything

210
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,739
long flowering right

211
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,000
yeah

212
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,180
it's not the same like trying to grow

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,720
indoors at Ida or alternate case that

214
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:12,539
flowers four to six months indoors that

215
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,300
are assertive dominant hybrid that has

216
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:17,159
already refined

217
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:18,899
that it takes three months of flowering

218
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,500
universe and performs well indoors like

219
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,500
golden tiger

220
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,899
it requires different approach okay but

221
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,539
considering that you are growing along

222
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,639
flowering sativa okay and the problem is

223
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:35,519
is charged along flooring and the size

224
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,199
and all this yeah

225
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,500
indoors

226
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,440
the typical failure that the Growers do

227
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,578
with sativa is to provide a lot of pot

228
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,820
size

229
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:51,179
a lot of

230
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:53,640
growing time okay the tropical the

231
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:56,338
sativas and the tropical sativas take

232
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,179
longer to reach sexual maturity usually

233
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:02,160
seven eight nine weeks this means that

234
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:05,399
the plan will grow will grow will grow

235
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,039
from seed and until until reaching the

236
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,820
sexual maturity before the plant is not

237
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:13,259
able to flower no no no no no matter the

238
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,500
photo period you're using is not going

239
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,299
to flower so if you want to keep the if

240
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,419
the grower wants to keep the the plants

241
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:23,219
a small and under control during these

242
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:25,799
two months that the plant is rich in

243
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,220
sexual maturity it's better to use a

244
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:32,879
small pot for example three liter pot

245
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:36,240
just just to to let it grow until the

246
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,939
plants sow sex for example you say in

247
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,259
that way you can keep many plants in

248
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,779
small pots

249
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,059
and then when you if you only want to

250
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:46,259
grow females you say okay I discard the

251
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,599
females

252
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,519
I discard the man sorry but this didn't

253
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,820
didn't take much space only three little

254
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,278
potage then you have the families in

255
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,560
small pots and and then just switch to

256
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,740
flower but you keep them in the small

257
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,139
pot okay because the sativas and

258
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,720
especially tropical sativas they're the

259
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,059
flowering stretching is very strong very

260
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
very strong they can double triple or

261
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,439
even more

262
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:18,419
and multiply their size just in early

263
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,360
flowing what is the best way to

264
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,939
to control the side with without topping

265
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,778
is with Rod bound we're using a small

266
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,260
pot

267
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:30,240
typically if you let the the female in

268
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:35,120
the three liter pot after sexing and you

269
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:39,060
pass switch to flower the the dominance

270
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,700
hybrid or the tropical sativa will start

271
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,619
to flower uh we'll do the early flowing

272
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,259
and stretching but in a more moderate

273
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,399
way okay you the grower will be able to

274
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:53,039
to tame as much as possible the size of

275
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,220
the tropical sativa from seed

276
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,500
uh and then

277
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,540
some songs

278
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:04,940
hybrids will work work well under 12 12

279
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:09,299
like could be Panama Banks

280
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:12,000
Panama golden tiger this work well under

281
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:14,578
classic 1212 or their strange like

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,659
pirutai ultimate hairs you need to go

283
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:22,259
down in 11 13 10 14 even

284
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:25,679
yeah and obviously another trick is to

285
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,919
start from clones from sexually mature

286
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,919
clones

287
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:40,439
directly switch to floor in that way you

288
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:42,419
can have sativaso one meter less than

289
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,920
one meter a bit more but very very under

290
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:47,399
control yes

291
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:50,039
yeah great advice there I was wondering

292
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,039
have you ever experimented with

293
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:57,240
different day and night times like for

294
00:13:53,039 --> 00:14:01,338
example DJ Short famously said that he

295
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,500
gives 11 hours of light 13 hours of dark

296
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:07,800
and he thinks that it makes the plants

297
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,899
Express more sativa-like have you found

298
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,778
anything like that on your own

299
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:15,899
okay every strand is different

300
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:19,200
yeah yeah I think I read some that his

301
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,120
approach was like to study the

302
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,660
germination of the tropical sativas and

303
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,940
the 1410 no I think so yes yeah because

304
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:28,919
this is for example in the subtropica

305
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,320
then we have been talking about in

306
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:34,078
Canary Islands in Hawaii in in

307
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,600
California in Reunion Island is that

308
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:41,819
photo period the longer days will be 14

309
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,600
hours okay and then you grow the plants

310
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,500
and

311
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:52,440
when when when you decide you switch to

312
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:56,458
11 30 yes very tropical strengths from 0

313
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,040
to 7 in from the equator

314
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:04,198
for example

315
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:07,259
ties extreme Colombians a extreme

316
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:10,979
Jamaican extreme

317
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:16,019
French Royal Africans these plants don't

318
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:20,039
flower Under 12 12. they are in in a

319
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:23,698
Everlasting early flowering stretching

320
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,500
so indoors they just grow longer nose

321
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:28,439
and longer nose and they put a few

322
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,539
pistols but they continue because they

323
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,920
are feeling that that they are in that

324
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:35,458
moment that they need to stretch and

325
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:38,219
make a space for the bad uh but they

326
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:41,099
will only this extreme tropical will

327
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:46,139
only go deep to the flowering process

328
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,940
when they are 11 13 and even to to make

329
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,278
them fully ripe and avoid more

330
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,620
reflowering some refluence you even need

331
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:58,019
to bring down the photoperation at the

332
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:01,620
end maybe to 10 14 photo period

333
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:04,500
yeah very interesting very interesting

334
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,039
I've seen online that I think you had

335
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,198
mention somewhere that you felt like a

336
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,778
lot of indoor Growers only really want

337
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,519
to do eight or nine week strains because

338
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:16,198
they think that they're going to yield

339
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,820
more but then you said oh you know but

340
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,859
if you grow a strain that takes you know

341
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,740
three or four weeks longer it will yield

342
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,500
more so it is worth the time

343
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,360
do you feel like not enough Growers are

344
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,220
sort of aware of this because it feels

345
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,860
like there's not a lot of sort of

346
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,139
commercial people trying to do sativas

347
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:38,240
you know how can we help get the message

348
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,240
out there that sativas are viable

349
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,078
that's a very good question and I I

350
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:45,719
don't think

351
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:48,838
many people realize especially the the

352
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,139
young ones and there's also the false

353
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,139
meat

354
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:59,458
without indica

355
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,160
there's no jail in hybrids you know uh

356
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:06,438
I have many many people that ask me the

357
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:09,480
same question over the years I want uh

358
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,339
seven eight week flowering plant that

359
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,500
deals well

360
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:15,958
and I say oh

361
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,419
Ellie flowering plants

362
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,818
are not the best healers they are good

363
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,220
indications but you want an Indica okay

364
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:26,938
there are good Indica strains that are

365
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:31,019
good yelling with nine weeks

366
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:35,160
but if you want even better years

367
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:38,160
you better to grow a 50 50 hybrid a real

368
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,340
F1 hybrid 50 50 that has a lot of

369
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,620
eternosis hybrid bigger

370
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:49,079
uh and wait until for example the Malawi

371
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:51,599
cross pck If Flowers 9 10 11 weeks but

372
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,879
the year is the double uh data plan of

373
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,859
eight weeks

374
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,360
so

375
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:02,579
is it worth to wait two three weeks more

376
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:05,038
uh until the double and harvest the

377
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,859
double uh and have something that has

378
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:10,379
more sativa probably can provide

379
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,159
different effects if you want me for

380
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,679
sure

381
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,019
and if we talk about the whole picture

382
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,140
what are the biggest kind of is yelled

383
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:18,139
in

384
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:27,240
in the world is

385
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,760
sativa dominant Hebrews with just a

386
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,759
thoughts of of indica

387
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,099
70 80 percent

388
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,119
uh hybrids that can grow five to six

389
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:40,259
metal

390
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:42,899
big and GL two three five kilos and they

391
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,960
have just you know Indica genetics to

392
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,298
add the bad density to make waste but

393
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,360
the long coldest floor restructure the

394
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:53,038
big size the super Vigor all only

395
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,099
strings that at the end will come on the

396
00:18:53,038 --> 00:19:00,058
final jail come from the sativa

397
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:03,240
the good flower relief radius that is a

398
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:07,259
good trade for later for bagapin and for

399
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,900
trimming is the indicas had very bad

400
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:13,140
flower with

401
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:16,259
bad radio the sativa have better

402
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,660
so at the end of your own uh very high

403
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,579
GL team with very great flower you

404
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,919
believe right here you must go to sativa

405
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,960
genetics no indica and wait a bit more

406
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,140
but it will be worth

407
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,660
oh yeah I like the sounds of that

408
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,179
I don't know if it's the case worldwide

409
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,720
but I feel like in Australia and in

410
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:40,200
America at least people prefer indicas

411
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,298
over sativas generally speaking and I

412
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,058
was trying to think about why that was

413
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:48,058
like why do people seem to like indica's

414
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:50,298
more and I kind of was thinking oh well

415
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:52,500
maybe it's got something to do with how

416
00:19:50,298 --> 00:19:55,319
sometimes people who sort of have

417
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,558
anxiety or are naturally a bit nervous

418
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:00,480
will use cannabis to help with that so

419
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,160
you know those people aren't going to

420
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,200
like sativas

421
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,820
but then I kind of thought oh I don't

422
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,160
really know maybe it's just individual

423
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:11,038
individual biochemistry like who knows

424
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,798
so I'm wondering do you feel like more

425
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,259
people like indicas than sativas and how

426
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,599
can we try to convert some of the people

427
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:22,038
who like indicas over to the dark side

428
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,038
to try the sativas

429
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:26,660
well

430
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:32,759
I I I I I realize you like indigos

431
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,480
I don't think it's the dark side or it's

432
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,480
a bad thing uh

433
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:39,019
um

434
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:42,538
but what I think is a bad thing is the

435
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:45,179
reductionism to simplify the whole

436
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:48,720
qualities of the Cannabis gem pool

437
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:52,320
towards only the the Indica dominant

438
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,900
strains that look good on Instagram

439
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,019
you know I think the economy is much

440
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,179
more than this

441
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,279
more than to offer than that

442
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:06,419
I understand that a lot of people don't

443
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:11,038
tolerate well the the sativa effects and

444
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:13,980
prefer the Indigo or or CBD I mean

445
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,740
perfect for a smoking Sativa no one is

446
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:20,460
better person is not

447
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,740
is not better okay but

448
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,319
yeah I think it has to do with both

449
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,839
things in one side there

450
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:31,139
the industry both in America in the 80s

451
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:33,839
and in Holland develop commercially

452
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,700
within the growing and the best

453
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,678
strengths that were developed within the

454
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,159
growing had a lot of money

455
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:46,519
this is a fact because

456
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:46,520
Northern California and all this

457
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:52,979
they they need in Northern California

458
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,658
the October is already called in Holland

459
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,980
they don't have a good weather

460
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,860
so

461
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,140
yes uh commercially

462
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:04,139
it went to

463
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:08,460
to fast-flowering indoor plants

464
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:11,820
of Afghani Indica genetic background

465
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,500
uh The Afghani also they were the more

466
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:15,779
suitable strains to adapt genetics to

467
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,079
indoor growing to certain flowering

468
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:21,240
times to make the the balls denser to

469
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:25,678
increase rest in production

470
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,079
so at the end the standard for

471
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,340
commercial quality width

472
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:35,158
after the scan yes and now with the

473
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,899
course and the cookies is obviously and

474
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,260
its effect is the Indica dominant

475
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,360
strengths yeah some of them have a bit

476
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,359
of sativa they are very complex

477
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,399
qualified you see the the produce

478
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:52,639
sometimes thinner leaves but the flower

479
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,640
is all all about the refinement of the

480
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:58,919
you know

481
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,440
is there and they are succeeding in the

482
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,179
the

483
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,120
they are the best on it in our in North

484
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:09,380
America and in North America the the

485
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:12,298
pioneers of the modern Western marijuana

486
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,640
we need to go to thank to to the hippies

487
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:15,960
that we are smoking and have this kind

488
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,140
of this culture today

489
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,159
they are the the biggest country

490
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,860
with the biggest

491
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,700
cannabis culture in in the Western

492
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:28,918
Country they are pioneers in Britain

493
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:33,058
so

494
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:36,000
I cannot complain much about them but

495
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:38,460
honestly their style doesn't match with

496
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,359
my my style of what I like but it's just

497
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,720
my

498
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:45,839
my

499
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,659
taste and I don't think is better or

500
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,298
than the other if you ask me I would

501
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:53,039
like to see more diversity more genetic

502
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:55,200
diversity and more sort of strange being

503
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,519
grown and being appreciated yes of

504
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,519
course

505
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,519
foreign

506
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,519
when the hip is started with all these

507
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,558
they they wanted to the to make the

508
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:13,440
Revolution and use the revolution use

509
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,859
the drugs for the revolution now well if

510
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,558
I in the days of

511
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:21,359
globalized capitalism no

512
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,940
um we deal with

513
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,279
with a lot of stress we are very

514
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,798
disconnected with the nature with the

515
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,298
Natural Life

516
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:32,298
and we suffer a lot of

517
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,480
the depression and anxiety increase in

518
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,519
this modern world

519
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,980
so

520
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:44,639
it's normal and

521
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,798
that people need approach

522
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,400
approach to canaries from the medical

523
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,599
way and then they prefer something that

524
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,960
we

525
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:56,579
that is more like a stone no that will

526
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,279
kill the day because they have had

527
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:01,798
another of the day

528
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:05,038
nature for something that that will kill

529
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:08,579
the day and we'll handle to go to to

530
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:11,579
sleep and that's all or they have a

531
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:14,158
medical problem that don't get high and

532
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:15,779
and get some medical reliefs from the

533
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,840
CBD

534
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:22,200
yeah great answer great answer

535
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:25,079
I was wondering if you could tell us a

536
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,460
little bit about the Spanish scene and

537
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,259
what I was interested in knowing

538
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,200
specifically was

539
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:33,658
is Hash still a big thing over there and

540
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,179
then as a follow-up are there any sort

541
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,640
of differences in the culture just even

542
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,640
regionally from say different areas in

543
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,799
different parts of Spain

544
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,840
he has been close to Morocco

545
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,038
the Spanish cannabis culture was all

546
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,158
about us

547
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:55,798
and then when when this first century

548
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,140
they grows they grow socks and the

549
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:02,099
genetics start to come from the people

550
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:06,538
start to grow indoors and

551
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:09,959
and then a very

552
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:13,859
a very thriving cannabis in industrious

553
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:17,159
started to to consolidate here

554
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:19,379
from from the seed banks from grocers

555
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,919
that are the small retailer to Big

556
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:26,299
wholesaler to fertilizer companies to

557
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:30,259
magazines to make an events

558
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:30,259
uh lawyers

559
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:39,000
and this everything everything there it

560
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:41,278
started 20 years ago or a bit more

561
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,119
but

562
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:47,400
it met when the Dutch season were going

563
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,479
down and we were just creating our

564
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,400
industry

565
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,759
so

566
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,278
yeah of course a few strong seed bank in

567
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:59,460
Holland it still remaining strong like

568
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:01,380
Greenhouse like that's passion and two

569
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,659
new ones very strong appear like Royal

570
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,778
Queen and bad news for example

571
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,880
but here in Spain

572
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:11,759
we were competing we were the Spanish

573
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,039
people managed to create companies that

574
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:17,278
were competing in products and in volume

575
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:20,819
of business with a Dutch company

576
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,200
and at all levels at all levels in a few

577
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:26,038
years

578
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,679
now after 20 years the the sector moves

579
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:32,460
a lot of millions creates a lot of

580
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:36,380
employment their legal legal companies

581
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,380
like Manda we pay a lot of taxes

582
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,440
um

583
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:43,019
so

584
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,419
the hearing Spain the weather is

585
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:47,579
extremely good and we are one of the

586
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:50,460
strongest countries in the world for

587
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:53,879
tourism we we are a population of less

588
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,700
than 50 and we have 70 80 millions of

589
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,059
tourists per year before covering

590
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:04,319
obviously a lot of people from from

591
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:06,058
England Germany Sweden when they retire

592
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,038
they buy a house here in Spain to live

593
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:11,759
because the weather the quality of life

594
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:13,440
is cheaper than lawful culture we have a

595
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,220
lot of different culture from the soul

596
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,980
the Mediterranean them the north the

597
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,100
central the the food is completely

598
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:27,179
different we are very tolerant we are

599
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:30,899
have a lot of uh yeah culture history we

600
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:33,538
we like a lot the party so this is the

601
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,759
perfect place so the tourists could come

602
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:38,579
and create a recreational marijuana

603
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,940
industry you know the they all come here

604
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:44,579
to to get drunk to enjoy the beach to to

605
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,919
all this is happening now with the Sofia

606
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:50,339
clubs in especially in Barcelona there

607
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,860
is more always the most tolerant city

608
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:55,859
than that is go ahead of us of the rest

609
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:58,259
of Spain but the model is not still

610
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,658
fully legal not for for the seed banks

611
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:02,220
not for the producer of the clubs not

612
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:05,460
for the clubs

613
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,558
is a very incomplete model that allows

614
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:12,659
to distribute seats

615
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:13,700
or companies is buy and sell seeds

616
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,880
legally

617
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,798
you you can make products oriented for

618
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,820
the Cannabis growing like the fertilizer

619
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:24,778
the

620
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:27,778
the lamps the soil Brands and all this

621
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:30,179
but still Spain is very very good very

622
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:31,919
very behind of the worldwide

623
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:35,100
legalization that is happening in North

624
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,580
America and Latin America now Uruguay

625
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:41,579
Colombia Mexico just now Ecuador also

626
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:45,178
legalizing uh

627
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:48,980
the in in Thailand just legalized in

628
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:51,538
many African countries we are realizing

629
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,360
Morocco to say two weeks ago that is

630
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:57,500
considering the legalization

631
00:29:53,359 --> 00:30:01,079
occurring in in in Europe

632
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:03,859
uh Germany has included marijuana and

633
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:07,379
the national health health system

634
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:12,119
so they are buying the legal marijuana

635
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:14,880
from the blps from Canada from Israel

636
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:17,398
so yes it's happening it's happening but

637
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:22,380
some countries Europe is is beginning

638
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:24,778
slow compared with with United States

639
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,200
with Latin America

640
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:30,500
or I think I think Australia and you

641
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,298
know we are very stupid

642
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,058
we

643
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:39,119
in our cases

644
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:41,579
is is terrible

645
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,979
I was gonna say yeah I mean Australia's

646
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:47,898
Got a cannabis program but it's probably

647
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,579
not not very good to be honest

648
00:30:47,898 --> 00:30:51,658
anyway I was wondering why because we

649
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:54,839
you know we're kind of talking about

650
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:58,200
hash you got me interested

651
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:00,720
which of your strains do you think makes

652
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,298
the best hash and then as a kind of

653
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,798
slightly different question which strain

654
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:09,599
has the largest trichome heads

655
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:14,398
for a section

656
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:16,278
the the best one there we have indicas

657
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,019
would be

658
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:19,740
which is

659
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:22,859
[Music]

660
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,380
this is not a very land race highway but

661
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:26,519
I like it so much and the customer like

662
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,559
it so much

663
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,839
that we offer

664
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:35,460
then the

665
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:37,819
the species also very nice for for us

666
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,819
and instruction

667
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,700
uh

668
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:44,058
the hash plan

669
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,339
and then the kalichina doesn't give so

670
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,919
much return but it gives a heart that is

671
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:54,599
very very special like very exotic

672
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,759
intense

673
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:59,639
the the China

674
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,200
quite different to to The Afghani houses

675
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,278
that are more common with the cookies

676
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,549
the orgies and the Bubba okay yeah and

677
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,819
then for for for Pakistani

678
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:12,178
[Music]

679
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:15,000
kind of Russian an extraction the the

680
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:19,380
Pakistan Violetta because it's very nice

681
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,679
that the trichomes really carry the the

682
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,200
the pigment the period the pigments so

683
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,659
when you you do the extraction and the

684
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,140
house the the house most of the time it

685
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:34,740
becomes purple or violet oh lovely

686
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,720
she has this this way is with Pakistan

687
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,339
Central Coast the purple dinosaur or

688
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,940
with Violetta

689
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:45,839
and this is quite interesting for

690
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:49,080
for Pakistani house and colorful houses

691
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,000
then here for moravity they already

692
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:54,240
recommend you

693
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,259
um for for CBD extraction CBD one

694
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,319
for sure is extremely resonance a very

695
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:03,480
good Philippines for extractions and if

696
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,579
you want to make CBD extraction on CBD

697
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,298
one is excellent

698
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:13,319
and we have sativas of

699
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:16,319
of that are very very resonance but

700
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:18,119
usually the the sativas

701
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:23,038
produce their

702
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:27,000
the the the Indica produce the

703
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:31,440
Russian more divided also in in the

704
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,880
bracks but also on the lips nearby the

705
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,820
the floor

706
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,380
the sativa concentrate much of the of of

707
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,538
the regime

708
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,899
on the on the black side not so much on

709
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:44,398
the leaf so for extraction they are not

710
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:46,739
so

711
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,959
so good in return

712
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,778
but we have sativa Domina and hybrids

713
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,919
that are very rationals but for example

714
00:33:51,778 --> 00:33:59,819
Panama Fern works very well Panama Cross

715
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,759
Banking Haze also Malawi cross Panama

716
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:05,398
5

717
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:08,398
summer Deli Cafe

718
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:11,819
foreign

719
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,019
golden tiger film they are very good for

720
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,820
extraction

721
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:17,878
with sativas

722
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,700
there you go some great answers there

723
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:23,039
I was interested I was browsing through

724
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:25,138
your catalog of strains on one of the

725
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,820
seed banks and I noticed there was one

726
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,579
that I'd never seen before called

727
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:33,179
Hokkaido and it says that it's like a

728
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,679
Japanese hemp that sounds very rare and

729
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,260
unique could you tell us a little bit

730
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,760
about that

731
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,599
yeah of course

732
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,619
this was a another genetic shot boy with

733
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,379
a grower

734
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:48,379
a person from from Japan contact me

735
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,539
um

736
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:57,599
um yeah I I didn't sound research

737
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:59,460
when trying to get a picture of of how

738
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,660
the the true land races were divided

739
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,880
around the world

740
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:05,000
and yes I read something about Japanese

741
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,358
strengths

742
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,838
but but it was not clear the information

743
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:15,598
if whether they were really secretive

744
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:18,838
Japanese cannabis strain like breathe

745
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:22,619
for with the secretive you for sure it

746
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:27,480
was used for for fiber

747
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:31,260
um ceremonial uses for for thousands of

748
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:35,280
years at least is documented in

749
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:37,760
yeah in their own read to us

750
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,240
and

751
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,520
and also for your for in the fabric for

752
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,799
the clothes they have a long tradition

753
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:49,320
of of

754
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,539
cultivating hemp

755
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,680
um

756
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:56,880
for I have a gather there was many many

757
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:59,879
hamper strains

758
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,400
all around the the Japan because Japan

759
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,980
you know

760
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,760
the the climates are quite different the

761
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,500
South

762
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,500
there are some islands that are almost

763
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:13,320
tropical and Hokkaido which is the north

764
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:17,239
part is an island on the North

765
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:21,720
is is very cold the Summers is is a very

766
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:24,000
natural research very beautiful place

767
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:28,078
and

768
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,599
it has short summer but but the the cold

769
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,000
weather comes very fast the Autumn is is

770
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,440
very short and the winter is very long

771
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,780
so

772
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,838
yeah it was difficult because it was not

773
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:43,380
properly documented

774
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:48,719
and and uh when after the second World

775
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:52,559
War uh Japan have to comply

776
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:56,159
follow the the loss from United States

777
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,739
no and at that time the already the

778
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,500
United States had the the loss regarding

779
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:02,459
the

780
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,139
marijuana

781
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,599
so

782
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,338
so I think they tried

783
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,260
many of the

784
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:12,358
of the

785
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,119
old Japanese campus strengths probably

786
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:17,159
have been eradicated around during these

787
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,599
years the previous decade is of

788
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:22,019
prohibition

789
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:24,960
and somewhat in in Hokkaido which is

790
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:26,420
some uh a Wilder place

791
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,300
uh

792
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:32,639
the the hemp has escaped from the

793
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,200
eradication program so although they try

794
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:35,159
because they already carry millions of

795
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,838
plants

796
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:40,379
generally

797
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:42,358
but yes a popular population of cannabis

798
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,858
managed to

799
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:48,659
to

800
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:51,980
drive without human

801
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:55,440
help there in Hokkaido

802
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:57,960
and I I contacted with with one Japanese

803
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,900
and he Italian

804
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,720
and what about Hokage I have some excuse

805
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,639
I can send you them we did uh exchange

806
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,199
and internet

807
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:12,299
and

808
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:14,338
I was quite excited about to see what

809
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,119
could come out

810
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:20,699
and when we grow the first week it was

811
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,579
quite in the quite exciting because it

812
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:25,039
grew like a houseplant Indica like

813
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:27,060
like

814
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:30,599
wild leaves

815
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:33,900
and looks like quite like a funny camera

816
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,838
like the indoor plants you know it

817
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:40,260
reminds me a lot like the Chinese indica

818
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,578
China Yunnan in in some ways remind me a

819
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:46,280
lot to

820
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:46,280
but still those in the gajas plan trades

821
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:50,640
um

822
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:53,900
and yes I have hopes that it could there

823
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:57,179
could be a executive Indica stream

824
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:01,400
but but it's not the the the first

825
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:04,739
population the the P1 plants we grill

826
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,838
uh to be honest we didn't grow it to the

827
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:10,618
to the best potential because the first

828
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:14,639
cycle uh we got a

829
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:18,000
a spider might infection so we had to

830
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:21,059
take clothes then we flower them again

831
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,159
outside but it was extremely hot it was

832
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:26,639
in summertime here I think I did they

833
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:29,279
didn't like much the the weather and the

834
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,739
samples didn't Express we brought them

835
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,940
to the lab and they were very similar

836
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:36,559
with

837
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,420
like a hamper strain I can like

838
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:43,578
0.5

839
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,579
of THC and 0.5 of CBD

840
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:49,920
was active okay it was not

841
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:52,799
a

842
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,338
but very recently

843
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,760
um

844
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:58,199
then we we all open pollinated because I

845
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,940
didn't we didn't receive many seats we

846
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:02,819
didn't have

847
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,940
um for what we we saw in the P1

848
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,338
generation I I didn't see any secret

849
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:12,119
active plan the plans were not rationals

850
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:16,259
but I smoke they don't get you high they

851
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:20,280
can navigate analysis where under one

852
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:23,820
so it looks songs and tastes

853
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,980
like a hemp stream so we open pollinated

854
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,380
we I think we only discard one plant

855
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,059
that was hermaphrodite but all the

856
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,039
plants the rest of the plant that was

857
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:33,299
actually stable way up and pollinated

858
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,880
and

859
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,440
of our first studies is okay this is

860
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,160
strain

861
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,740
I said okay we we released

862
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:45,899
that's not a problem is obviously we

863
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:48,299
it's not going to sell a lot because our

864
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,280
customers are more marijuana type but

865
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,599
the ganja tiger wants to to get high

866
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,260
with the flower

867
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,900
but it's interesting to

868
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,880
from the pressure

869
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:04,079
from the preservation side to to

870
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,240
contribute a new home cultivar that no

871
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,280
one knows that the the Japanese and the

872
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:14,399
Japanese have had a very prohibitionist

873
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,380
since since the second world war so they

874
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,079
don't comment anything about their

875
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,780
Japanese strengths or they can be

876
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,760
secretive there are some studies quite

877
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,720
those

878
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,920
um

879
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:31,319
and a one year by some laundry is

880
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,639
Growers they say yeah Japanese well

881
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,099
that's interesting I'm going to buy you

882
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,920
some bags and it's an idea more because

883
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,500
from the preservation side and because

884
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,858
it's really exotic you know right then

885
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,820
it's secretive potential and one grower

886
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:49,019
that

887
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:51,260
grill or the the p2's generation we will

888
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:51,259
release

889
00:41:53,838 --> 00:42:01,099
with no relevant secretive or terpenic

890
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,800
value

891
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:06,019
and and one grower the agree of a few

892
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,880
packs

893
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:12,000
phone a few resinous plant and a few

894
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:16,820
plants that were smelling really good

895
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,820
from from a field of thousands

896
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,639
um

897
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:24,899
um he brought into the lab

898
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:27,618
and one of them had 10 percent of CBD

899
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,900
and five percent of THC

900
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:33,240
very good

901
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:35,579
number and the others were

902
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,439
and the other is interesting were very

903
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:40,500
low in Tac

904
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,780
but a bit but a bit of Civility

905
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,019
and then the third type that was like

906
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,740
the one we found like him like

907
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:51,838
very low TLC I'm very low CV so you

908
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:53,639
really saw the

909
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,460
the uh

910
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:59,039
if we look for in first that the the

911
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,318
string has the potential to to be

912
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,440
more relevant for for their parents and

913
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:07,440
cannabinoids and with a bit of work

914
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,659
working to to this plan to to this kind

915
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,940
of camel type with more content we can

916
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:14,578
make it even secretive

917
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,318
but it will need like by Crossing to

918
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:18,060
this type of plants

919
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,519
then in breathe

920
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:23,699
remember line one two three generation

921
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:26,639
and and then fix fix it to do something

922
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:30,000
more selective or something

923
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,980
only with CBD but most CBD it can be

924
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,559
done yeah you give a

925
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,659
a more interesting value to this line

926
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,219
and it was we chose Discovery like two

927
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:40,219
three months ago thanks to a customer

928
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,180
actually had a chance to to agree with a

929
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:50,159
few thousands

930
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:53,460
and realize that there are a few higher

931
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:56,159
potential to be selective so who knows

932
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:58,858
I'm I'm in touch with him maybe we

933
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,659
collaborate to to hopefully increase the

934
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:03,358
economy new Enterprise

935
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:06,179
of this yeah but definitely the

936
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:10,019
potential to do it yeah yeah wow how

937
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:12,239
interesting maybe a future offering from

938
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:15,780
the Japanese hemp strain that's very

939
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:18,179
cool so you mentioned preservation in

940
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,220
there and it kind of got me thinking

941
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:23,818
about a question I've been thinking

942
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:26,578
about for years now which is for someone

943
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:30,599
like yourself who's looking to get pure

944
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:33,839
land race stock what does the future of

945
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:37,079
preservation look like to you in regards

946
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:40,619
to land race considering most people

947
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,140
kind of say oh you know you can't find

948
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:45,900
that pure anymore even if you go to the

949
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:48,000
real it's all polluted now what do you

950
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,220
think land race preservation is going to

951
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,920
be like going forward

952
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:54,000
the thing obviously many things has been

953
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,900
lost

954
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,400
that's that's true but many things are

955
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,300
left

956
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:05,599
many things are left more than the

957
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,599
indoor Kush

958
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:12,240
waiting for us to to

959
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,539
yeah I I think

960
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:18,479
that that is a pessimistic

961
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:21,480
way to see it yeah I agree that very

962
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,639
interesting lands have been lost

963
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,039
then you're not going to do anything to

964
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:28,679
to to Really find out

965
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:30,420
how many good ones are left and to try

966
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:32,039
to preserve

967
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,599
what is left

968
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:35,599
you are going to stop there only

969
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,160
I I don't understand this attitude

970
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,260
um

971
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:49,500
is is difficult because preservation

972
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:53,299
[Music]

973
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:56,159
how it has grown up the the recreational

974
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:59,339
and the industry

975
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:03,179
doesn't give money in the future we'll

976
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:06,480
mean long term when this gets when this

977
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:09,960
industry gets more complicated when the

978
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,539
genetic engineering starts when only big

979
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,940
companies that have this knowledge these

980
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:18,199
machines disqualified people

981
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,200
these patterns

982
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:23,818
will available

983
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,539
for that for that profile of companies

984
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:31,440
then the the different genotypes that

985
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:34,579
that the land races and and the temples

986
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,579
that we are not looking at

987
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,139
these are the the temple that that will

988
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,719
be very important and with a lot of

989
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:45,420
value for for these big companies

990
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:47,159
okay but it means long term

991
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,579
at the moment

992
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:52,858
and for the small companies

993
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:56,160
it has very little value

994
00:46:52,858 --> 00:47:00,779
because what is the big Trend the Kush

995
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:04,199
the cookies this is 80 of the business

996
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:07,920
this is 80 of the business so if you

997
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:09,899
concentrate in if you want to make money

998
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,500
you need to concentrate on this that's

999
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:16,260
why that span the seed banks are coping

1000
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,539
USA and the Spanish is that I'll also

1001
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,359
coping USA because it's the next big

1002
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:24,380
thing in USA is already there

1003
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,380
you know that

1004
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:31,799
and the only way to

1005
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:33,239
the the commercial gentle is all hash

1006
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,519
cookies

1007
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:38,219
you could you can call it with other

1008
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,338
name across it with other name and give

1009
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:44,639
it another twist so it looks slightly

1010
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:46,199
better but it's a very narrow part of

1011
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,900
the Temple

1012
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,519
and the potential and the qualities of

1013
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,619
the cannabis

1014
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:55,679
so

1015
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:58,380
for me preservation I I saw it since the

1016
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,980
beginning first as a passion for me to

1017
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:04,740
learn to to where is the roots in the

1018
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:08,039
hybrid we should we we find it all mixed

1019
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:10,379
but where this the taste of the uh of

1020
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:12,960
the scan cane where the intents of the

1021
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:16,200
haste came where the color of this came

1022
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,800
to understand all this from from their

1023
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:21,358
Roots what what land races give give

1024
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,400
these traits

1025
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,858
and for me it was passionate for me it

1026
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,200
was obvious that it has an immense

1027
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:30,380
genetic value something that can give

1028
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,379
you

1029
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,179
something new

1030
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:37,920
if you're always repeating the same it's

1031
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:41,279
very it's very difficult that you came

1032
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,619
out with something entirely new one that

1033
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:48,319
that can make a new Revolution on the

1034
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:48,318
cannabis you know in science

1035
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,500
um

1036
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:55,979
if you are always repeating the same you

1037
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,559
always finish on on the same

1038
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:02,099
if you want to reach to new territories

1039
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:05,219
you must start from from new things and

1040
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,660
for that the the land races and

1041
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:08,358
obviously it's there

1042
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:11,279
the the

1043
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:13,980
source of the all the genetic diversity

1044
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,280
we enjoyed right now

1045
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:20,539
is the repository of this of the genetic

1046
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,280
diversity all these genetic

1047
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:27,599
widespread especially in countries like

1048
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:30,599
Indian Nepal Afghanistan Pakistan

1049
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,539
that they have such

1050
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:37,140
cannabis code so for hundreds centuries

1051
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:38,639
in so many parts

1052
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:41,159
is

1053
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:43,019
incredible the genetic diversity so

1054
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:45,440
Stalone India Nepal Afghanistan and

1055
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:45,440
Pakistan

1056
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,880
um the other social Revolution that are

1057
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,940
that have been happening

1058
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,940
with their autoflowing Revolution the

1059
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:00,720
CBD Revolution all these were trades

1060
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:05,519
that weren't very obvious and easy to to

1061
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:08,098
get from from Land races from the out of

1062
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,980
Floridian from the Eastern hemp for

1063
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:16,079
example on the Russian

1064
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:18,240
and the CBD from from the the house plan

1065
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,359
laundry School diverse while the

1066
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,358
hospital

1067
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:27,079
the

1068
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,079
Lebanese the Pakistani

1069
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:33,780
so the potential to find new things new

1070
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:35,338
Canary noise neuter pins

1071
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:40,440
will come

1072
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:42,420
most probably from the the this the

1073
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,559
Temple of the land race was probably

1074
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:50,400
rather than the bottleneck

1075
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:53,159
Jam pulled the the American industry

1076
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:57,900
Industries driving the gentle nowadays

1077
00:50:53,159 --> 00:51:00,299
yeah great answer to a complex question

1078
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,039
while we're talking about genetics a

1079
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,920
different viewer wanted to know and I

1080
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:07,920
was interested as well what sort of

1081
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,720
Lebanese stock do you work with and how

1082
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,659
would you describe it to people our

1083
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:15,419
listener was wondering how often does

1084
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:19,639
the red phenotype versus the blonde

1085
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,639
phenotype show up in the regular seeds

1086
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:29,039
yeah um they are some some people

1087
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:32,460
I I think most of our audience knows but

1088
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:33,058
I think it's going good to point it out

1089
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,599
um

1090
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:37,619
you usually people as you said or

1091
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,960
connect

1092
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:42,300
has with him because right

1093
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,940
with afani Pakistan you know

1094
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,380
but

1095
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,139
many of the traditional hashes I

1096
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,358
produced from sativas

1097
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:55,139
the the most

1098
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:58,318
excellent cases are the the Chara

1099
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:59,460
sativas the The Nepalese and the north

1100
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,259
Indians

1101
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:05,099
okay

1102
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:07,260
but also the the Morocco the Morocco has

1103
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:10,500
and the Lebanese has that is used

1104
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:13,020
following the dry safe methods using in

1105
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,900
Pakistan in Afghanistan and Pakistan

1106
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:18,719
are sativas

1107
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,300
people confuse and they um

1108
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:24,000
uh

1109
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,260
yeah for for some people it's difficult

1110
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,420
to understand that

1111
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,780
the

1112
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:34,740
Moroccan and the Lebanese

1113
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:37,380
the the Lebanese population we we offer

1114
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:41,039
from United States

1115
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:43,140
came from from a friend from Israel that

1116
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:46,139
in the 90s he

1117
00:52:43,139 --> 00:52:47,400
there in Israel is very racy to get live

1118
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:49,440
on his house

1119
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,358
but not so common to to get with but

1120
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,380
sometimes he got away from the Bedouins

1121
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,019
that

1122
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,818
that were smugly and so on some products

1123
00:52:55,019 --> 00:53:00,179
and with us you know

1124
00:52:56,818 --> 00:53:02,639
and and then he saved the the seeds and

1125
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:03,899
he came to to live to spam for a few

1126
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:06,358
years

1127
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:09,480
and we get we keep in touch and he's

1128
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:13,799
here with us with um

1129
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:16,440
this is of this leverness

1130
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,260
and it was working mainly by by a friend

1131
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,858
of mine called raspablo who who is the

1132
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,859
first generation

1133
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:26,639
um

1134
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:29,760
and yes yes

1135
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:33,480
is assativa completely adapted to the

1136
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,480
dry and hot climate of of Lebanon is is

1137
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,480
extremely

1138
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:45,599
resistant against heat and lack of water

1139
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:48,479
we did a test here outside putting some

1140
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,700
Lebanese plants in a pot

1141
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,079
that usually plants in a pod literature

1142
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:56,399
is easier

1143
00:53:52,079 --> 00:54:01,140
uh hearing some time for in in Spain 40

1144
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:04,380
degrees and add exit of the aircon

1145
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:06,659
so the plans were receiving in the sun

1146
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:09,420
40 degrees and the and the Heat of the

1147
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:13,039
aircon we understand

1148
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,039
and and with other plants

1149
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:18,680
after one year the indoor Afghani were

1150
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,858
or

1151
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:21,858
fading down

1152
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:29,520
you know

1153
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:31,858
yes I he saw you how how resistant this

1154
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:37,199
the these genetics these genetics are

1155
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:40,679
and in the in the very one generation we

1156
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:43,799
um there were not much is like 30 or

1157
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:49,199
something and my friend reproduced the

1158
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:52,500
line in in in in a few Cycles

1159
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:55,460
using a small population but but always

1160
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:59,099
removing the the

1161
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,960
rmaphrodites and and using a a very nice

1162
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:05,338
female in every cycle with different

1163
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,920
females so we came up with uh three lots

1164
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:10,619
from the same males that were pollinated

1165
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,200
with many different males in each lot

1166
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:15,318
for the P2 for the second generation

1167
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,899
then we uh

1168
00:55:15,318 --> 00:55:21,480
we grew like 100 we put only three loads

1169
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:25,220
this is the silver Bulgarian all and we

1170
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:28,858
put all 100 plants and again a lot of

1171
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:30,558
hermaphrodites uh

1172
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:33,420
we came up

1173
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:39,800
throwing jelly

1174
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:39,800
40 from the 40 50 plants

1175
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:46,039
yes and 11 is also has a a a a high male

1176
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,338
radio

1177
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:53,159
11s usually produce quite a lot of Mace

1178
00:55:50,338 --> 00:55:55,619
yeah well after removing males and

1179
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:59,279
hermaphrodite we left with

1180
00:55:55,619 --> 00:56:04,380
30 40 females but we managed to found

1181
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:07,079
sexually stable if females and males the

1182
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,720
two men the two phenotypes one more

1183
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:14,339
sativa with long nose that takes longer

1184
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:17,719
to flower in 70 days 74 indoors a bigger

1185
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:21,119
gelding more branchy type

1186
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:24,679
uh thinner lips but they're still big

1187
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,680
they have with more

1188
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,500
Tangy

1189
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:34,920
trick mango free liter pins and then

1190
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:37,440
there's all the other uh fennel there is

1191
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:41,240
a smaller more columnar faster flowering

1192
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:46,139
55 days fluorine or so and more colorful

1193
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:46,139
indoors it turns purple radish

1194
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,539
is not so fruity

1195
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:56,219
yeah I prefer the effects of the long

1196
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:58,019
and the The Taste and the effects of the

1197
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:01,980
long flowering and the interesting thing

1198
00:56:58,019 --> 00:57:06,539
of the Lebanese is is that most of the

1199
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,619
plants produce uh both THC and CBD they

1200
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:09,358
are rich in both

1201
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:14,900
okay uh

1202
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:19,199
like for example we found like a balance

1203
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:22,280
one to one chemotypes seven percent TSC

1204
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:25,279
seven percent CBD

1205
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:30,859
then uh

1206
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:34,760
once with very little THC like 0.5 and

1207
00:57:30,858 --> 00:57:34,759
16 of CBD

1208
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:40,259
and

1209
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:41,220
um radius of one to three like

1210
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,380
four percent

1211
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:47,699
[Music]

1212
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:53,160
uh THC to 12 percent CDD

1213
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:55,019
one radius of one two TSC CBD

1214
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:59,639
it's very interesting

1215
00:57:55,019 --> 00:58:03,119
the the main interest of the Lebanese is

1216
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:06,420
there is a new source for CBD it has

1217
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,880
many interesting Rich CBD chemotypes and

1218
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,039
also somewhere

1219
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,960
with CV

1220
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,259
is a

1221
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,338
very resistant for for other places

1222
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,940
where

1223
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:24,119
with water restriction with with a lot

1224
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,119
of heat

1225
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:31,799
uh

1226
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:33,780
and use that and and people really like

1227
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,720
the the effects here

1228
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,819
many girls really like the effects it's

1229
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:41,759
not and it's not very strong it's the

1230
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:42,480
potency is soft moderate because it also

1231
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,540
has

1232
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,219
CBD but it's really Pleasant very really

1233
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:49,380
happy clear

1234
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:53,098
yeah that sounds lovely

1235
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:56,358
always wanting to ask you what land race

1236
00:58:53,099 --> 00:58:59,400
genetics do you think are

1237
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:02,699
underrepresented within the Cannabis

1238
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,798
culture so to speak for me I always

1239
00:59:02,699 --> 00:59:07,558
think about Haze and how there's

1240
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:09,239
supposedly some Indian genetics in there

1241
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:12,780
and I think to myself you never hear

1242
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:15,000
about Indian what to you do you think is

1243
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:17,160
really underrepresented

1244
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,798
as you know they are

1245
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:25,199
the main recreational gentle

1246
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:27,780
comes from genetics that hybrids that

1247
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:31,679
were developing in United States

1248
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:34,160
okay so the

1249
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:37,558
the the the

1250
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:40,019
language the languages that were used to

1251
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:43,079
to develop these hybrids

1252
00:59:40,019 --> 00:59:45,838
depended a lot on the land races that

1253
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:47,400
the people in the United States receive

1254
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:51,078
obviously

1255
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:53,579
so yeah yeah at the end but

1256
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:55,859
they they enjoyed the state they work

1257
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:58,200
mainly with Mexican

1258
00:59:55,858 --> 01:00:00,078
with Colombia

1259
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:02,879
and

1260
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:05,818
Thai a bit lesser

1261
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,338
I'm with Havanese

1262
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:10,980
that's the main Temple that

1263
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:13,500
the

1264
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,679
does the land races the

1265
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:19,019
that are more prevalent in today's

1266
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:21,480
modern Western recreational

1267
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:24,059
to change it so the ones that are

1268
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,500
underrated and we should put more

1269
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:28,559
attention to

1270
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:31,019
is is for example the The Amazing World

1271
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:34,640
The erasening of Indian Lander and

1272
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:34,639
Brandy exchange is doing

1273
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,358
yeah

1274
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:42,118
to look

1275
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:43,858
and what we will have uh discussed

1276
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:45,420
previously that India and nepalis

1277
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:48,779
probably and Afghanistan and Pakistan

1278
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:52,500
the most interesting places for to look

1279
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:57,960
for biggest diversity oldest land races

1280
01:00:52,500 --> 01:01:02,280
with other culture and more variety

1281
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:05,220
and I I think yes the Indian Land races

1282
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,200
The Nepalese land races are not very

1283
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:09,358
prevalent in in the gym pool that people

1284
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,818
are smoking nowadays

1285
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:15,058
and

1286
01:01:10,818 --> 01:01:16,159
regarding indicas uh is is mainly a

1287
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:20,599
funny

1288
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:25,139
maybe some some Pakistani also made into

1289
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:29,700
the North American Temple but uh I think

1290
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:31,798
is mostly Afghani and Pakistan also has

1291
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:34,679
very interesting indicas

1292
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:36,900
to to offer and there are other very

1293
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:38,818
interesting indicates in countries like

1294
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:42,660
Uzbekistan

1295
01:01:38,818 --> 01:01:45,058
yeah interesting stuff for sure

1296
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:47,338
so the next thing I wanted to ask you

1297
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:50,339
about was something which a lot of fans

1298
01:01:47,338 --> 01:01:52,798
asked me to follow up with you

1299
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:55,798
do you ever plan to have any sort of

1300
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,719
Partnerships with any U.S seed banks I

1301
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:59,759
think there's a lot of us Growers that

1302
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:02,598
really want your gear but maybe find it

1303
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,599
hard to get it

1304
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:08,700
the

1305
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,179
they are it's legalized on a federal

1306
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:14,759
level we will try to establish there are

1307
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:17,779
a legal business and to look for

1308
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:21,660
partners there

1309
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:24,059
I don't think right now is the moment

1310
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:26,519
I have friends and

1311
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:30,180
working there

1312
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:32,639
the the half Hemi with with selections

1313
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:34,980
and I appreciate a lot

1314
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,719
but we never talked about making

1315
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,780
business there

1316
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:42,539
and now we're with we have so many

1317
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,400
retailers that see worldwide I

1318
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:47,338
understand that the people in the United

1319
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,798
States very used to to have the the

1320
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:52,019
problem very easy to access it within

1321
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:55,139
United States on our list

1322
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:56,940
but well even in this

1323
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:58,818
globalized world the things are not

1324
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:02,539
always so easy

1325
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:06,539
especially regarding customs

1326
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:08,539
and So to avoid problems that we don't

1327
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:11,338
want problems

1328
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:14,039
uh at this time

1329
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:16,259
we're not shipping to

1330
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:18,239
to United States but I don't think it

1331
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:20,579
will take much time I want to legalize

1332
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:23,939
federally

1333
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:26,460
um and once we do a few steps here to to

1334
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:29,159
get fighter certificates for

1335
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:31,559
for an exportation of the seats I think

1336
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:34,920
they won't have any

1337
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:38,220
any complaint to to Donald allo the

1338
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:42,440
importation of the she's there I should

1339
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:47,159
be without any problem and fluently

1340
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:49,380
uh until now I would recommend to anyone

1341
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:51,480
interested to look in the in the many

1342
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,358
retailers that see worldwide

1343
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,940
we don't do it because we want to

1344
01:03:54,358 --> 01:04:00,259
to to

1345
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:00,260
be quite a strict with a look here

1346
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,798
um

1347
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,000
but many retailers are shipping

1348
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,280
everywhere

1349
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,059
and

1350
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,059
it's very easy

1351
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:15,960
yeah having been able to get some of

1352
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,700
your seeds of myself I'll let people

1353
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,858
know it is possible to get them via

1354
01:04:17,699 --> 01:04:22,259
other means

1355
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:24,838
uh speaking of Australia I wanted to ask

1356
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,780
you are you familiar with the Australian

1357
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:31,619
bastard cannabis plant

1358
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:33,540
no no not much uh not much have you seen

1359
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:35,720
photos

1360
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:38,818
as you know the uh

1361
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:41,338
we're actually at the other part of the

1362
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:42,840
world yeah in Spain we say if you make a

1363
01:04:41,338 --> 01:04:45,440
holiday you will appear in

1364
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:51,059
[Laughter]

1365
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:54,119
so yeah for us Australia it's like woof

1366
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:58,740
this is super far super far so it's it's

1367
01:04:54,119 --> 01:05:01,260
not something that that we have in in

1368
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:03,419
our cannabis culture I remember when we

1369
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,400
in overgrown when when some of the

1370
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:09,079
Australian Growers start to join also

1371
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:14,298
the the mulu Batman the showing some

1372
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:18,059
Madness of five kilos plants that

1373
01:05:14,298 --> 01:05:18,920
were amazing yeah I remember some very

1374
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:22,740
very

1375
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:25,579
clear Australian Growers and then I knew

1376
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:25,578
about the um

1377
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:37,440
no a lot of the stick arrived in the 70s

1378
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,059
and 80s there so you have a very good

1379
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,059
Saturday

1380
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:44,819
the purple name being I have hair and

1381
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:47,579
scene but never smoke to be honest so

1382
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:51,119
it's a Pity but I think it's just

1383
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:54,059
because the distance and because uh at

1384
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,519
the end the Australian hybrids didn't

1385
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:59,460
make it into the Dutch genetics or the

1386
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:03,059
North America genetics and it's a Pity

1387
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:07,199
because many people say very good things

1388
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:09,480
about about me Madness so I

1389
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:12,480
don't understand how

1390
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:15,260
after so many years Noah came up with a

1391
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:18,539
good representation of of

1392
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:20,940
that that could be spreaded around the

1393
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:23,519
world so people can get a tote of the

1394
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:25,099
fine flowers and breads from the

1395
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,900
Australian Growers

1396
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:32,099
it's really a Pity that but it was

1397
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:34,500
obviously a result of the prohibition is

1398
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:36,780
it's just like that

1399
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,699
no you got a very valid point there it's

1400
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:41,160
surprising no one's really locked down

1401
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:44,038
the mullumbimby madness

1402
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:46,139
I did want to ask you I know that you

1403
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:48,420
grow organically and we're very

1404
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:51,358
passionate about helping people to grow

1405
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:54,240
organically on the show what sort of

1406
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:56,880
grow style do you use do you just use

1407
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:59,098
basic amendments and you just mix it in

1408
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:03,059
do you do no-till give us a bit of a

1409
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:05,280
rundown on how you grow plants

1410
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:06,240
this is

1411
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,880
yeah

1412
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:12,058
for 20 more than 20 years following the

1413
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,700
the same soil mix recipe I'm a soil

1414
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:18,920
grower I'm an organic grower

1415
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:25,019
I love the outdoor buds over indoor

1416
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:28,380
and I am I always use this I uh we get a

1417
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:31,500
very high quality high quality bit from

1418
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:35,160
Cooperative here in in Spain and we have

1419
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:37,500
been buying the speed for 25 years and

1420
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:41,219
it's always the same um basically we put

1421
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:45,838
like 80 90 percent of the speed then 10

1422
01:07:41,219 --> 01:07:49,439
of very high quality warm costume then

1423
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:51,719
a bit of formal of one of these

1424
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,519
depending of the strain on the stage

1425
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:57,538
and the transplant

1426
01:07:53,519 --> 01:08:00,119
more for flowering the the wano and and

1427
01:07:57,539 --> 01:08:02,160
a bit of cocoa if this if it's a strain

1428
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:05,940
that is slow with the roots

1429
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:09,358
or if we want to speed up the first whip

1430
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:12,019
the first weeks a bit more of cocoa and

1431
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:12,019
this

1432
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:20,940
organic fertilizer we use to Branch the

1433
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:24,059
hearings in Europe are very very well

1434
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:25,439
known is Canada the the organic line the

1435
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:29,100
biocana

1436
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:31,858
which is basically and Cana Flores and

1437
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:34,679
their risottonic which is marvelous for

1438
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:37,859
for transplants

1439
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:40,338
uh and then also it's very nice I like a

1440
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:44,219
lot of the the

1441
01:08:40,338 --> 01:08:49,579
obese there'll be a grow be a blonde

1442
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:53,640
your face uh the phase one

1443
01:08:49,579 --> 01:08:57,298
use this one for 25 years and

1444
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:59,219
and that's all I love the taste or on

1445
01:08:57,298 --> 01:09:00,838
the feeling and the vibration of how

1446
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:02,880
they came out

1447
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:05,039
yeah I don't need anything more yeah

1448
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,298
there's room for improvement regarding

1449
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:09,439
you

1450
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:14,179
but I don't like to use chemical it

1451
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:18,778
makes very natural The Taste and harsh

1452
01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:20,759
and gives a bad negative uh vibration

1453
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:23,819
that I don't like in the if I like a

1454
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:25,679
toxic feeling in the height I don't like

1455
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:29,279
um and also I don't use much of these

1456
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:31,920
new era flowering stimulators that the

1457
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:37,259
yeah yeah yeah

1458
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:39,420
more more more I just use and uh basic

1459
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:40,979
organic fertilizer for fluorine and the

1460
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:45,420
soil

1461
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:47,818
no not bad Busters and all these no

1462
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:49,399
there you go keeping it simple I like

1463
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:52,199
that

1464
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:53,879
so the next question I wanted to ask you

1465
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:57,119
was

1466
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,980
do you have any seeds in your stash that

1467
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,500
you're really excited to look through

1468
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:05,779
next like what's the next thing you're

1469
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,779
excited to look on to look into

1470
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:09,738
how it is

1471
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:25,500
one of my colleagues got from hippie a

1472
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:29,100
Spanish Kitty that lives there for four

1473
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:31,979
decades and we have done a couple of

1474
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:34,440
generations of this cash plan from from

1475
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:37,319
Kashmir and it's very interesting

1476
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:40,500
there's job to do because

1477
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:43,198
there are different chemo types there

1478
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:45,719
are solar air means but there are some

1479
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:50,819
very interesting expression like very

1480
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:52,920
rationals why leave the colors very

1481
01:10:50,819 --> 01:10:55,859
interesting their pins

1482
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:57,779
and yeah it's quite interesting this

1483
01:10:55,859 --> 01:11:02,939
this question here

1484
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:05,158
then some some sativa seeds that are a

1485
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:08,339
friend of mine that is a sailor brought

1486
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:11,579
me from the Caribe in from San Martin

1487
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:14,480
island it's a very very small island in

1488
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:14,479
the Caribbean

1489
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:21,179
after going across the whole Atlantic

1490
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:24,000
that he finished all the joints

1491
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:24,960
and they they reached to San Martin

1492
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,460
first

1493
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,119
in America

1494
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:33,480
we we in and then she was in touch with

1495
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:37,738
with Rasta there that was growing super

1496
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:40,979
crazy sativas like things live like

1497
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:43,079
needles my friend told me that's what

1498
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:46,439
went off to me like

1499
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:47,579
I I go Tropical from the career the

1500
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:50,819
Caribbean

1501
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:52,500
the dog doesn't contain indicator simply

1502
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:56,099
contaminated

1503
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,899
then I have some interesting Colombia

1504
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:02,120
song

1505
01:11:57,899 --> 01:12:02,119
the the one Chilean

1506
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,140
he used to work for the encode do you

1507

1557
01:14:29,579 --> 01:14:34,579
there will be a lot of demand for that

01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:49,679
plants give you

01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:07,800
Growers willing to grow a sativa that

1568
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:10,519
take four or five months to flower

1569
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:14,300
these are very very easy

small Market yeah only the hardcore okay

1571
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:19,560
well while we're talking about long

1572
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:24,480
flowering sativas I really wanted to ask

1573
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:26,940
you about how you got the old-timer Haze

1574
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:30,000
how did that go about and how would you

1575
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:32,519
describe the Old Timer had it

1576
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,219
yeah the ultimate cases are a very

1577
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:39,980
unique line

1578
01:15:34,219 --> 01:15:45,000
is one of the most extreme tropical

1579
01:15:39,979 --> 01:15:48,658
sativa I ever had a pleasure to to

1580
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,658
experience is

1581
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:53,399
um

1582
01:15:50,819 --> 01:15:56,880
I don't know how to describe the Finnish

1583
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:59,719
priorities is like it comes from two

1584
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,719
centuries ago

1585
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:06,719
if you saw a battle for the timer has to

1586
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:11,719
to all this cookies guys and all this

1587
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:15,840
they they don't know how to to take it

1588
01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:17,279
but that is is like completely different

1589
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,480
thing is

1590
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:24,059
two hundred percent sativa you cross all

1591
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:30,139
timers with an indica and they all

1592
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:30,140
called still 100 sativa and you know

1593
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:39,300
is really extreme he's very tropical

1594
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:40,439
from safe it could take six months to

1595
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:44,279
flower

1596
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:48,359
and the Clones we have are really old we

1597
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:48,359
are 15 years old so

1598
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:54,419
a bit faster

1599
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:57,060
but yeah they are very very wild very

1600
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:59,760
very well

1601
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:02,039
what do you know about to know more

1602
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:05,340
specifically about Old Timers I guess

1603
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:08,340
something I'm interested in is how did

1604
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:10,619
you get that stock from Old Timer and

1605
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:13,679
how do the different phenotypes differ

1606
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:16,319
is it mostly just the color or is are

1607
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:18,779
they actually quite different the the

1608
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:20,579
old timer has a

1609
01:17:18,779 --> 01:17:23,579
there are two main finals the green and

1610
01:17:20,579 --> 01:17:26,279
the Purple Haze okay

1611
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:27,000
um they are grow and flower almost the

1612
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:29,279
same

1613
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,920
the the difference is

1614
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,719
only in the second half of flowering and

1615
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,300
in the finished product

1616
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:38,340
but during the whole growth early

1617
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,659
flowering

1618
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,699
they look

1619
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:43,738
essentially green

1620
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:46,678
okay

1621
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:50,000
if if you live in a call in a if they

1622
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:53,699
are grown in outdoors in a cold weather

1623
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,359
usually in October with the cold nights

1624
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:59,399
the the colorful

1625
01:17:56,359 --> 01:18:01,920
phenotypes start to show okay not

1626
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:06,719
usually showing a bit of the purple

1627
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:10,560
veins the red red reddish tones

1628
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,939
okay uh and depending how cold is your

1629
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,699
weather

1630
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:18,119
yeah it's just me that the through the

1631
01:18:14,698 --> 01:18:22,139
flowering the the nights are lower than

1632
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:25,920
15 degree so this happened in yesterday

1633
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:29,820
in tropics and subtropica it happened in

1634
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:32,279
in in most temperate latitudes even with

1635
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:34,259
good climate like the Mediterranean

1636
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:37,259
so so yes

1637
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:39,060
um regarding finished product the the

1638
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:43,320
green cases

1639
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:46,020
super clean Super euphoric

1640
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:48,599
and it's it's a bit like the the like

1641
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:51,000
the New Caledonia just the smoke that

1642
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:53,820
you feel everything more

1643
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,579
Amplified you are more alive

1644
01:18:53,819 --> 01:18:59,880
okay is

1645
01:18:56,579 --> 01:19:01,140
and you want to do things like you have

1646
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,920
a lot of energy

1647
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:06,000
okay the purple hay and and the green

1648
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,640
Haze

1649
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:13,340
smell like

1650
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:18,360
an ancient world spices

1651
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:19,440
their incense I I I like to to describe

1652
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:22,439
it like

1653
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:24,198
like uh the backpack of a Backpacker

1654
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:27,479
after

1655
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:30,299
traveling one month in India and coming

1656
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:32,000
back with with infants and spices and

1657
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:35,760
all the dirty clothes

1658
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:38,399
something something like that is is the

1659
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,219
smell of the of the or the other

1660

alternative is a Green Inferno there's

1661
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:45,060
some

1662
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:47,399
and here's the green case even with cold

1663
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:51,179
temperatures even fresh in terms is

1664
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:54,119
completely ripe green then the Purple

1665
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:56,480
Haze with the colder nights in October

1666
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:59,760
November December

01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,819
um

1670
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:07,199
yeah usually they saw a mix of red and

1671
01:20:05,819 --> 01:20:11,099
purple

1672
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:17,399

fennel have more like red wine Brandy

1674
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:24,000
kind of alcoholic serpentes uh more

1675
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:28,679
Berry

1676
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,679
uh Blackberry strawberry

1677
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:39,140
the smoke is also very very terrible

1678
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:42,300
is all in the head

1679
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:43,800
but it's more introspective than the

1680
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,119
Green Hills

1681
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,520
okay

1682
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:50,039
and how did you get the seed stock

1683
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,280
initially

1684
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:55,260
okay the the Seas came from from

1685
01:20:53,279 --> 01:21:00,380
Alzheimer which is

1686
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:00,380
one of the Pioneers breeders in in UK

1687
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:01,859
[Music]

1688
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,739
um

1689
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:05,939
he's an old person and he was in touch

1690
01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:08,698
with

1691
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:10,799
with the the first marijuana movement

1692
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:12,539
and the the first hip is traveling and

1693
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:15,840
I'm exchanging series

1694
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:18,479
that came from

1695
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:21,900
from Asia

1696
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:24,899
so he also traveled to United States

1697
01:21:21,899 --> 01:21:24,899
lines

1698
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:29,939
uh

1699
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:33,179
that he collected himself that are not

1700
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:35,519
the rebelt from some school man

1701
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:37,140
at least directly I don't know

1702
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,179
oh yeah you know that all the original

1703
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:45,320
Haze is the the haze the sun is

1704
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:45,319
like this to Holland

1705
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:53,059
um this is supposedly uh

1706
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:53,059
a pure case line

1707
01:21:53,179 --> 01:21:58,980
collected by All Time and another person

1708
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,460
and that has been preserved parallel to

1709
01:21:58,979 --> 01:22:02,658
original yes

1710
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:06,239
[Music]

1711
01:22:02,658 --> 01:22:10,019
told me that he had three lines but

1712
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:13,079
because he gave away to people to

1713
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:16,440
reproduce but never no one did at the

1714
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:18,539
end he he lost it and he he used to

1715
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:20,339
breathe in UK so he can only breathe

1716
01:22:18,539 --> 01:22:23,158
indoors

1717
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:24,719
so the whole timer were too too extreme

1718
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:27,139
for

1719
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,140
for

1720
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:32,039
the breeding goals

1721
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,920
and needs

1722
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:38,640
so he made a few hybrids with with it

1723
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,719
but he ended up losing his his pure his

1724
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,179
population

1725
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:45,119
are the only one person that

1726
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:47,819
that was called Pacific

1727
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:48,840
was one one of the persons that received

1728
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:51,599
the

1729
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:55,560
pure seeds from from

1730
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:57,920
him from Alzheimer and he did a small

1731
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,900
reproduction

1732
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:04,319
he gave Oasis to

1733
01:23:00,899 --> 01:23:06,899
in Canary's world I think it was yes to

1734
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:09,840
to different people to people like Santa

1735
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:11,939
Barbara to us

1736
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:16,140
and I think there were not many seats

1737
01:23:11,939 --> 01:23:18,178
left and well I I think

1738
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:21,360
Old Timer

1739
01:23:18,179 --> 01:23:23,158
appreciate us chariots and like he gave

1740
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:25,439
us I knew that

1741
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:30,238
we were really passionate with sativa so

1742
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:32,698
he gave our life 40 or 50 seats of the

1743
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:36,599
from the Pacific

1744
01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:39,539
reproduction and and those were I don't

1745
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:43,219
have any

1746
01:23:39,539 --> 01:23:44,960
any record or no or news that anyone

1747
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:47,158
Grill

1748
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:50,640
moral timer haze from the original

1749
01:23:47,158 --> 01:23:51,979
Channel but for the religion robots or

1750
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,539
that anyone

1751
01:23:51,979 --> 01:23:57,119
preserve any other headline from from

1752
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:59,399
Alzheimer different than this one

1753
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:03,000
or only the

1754
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:06,719
the work we did is what remains alive

1755
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,000
yeah fantastic it's a it's a very highly

1756
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:12,960
sought after strain in terms of the cult

1757
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,840
following just as a random side question

1758
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:19,319
did old-timer ever talk to you about

1759
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:24,239
giving genetics to Sam the skunk man or

1760
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:24,238
being involved in the skunk project no

1761
01:24:24,658 --> 01:24:31,559
no uh I I think I

1762
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:34,500
uh I I cannot pull I cannot say now that

1763
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:37,920
that he said that that he work in this

1764
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:41,219
country yeah okay he never said that he

1765
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:44,880
worked to develop the haze he only said

1766
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:46,198
that he got his seats yeah coming from

1767
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:50,179
yes

1768
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:50,178
what others are saying I

1769
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:57,359
I prefer not to go

1770
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:59,100
it's all polemic about things that I

1771
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:02,698
don't know they are a fact so I prefer

1772
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:04,800
not to go in yeah so just as a sort of

1773
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:07,319
general question what's your favorite

1774
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,920
offering from Ace seeds if you could

1775
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:09,920
only pick one

1776
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:15,319
so difficult

1777
01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:22,679
for others or for me

1778
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:26,579
um how about do one for each

1779
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:28,859
if you if you watch for me I will

1780
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:31,738
date you

1781
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:34,019
date you for me it is

1782
01:25:31,738 --> 01:25:36,299
the noise

1783
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:38,820
press all my buttons you're making me

1784
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:41,880
feel I

1785
01:25:38,819 --> 01:25:45,299
don't know like

1786
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:49,199
is is what I call a spiritual wind I

1787
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:53,699
started us is really magic with this

1788
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:56,698
very special and the incense

1789
01:25:53,698 --> 01:25:58,738
from his magic with yeah and for others

1790
01:25:56,698 --> 01:26:01,859
if you want I wanted to impress someone

1791
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:04,738
and don't know anything about or sativas

1792
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:07,939
and something that is grow up on a

1793
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:07,939
micros fan

1794
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:12,559
and and you will get a good into

1795
01:26:10,939 --> 01:26:14,698
introduction

1796
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:18,480
into our work

1797
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:20,279
well to really solid offerings there

1798
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:23,158
I was hoping I could ask you a little

1799
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:25,319
bit about the Panama Red Line you have I

1800
01:26:23,158 --> 01:26:27,179
noticed obviously it's an F10 so it

1801
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:30,359
sounds like a lot of Works gone into

1802
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:32,399
this project what sort of traits were

1803
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:34,619
you looking for in it and do you have

1804
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,238
any plans to breed with it more in the

1805
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:38,460
future

1806
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:41,519
oh

1807
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:44,359
the Panama strain is probably the the

1808
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:48,260
stream we we have work

1809
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:48,259
longer more generation

1810
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:56,400
and probably

1811
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:57,839
or for long-term lines is probably the

1812
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:01,920
best one

1813
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:06,659
yes and most of the Merit or on this

1814
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:08,579
line came from the job of of kaiki or of

1815
01:27:06,658 --> 01:27:12,379
Charlie Garcia

1816
01:27:08,579 --> 01:27:19,939
it is the most difficult

1817
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:19,940
generation and and to pull it at a level

1818
01:27:20,658 --> 01:27:27,599
that is incredible the the Panama or

1819
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:33,060
Panama or

1820
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:37,739
is is a fifth Panama hybrid it started

1821
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:38,719
in the United States the uh there was a

1822
01:27:37,738 --> 01:27:41,579
a

1823
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:43,859
grower a matter of breeder

1824
01:27:41,579 --> 01:27:47,039
and in the upper Grove forums that he

1825
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:49,679
was a friend of mine and suddenly

1826
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:51,238
Charlie Garcia he his name was green

1827
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,139
grocer

1828
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:57,299
and um

1829
01:27:54,139 --> 01:28:01,859
he used to grow

1830
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:05,460
a Panama Panama lines he had a a hybrid

1831
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:07,380
of apanema old Panama green on an old

1832
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:11,840
Panama Red Line

1833
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:15,000
okay and he worked I don't know maybe

1834
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:16,219
one two generations this hybrid being

1835
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,158
grosser

1836
01:28:16,219 --> 01:28:21,719
then she passed the

1837
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:24,420
the

1838
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:27,480
genetics to Charlie Garcia to kaiki from

1839
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:29,460
Canada when we were working the first

1840
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:31,259
years of his seats

1841
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,260
and I'm with

1842
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:37,739
um we took a third Panama

1843
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:38,940
Colombian registry from Alex Mano Negra

1844
01:28:37,738 --> 01:28:44,158
okay

1845
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:48,059
and we put several Rhythm male red males

1846
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:51,299
from this Fair versus Sativa male into

1847
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:55,739
the the two-way hybrid

1848
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:58,980
making a three-way hybrid okay and then

1849
01:28:55,738 --> 01:29:04,019
kaiki will award the hybrid in

1850
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:07,678
at least until left 6 F7

1851
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:07,679
until 2006

1852
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:13,698
and the

1853
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:18,060
same here here

1854
01:29:13,698 --> 01:29:22,439
the most difficult job is that Panama is

1855
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:25,639
like to to capture the best trace of the

1856
01:29:22,439 --> 01:29:28,500
of the best Panama race

1857
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:30,980
in a strain that can be grown with

1858
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:34,880
modern standards and compared with

1859
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:39,019
racing interpins potency bag appeal

1860
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:39,020
quality with the modern strings

1861
01:29:39,539 --> 01:29:46,619
um is is an extremely good job we don't

1862
01:29:43,738 --> 01:29:50,099
say lightly that is the the best purusa

1863
01:29:46,619 --> 01:29:52,340
diva Central Americans of the last 20

1864
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:57,500
years because it is

1865
01:29:52,340 --> 01:30:01,920
amazing quality it has different Thanos

1866
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:05,340
and the red ones the green ones some

1867
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:08,359
that have so much resin that is white

1868
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:08,360
purple one

1869
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:15,000
and

1870
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:18,479
um cakey work the telegraphy award the

1871
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:21,420
panaman deal the F6 F7

1872
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:25,319
and then I start to work with the line

1873
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:29,819
on 2006 2007.

1874
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:34,619
ideally two or three generation

1875
01:30:29,819 --> 01:30:38,880
and then the the time that I work better

1876
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:41,039
myself the Panama was in 2013.

1877
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:45,659
when I bought like seven different

1878
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:49,859
Panama lines from X F6 1210

1879
01:30:45,658 --> 01:30:51,960
and then we selected among 100 different

1880
01:30:49,859 --> 01:30:53,839
females

1881
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,060
and then I came up with the Panama gold

1882
01:30:53,840 --> 01:31:00,300
sf10 Elite

1883
01:30:56,060 --> 01:31:02,219
which is my work after kaiki after

1884
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:07,739
Charlie Garcia

1885
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:10,139
of a mix of his Elite Panama Red The

1886
01:31:07,738 --> 01:31:11,819
Elite Panama Red we had a the assist at

1887
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:14,819
that time

1888
01:31:11,819 --> 01:31:18,179
mix it with greens that I like

1889
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:19,139
and then work three four five generation

1890
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:22,380
work

1891
01:31:19,139 --> 01:31:25,020
some of the lime the the the main

1892
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:27,779
parental plan we use for Panama breeding

1893
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:33,540
is the Panama goddess it's an F

1894
01:31:27,779 --> 01:31:36,359
10 F10 sorry and his Elite it has

1895
01:31:33,539 --> 01:31:40,079
everything I want is probably not the

1896
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:42,000
more radius but regarding GL

1897
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:45,300
type of FL

1898
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,899
the quality of the effect terpenes

1899
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:51,659
is the the best female I have seen

1900
01:31:48,899 --> 01:31:53,059
until now after 20 years working with

1901
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:55,859
Panama

1902
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:59,580
that's awesome to hear

1903
01:31:55,859 --> 01:32:03,238
so I was hoping to clarify I noticed

1904
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:05,600
that the Pakistani chitrali Kush breeder

1905
01:32:03,238 --> 01:32:08,519
pack it kind of had a lot of different

1906
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:12,900
phenotypes listed in it is that similar

1907
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:14,639
to how you were talking about doing like

1908
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:16,859
the different xamls where they're sort

1909
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:18,480
of like unreleased mothers and you're

1910
01:32:16,859 --> 01:32:20,279
including them in this pack that aren't

1911
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,559
normally in the others and how would you

1912
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:25,698
describe the other Pakistani mothers

1913
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:28,560
compared to the usual one you use

1914
01:32:25,698 --> 01:32:32,479
okay the the concept of the breeder

1915
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:36,659
packs is more more addressed to

1916
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:38,819
to to Big breed or two breeders and I'm

1917
01:32:36,658 --> 01:32:41,479
a big Growers that want to make a big

1918
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:44,399
selection to find that really really

1919
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:45,959
outstanding plan to to keep us a cloning

1920
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:47,819
and keep for years

1921
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:51,179
these people that

1922
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:53,099
that wants to go into one of our

1923
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:55,619
strained

1924
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:57,239
as much as Steep and wide as possible

1925
01:32:55,619 --> 01:33:01,219
and

1926
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:03,599
in in the bigger pack it's each pack

1927
01:33:01,219 --> 01:33:05,579
it's a strain is different so it's

1928
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:10,880
pretty pack is different

1929
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:10,880
but when I try to to offer is

1930
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:16,259
a seat from the different

1931
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:18,599
baselines

1932
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:20,780
that represent the strain

1933
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,280
okay

1934
01:33:20,779 --> 01:33:28,619
for example in the case of the Panama

1935
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:31,079
breeder Pass movie to put a good

1936
01:33:28,619 --> 01:33:33,479
that the grower can initially find good

1937
01:33:31,079 --> 01:33:36,559
seats from the Panama Green from the

1938
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:40,259
Panama of the red pink pistil

1939
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:41,639
from the latest job we have done with

1940
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:43,500
The Strain coming from the Panama

1941
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:48,719
goddess

1942
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:49,439
Etc with China with different lines they

1943
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:53,060
are

1944
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:55,738
cautions one half

1945
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:58,199
slightly different or pain

1946
01:33:55,738 --> 01:34:01,198
the other different slightly different

1947
01:33:58,198 --> 01:34:01,198
effects

1948
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:07,319
so if you for example want to or in the

1949
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:10,679
Pakistani truck which is the

1950
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:13,340
the Pakistan there has been used more in

1951
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:16,260
the industry to produce colorful hybrids

1952
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:18,840
whatever they name they want to put on

1953
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:20,820
it but I know it's basically

1954
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:24,480
[Music]

1955
01:34:20,819 --> 01:34:28,380
it's so easy to to

1956
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:32,638
because this is the abiental plans you

1957
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:35,279
working 15 years this like recognize one

1958
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:37,739
one of my daughters

1959
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:40,619
and for example if you want to read with

1960
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:42,718
Pakistani dragons in a more proper way

1961
01:34:40,619 --> 01:34:46,079
you take the breeder pack and you mean

1962
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,520
from the green line I focus to find the

1963
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:50,039
best from the green

1964
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:53,340
this is the the best purple for their

1965
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:56,340
pants this is the black one very red

1966
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:59,279
phenotype and the colorful ones

1967
01:34:56,340 --> 01:35:01,739
Etc and depending of the reproduction we

1968
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:03,559
have done and what have been the most

1969
01:35:01,738 --> 01:35:05,698
remarkable

1970
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,560
plants then I

1971
01:35:05,698 --> 01:35:10,738
make up either pack

1972
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:13,860
that provides the best from the last

1973
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:16,319
breathing step usually

1974
01:35:13,859 --> 01:35:18,119
what a great answer so there we go guys

1975
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:20,880
if you want to do the big Fino hunt you

1976
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:24,719
know where to look so we're now on to

1977
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:26,279
our final quick fire questions which we

1978
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,439
ask all breeders at the end of the

1979
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:31,859
interview so the first question I wanted

1980
01:35:28,439 --> 01:35:34,439
to ask you was if you could go back 10

1981
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:36,779
years and give yourself some advice

1982
01:35:34,439 --> 01:35:38,099
relating to cannabis what would you tell

1983
01:35:36,779 --> 01:35:40,279
yourself

1984
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,280
foreign

1985
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:45,439
10 years ago

1986
01:35:48,539 --> 01:35:54,119
I believe everything how it is

1987
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:56,760
yeah that was the Beautiful Life

1988
01:35:54,119 --> 01:36:00,238
oh that's poetic I love it

1989
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:03,179
the next question we ask yes is what is

1990
01:36:00,238 --> 01:36:05,718
the single most memorable bit of

1991
01:36:03,179 --> 01:36:08,279
cannabis you ever smoked be it flower

1992
01:36:05,719 --> 01:36:10,920
hash whatever it is what's the most

1993
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:12,920
memorable for you

1994
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:16,380
oh

1995
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:18,899
the man was memorable there

1996
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:21,119
the most memorable the cherries in my

1997
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:23,759
memory a lot is The Nepalese Commando

1998
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:28,260
was one of the Freeland races I grew

1999
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:30,539
it was a flower with purple pinkish hues

2000
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:34,020
it was such a delicate plan that

2001
01:36:30,539 --> 01:36:38,279
follower with its delicate call us

2002
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:40,440
and you smell like wild strawberry and

2003
01:36:38,279 --> 01:36:42,238
when you smoke it it was in fence I like

2004
01:36:40,439 --> 01:36:45,319
being in Nepal

2005
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:51,379
why we were we were tiles

2006
01:36:45,319 --> 01:36:51,380
uh and they say my God this way foreign

2007
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:08,520
incredible trippy then other strains I

2008
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:13,219
miss a lot are the

2009
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:16,020
the the the the funny Mexican effects

2010
01:37:13,219 --> 01:37:19,319
that make you laugh with your friends

2011
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:22,199
like a bit like the new California

2012
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:26,639
that is maybe your

2013
01:37:22,198 --> 01:37:29,519
smile and live here more I missed this

2014
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:33,800
this kind of effects you're very settled

2015
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,800
on finding it today in today's week

2016
01:37:33,859 --> 01:37:38,599
[Music]

2017
01:37:35,399 --> 01:37:41,460
or other strain I smoke

2018
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:43,320
burying the resting purpose sativas in

2019
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:45,179
Northern Laos

2020
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:49,259
in bandian

2021
01:37:45,179 --> 01:37:51,960
or that was very strong and unique

2022
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:56,219
I never try anything like this

2023
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:57,480
and then I smoke work and when I was in

2024
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:58,980
North Sumatra

2025
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:01,439
a

2026
01:37:58,979 --> 01:38:04,138
in a

2027
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:06,839
orangutan Reserve

2028
01:38:04,139 --> 01:38:10,560
you know we had to there they would like

2029
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:12,020
to try the the

2030
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:16,199
the

2031
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:18,540
actual is how we call it the Americans I

2032
01:38:16,198 --> 01:38:21,658
guess the football into everything but

2033
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:24,119
it was in in it was black

2034
01:38:21,658 --> 01:38:27,059
and it was just

2035
01:38:24,119 --> 01:38:29,939
it was true and I haven't smoked in a

2036
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:31,440
few weeks it was on holidays and if I

2037
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:35,158
was there in

2038
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:38,359
in the dark in the jungle and one of the

2039
01:38:35,158 --> 01:38:40,079
that was traveling with her with a group

2040
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:43,198
uh

2041
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:46,679
got some of the of the local wheat from

2042
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:49,079
from northern Sumatra from from

2043
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:52,980
and they were

2044
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:57,238
a black fermented thing that almost had

2045
01:38:52,979 --> 01:39:00,119
no brags and it was only leaf and sticks

2046
01:38:57,238 --> 01:39:03,119
where we make one or two years high and

2047
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:05,779
I wish I live in between three and four

2048
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:08,819
and he was

2049
01:39:05,779 --> 01:39:11,519
extremely extremely strong

2050
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:12,840
if you grow this properly with good

2051
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,420
flour

2052
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:18,960
and you let it ripe because the the

2053
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:21,779
flower will smuggles and ripe

2054
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:25,859
the I think the

2055
01:39:21,779 --> 01:39:28,380
is one of the strongest races

2056
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:30,420
I come I have experienced them in

2057
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:34,699
Northern Sumatra

2058
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:34,699
I know that I I cherish

2059
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:39,500
from from the commercial strains

2060
01:39:39,539 --> 01:39:46,738
the first Maple Leaf not the smell like

2061
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:49,738
babysit

2062
01:39:46,738 --> 01:39:49,738
incredible

2063
01:39:50,039 --> 01:39:55,439
their pins

2064
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:57,359
and of course the best hybrid is from

2065
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:59,698
maybe from the 90s

2066
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:02,639
uh

2067
01:39:59,698 --> 01:40:06,119
jachter is a masterpiece

2068
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:09,020
and the Hawaiian has he was incredible

2069
01:40:06,119 --> 01:40:12,079
only try once but

2070
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:14,940
it was

2071
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:17,340
they're probably one of the most trippy

2072
01:40:14,939 --> 01:40:21,619
and entropy

2073
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:21,619
and best hybrid from from Neville

2074
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:26,399
um the Cali means the old Kali means

2075
01:40:23,819 --> 01:40:28,198
from serious and Simon it was a

2076
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:31,698
spectacular

2077
01:40:28,198 --> 01:40:31,698
it was a spec member

2078
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:34,460
um

2079
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:41,460
yes one Philippine Kaling had a

2080
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:45,000
from Cordillera Centralia that tastes

2081
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:48,319
like I just mean it was purple and there

2082
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,319
is like like Jasmine

2083
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,360
these are probably

2084
01:40:51,899 --> 01:40:56,279
the the land races and Commercial

2085
01:40:54,359 --> 01:40:59,880
strains that

2086
01:40:56,279 --> 01:41:02,039
the Richer is more and had more impact

2087
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:05,340
in me

2088
01:41:02,039 --> 01:41:07,859
fantastic what a awesome list you've got

2089
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:10,560
there so the next question I wanted to

2090
01:41:07,859 --> 01:41:12,420
know was if you were gonna get dropped

2091
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,239
off on a desert island and you could

2092
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:17,880
only take three strains with you for the

2093
01:41:15,238 --> 01:41:20,779
rest of time what three strains are you

2094
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:20,779
gonna take with you

2095
01:41:21,779 --> 01:41:24,779
foreign

2096
01:41:31,698 --> 01:41:38,939
dominant selection love it love it okay

2097
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:40,739
so have you ever had a strain where all

2098
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:43,079
your friends are telling you about it

2099
01:41:40,738 --> 01:41:45,658
you're getting very excited to try it

2100
01:41:43,079 --> 01:41:49,139
and then it finally comes time to try it

2101
01:41:45,658 --> 01:41:52,679
you do and you feel like this isn't very

2102
01:41:49,139 --> 01:41:55,079
good at all it's quite disappointing

2103
01:41:52,679 --> 01:41:59,100

2123
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:06,178
I I

2124
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:10,039
I would go to to Thailand in the 70s

2125
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:10,039
together through Thai stick

2126

if he goes to Thailand or or Africa or

2148
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:18,960
India is not going to get the best

2149
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:20,819
you know only only the locals I'm from

2150
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:22,980
from Valencia you're only going to read

2151
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:25,139
the best paella in the world if you are

2152

and come and come back with the best so

2156
01:44:34,859 --> 01:44:40,019
it's it's super interesting it's finally

2157
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:43,739
there was the moment that the the people

2158
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:44,820
of the the the people from the

2159
01:44:43,738 --> 01:44:46,859
traditional

2160
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:50,399
the traditional farmers and people from

2161
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:51,839
those countries start to understand the

2162
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:54,599
value and the importance of the

2163
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,100
preservation of the of their their game

2164
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:59,760
pools because

2165
01:44:56,100 --> 01:45:03,000
there are very uniquely there with many

2166
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:06,840
other traditional life who are lifestyle

2167
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,859
and who can do is better than the local

2168
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:12,440
people

2169
01:45:07,859 --> 01:45:15,599
and who should do it ethically a morally

2170
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:18,658
others first than them

2171
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:21,300
so it's amazing what that what he's

2172
01:45:18,658 --> 01:45:24,479
doing and that's why if the races we are

2173
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:26,579
trying to to support the world uh the

2174
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:27,959
Indian Landry Saints are doing to to

2175
01:45:26,579 --> 01:45:30,719
document

2176
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:33,539
the land races of of the countries that

2177
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:36,539
have more and and showing us that there

2178
01:45:33,539 --> 01:45:38,819
are still so many left

2179
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:40,439
um and there are still so many things in

2180
01:45:38,819 --> 01:45:43,618
cannabis to discover

2181
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:46,138
that that shows the same thing

2182
01:45:43,618 --> 01:45:49,519
so yes that's why I like to support the

2183
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:52,500
people I like him I'm

2184
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:56,040
extremely excited but with we everybody

2185
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:56,229
with every project they do

2186
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:57,840

[Music]

2188
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:02,039
and yes I think the future already is

2189
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:03,779
there now that the legalization is

2190
01:46:02,039 --> 01:46:05,939
coming to to all these countries that

2191
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:10,198
people try to empower their local

2192
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:11,698
strains uh and try to preserve what we

2193
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:15,178
have left

2194
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:16,979
and then try to to to develop near

2195
01:46:15,179 --> 01:46:19,500
strains

2196
01:46:16,979 --> 01:46:22,439

2197
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:24,600

well they have many ups and downs

2209
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:55,579

2210
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:58,800
sacrifice many things

2211
01:46:55,579 --> 01:47:01,198
