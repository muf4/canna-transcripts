00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,038
it in the toast oven and put it in the

168
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,159
pens to kind of test out the devices and

169
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,680
you know passing them out to the

170
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,639
employees and my friends and smoke it

171
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,400
myself so it just tastes so damn good I

172
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,160
did have to I did have to keep it in

173
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,598
there a little bit longer to kind of

174
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,720
mellow out the extra energy side of it

175
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:53,120
it's a little woo you know so I kind of

176
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,440
got a little bit of that to come out of

177
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120
it when I just kind of left it in there

178
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,160
for a little bit longer decar box just a

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,519
bit longer you know um and yeah so

180
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,639
that's what I've been smoking and then

181
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,959
on the on the uh the flower front I've

182

199
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,800
really nice really enjoying that savory

200
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,120
flavor I hear it's got some sort of Kim

201
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,560
in it I'm not I don't really know the

202
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,800
lineage of it but it definitely tastes

203
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,439
like it's got let's just say kemi in it

204
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,240
you know it's got that savory it's got

205
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,120
GMO GMO there you go yeah I said you

206
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,400
nailed it with the chmd yeah it's it's

207
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,360
it's nice though I like it so we're

208
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:12,560
going to be rocking now in here too um

209
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,879
yep that's about it that's so cool to

210
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,000
hear you've been uh getting into

211
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,759
concentrates I got to ask you some more

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,639
like are there any other sort of

213
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,840
standout strains you've put into the

214
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,800
pens and you reference with the Jax

215
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,119
cleaner like was it that it was like a

216
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,439
bit racy in the way like sativas were

217
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,879
when you say you were trying to Mellow

218
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,038
it cuz it's really interesting you don't

219
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,919
hear about

220
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:34,278
people say oh you put anything into a

221
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,559
pen it just feels like an Inda um so

222
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:38,038
that sounds like you were getting more

223
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,199
of that sativa expression yeah I it was

224
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,000
my first time decarboxylating the live

225
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,519
Rod of myself and I you know at first I

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
just let it go I was trying to get every

227
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,120
little itty bitty bubble out of it so I

228
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,000
think I let it go for like probably way

229
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,919
too long um and then so it kind of just

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,879
naturally happened um but I did have

231
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,519
some of the the rosin that wasn't

232
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,799
decarbox and I I did a dab and I was

233
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,399
like that's a different feeling you know

234
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:06,159
it was way more racier um it wasn't too

235
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,278
much but like I said uh you know I don't

236
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,039
I don't smoke that in the morning the

237
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,480
pen is kind of throughout the

238
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,039
day sure so you you were saying you

239
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,039
mostly use the pens through the day I'd

240
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,759
love to know have you ventured much into

241
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,319
the world of like hash dry C anything

242
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,519
like that or you sticking mostly to like

243
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,200
the more concentrate esque no we we have

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,759
been making we've been setting aside a

245
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,920
little bubble hash when I make the I

246
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,360
make all the live RS in here um just

247
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,360
don't have anyone else to do it you know

248
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,120
um but so yeah I always set a little

249
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,600
bubble aside I love having a freeze

250
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,278
dryer man it's kind of a new thing for

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,278
me it's like I wish I would have had

252
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,838
that all along you know so amazing it's

253
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:45,838
amazing to come back the very next day

254
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,480
and like pull out some dry hash bubble

255
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,720
hash and you know melt it up you know so

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,839
yeah I've been keeping I've been doing

257
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,519
some tits some purple full stack we did

258
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,600
some red dog that one came out really

259
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
nice not a big yelder so it's probably

260
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,240
not going to be something in rotation

261
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,839
it's one of ours the lucky dog uh

262
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,440
crosses that we made um we found a

263
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,760
really nice one it's it tests around 29%

264
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,680
THC whatever that means to anybody but

265
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,039
it's got this beautiful flavor to it

266
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,479
like this almost like green weed flavor

267
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,958
to it that's kind of rare these days um

268
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,720
and it's got this incredible like

269
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,359
relaxing effect um the people who come

270
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,160
in it's been really popular like our

271
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,959
last drop the ones that we're flowering

272
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,838
out here have been really popular our

273
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,559
most popular as diesel poison and red

274
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,519
dog we can't we can't grow enough of

275
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,919
that all of a sudden and they're kind of

276
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,200
surpassing all the the botiques and the

277
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,479
old chims that we have and you know some

278
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,240
of my old classics that I've got um

279
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,079
which makes me so happy I love that you

280
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,159
know people that don't know anything

281
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,239
about lucky dog or really even Kim dog

282
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,919
or like any of the stuff that goes any

283
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,278
of the history or anything like that

284
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,360
they'll come in and they'll buy stuff

285
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,720
that we've selected from our own you

286
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,560
know crosses and it just it really

287
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,240
validates what you're doing you know it

288
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,319
really does CU it's like there's no bias

289
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,480
there there's no you know

290
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,240
preconceived notions at all it's just

291
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,879
simply you know this is the one I like

292
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,799
and they you know they asked for it

293
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,120
they're bummed out we don't have it so I

294
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,039
made I did a little bit of that some red

295
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,278
dog like said purple full stack and

296
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:26,039
Diesel poison we did some pull dog there

297
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:27,720
the skunk dog cross and uh the tits GMO

298
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:32,399
which you know always makes some really

299
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,839
nice [ __ ] rosin or bubble hash and uh

300
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,039
that's about that's all I can think of

301
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,120
right off the top of my head it's really

302
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,278
not that much but oh and uh we have one

303
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,120
called

304
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:46,799
um um dog roller that we made that one's

305
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,839
in is is also in rosin form too that's

306
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,159
like a heavy duty strong

307
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,639
Inda so yeah I feel like you're selling

308
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,958
yourself short you're like that's that's

309
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,000
not that much it's like there's a

310
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,278
plethora of killers in that mix there so

311
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,399
sounds like you got some good

312
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,799
concentrates on board I guess I want to

313
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,399
ask given you're trying all different

314
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:09,120
variety if you had to pick one as your

315
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,919
favorite which would you go with

316
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,560
currently the out of the ones I've made

317
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,120
uh that I currently have I'd say

318
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,879
probably the tits it's always been my

319
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,000
favorite ever since I smoked it as far

320
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,759
as concentrates goes it just it's good

321
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,879
any time of the day generally I smoke it

322
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,399
in the day time but um you know it's

323
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,799
it's it's just got that it's got the

324
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,320
flavor it stays in your mouth It Coats

325
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,519
it it just stays with you makes your

326
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,800
mouth water and it's just got the nice

327
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,560
high you know it's a really rare plant

328
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,240
it's got it all you know so I'd say the

329
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,559
tits that always is going I'm going back

330
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,919
to I got one of those uh

331
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,119
puffco the pipes what do you call them

332
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,838
the proxies you know and so you know if

333
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,399
I'm feeling saucy you know we have to

334
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,880
worry about inspectors here so we can't

335
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,440
just walk around with those pipes in her

336
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,439
hands around here you know what I mean

337
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,279
it's a legal cannabis business so that's

338
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,600
why the pens come in handy of course you

339
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,919
know it's not something that we prefer

340
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,000
it's just something that we kind of it's

341
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:08,039
a a ways to a means you know um but I I

342
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,039
do like I do like smoking the the tits

343
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,679
rosin out of that thing it's really nice

344
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,519
you can really get a good good flavor

345
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,958
the full the full flavor comes through

346
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,759
with no water in it and such you know

347
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,399
that's awesome and and just to loop back

348
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,799
you were mentioning with the flower you

349
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,759
having Jack Hera and some Sour band

350
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,799
sounds like you're starting to gravitate

351
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,759
more to the saever end of the spectrum

352
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,559
or is it just in the

353
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:33,000
daytime no I am actually you know as

354
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,759
I've gotten older it's just uh I'm not

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,919
sure if it's because I wasn't so exposed

356
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,639
to it when I was you know you know 20s

357
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,838
and 30s just too much chem around me not

358
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,159
to say that it doesn't have sativa

359
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,480
qualities we I don't know it does but um

360
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,120
but some of these I just didn't have

361
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,759
access to and um maybe I would have

362
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,600
enjoyed them back then but yeah I do

363
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,480
gravitate towards them I like that Upp

364
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,800
feeling you know the older I've gotten

365
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,360
I'm 51 now and I like that that

366
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:01,679
energized feeling it it does me well and

367
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,519
I like that brain stimulation you know

368
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:08,039
um you know kind of creativity you know

369
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,360
problem solving kind of effects I love

370
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,799
that you know I like to see things

371
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,039
differently I love when weed does that

372
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,078
to me so I get that a lot from the

373
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,759
sativas I smoke and I I do like them

374
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,799
been breeding a lot more sativas too you

375
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,079
know that was going to be my next

376
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,000
question tell me about it well you know

377
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,198
like the pull dog for instance that's

378
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,919
definitely you know in the diesel poison

379
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,519
the diesel poison has just been like a

380
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,799
big surprise like we just pack we uh we

381
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,600
took one pack 13 seeds germinated them

382
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,679
grew them out we could have kept three

383
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,839
of them but there was one that just you

384
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,439
know the the problem with breeding with

385
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,720
anything that's high in terpinolene is

386
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,040
of course I think we've talked about

387
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,560
this before it dominates everything you

388
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,120
know um you know a lot of people that's

389
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,319
what weed smells like because that's all

390
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,159
they remember when they from the times

391
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,680
they smelled weed you know but uh so

392
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,278
when you're able to make a cross because

393
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,879
it's a great it's a great flavor it's a

394
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,360
great smell it does like it does a lot

395
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,360
of things to you I don't I can't even

396
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,360
explain it but um to be able to have

397
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,759
that in in a strain in the flavor in the

398
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,959
aroma but not dominating and you can

399
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,120
have like you know different smells

400
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,879
different flavors on the back end and

401
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,159
that's what this does it's really cool

402
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,838
you know and uh you know we we pulled

403
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,958
that one off it's a huge yielder you

404
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,440
know it just wrecks you people love it

405
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,638
and so I would say that's you know

406
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
that's one of the ones that I'm thinking

407
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,360
about right now U but we also did the

408
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,680
pull dog with the skunk dog it's

409
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,919
definitely a sativa leaner I mean the

410
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,799
skunk dog itself is just by itself is uh

411
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,919
it's got almost medicinal benefits when

412
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:45,359
it comes to things like ADHD you know

413
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,958
it's so focusing you know um I've had

414
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,278
people com into the shop here I think

415
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,799
I've told you this before where you know

416
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,519
that's why they smoke her because they

417
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,679
have severe what they call

418
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:58,360
ADHD and you know certain strains can

419
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,679
really lock them in and and change their

420
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,519
day when it comes production and and uh

421
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:06,198
we've had people give us feedback like

422
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,879
that on on the P dog um so you know and

423
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,919
I enjoy those now too I used to be kind

424
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,879
of scared of those because I don't

425
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:14,479
really want to like have a heart racing

426
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,879
you know like like neop panic attack

427
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,839
feel but nowadays I don't know if I

428
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,439
enjoy it or if it's just different but I

429
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,240
I kind of enjoy it you know yeah I know

430
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,720
you do too well you know what I've

431
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,759
thought about that a lot because you

432
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
know there was a time where if I had any

433
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,399
of these sativas I would just feel feel

434
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:35,399
profoundly anxious and not enjoy it at

435
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:39,839
all and my conclusion I've come to is

436
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:43,480
that I think over time you learn to

437
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,360
harness that feeling and use it as like

438
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,079
you feel energized and productive you

439
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,159
know whereas in other situations it

440
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:54,679
feels like almost a bit crippling um so

441
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,278
that that's just my anecdotal sort of

442
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,000
musings on it because I have thought

443
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,000
about that like why did it used to make

444
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,559
me anxious but the same clone nowadays

445
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,078
it's like o

446
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,798
perfect that's a I think that maybe

447
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,318
that's a good point uh for me too

448
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,679
because you know maybe when I was

449
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,159
younger I I

450
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,759
certainly I'm I'm I'm I would say I

451
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,240
don't want to say I'm busier because I

452
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,838
physically maybe I'm not as busy but

453
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,199
mentally I'm busier than I've ever been

454
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,198
in my life and so maybe It just fits

455
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,839
better with my life now because of that

456
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,320
whereas when I was younger I'm at home

457
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,558
you know I got my bed rooms you know and

458
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,879
growing the weed hanging out with my my

459
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,279
kid my little kid you know and maybe

460
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,600
maybe that's what it was maybe it's just

461
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,599
that you need to have the right kind of

462
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,439
day to have that kind of smoke in your

463
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:45,319
life you know production wise definitely

464
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,840
definitely and you know what the

465
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,038
listeners are probably sick of hearing

466
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,319
me say this but uh what you said about

467
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,879
the diesel poison being like

468
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:56,158
unexpectedly popular uh is is really a

469
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,000
sentiment I'm always mentioning to

470
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,400
people which is that that notion that

471
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,159
people are burnt out on Blue Dream or

472
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,720
Jack har or train wreck um it I really

473
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,360
don't think it applies outside of

474
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,960
California because the majority of

475
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,119
people and they're just not exposed to

476
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,279
it so I I see people in Australia all

477
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:18,599
the time growing Durban Poison S1 Blue

478
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,879
Dream S1 train wreck S1 because they're

479
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,798
very much interested in it so yeah I

480
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,280
think it it mirrors what your sort of

481
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,839
experience is that like there are a lot

482
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,839
of people who are still really into

483
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,839
turpening profiles and love the high and

484
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,399
think yeah this is for me I would agree

485
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,199
with that I didn't mean to cut you off I

486
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,600
I would agree with that um yeah

487
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,480
California Market's different than all

488
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,918
the others I've I've been exposed to a

489
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,599
mid around um I don't really know what

490
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,960
it is you know it's a big place with a

491
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:48,079
lot of people and they do Drive markets

492
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,558
outside of the room you know uh but but

493
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,038
I I've had that here I was surprised

494
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,000
when I came here I was blown away

495
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,119
because I've never really seen that and

496
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,599
then when I came here and opened up shop

497
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,119
you know people were looking for the

498
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,798
sativas and they still are you know and

499
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,959
so we and intentionally grow more and

500
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:04,038
more of them you know the traditional

501
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,240
classical classic sativas we grow more

502
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:08,240
and more of those because that's what

503
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,079
they want you know which is it's not

504
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,759
purple weed you know like California I

505
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,839
don't know how it is today things can

506
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,759
change but when I call back there it's

507
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,678
all about the purple weed is it purple

508
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,599
I'm like I don't know maybe how cold is

509
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,840
it but yeah I I agree with that I agree

510
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,439
with what you said I think it is I think

511
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,678
it is an outside California thing which

512
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,080
is literally

513
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,320
everywhere there you go well look I

514
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,399
guess the next question is would you

515
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,678
ever consider maybe developing a male

516
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,679
that's like you know hybrid

517
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,400
sativa I think we have we we we selected

518
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,919
a Kim Fuego that seems to pass on the

519
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,919
best parts of the sour diesel when it

520
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,480
comes to those effects you know um we've

521
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,919
done a lot of we just finished doing a

522
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,400
lot of crosses with those we're going to

523
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,159
test them out see if they landed where

524
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,919
we want um but that's that's that's kind

525
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,080
of what we've been doing you know uh we

526
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:03,038
definitely are are developing more m

527
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:05,319
here um slowly but surely you know uh

528
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,879
but we're trying to expand what we're

529
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:08,480
doing we know of course we're Kim dog

530
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,400
based here we always will be it's just

531
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,360
the way it is but um but we have we have

532
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,120
started to do that I would say I feel

533
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,719
pretty good about the this next line

534
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,199
that we're going to be coming out with

535
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,279
as far as the that Kim fuo mail that we

536
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,240
selected you know the Kim fuo has been

537
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,079
up for quite a while was probably the

538
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,159
most popular one I've ever I've ever

539
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,678
made as far as what I can see um and so

540
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,679
decided to kind of look into it a little

541
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:36,919
bit more uh been collecting clones of it

542
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,720
been selecting more females of it um and

543
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,080
have gone through a few males so we just

544
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,558
we're literally drying a bunch of flour

545
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,558
seated flour right now and we're going

546
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:49,319
to start testing them out later this

547
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,158
summer we'll start popping them wow

548
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,200
that's exciting I've I've had a few

549
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,600
friends grow some Kem fuo out and

550
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,279
they've all loved it so that's that's

551
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,599
really exciting I guess I'd love to know

552
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,879
are there any uh particular crosses in

553
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,519
the mix that you did that like you know

554
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,200
you I know that like when I make seeds

555
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:07,918
you know there's like say you make 10

556
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,640
crosses there's like there's two in your

557
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,679
mind where you're like oh I'm really

558
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,159
those are the ones I'm keen on tell me

559
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,360
what are they for

560
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,039
you well honestly I've been through this

561
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:21,240
and I try not to do that because I

562
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:24,240
disappoint myself you know um I did some

563
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,079
red Lebanese hash plant crosses and they

564
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,159
were phenomenal but there was a little

565
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:31,960
bit higher interex traits than I pref

566
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,200
you know so I've uh I've thought about

567
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,440
kind of because they were really they

568
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,240
were they were off the chain but I got I

569
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,880
got hung up on what I saw as far as I go

570
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,640
it wasn't wasn't terrible but it was you

571
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,278
know when we stressed you know what we

572
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,200
did with stress we just use Mo mostly we

573
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:50,558
use what I've learned is that when you

574
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,798
find those it's mostly rootbound plants

575
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,639
you know sometimes I can't get heat to

576
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,639
do it you know excessive heat but I can

577
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,400
get a plant and a solo cup to do it you

578
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,080
know and so I I we you know we were

579
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,679
testing them with smaller pots and we

580
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:10,038
did find that um basically if I find two

581
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,200
and like say you know 30 or 50 I don't

582
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,038
really have numbers on that but

583
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,960
somewhere in that range that's too much

584
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,919
for me um you know but we have thought

585
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,558
about putting those out so anyways I was

586
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,919
so I had such high expectations on that

587
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:23,278
one that I got really disappointed when

588
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,240
I saw that of course I never released

589
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:29,240
the stuff um so I try to stay away from

590
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,038
that but we did just make a [ __ ] ton of

591
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,880
crosses I'm trying to think if I had a

592
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:37,000
favorite if I could pick one

593
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,679
um I don't know man like there's so many

594
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,919
we just did a bunch of different stuff I

595
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,679
mean I even have to get the list out to

596
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,640
tell you it's like that you know there

597
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,840
there's like 26 different ones that we

598
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,120
re rocked you know but I did like I did

599
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,119
have a lot of problems with the banana

600
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,079
OG that's kind of a outside of my realm

601
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,918
and we started to do a little C like

602
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,839
Crossing with some things we've made

603
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,960
females we've selected of our own stuff

604
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,678
like the dog roller

605
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,960
um the uh the diesel poison like I

606
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,640
mentioned the pole dog you know things

607
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,278
like that we're starting to cross into

608
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,640
that and see what we find there maybe

609
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,679
there's going be some good [ __ ] there

610
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,480
but um nothing really that I feel like I

611
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,000
just try not to fall in love it's like

612
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,440
you know I I get I can I can go I can

613
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,839
get all emotional about something pretty

614
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,240
quick so I try to check myself and you

615
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,240
know play it out let things just kind

616
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:31,599
of you know and try not to have too high

617
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,678
of EXP expectations bigger low you know

618
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,639
yeah certainly certainly I always think

619
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,400
to myself like I'll have a few favorites

620
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,278
and maybe one or two of them will pan

621
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,360
out to be what I hoped and maybe the

622
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:46,720
others don't and then there'll always be

623
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,918
one that I wasn't particularly invested

624
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,079
in that proves to be like one of the

625
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,520
really good pairings and so I guess it's

626
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,798
kind of what you're saying you know like

627
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:59,558
it's just you can't really call it

628
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:01,319
either way no because I mean you more

629
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:02,798
more times than not I get surprised you

630
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,200
know like this is not one that I had a

631
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:08,359
lot of Hope in and then boom there it is

632
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,759
you know so I kind just stay out of that

633
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,479
you know learned to do that with many

634
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,519
things in my life even with

635
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,919
this there you go and I wanted to ask I

636
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,599
saw I believe in your stories or

637
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:23,159
somewhere that you're looking to retire

638
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:26,359
the bx2 male and upgrade to the bx3 only

639
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,080
tell me a bit about it you know it just

640
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,719
it it came down like this like I kept

641
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,918
them both because I when I made

642
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,278
different crosses with each one you know

643
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,120
the same cross but with th each uh male

644
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,798
you know sometimes I would find better

645
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,119
qualities or and traits in one versus

646
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:44,119
the other and often sometimes it was the

647
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:45,879
bx2 that was that had the the better

648
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,519
traits and so I figured well we better

649
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,200
keep it around but it wasn't that it

650
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,038
wasn't like that big of a difference and

651
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,519
as time went on the more we did that the

652
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:56,319
more we looked it really was like it

653
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,839
became like obvious like we've moved on

654
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,759
from it you know so we just we retired

655
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,240
it is she he's gone now we don't even

656
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:06,558
have him anymore we decided to put him

657
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:10,759
down so um it just maybe a little bit

658
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,200
too like overthinking it um and then

659
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,558
after that was over it was like well we

660
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,480
don't really need this anymore so let's

661
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:18,038
Let it go you know I crossed with the

662
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,798
Kim sis and you know I couldn't tell

663
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:24,440
which one was better I felt at one time

664
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,240
that the uh the the bx2 was better and

665
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,840
so I kept that one that was probably the

666
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,399
one that made me keep it the mo like

667
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,240
that was the one was like oh I think you

668
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:33,918
know I like this better so I'm going to

669
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,519
keep this but you know time and space

670
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,919
and like space is a big thing and we

671
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,440
just don't have room for it anymore we

672
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,799
we want to put more males in so um there

673
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,440
was nothing really wrong with it it was

674
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,599
just like it just kind of was like

675
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,798
what's the point you know so I I decide

676
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:49,000
to retire it you know no that makes

677
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,519
sense and I guess the the next question

678
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,919
is do you have any plans to make a

679
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:59,200
bx4 well I've made a bx4 um and then one

680
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,399
that b

681
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,159
2009 was it

682
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:07,359
2019 when I was still in sowa County we

683
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:10,360
had the fires come through really close

684
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,398
and we had to be evacuated and I was i'

685
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,918
just taken clones of everything to

686
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:17,678
replace all my mothers um and the

687
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,919
evacuations became

688
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,720
mandatory and where I was living at the

689
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,200
time it was like at a very high vantage

690
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,600
point in snow County I could actually

691
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,880
see the fires which as a bird flies

692
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:32,278
maybe 20 miles away maybe not

693
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,640
and you know when those when those um

694
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:36,278
what do they call those things the uh L

695
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,600
Diablo is that what they call those wins

696
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:42,720
L Diablo winds come through they can get

697
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,879
so strong this happens quite often I

698
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,519
think it's happening right now in

699
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,039
Northern California um when it hap when

700
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,599
that happens and it happens you know

701
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:53,319
September October the wind gusts can be

702
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,038
so dry the humidity can drop so low and

703
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,879
the winds can be so powerful that they

704
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,879
can do this phenomenal I figur what they

705
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,039
call it but where the fire jumps from

706
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,960
Treetop to Treetop and it can spread so

707
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,558
fast at that point that you know you

708
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,440
really literally have to keep an eye on

709
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:10,200
it you like the evacuations make sense

710
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,480
when that kind of situation arises

711
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,840
something they can't predict um so we

712
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,519
you know I grow weed so I stayed put

713
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,480
during the mandatory evacuations no

714
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,798
power you know the power's already been

715
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,360
off for a few days before these

716
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:26,558
evacuations come uh because of the fire

717
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:30,079
and luckily for me I had everything

718
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:33,240
rooted in rockwool and so I I what I did

719
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,678
is I set up my RV with my sunlight my

720
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,640
Skylight I put the Clones in I you know

721
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,720
I don't put them in there because I have

722
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,080
a generator but I have a spot ready for

723
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,200
them in case I have to blaze really

724
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,759
quick I fill up the art this is like

725
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,319
something became like um you know a

726
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,759
regular occurrence you know something we

727
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,678
had to do all the time set you know put

728
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,960
all the finance you know all the papers

729
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,480
all the important papers all the photos

730
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,079
the crystals the CD collection all in

731
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,960
the RV

732
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:03,199
and waiting for us to evacuate and then

733
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,440
I put the RV in front of my location and

734
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,840
then I would hide the generators between

735
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,759
you know behind the RV between the house

736
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,439
hiding them from the street because it's

737
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,879
a mandatory evacuation we're not

738
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,840
supposed to be there so we would go up

739
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,200
to the top of the hill on foot and we

740
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,959
would watch and see how the fire is

741
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,759
doing we could also see if any Authority

742
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,399
law enforcement or fire department was

743
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,519
coming up the hill um because we're not

744
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,239
supposed to be there and then we would

745
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,919
shut the generators off we also had

746
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,440
solar uh battery so we could have all of

747
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,278
our lights and refrigerators and you

748
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,240
know our refrigerator and stuff on but

749
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,839
no grow lights and we would shut all

750
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,759
that [ __ ] off before they got to our

751
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:43,359
street you know it was a [ __ ] CAD

752
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:45,398
Mouse game um so it went on for almost I

753
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,439
I believe that time it was like 10 we 10

754
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:50,239
days you know it was a long time um

755
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,798
there's a lot going on you're not really

756
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,240
you shouldn't if you drive away from

757
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:56,558
your house you can't come back that's

758
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,120
another thing you know so once you leave

759
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,798
you can't come back you once you leave

760
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,959
you have to be ready to not come back um

761
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:05,278
so food all that water all these things

762
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,600
you know you have to be ready for that

763
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,880
and when that happened I I didn't lose

764
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:13,798
anything except for the bx4 that I was

765
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,159
working on um I didn't really get a lot

766
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:18,158
that feedback on it yet I didn't find do

767
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,120
a lot of testing with it I did cross

768
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,960
with the headband and we released it at

769
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:26,199
that Harvest uh cup and

770
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,000
Worster uh was it that year I think it

771
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,240
was that year it's right before

772
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,919
but anyway um so and then once I lost it

773
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,120
I just kind of I kind of haven't gone

774
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,480
down that road so um you know with what

775
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,479
we're doing next there's going to be a

776
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,200
lot of Clone only released and I'm

777
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,640
working constantly on you know the back

778
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,919
you know in the background of my life

779
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm just working on an IBL Kim dog IBL

780
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,559
and it's kind of like I feel like it's

781
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,959
GNA maybe never happen or it's going to

782
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:59,558
take the rest of my life to make it

783
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,840
happen and so the bx4 was part of that

784
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:03,720
um we we are getting ready to go through

785
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,398
all the rest of the bx3 seeds that I

786
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,759
have uh to select females and maybe to

787
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,359
take the Fe the male one more step I'm

788
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:11,879
going to spray the male I'm going to

789
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,278
spray the males that I select and kind

790
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,320
of figure out what we got from that do

791
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:19,519
maybe do some testing here with the lab

792
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:23,158
the local lab here um tpin

793
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,480
cannaboids um once we reverse it if that

794
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,200
seems like a good idea at the time but

795
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,200
right now with everything else going on

796
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,440
it's just kind of like on a side burner

797
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,159
you know there you go and I I wanted to

798
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,278
ask I've seen some cool crosses popping

799
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,919
up in your stories like some some

800
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:40,880
pollinated moms for some upcoming

801
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,799
projects I guess and the thing that sort

802
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,399
of grabbed my attention the most was

803
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,558
there was quite a few mums in there that

804
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,599
were like new to the Arsenal and I I

805
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,599
wasn't necessarily expect them to pop up

806
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,480

30% on the THC Total so we put that one

880
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,240
in there and then my lady made some f2s

881
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,119

882
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:21,918

884
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,440

891
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,440

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,440

896

900
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,280
slaps that was from Gabby and then we

901

did the slice have you ever heard of

902
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,000

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,559
made Calo right yeah Calo and his skunk

904

905
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,719
then we did a strawberry diesel we're

906
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:23,239
hoping we can put some more P pump oom

907
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:26,358
into that and ton so the Talon's been a

908
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:29,118
nice one that one's like a 7% uh yielder

909

912
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:37,679
not sure I have to check with Gabby on

913
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,159
some of those those are cuts that he all

914
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:43,598
that he passed to me he loves his exotic

915
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,719
doesn't he he I guess he does yeah I

916
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,320
he's got a you know his library is

917
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,639
surprising knowing him you know I don't

918
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,760
know you know he's uh he's turned me on

919
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:54,358
some some new [ __ ] I like that yeah very

920
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,079
surprising unexpected but he's turning

921
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:59,719
me on some newer newer school stuff you

922
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,039

923
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:05,439
her selection of triangle Kush by

924
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:08,759
Irene and then that's and then we did

925
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,679
the White Widow the Sharon cut we did

926
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,520
yeah a lot of people have been asking

927
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,039
about that one so I figured we we'll run

928
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:15,318
that one I believe there's some other

929
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,920
ones but those are those are all the

930
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:19,239
ones I can find right I mean while we're

931
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,159
on that topic before we transition

932
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:24,039
what's your thoughts on the future of

933
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:26,559
flower do you feel like demands growing

934
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:28,599
falling where do you see

935
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,559
flower I don't know if I have a good

936
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:33,640
perspective of that but my perspective

937
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:36,039
is is that it's the same as it ever it

938
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:37,799
was that there's some people who just

939
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,318
want cheap weed to get high with and

940
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,800
there's some people who you know want

941
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:47,079
The Connoisseur Grade weed um I think

942
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,960
that when you have those two types of

943
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,519
consumers I think you're always going to

944
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,119
get more exposed to the one who wants to

945
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:56,159
save a few bucks on a Friday afternoon

946
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,119
before their weekend you know um so they

947
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,679
have the most joints possible to smoke

948
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,559
during the weekend but there's still

949
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,838
that you know we get people out here

950
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,119
that come to the shop that fly from you

951
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:08,318
know pretty far away and we happen to be

952
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,358
part of their trip you know here at

953
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:14,599
Lucky Dog you know Boseman Montana is a

954
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:17,078
um it's a tourist destination you know

955
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:18,880
Yellowstone Parks here um for the

956
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,800
summertime and then in the winter time

957
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,680
we have some great skiing snowboarding

958
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,480
here at Big Sky and briger bll and so we

959
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,679
do get a lot of Tourism here that's

960
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,440
basically the industry that that the

961
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,719
town has if it has one this area it's

962
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,720
not really just this town but this area

963
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,879
and so you know just uh funny little

964
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:40,639
story about that so in February this guy

965
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,480
I think he called the shop he found the

966
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,480
shop like on Google you know called it

967
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,079
up he talked to my employee Sarah and he

968
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,159

971
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,920
to keep that on the Shelf it sells out

972
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:57,118
really quick um but we have a little bit

973
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,119

month so she's like okay so he she says

977
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,039
we have like a half an ounce of it

978
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,480

979
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,599
he's like will you save it for me and

980
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,480
she's like yeah let me ask uh let me ask

981
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,559
you know the boss so she asked me I'm

982
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,159
like yeah of course I mean that'd be

983
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:22,920
interesting if he actually shows up and

984
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:25,118
gets it so let's see what happens so he

985
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,599
did he comes back like you know a month

986
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,079
or he comes like in a month and you know

987
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,160

988
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:32,519

989
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,598

990
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,800

and the shirts and the [ __ ] bought a

996
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,199
bunch of flour him and his wife did and

997
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:52,799
and I I remember just looking at his

998
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:54,960
wife and she was like what the [ __ ] she

999
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,200
was just looking at like I just kept

1000
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,800
catching this look like what are we

1001
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:00,919
doing like this is what we came for you

1002
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,480
know and he gets his half ounce of Kim

1003
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,480
dog that we put away for him you know it

1004
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,358
was the last bit we had and um so he

1005
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,639
that all happens we take pictures it was

1006
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:12,199
a big deal and then just yesterday

1007
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,239
coincidentally just yesterday we get a

1008
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:17,279
package in the mail and it's from this

1009
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:19,959
fella and uh and so he sends us he had

1010
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,519
like these tie Dy made he was a 49ers

1011
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,440
fan like myself when we were talking

1012
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,400
about that when he was here and he had

1013
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,639
these tie-dyes made with like a pot leaf

1014
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,960
on it and and then the rest of the

1015
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:32,039
backgrounds Red Gold you know like the

1016
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,440
49ers color and then he wrote a little

1017
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,318
note saying hey you know we're both

1018
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,760
49ers fans and I appreciate the you know

1019
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:38,960
you guys saving the weed for me and

1020
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,599
here's shirts for everybody there was

1021
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,720
like five shirts in the thing you know

1022
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,480
and so like that's awesome we get a lot

1023
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,439
of that you know so my perspective is a

1024
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,480
little skewed because of stuff like that

1025
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,079
you know um but so but I would say on

1026
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,559
The Daily like people just want to like

1027
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,480
they just want to relax they want the

1028
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,838
effect of weed you know they want to I

1029
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,280
don't want to break the bank on it

1030
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:02,679
although the weed is about as cheap as

1031
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,599
you can you know as you can [ __ ]

1032
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:07,239
produce it and sell it for but um I

1033
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,359
don't know I think it's about the same

1034
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,358
if anything there's more people

1035
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,318
smoking um I'm not even sure if that's

1036
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:16,239
true actually but in my perspective

1037
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,159
there's probably more people smoking and

1038
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,959
they're probably a different customer

1039
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,480
than I've ever been around they're just

1040
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,880
they're just want to get their their

1041
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,960
herb and they want to like you know

1042
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,119
enjoy it and you know kind of that's

1043
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,318
their thing and they don't want to spend

1044
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,039
a lot of money on it so if they want to

1045
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:33,679
get like older weed or Smalls as you say

1046
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,358
you know then they'll take that if it's

1047
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,279
at a discount then there's people that

1048
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:38,559
just want the best you know so I think

1049
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,400
it's the

1050
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:43,000
same yeah totally look that's that's an

1051
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,519
interesting perspective for sure and I

1052
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,280
guess as like an extension of that where

1053
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,000
do you see the price point going do you

1054
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,519
think we've hit the rock bottom with

1055
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,280
quality flower whereby it's going to

1056
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,639
start to pick up again or do you think

1057
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,880
there might still be a little more to go

1058
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:02,519
what's your

1059
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,079
suspicion I don't really know if I know

1060
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,119
I don't know if I have a good view for

1061
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,640
that but I would say that what I think

1062
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,760
when that comes up is that you know

1063
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:17,000
indoor cannabis which you know is easily

1064
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,040
more you know popular or more desired or

1065
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,440
whatever than than anything else any

1066
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,079
other way you can grow it that seems to

1067
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,559
be there's a bottom to where you just

1068
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,960
you can't produce it you know there no

1069
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,719
matter how much you grow there's only so

1070
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,880
much you can produce at a certain price

1071
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:31,679
I mean you can go the more you produce

1072
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,838
the more efficient you are the lower you

1073
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,879
can you know um you know the lower the

1074
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:38,039
price can be when you sell it but you

1075
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,480
know I think there's still the bottom I

1076
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:42,039
mean you still have rent you still got

1077
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,800
electricity you still got those things

1078
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:45,079
so I I just I don't know how close we

1079
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,400
are to that but it feels to me like

1080
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,039
we're pretty darn close you know um I

1081
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,599
don't know I I I think we're pretty

1082
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,920
close to that we've dropped our prices

1083
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,880
but now we've literally you know I I'm

1084
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,838
embarrassed to say this but we've

1085
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,358
literally succumbed to the cannaboid

1086
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,838
levels being the price point so now at

1087
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:04,960
Lucky Dog when you come here you can get

1088
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:06,519
what when when the THC levels are here

1089
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,280
you it's this much when it's here it's

1090
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:10,559
this much when it's here it's this much

1091
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,640
you know I tried to like fight the power

1092
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,960
as you say and tried to educate the

1093
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,519
customers but I'm just one guy you know

1094
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,480
the numbers mean everything to the to

1095
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:19,480
the folks who smoke they just don't they

1096
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,639
don't know it's our it's our

1097
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,480
responsibility to educate them but it's

1098
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:27,199
not as easy as it sounds it's easier

1099
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,000
said than done does that mean that like

1100
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,199
some of the more Legacy strains like say

1101
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,800
like your Durban Poison your chem dog

1102
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,879
like it's sort of not economically

1103
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,559
viable to grow them now because they

1104
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,119
they're going to be in the lower tier

1105
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,720
even though it doesn't reflect the

1106
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,440
quality or the

1107
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:46,318
demand well the Kim dog is always around

1108
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,679
29 30% so that one always goes off the

1109
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,558
shelf whether or not you've ever heard

1110
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:54,480
of it before people gravitate towards it

1111
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:57,319
so um but Legacy strains indeed like we

1112
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,838
were we've been pushing uh you know we

1113
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:00,440
keep bringing up but the Killer Queen we

1114
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:02,519
have that one it's a really nice string

1115
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,800
you know and we've been pushing that on

1116
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,239
people and they'll they'll come back and

1117
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,440
buy it but it's like 18 20 21 percent so

1118
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,519
people don't it's that initial

1119
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,960
gravitating you know like if you just

1120
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,000
were like if if people could just pick

1121
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,400
up weed and just smell it and be with it

1122
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,599
for a minute you know the way

1123
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,200
traditionally we always have been then

1124
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,519
it might be different but they're just

1125
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:23,679
looking at numbers and they're looking

1126
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,719
at a jar with weed in it you know so

1127
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,199
they don't gravitate towards that stuff

1128
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,078
you have to kind of push it on and not

1129
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,838
really push it but kind of you know turn

1130
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:33,480
them on to it really um you know it

1131
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,279
smells great so just take a smell of

1132
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,119
this but we always tell people here like

1133
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,400
listen it doesn't matter how much D it

1134
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,920
has nothing to do with it we have

1135
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,400
strains that are 18% it'll [ __ ] knock

1136
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,838
your socks off compared to you know the

1137
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,639
latest one you heard about that's at 31%

1138
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:50,358
it's just it's not that simple um can we

1139
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,759
explain it to you no nobody can because

1140
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:53,719
we haven't really studied it to the

1141
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,000
point where we understand it but we tell

1142
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:57,078
them what we know we tell them that you

1143
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,119
know the different levels and

1144
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:01,318
combinations of the cannaboids the

1145
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,240
different tpin you know the combinations

1146
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:05,719
of them they all affect the THC and the

1147
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:08,199
way it interacts with your brain but you

1148
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:10,959
know at some point like we're just like

1149
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,159
talking to a wall you know just to be

1150
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,519
honest you know like it's just there's

1151
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:17,399
only so much we can do to kind of push

1152
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,358
back on that you know it's just it's

1153
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,440
that's the way it is you know like the

1154
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,199
states

1155
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:27,119
regulate based on THC percentages they

1156
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:29,159
just do so if that's the case then that

1157
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,039
has to mean something to the consumer

1158
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:34,239
and it means something but maybe not as

1159
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:36,199
much as they think it means and so they

1160
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:39,159
still grab gravitate towards the higher

1161
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:40,879
numbers you know like here in Montana

1162
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:43,399
which you know this is Montana like this

1163
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,880
isn't like your standard American Market

1164
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,318
I understand that but here in Montana

1165
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,640
like even on the wholesale level now

1166
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:52,159
it's trickled to that it's like you know

1167
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:53,838
look at this amazing Wei was the COA and

1168
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:57,078
you're like well here's the COA like

1169
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:58,480
yeah I can't sell that you know so it's

1170
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,039
kind of sad I think it's kind of sad but

1171
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,440
we're never going to stop we're always

1172
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:04,119
going to have all those they're going to

1173
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,318
be here you know we love them they

1174
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,838
deserve to be showcased we're not going

1175
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,519
to like fall in line and just grow high

1176
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:13,639
percentage thcs you know we're not doing

1177
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:15,199
that here so um but truthfully it does

1178
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:18,039
matter you know that's just being honest

1179
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,318
it does matter to to bottom line it

1180
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:22,519
matters you

1181
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:25,639
know something which is sort of like the

1182
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:26,800
50 to 100 Year extension of that

1183
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:30,000
question that I've been thinking a lot

1184
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,359
about recently is do you think that you

1185
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,800
know say in 50 or 100 years we're going

1186
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:37,318
to get to a point where sort of like

1187
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,119
where the wine world's at where there's

1188
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:43,039
only really like 40 well-known great

1189
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,119
varietals that are grown and there's not

1190
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,318
really much great breeding going on do

1191
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,160
you think we'll get to that point with

1192
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,400
cannabis or there'll always remain a

1193
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,879
demand for a much greater diversity of

1194
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:58,200
offering I think I think that that's

1195
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:01,079
where cannabis and wine grapes differ um

1196
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:03,318
there's certainly a a wide variety of

1197
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:06,440
flavor in the grape you know the wine

1198
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:08,079
grape world for sure there is um but

1199
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,000
there's generally I don't know how many

1200
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,318
strains that you know wine grap started

1201
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,159
off with maybe you know but you know how

1202
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:15,440
many how many different flavor profiles

1203
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,358
of cannabis have I think cannabis is

1204
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,760
different because of the flavor I think

1205
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,679
I think it separates a little bit I

1206
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,520
think it's more of a um you know a wine

1207
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,960
maker can change the flavor you know

1208
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,079
like

1209
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,838
soil terar can change the flavor of wine

1210
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,318
you know cannabis is different you know

1211
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,679
we grow it indoors you know we both we

1212
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,480
generally use some semi-sterile Medias

1213
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:40,078
when we grow it doesn't have a lot to do

1214
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,039
with it the plant itself does all of the

1215
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,280
with certain environmental inputs and

1216
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,159
and um other inputs I think that

1217
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,839
cannabis can demonstrate different

1218
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:52,000
flavor profiles strain by strain but

1219
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,599
generally the strains themselves with

1220
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,800
the variety of so I I I actually don't

1221
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,318
think so I think that we're going to

1222
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,599
probably have more strains we want now

1223
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,358
and we probably have more strains than

1224
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,119
we want going to the Future even more I

1225
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:07,199
think that's what separates cannabis and

1226
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:09,000
wine grapes is that for whatever reason

1227
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,639
there's just a wider variety of flavor

1228
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,239
in cannabis than Wine you know although

1229
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:16,239
there's a lot of variation wine grapes

1230
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:18,358
and even wines grown year to year

1231
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,919
different regions are grown all those

1232
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,480
things but cannabis is more it's simp

1233
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,960
it's simpler I guess you could say it's

1234
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,519
like this strain tastes this way this

1235
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,358
strain tastes that way and they don't

1236
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:30,079
taste anything alike but they're still

1237
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,400
cannabis they're both cannabis right

1238
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,800
yeah definitely no and that's that's

1239
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,400
actually a really interesting point I

1240
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,240
hadn't considered that yeah the

1241
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,960
diversity of uh flavor in cannabis

1242
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:42,000
certainly makes it a distinguishing

1243
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,559
thing before we move on to the Grateful

1244
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,400
head which we'll jump into in just a

1245
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,319
moment I wanted to ask one last question

1246
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,599
which is that almost everyone I've

1247
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:52,358
spoken to who makes or sells seeds in

1248
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,680
the past say 10 episode has mentioned to

1249
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:57,039
some effect that it just feels like the

1250
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,519
demand for feminized seeds is ever in

1251
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,759
increasing have you considered doing

1252
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,838
some fem work for the public or at least

1253
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,599
have you had any thoughts on it you know

1254
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:10,358
we we actually have and we've uh

1255
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:13,440
collected some pollen here stored it um

1256
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:15,159
definitely not against it but um I don't

1257
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,599
think I have any fresh ideas when it

1258
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:20,480
comes to feminized seeds that aren't

1259
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:22,440
already being done you know um but with

1260
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,838
that being said we are definitely going

1261
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:29,599
to focus on making some feminized seeds

1262
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:31,279
this year um we're actually you know STS

1263
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,280
spray is you know it's pretty it's

1264
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,839
pretty standard thing but you know we

1265
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,640
have our own that we've mixed up and we

1266
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:41,519
sell over at at uh breeders direct

1267
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:42,558
seedco um so you know we we uh we're

1268
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,199
definitely going to be selling some

1269
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,880
femin we're going to be producing some

1270
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:49,279
this year we haven't we've produced only

1271
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,240
enough for us to do a little testing in

1272
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,599
inhouse um we need to get through those

1273
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,919
and pick which ones that we're going to

1274
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,760
put in production but you know we we um

1275
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,760
there's nothing against them they just

1276
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,480
there's nothing really there's no new

1277
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,240
ideas there not that I have any fresh

1278
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,159
ideas with regular seeds but uh it feels

1279
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:09,919
more fresh than you know just taking two

1280
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:12,239
clone ones and Crossing them uh in a

1281
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,400
feminized Manner and selling the seeds I

1282
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,279
mean I think there's already enough of

1283
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,039
that out there so it's not something

1284
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,359
that it's not like a big passion M I

1285
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,759
don't feel like it might pay the bills

1286
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:22,679
but it's not like something that I'm

1287
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,920
like oh God I can't wait to see what we

1288
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:28,118
can come up with do you know what I mean

1289
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,920
sure so it's it's not like a fresh idea

1290
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:32,519
to me

1291
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,798
um you know I've grown some feminized

1292
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:38,119
seeds out I my experience I've never

1293
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:40,039
been like super duper thrilled with it I

1294
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:44,039
don't really agree that it's a way to

1295
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:46,358
like um making s1's I my experience and

1296
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:47,960
and and watching others that have made

1297
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,400
them and and growing their stuff I don't

1298
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,358
really feel like that's a great

1299
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,720
preservation method I don't really feel

1300
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:57,838
that way I feel like that tissue culture

1301
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,679
um you know uh synthetic seeds you know

1302
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,519
I think that's a clonal seeds I think

1303
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,480
that's more how I would prefer to do

1304
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:07,719
genetic preservation now we're starting

1305
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,559
to look into like Cryo Storage which is

1306
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:12,078
really complicated stuff but um I'm not

1307
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,160
afraid of complicated stuff I love

1308
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:19,599
complicated stuff and you know to me

1309
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:22,399
it's like at making feminite crosses a

1310
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,000
like I said there's not really some you

1311
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,639
know like amazing idea of creation that

1312
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,920
I have more than what's already being

1313
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:35,519
done making s1's to me it's like I'm

1314
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:38,519
very like um data oriented logical

1315
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,960
oriented like that's for preservation

1316
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:42,798
but then when you look at it yeah it's a

1317
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,159
method of preservation but it's like a

1318
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:47,920
last resort now in 2024 for me and like

1319
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:51,358
you know 2010 it would have made a lot

1320
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,358
more sense for preservation reasons but

1321
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,279
we have the Cannabis has now entered

1322
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:59,480
into the mainstream agriculturally and

1323
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:01,960
now we have real methods to preserve

1324
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,000
genetics long term we don't need to do

1325
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,639
that you know so with that being said I

1326
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,639
I uh I do get a lot of questions about

1327
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:12,879
that and I you know we have all the

1328
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,719
tools here we have all the genetics here

1329
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,680
we are going to make some some feminized

1330
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,759
crosses and some s1s um definitely some

1331
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:21,519
Chim dog family s1s that way you know

1332
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,200
when you get your Kim dog s ones you get

1333
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,920
them from the Kim family and stuff but

1334
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:27,919
um you know that's kind of how I feel

1335
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,639
about it it's doesn't inspire me at all

1336
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,960
you know it's just like um it would be

1337
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,199
meeting a demand but it wouldn't do much

1338
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,798
for me other otherwise other than maybe

1339
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,039
pay a bill or two you know sure know

1340
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:41,599
that that's understandable you've got

1341
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:44,838
some other projects and let's dive into

1342
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,280
it I mean the last time I spoke to you

1343
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:50,279
you were really passionate in talking

1344
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,559
about getting a lab going of your own at

1345
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,280
that time it wasn't this current

1346
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,640
manifestation of the Grateful head so

1347
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,880
I'd love to know how did you sort of

1348
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,879
progress since that time to where we are

1349
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,440
now and get involved in this current

1350
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:07,318
project and tell us a bit about

1351
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:10,119
it um well so of course getting into it

1352
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:12,400
like I told you before it's uh it was a

1353
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:14,440
personal thing you know when you have a

1354
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,240
lot of when you have a large library and

1355
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,838
anyone out there who has one will tell

1356
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:22,279
you it consumes your life um there's no

1357
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:25,000
vacations there's no you know there's no

1358
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:27,000
going away out of town without a lot of

1359
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,719
you know problems that you have to solve

1360
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,559
before you even leave and um you know

1361
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,000
that's fine but as time goes by it's

1362
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,798
like gez man you're getting older you

1363
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,039
want to go have a life so storage is

1364
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:39,639
really important like I said we have a

1365
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:41,239
lot of cultivars here that we'll never

1366
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:43,039
leave our hands we'll always take care

1367
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:45,078
of them but they're not really popular

1368
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,358
at the time maybe they will be popular

1369
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,960
we don't also don't really care if

1370
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:50,119
they're popular they're just they're

1371
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,280
Standalone genetics that deserve to be

1372
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,680
preserved and that's what we do that's

1373
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,079
something that I'm known for that's

1374
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,598
something that I'll always be doing it's

1375
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,720
I I can't help it I'm I'm like a weirdo

1376
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:03,480
about it I'm like a collector or

1377
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:06,279
something you know so um so naturally

1378
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:09,400
like tissue culture um is a way to do

1379
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,280
that so and that's like the basis of it

1380
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,798
and so that's the motivation and like

1381
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,440
I've said before I went through a lot of

1382
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:19,679
I talked to a lot of lab operators about

1383
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,880
their services and see if there could be

1384
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:25,118
some sort of partnership and I just

1385
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,000
couldn't get past the parts of I just

1386
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,760
couldn't feel it you know I I just maybe

1387
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,159
it's ridiculous but I couldn't feel that

1388
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,680
connection I couldn't feel that I

1389
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:35,598
couldn't feel that honesty I couldn't

1390
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:39,078
feel like that real true let's work

1391
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,720
together for the plant um you know

1392
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:44,079
probably overthinking it probably I'm a

1393
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:46,679
hard ass but still so I decided to take

1394
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:49,079
it on my own a long time ago you know

1395
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:51,199
well not a long time ago but years ago

1396
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:54,079
but it's a process so you got to teach

1397
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,679
yourself and I took courses I took

1398
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,240
training um I actually took my training

1399
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:00,879
in Northampton which is where the Kim

1400
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:02,000
dogs he was popped coincidentally uh it

1401
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,160
turned out to be

1402
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,039
coincidentally um you know learned how

1403
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:09,920
to do you know synthetic seeds learned

1404
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:13,159
how to do noal tissue culture learned

1405
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,358
about the Cannabis and plant aseptic

1406
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:16,679
practices had some background on that

1407
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:19,039
because I'm you know I've got a little

1408
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:22,719
bit of myology under my belt for my own

1409
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:25,279
personal growing and then um and then of

1410
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,838
course Mary stem harvesting uh which is

1411
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,000
kind of the Pinnacle of that for me so

1412
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:31,960
and then and then learning about

1413
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,199
hormones plant hormones how to how to um

1414
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,400
manipulate plants with hormones cannabis

1415
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:39,358
plants so um that's where it started and

1416
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,000
it's like okay now what all right now

1417
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,159
you got to get the lab going so here at

1418
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,318
the shop you know we we had a mother

1419
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:47,920
room we shut the mother room down rented

1420
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:49,679
another spot across the parking lot here

1421
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,039
now that's the mother room which is

1422
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,960
better size for the mother room and

1423
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:56,440
turned the previous mother room into a

1424
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:59,159
tissue culture lab and got into it

1425
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,760
started doing it and started to find out

1426
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,920
that it was a lot more to learn than I

1427
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,480
even knew like yes we're clear of hop

1428
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,400
and vroid here but there's more to it

1429
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,760
than that the the pathogens that are

1430
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,838
really you know the ones that are really

1431
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,000
preventing you from seeing the choid

1432
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:16,838
potential the turpine potential and just

1433
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,519
the the the growth potential like the

1434
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:22,519
the Vigor is you know they they fungal

1435
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:23,798
end endites there's bacterial endites

1436
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,679
and those things are systemic in

1437
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:27,679
cannabis some of them are beneficial to

1438
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,038
cannabis and some of a lots most of them

1439
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:32,598
are not and you know plants picked this

1440
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,440
up over years and years and years of

1441
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:37,400
storage in traditional manner

1442
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,838
traditional cloning um traditional just

1443
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,358
mother rooms you know bringing in

1444
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,759
mothers mothers leaving there's all

1445
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:43,719
kinds of [ __ ] that goes on that we don't

1446
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,640
even see stuff that we don't even have

1447
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:48,879
names for really and so as I started

1448
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:51,440
putting all my library into nodal tissue

1449
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,680
culture I started to real because you

1450
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,519
know just just to like kind of make some

1451
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:59,000
understanding of that is that you know

1452
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:01,559
if you're free and clear of hopl and

1453
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,639
vroid and you know other more serious

1454
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:07,680
viruses or but really hopl and vroid and

1455
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:10,400
cannabis um you know then you can just

1456
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,118
skip the marry stem harvesting

1457
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,880
theoretically and just jump right into

1458
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,240
um noal tissue culture where as opposed

1459
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,880
to taking the Mary stem and in case

1460
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:22,318
anybody doesn't understand this the Mary

1461
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:24,880
stem is at the apical point of a plant

1462
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:26,798
so the very new shoot that pops out the

1463
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,280
very first shoot in any brand in any

1464
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,280
location has what they call a merry stem

1465
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,079
at the very tip and the merry stem has

1466
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,039
got all the genetic um the genetic code

1467
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,839
of that cultivar however it hasn't been

1468
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,400
connected to the vascular system of the

1469
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:43,119
plant yet so those pathogens that I talk

1470
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,039
about the endites the the bacterial

1471
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:49,119
endites the fungal endites and any

1472
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:51,160
viruses or viroids hot plade and vroid

1473
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,798
they haven't crossed over into that

1474
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:56,239
material yet so what that means is that

1475
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:58,159
if you harvest that successfully and put

1476
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:00,639
put it in vitro in tissue culture and a

1477
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:03,798
sterile environment to grow um with a

1478
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:05,679
nutrient-rich you know Ager then you can

1479
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:08,960
grow that plan out from something the

1480
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:11,519
size of a pen head um you know it's it's

1481
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,559
almost too small to see with your eye

1482
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:15,838
and um it takes some time but it'll grow

1483
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,760
out of that you know we we can

1484
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,920
manipulate it with hormones to grow from

1485
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,240
that if that happens and we're

1486
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,400
successful once those Sho start coming

1487
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,719
out after time we can subculture those

1488
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,318
into other

1489
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:32,199
um uh sterile environments and keep the

1490
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:35,159
root system off of them but still

1491
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:39,000
multiply them once again um you know

1492
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:41,000
manipulating them with with hormones so

1493
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,358
I don't didn't really feel like I needed

1494
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,599
to do that I started putting my library

1495
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:47,279
in so I started doing nodal tissue

1496
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,640
culture which means I'm just taking a

1497
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,559
plant and I'm taking a node and I'm

1498
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:53,798
getting rid of all the material I can

1499
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:56,200
off at leaf and leaving just the the

1500
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:58,318
smallest part of the node and then I st

1501
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:00,038
St iiz that surfac because I can't

1502
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:03,639
sterilize it internally but I sterilize

1503
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:05,319
it on the surface with you know bleach a

1504
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:08,639
bleach solution some people have used

1505
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:11,960
ethanol but 10% 15% to 20% bleach

1506
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:14,000
solution 15 minutes agitating is usually

1507
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,599
considered enough and then you put it

1508
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,039
into your you know all this is done

1509
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,519
under sterile conditions you put it in

1510
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:21,319
your sterile medium and then you can

1511
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,920
grow it it'll start growing and we've

1512
00:58:21,318 --> 00:58:24,759
all seen that I think most people

1513
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,358
understand what that is now so what I

1514
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,160
found out is is that even though I was

1515
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:33,400
free and clear of vroid which is you

1516
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:36,719
know a piece of RNA um I did have like

1517
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:39,798
any plant will have that's you know any

1518
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,959
amount of time years old especially 30

1519
00:58:39,798 --> 00:58:43,159
years old is going to have some

1520
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,559
bacterial indites in it or maybe even a

1521
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:48,719
fungal so I found that out what does

1522
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:51,039
that mean it means that so okay when you

1523
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:54,118
do any kind of like you

1524
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:56,160
know um aseptic practice you know like

1525
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:58,640
when you do any kind of like tissue

1526
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:00,440
culture or if you're in micology and you

1527
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:02,000
and you've done anything like that you

1528
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,639
know within a few days if you have

1529
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,480
contamination you know you'll see the

1530
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:08,879
contamination growing on your media um

1531
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,920
what a bacterial a systemic bacterial

1532
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,720
ight will will will demonstrate you

1533
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,000
won't see it for two three four weeks

1534
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:22,759
after you've determined your culture is

1535
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,199
uh contaminant free um so like I said

1536
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:27,200
that was something I wasn't really

1537
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:28,598
prepared for and what what that what

1538
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:30,598
that made me realize is like even though

1539
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,559
I don't have I'm not dealing with hop

1540
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:36,359
late and vroid here at the time knock on

1541
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:38,200
wood um you know there's other things to

1542
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:40,480
deal with and so even though you don't

1543
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:43,318
have that vroid those other IND fights

1544
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,039
are what are making you or or or what's

1545
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:46,719
your what you're seeing in an expression

1546
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:50,079
of your plant that is not what it used

1547
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,959
to be you know declined choid declin T

1548
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:55,559
declined tpine levels those types of

1549
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,559
things this more finite you know of the

1550
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:59,160
what's going off the plant you know when

1551
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,960
you put a plant into tissue culture

1552
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:04,199
there's a couple things going on first

1553
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,679
off if if you have if you successfully

1554
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:09,358
initiate a PL in tissue culture and you

1555
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:10,440
don't see any you know fungal growth and

1556
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,719
then eventually you don't see any

1557
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,358
bacterial growth well and then you don't

1558
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,838
grow any Roots um on a plant because

1559
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:19,078
that's how it is in tissue culture when

1560
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:20,679
you're multiplying well the plant has

1561
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:22,680
time and by the way this the growth is

1562
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:24,598
slower we can even slow it down with

1563
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:29,480
cold storage which is really beneficial

1564
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:31,960
when it comes to um AAL um repair DNA

1565
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,318
repair of a plant so when people say oh

1566
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,880
these plants you know they came from gen

1567
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:37,480
zero tissue culture look how much

1568
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,680
vibrant they are look how much vigorous

1569
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,240
they are wow they're growing faster than

1570
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,358
all these other plants including the

1571
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:45,558
Clone the traditional clone plant of the

1572
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,719
same strain well the reason why is

1573
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:50,359
because you know the plant has had time

1574
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:52,519
to repair some of its DNA something that

1575
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:55,119
you know I don't think humans are very

1576
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:56,880
adapted doing but plants are plants are

1577
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,720
plants are so adap aable like it's

1578
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,519
beyond you know we don't even understand

1579
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,078
the the adaptation qualities of a plant

1580
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,920
like we don't even appreciate it yet you

1581
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:06,440
know we don't even think about it but if

1582
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,680
you were able to look back through

1583
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,400
history and the evolution of plants and

1584
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:14,078
you know how they've come from the

1585
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:16,599
beginning of time to now you know it's

1586
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,280
it's fascinating it's really amazing but

1587
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:19,760
one of the qualities they've done is one

1588
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,798
of the qualities that a plant has is it

1589
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,520
can repair it's it's alals basically and

1590
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,440
and kind of repairs DNA but also if

1591
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:30,798
you're able able to outgrow any of those

1592
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,440
indites you know one example is you know

1593
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:34,599
when you take clones you know people who

1594
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,280
take lots of clones will understand this

1595
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:38,680
you know sometimes you'll get like this

1596
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,960
brown slime on your CL your roots you

1597
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:41,719
don't understand where it comes from

1598
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,880
doesn't make any sense well that's a

1599
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:46,519
fungus and sometimes that fungus isn't

1600
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,280
even in the air oftentimes it is also in

1601
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:51,960
the air but it can also just be systemic

1602
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:55,079
in the plant and when that plant that um

1603
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:57,240
cutting pops out roots well those uh

1604
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:59,039
those indites go to work and they start

1605
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:01,598
propagating and then so you're starting

1606
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:03,278
to see a fungus there so that's what I'm

1607
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,960
talking about like that type of stuff

1608
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:08,119
you can eliminate those things with with

1609
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,278
uh you know quality tissue culture

1610
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:13,559
practices you can and that's kind of the

1611
01:02:10,278 --> 01:02:15,960
goal so when I when I to back what I was

1612
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:17,960
saying so when I discovered like oh man

1613
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,199
there's more to this than I thought I

1614
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,079
was like I'm gonna have to take my whole

1615
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:22,598
library and put it in the mar like

1616
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:24,278
harvest the Mary stems I didn't think I

1617
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:27,760
was going to have to do that because you

1618
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:30,318
know we test here um at the facility we

1619
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:33,119
have the we use Tumi and now we use Tumi

1620
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:35,079
glow so we can test right here in in in

1621
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,079
house for hop late and that way we can

1622
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:38,920
get regular testing and you know just

1623
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,318
make sure you know we do bring in new

1624
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,318
clones so we have a a protocol for how

1625
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:45,239
they come in and you know the time

1626
01:02:43,318 --> 01:02:46,199
period before they can be tested and the

1627
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:49,358
time period before they can be

1628
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:52,480
introduced to the main population and

1629
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:56,440
you know I'm big on redundancy so I keep

1630
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,920
we keep the practices here as if we have

1631
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,920
problems because we you know just

1632
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,960
because we don't have hop Lon here

1633
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,559
doesn't mean that other things can't be

1634
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,639
spread so we use the same

1635
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:10,599
protocol for sanitary conditions

1636
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:11,960
regardless of you know what's going on

1637
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:14,278
with the library regardless what the

1638
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,119
testing tells us the testing just tells

1639
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:17,798
us where we're at you know it doesn't

1640
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:20,000
give us like you know I've see people

1641
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:21,679
out there they go oh I just tested my

1642
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,318
whole crop and I don't have to worry

1643
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:25,199
about this and this and this in the

1644
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:28,199
protocol and I I disagree with that

1645
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,798
because a we don't you can test a plant

1646
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:31,719
several times before you find out it

1647
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:34,358
actually comes positive because the way

1648
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:37,038
hop plate and vroid uh spreads around a

1649
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:40,798
plant um you know it starts at a at a

1650
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:42,278
wound usually um more I think more often

1651
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,318
than people realize it actually comes

1652
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:46,838
from the root system sharing W water

1653
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:49,079
runoff so you don't always know you know

1654
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:52,078
like you can you can make the wrong

1655
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:53,559
guess as I say when when you make that

1656
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,160
decision so it's better to keep the

1657
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:57,760
protocol in place regardless what the

1658
01:03:55,159 --> 01:04:00,798
testing is you know the people who come

1659
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:03,119
in you know my guy Ginger grower who

1660
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:04,920
goes and takes some Cuts he doesn't know

1661
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,240
if I have a negative or positive you

1662
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,159
know we always we don't have any

1663
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:09,078
positives but there's no need to tell

1664
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:11,199
him because I don't want him to get

1665
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:13,880
comfortable around you know the plants

1666
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:15,798
because he has a false sense of security

1667
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:18,039
about it you know which can easily

1668
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:19,798
happen and I can't say for sure either

1669
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:21,640
because if we're bringing new plants in

1670
01:04:19,798 --> 01:04:24,079
even though they go through the protocol

1671
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:26,480
hoplon affects different affects

1672
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:29,640
different cultivars differently so just

1673
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,880
because it grew super fast in this Maui

1674
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:34,759
dog doesn't mean it's growing fast in

1675
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,640
this whatever you know so some plants it

1676
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,000
hits them really hard and fast and some

1677
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,960
plants they can you know I mean Sour

1678
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,838
Diesel I've seen this with my own eyes

1679
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,838
um you know it can be severely infected

1680
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:49,199
and still produce Cham noid and still

1681
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:51,000
produce tpin you know at high levels it

1682
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,239
can be really difficult to just know

1683
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,880
that you have it you know and so even

1684
01:04:53,239 --> 01:04:57,000
though I've never tested that particular

1685
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,920
plant um for hop plate and virid

1686
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,798
positive or negative I would say that

1687
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,200
you would probably get you know you'd

1688
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:03,960
get different results on the tighter

1689
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:05,439
levels you wouldn't you wouldn't you may

1690
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,960
not know not every test May able to pick

1691
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,079
it up and you may not even test the

1692
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,760
right spot the tests are getting better

1693
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:13,440
you know now we're testing the roots um

1694
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,160
which I think is you know a step in the

1695
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,519
right direction you know it it's better

1696
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:21,318
to understand how things work as opposed

1697
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:22,759
to guessing you know and there's been a

1698
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:24,719
lot of guessing and now we're starting

1699
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,039
to understand things that you know hop

1700
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,038
plate and VI starts a part of the plant

1701
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,640
and then it goes to the root system and

1702
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,520
then eventually it spreads to the new

1703
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:35,440
growth and then from there it spreads to

1704
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:36,838
the older growth you know but not always

1705
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,838
that's just how it usually works so the

1706
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:41,119
point

1707
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:44,440
is just do the protocol you know clean

1708
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,400
your scissors clean your hands 10% at

1709
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,920
least it's okay to use 20% get yourself

1710
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,680
some scissor sharpeners that's going to

1711
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:54,599
dull your scissors you know take the

1712
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:57,278
time you know sanitize your hands give

1713
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,880
it a full 60 seconds why not think about

1714
01:05:57,278 --> 01:06:01,760
what happens if if something goes wrong

1715
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,119
it's worth the time you know so I'm

1716
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,400
getting a little sidetracked here from

1717
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,559
your question I understand that but uh

1718
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:11,000
the point is is that um I built the lab

1719
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:14,400
here it's functional we're doing what we

1720
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,838
got to do but then once that door opened

1721
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,519
and it's been I've been working on that

1722
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:21,599
door for two two plus years now as far

1723
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:24,798
as you know when I when I do something

1724
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:27,079
you know for for cannabis and my career

1725
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:29,119
I make sure understand it top to bottom

1726
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:31,119
you know I make sure that you know it's

1727
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,400
easy to go hire someone who can do

1728
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:35,039
something for you or understand it for

1729
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,480
you I that doesn't work for me I don't

1730
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,559
sleep at night with that I sleep better

1731
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,119
at night if I understand top to bottom

1732
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,839
and then I know the right questions to

1733
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:44,079
ask I have the right answers when I'm

1734
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,960
ask questions and so that's what I've

1735
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,079
been spending my time doing you know and

1736
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,559
I've been learning a lot and then that's

1737
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:53,720
kind of What's led to what's happening

1738
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,039
now you know because I realized that

1739
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:56,558
even though I try to do everything

1740
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,640
myself and I try to keep everything

1741
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,278
inhouse like I just described it just

1742
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,199
doesn't always work out that way

1743
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:04,079
sometimes you need a team sometimes you

1744
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:07,038
need people around you who have the same

1745
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,640
goals in mind and you know that's kind

1746
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,278
of where my life is at right now I've

1747
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:14,639
that Paradigm of it's okay to have a

1748
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:16,480
team not just you know not just people

1749
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,159
that are hired you hire to do what you

1750
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,599
need them to do but like a team of

1751
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:22,440
people that are thinking the way you

1752
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:25,000
think that are approaching problems the

1753
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,119
way you approach them it's very valuable

1754
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,960
you know cuz because not any one of us

1755
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:32,240
is dealing with this on our own and it

1756
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,400
will only get dealt with as a community

1757
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,239
you know um it's bigger than people

1758
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,920
realize it's more rampant Than People

1759
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:44,759
realize the faster weed goes into this

1760
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:48,639
legal space the more education is going

1761
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:51,200
to be required to deal with the things

1762
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:54,078
that we have to deal with such as hop

1763
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:57,439
plate and vroid and there's going to be

1764
01:07:54,079 --> 01:08:00,000
more pathogens that are going to be as

1765
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,400
detrimental or more detrimental than

1766
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,920
this so we have to like we have to be

1767
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,119
prepared to meet those challenges and

1768
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,240
this this is like for me hot plate and

1769
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,559
vroid and watching how it's affecting

1770
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:14,479
folks in the world and the potential

1771
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:17,480
damage it can do to a business to you

1772
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,158
know a cultivar um it's just like

1773
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:21,599
training wheels for the next thing you

1774
01:08:19,158 --> 01:08:23,759
know it's like get the protocols get the

1775
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,000
right frame of mind and especially the

1776
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,600
right team around you to be able

1777
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,079
to be prepared for what's coming next

1778
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,719
because there will be something next and

1779
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:33,479
it may not be as simple as you know

1780
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:37,119
cleaning it up with the Mery stem tissue

1781
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:39,399
culture remediation you know so I think

1782
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:41,119
I think I got off track there but you

1783
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:43,679
know I think somewhere there was an

1784
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:46,079
answer you did predict my next answer

1785
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,920
which was going to be asking you do you

1786
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,000
think there's going to be another virus

1787
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,520
in the future and the answer you said

1788
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,399
was yes so before we jump back to where

1789
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:56,880
we were I want to quickly ask you I've

1790
01:08:54,399 --> 01:09:00,000
heard anecdotally that that after a

1791
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,880
particular genetic under goes meristem

1792
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,759
tissue culture just again anecdotally

1793
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,000
people say oh you notice it's better and

1794
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:11,679
the number I heard was like maybe like

1795
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,640
15% better in terms of like across the

1796
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,440
board not in one particular aspect so

1797
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,319
you know like maybe it's more vigorous

1798
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:19,519
and maybe there's a bit more yield and a

1799
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:22,359
bit more turs and just sort of you know

1800
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,440
like 15% better have you would you say

1801
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:26,199
that it's more than that it's about that

1802
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:29,479
what's your thoughts when you

1803
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:32,439
that it's all relational to where you're

1804
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:35,358
starting from um you know if you've got

1805
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:38,798
a plant I think the Gorilla Glue number

1806
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,679
four is a great example right I from

1807
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:43,119
from what I gather that was a big

1808
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:45,279
culprit of of sick plant getting other

1809
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:48,880
plants sick it got spread around really

1810
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:50,960
quickly at some point years ago and I

1811
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:53,239
think that a lot of

1812
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,119
people spread around that hot blade and

1813
01:09:53,238 --> 01:09:57,559
virid at that point you know so so to

1814
01:09:56,119 --> 01:09:59,679
use that one as an example it's like

1815
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:02,840
night and day I I would say

1816
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,158
50% um I didn't have a lot of experience

1817
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:08,199
with it before I had some but not a lot

1818
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:10,920
before we got the clean version we have

1819
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:14,319
now that's basically a uh came from a

1820
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:15,960
gen one you know um but it's night and

1821
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:17,920
day it almost doesn't seem like the same

1822
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,439
we same weat like you'll show it to

1823
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,679
people who tell you that you know

1824
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:22,559
Gorilla Glue was always one of their

1825
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:23,719
favorites oh I remember the gorilla glue

1826
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,120
and then you show it to them like what

1827
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:28,880
is this and you're like this it's the

1828
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:30,279
same same one you know so I think maybe

1829
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,960
on an average I don't know if I could

1830
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:35,198
answer that but I think the potential is

1831
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,880
is much you know much greater than that

1832
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:39,799
you know it all depends on where you

1833
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,719
start from if it's if it was a you know

1834
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,800
sort of sick plant or sort of not well

1835
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:45,800
or maybe not that oval plant maybe maybe

1836
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,880
the difference isn't that big but

1837
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:50,000
generally it's it's like night and day

1838
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,400
you know like it's it's The Vig is is

1839
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,679
completely out of control you know I you

1840
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:57,039
can see it on the the you know the the

1841
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,719
stems you know you can see it on the

1842
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:00,840
stalks you can see it like it's just

1843
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,520
vigorous more lively it looks like it

1844
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,079
looks like it was just popped right L

1845
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,199
not that long ago from a seed you know

1846
01:11:05,079 --> 01:11:09,119
that's just what I've seen and just as a

1847
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:11,678
quick followup how would you compare the

1848
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:13,960
difference between say doing the noal

1849
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:16,279
harvesting versus meristem is there

1850
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:18,279
quite a big difference when you go to

1851
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:21,719
that meristem

1852
01:11:18,279 --> 01:11:24,479
level so not necessarily because like I

1853
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:28,279
said if you have a generally clean plant

1854
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:30,718
and then you initiate it noly uh it's

1855
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:32,000
you're not going to you know you're not

1856
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,000
going to see a whole lot of difference

1857
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,479
when it comes out that plant was pretty

1858
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,479
clean when it came in so you're not

1859
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:39,759
going to see a lot of difference between

1860
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:41,279
a merry stem gen zero and let's just say

1861
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,079
I don't think that's a real term but a

1862
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,599
nodal gen zero you know uh plant that

1863
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:47,479
just came right out of tissue culture

1864
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,760
but let's say that plant you know

1865
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:52,519
because when once you're in Mary stem

1866
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,159
you know really you're just mostly whe

1867
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:56,199
when you go through tissue the tissue

1868
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:57,879
culture process you're eventually going

1869
01:11:56,198 --> 01:11:59,678
to get rid of all those fungal and

1870
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:02,079
bacterial indites like I was saying

1871
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:06,760
before the Mary stem is more for going

1872
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:08,840
in the marem is more for just like um

1873
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,400
you know remediation it remediates you

1874
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:15,000
know all those fungal bacterial indice

1875
01:12:11,399 --> 01:12:16,960
but also more importantly that's the the

1876
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,119
only way that we have currently to

1877
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:23,239
remediate from the viroid you know the

1878
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:24,479
viruses so it's kind of like comparing

1879
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,238
when you're talking about the way you

1880
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:27,919
described it like apples and oranges but

1881
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,479
at the end of the day you know it's

1882
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,319
going to be about the same because the

1883
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:36,599
the genetic repair that goes on and then

1884
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:38,559
also the cleaning up of the endites the

1885
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,639
bacterial or fungal that's going to

1886
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,239
happen with the with the nodal too um

1887
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:45,400
the Mery stem we would just cut to the

1888
01:12:43,238 --> 01:12:47,759
Chase and just do that anyway even if we

1889
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:50,039
didn't have the vroid because it's an a

1890
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,719
quicker way to guarantee that we're not

1891
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:55,679
going to bring any of those bacteria or

1892
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:57,239
fungal indites into the culture do you

1893
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,520
understand what I mean does that make

1894
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:01,399
sense yeah definitely definitely

1895
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,600
definitely so well I mean just to

1896
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:05,960
quickly bring us back to where we were

1897
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,840
how did you essentially get involved in

1898
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,719
the grateful Head Endeavor how did it

1899
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,000
all start because you you've told us it

1900
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:14,960
was on your mind well you know that's

1901
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,439
funny you say that because I believe

1902
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,719
that we kind of manifest our reality you

1903
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:23,238
know um I'm one of those that believe

1904
01:13:19,719 --> 01:13:26,359
that we talk things into existence that

1905
01:13:23,238 --> 01:13:28,238
we think things into existence and so

1906
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:29,960
yeah this is on my mind constantly for

1907
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,479
years and I've gone through a lot of the

1908
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,439
labs and you know I won't mention any

1909
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:35,039
names but you've heard of them all and

1910
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:37,119
they just couldn't make me feel

1911
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:39,920
comfortable with who they were what

1912
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:42,000
their goals were and you know how that

1913
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,960
would affect me in a partnership with

1914
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,119
them and so I like I said back to what I

1915
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:51,119
was saying like I tried to go at it my

1916
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:53,000
loan and sure I could do that but it

1917
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:55,319
seems like it's bigger than that so

1918
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,760
while I'm thinking about this I uh I

1919
01:13:55,319 --> 01:14:00,279
like to post on Instagram like when I

1920
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:03,079
open up my Instagram feed it's mostly

1921
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:05,079
Laboratories that I'm that that the

1922
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:07,559
algorithm wants me to see it's not it's

1923
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:10,198
not the pretty flower there's that too

1924
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:12,159
but mostly it's Laboratories techniques

1925
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:15,638
any know it's outside of cannabis it's

1926
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:18,719
you know patunas and Bonas and you know

1927
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:21,199
fruit crops and all kinds of [ __ ] like

1928
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,960
bioscience like you know Agricultural

1929
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,719
Science is fascinating to me as I've

1930
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,679
gotten to this point in my life it's

1931
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,600
just it's kind of where my you know it's

1932
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,880
just what interests me you know so plus

1933
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,560
with the tissue culture thing the

1934
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,719
algorithm knows what I'm thinking at

1935
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,440
least it can figure out what I was

1936
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:40,119
thinking yesterday you know how it is um

1937
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:41,519
so I like the post of a fellow uh and he

1938
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:43,840
he immediately hit me up I was like we

1939
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,719
should talk and I was like all right so

1940
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,119
I called him up and that's not you know

1941
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:48,600
me that's not something I do it's hard

1942
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:50,800
to even get me on the goddamn phone but

1943
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,920
I called him up and we just hit it right

1944
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,880
off and uh you know he was pretty

1945
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:59,239
forward and invited me to to join the

1946
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:01,600
the cause and um you know I I kicked the

1947
01:14:59,238 --> 01:15:04,079
idea around it's it's you know the last

1948
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,159
year I've gone through this year last

1949
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,039
year and a half I've kind of gone

1950
01:15:05,158 --> 01:15:10,799
through this paradigm shift in my own my

1951
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:13,399
own Universe you know is uh I used to be

1952
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,719
like you know I've been collecting

1953
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:17,519
clones and you know taking care of them

1954
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:19,119
and you know spending every resource I

1955
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,920
have to make sure they're safe even

1956
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:22,599
sometimes the last [ __ ] dollar to

1957
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,719
make sure that the plants are fine

1958
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:29,079
forget about me and my you know so

1959
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:31,439
um you know it's a big deal to me and

1960
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:33,079
you know like I've gone from you know

1961
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,719
these things are so valuable how do you

1962
01:15:33,079 --> 01:15:36,800
put a price tag on it how do you sell it

1963
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:40,480
to someone else you know like how do you

1964
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:42,199
like like like what what use does that

1965
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:44,559
have you know like selling a genetic to

1966
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:46,158
someone you know like selling a clone of

1967
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,639
of a clone only that you can't get to

1968
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:49,158
someone like what use does that have

1969
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:52,400
I've I've always kind of felt like that

1970
01:15:49,158 --> 01:15:53,679
was no real use to that you know um yeah

1971
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:55,759
they're going to go off and make a bunch

1972
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:58,158
of money with it but that it like is

1973
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:00,239
that really is that really all it's for

1974
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:02,559
and my mind was like no it's not and so

1975
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:05,599
I kind of always tended not to share

1976
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,120
genetics clone only is not to share you

1977
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,679
know you know my library with folks not

1978
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:12,119
to sell it you know even though I could

1979
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:13,960
at any time I just chose not to and over

1980
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:16,079
the last year I've been kind of watching

1981
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,239
the industry and kind of watching you

1982
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:20,279
know one by one breeders start to sell

1983
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:23,559
their you know breeding clone you know

1984
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:25,599
their uh se you know their selections

1985
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:26,800
and you know then

1986
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,520
you go out on the internet now and

1987
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,360
there's like clones everywhere you can

1988
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,080
buy them and then so my girlfriend

1989
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:34,839
started buying clones from people

1990
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:36,639
because I'm such a anal person that I

1991
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,639
wasn't even like sharing with

1992
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:42,079
her and uh you know next thing you know

1993
01:16:39,639 --> 01:16:43,600
there's hop L and virid popping up and

1994
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:45,920
you know now we're dealing with that and

1995
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,920
trying to like you know protect the

1996
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,520
library from that I'm like God these

1997
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,800
then you call the company up and they're

1998
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,560
like we don't test for hopl and virid we

1999
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,960
don't we don't have the money for that

2000
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,679
what do you mean you sold the Clone for

2001
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:00,000
$500 you know the money for that it just

2002
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,039
blew my mind how careless some of these

2003
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,800
clone sellers were being you know I just

2004
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:07,760
was like oh my God now this we're going

2005
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,400
to drop to this [ __ ] level now and so

2006
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,000
over the course of the last year and a

2007
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:13,119
half I've just kind of come around to

2008
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,880
the idea that you know what maybe maybe

2009
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:17,399
it is a good idea if we do it right you

2010
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:20,480
know maybe it is a good idea if we are

2011
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:23,359
good stewards of the plant and soell

2012
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:25,959
clones that are clean so genetics that

2013
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:28,000
are clean and like well taken care of

2014
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,679
and verified you know there's that too

2015
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,920
like you never know what you're getting

2016
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:34,600
and at a fair price you know um

2017
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,520
something that makes sense for us H

2018
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,079
keeping it for so long and holding on to

2019
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,360
it and all the resources that we

2020
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:42,800
committed to the library but also you

2021
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:45,439
know to making sure that the guy with

2022
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,760
the tent in Texas can like I I mentioned

2023
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:49,599
to you before can afford it and get that

2024
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,679
[ __ ] headband or whatever the [ __ ] it

2025
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,920
is he wants in his tent you know without

2026
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:56,840
spending you know Breaking the Bank

2027
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:59,600
spend thousands of or whatever it is so

2028
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:01,560
as I'm coming to that kind of paradigm

2029
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,920
shift in my head and just different way

2030
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:06,360
of seeing things this whole thing

2031
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,158
happened where I liked this post and

2032
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:09,759
this fellow you know reached back to me

2033
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:13,599
we're on a phone call we're talking

2034
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:15,639
about it and I just of course my first

2035
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,480
like inclination was kind of to push

2036
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:21,719
back and like you know JK be be careful

2037
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:23,559
you know like people say things and but

2038
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:25,880
it just I just kept it kept fitting

2039
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:27,280
together like a puzzle every ation so

2040
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,600
over the course of like two months we

2041
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:32,359
started talking and you know like quite

2042
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,520
often about it and I was taking it very

2043
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:36,319
serious the idea in my mind my personal

2044
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,800
life and I was bouncing off my family

2045
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:41,198
and you know the people that I trust and

2046
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,400
care about their opinions and I decided

2047
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:45,198
to go for it you know I decided to enter

2048
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:47,279
into an agreement with the company and

2049
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:49,960
be part of the uh you know part of the

2050
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:52,479
board of directors on a company and it

2051
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:54,800
just once that happened it was like a

2052
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,319
bowling ball as we say just started

2053
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:01,360
rolling down the hill there was no way

2054
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:03,479
to stop it you know um and it it's like

2055
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:04,960
it's brought me such a relief from the

2056
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:07,559
pressure that I was putting on myself

2057
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,960
about this that you know there's been a

2058
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:10,880
lot of great things that have coming

2059
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,679
from it we haven't even you know we're

2060
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:16,639
just getting ready to do our first drop

2061
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:19,079
this summer um August 5th but you know

2062
01:19:16,639 --> 01:19:21,119
in my own personal life just the mental

2063
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:24,319
pressure it's taken off me knowing that

2064
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:27,639
I'm around some men uh who feel the same

2065
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:29,238
way that I do about all this completely

2066
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:30,440
understand like where we're coming from

2067
01:19:29,238 --> 01:19:33,759
when it comes to the plant and

2068
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:35,319
protecting it and like what it means and

2069
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,560
you know even the guy who approached me

2070
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:39,119
you know he had like I I don't want to

2071
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:42,320
overp speake I don't know the exact but

2072
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:45,279
he had like say 152 200 cultivars that

2073
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:47,679
he did that did get infected well you

2074
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:50,000
know what what's the protocol say it

2075
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:52,239
says throw them away start over right he

2076
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,238
chose not to do that he reached into his

2077
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:56,079
back pocket and he reached deep and he

2078
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:59,198
went to a lab and he got his whole

2079
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,760
[ __ ] crop remediated and like I I

2080
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:03,519
have so much respect for that you know

2081
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:04,840
that's what I would do I can say that

2082
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,360
that's a whole different ball game to

2083
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:09,679
face that reality you know and he did

2084
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:12,079
that and like that that um that had an

2085
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:14,679
impact on me uh dealing with this

2086
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:16,920
gentleman and so I realized that I'm not

2087
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:19,319
the only one and that there's other ways

2088
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,840
besides doing it yourself so I join

2089
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:24,719
joined forces and you know here we are

2090
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,039
now now what's happening is like we're

2091
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,560
you know now we're trying to keep up

2092
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:30,238
with what we what our plan is like I

2093
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,159
said it's like a snowball just growing

2094
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:33,799
down the hill 100 miles an hour We're

2095
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,198
just trying to keep it up you know keep

2096
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:38,480
up with it so it's like the most

2097
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:39,279
exciting thing I've been part of since I

2098
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:42,919
can

2099
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:44,960
remember and um you know that's that's

2100
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:47,039
that's that's where it starts you know

2101
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,840
so it's all brand new this all just

2102
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:50,920
happened since April and you know I feel

2103
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,199
like we've been doing it for years

2104
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:56,279
already you know just because of all the

2105
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:59,479
details and work we're putting into

2106
01:20:56,279 --> 01:21:00,759
it that's that's really exciting to hear

2107
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,359
I I mean we're going to have to talk a

2108
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,639
whole bunch more I guess the first

2109
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:06,158
question is I'm sure people have maybe

2110
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,679
seen some of the other content you've

2111
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,399
done out there but if not uh I'm aware

2112
01:21:08,679 --> 01:21:12,480
that you're doing it with buddies of the

2113
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:14,198
show Dutch blooms and Kevin JRE can you

2114
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:16,839
tell us a bit about some of the other

2115
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:19,279
people involved and what each person

2116
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:21,239
brings in their capacity so to speak

2117
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:24,158
how's how does it all work

2118
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:26,319
logistically so that's pretty much the

2119
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:29,519
basis of it it's we're all collectors

2120
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:32,679
we're all you know long longterm like

2121
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:36,000
cannabis enthusiasts collectors and you

2122
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:38,639
know just people who love the plant um

2123
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,319
so you mentioned you mentioned Dutch

2124
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,920
blooms you mentioned Kevin I think you

2125
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:46,119
know folks have had some exposure to

2126
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:48,199
them and you know Kevin is an amazing

2127
01:21:46,119 --> 01:21:51,479
human like I I uh of course knew who he

2128
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:53,960
was um but now I've gotten really I've

2129
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:56,158
gotten to know him to a degree being

2130
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:59,158
part of this we meet every week and we

2131
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:01,920
discuss our plans and kind of our ideas

2132
01:21:59,158 --> 01:22:03,839
and I mean it's it's like a wildfire

2133
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,239
like when we get together like we take

2134
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,119
the smallest little notion of an idea

2135
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:11,000
and within an hour it's blossom into

2136
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:13,279
this giant Garden of a of a of an idea

2137
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,880
you know it's it's insane and it's all

2138
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:16,519
because we've been around this plant for

2139
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,119
so long we've been around cannabis for

2140
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:22,159
so long and we've been involved to

2141
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:24,719
different degrees um so you know

2142
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:26,279
generally saying speaking we all have

2143
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,840
our own personal libraries that we've

2144
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:31,719
thrown into the collection um there's

2145
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:33,199
there's one person that um that you

2146
01:22:31,719 --> 01:22:36,079
didn't mention and that's the guy I was

2147
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:37,439
talking about his name is is Steve and

2148
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:39,279
uh we've gotten to know each other and

2149
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,960
he's an amazing guy man he really is

2150
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:44,238
he's he's uh he cares about cannabis as

2151
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:46,760
much as plants as as much as anyone I

2152
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:48,559
know and it this is kind of his brain

2153
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:51,639
shot and he kind of brought us together

2154
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:55,080
you know um he's a good networker and

2155
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:57,600
he's got good ideas and great energy and

2156
01:22:55,079 --> 01:23:01,039
he's kind of brought us all together and

2157
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:03,360
um you know made it to where it it's

2158
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:05,399
like it feels like a team like he he did

2159
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,399
it the way we all feel like it's like an

2160
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:10,519
equal team you know and it is and so

2161
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:11,960
it's the four of us um there's a few

2162
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:15,280
other people involved you know we have a

2163
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:18,000
CFO and you know we have a lab partner

2164
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:20,039
um that we have that we're doing all the

2165
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,079
the culturing and Remediation at it's a

2166
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:25,279
big big Endeavor it's really a big

2167
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:29,559
project you know um and lucky to have a

2168
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:30,880
lab that that has taken on that work um

2169
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,320
you know when you find someone that can

2170
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,279
do this kind of work they have a you

2171
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:35,840
know usually a pretty extensive

2172
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:37,960
scientific background and this

2173
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,920
individual does I would imagine there's

2174
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:41,639
lots of Avenues in life that a person

2175
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,279
like that could take a lot of

2176
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:45,840
opportunities and and um has chosen to

2177
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:49,880
work with cannabis is kind of admirable

2178
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:51,880
to me and so um we're lucky to have that

2179
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,920
of course you know things are always

2180
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:57,159
moving they're always Mo you know

2181
01:23:53,920 --> 01:24:00,199
motions are always have have happening

2182
01:23:57,158 --> 01:24:02,158
um so we're all being in cannabis we're

2183
01:24:00,198 --> 01:24:03,559
all accustomed to that so every time

2184
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:05,679
there's like a bump in the road that we

2185
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:08,320
see we have like a million ways to deal

2186
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:10,039
with it and the best part about it is

2187
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:13,840
it's not on just one person you know

2188
01:24:10,039 --> 01:24:15,840
it's a team like you know no one person

2189
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,880
has all the ideas no one person has all

2190
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,840
the solutions or answers but when you

2191
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,359
put some people together that I you know

2192
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,000
this is my experience when you put some

2193
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,198
people like that together smart people

2194
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,560
who you know are engaged in what they do

2195
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:28,079
and they care about what they're doing

2196
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,120
and they have passion for what they

2197
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:33,639
doing [ __ ] magical things happen it's

2198
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:35,599
almost like it's like I said before like

2199
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:38,639
speaking things into existence like that

2200
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:41,119
on steroids it's like wow look at this

2201
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,880
it's just growing so fast it was all you

2202
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:46,198
can do is say wow this is just meant to

2203
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:48,159
be and then you know the motivation I

2204
01:24:46,198 --> 01:24:50,118
think for a lot of us is you know how

2205
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:53,519
it's being done wrong everywhere just

2206
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:55,039
across the board and by people who may

2207
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,480
not quite

2208
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:58,079
quite get it I don't know how to say it

2209
01:24:56,479 --> 01:25:00,359
you know just may not quite get it the

2210
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:02,359
way some of us do and I think that only

2211
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:04,679
comes not because people are so

2212
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:07,039
different but because of experience uh

2213
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:10,039
around it like seeing what can be good

2214
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:11,719
and what can be wrong and being able to

2215
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:13,920
kind of navigate those those things when

2216
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:15,760
they come up I think we're all adapt to

2217
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:19,600
that and very good very good at dealing

2218
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:21,679
with that um and you know you know me

2219
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,840
I'm I'm a hard ass you know I'm a I'm a

2220
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,560
purist I'm a and I don't like to [ __ ]

2221
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,360
around I'm not trying to like you know

2222
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:29,320
but cannabis is going in a certain

2223
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:32,000
direction and you can either kind of

2224
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:34,198
ride ride that you can kind of hold on

2225
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:38,039
or you can not it's up to you and I'm

2226
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:42,238
trying to find ways Within Myself to

2227
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:44,880
make it better for cannabis in general

2228
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:47,000
based on what I believe but not just

2229
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,400
hiding behind my keyboard or my closet

2230
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,238
bitching and moaning about what's going

2231
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:52,519
on you know what I mean but as opposed

2232
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:54,879
to like as opposed to that kind of like

2233
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:57,560
influencing it changing it maybe having

2234
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:59,480
a positive impact on the outcome and I

2235
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:01,719
think that we're all all of the Grateful

2236
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:04,000
head and the the people who are involved

2237
01:26:01,719 --> 01:26:06,079
with that myself included we all have

2238
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:11,880
that in our back of our mind always you

2239
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:14,439
know um that you know it's better to

2240
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:17,239
work within a system to change it to

2241
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:18,759
make it more better as opposed to just

2242
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:20,359
sitting on the outside screaming and

2243
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,360
pounding your fist and saying it's not

2244
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:24,880
good enough you know and I've been on

2245
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:26,519
the outside doing that to some degree

2246
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,279
but I've always known it's better to be

2247
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,840
on the inside doing it and I feel like

2248
01:26:28,279 --> 01:26:33,599
the grateful Head has an opportunity for

2249
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:36,400
us to do that like you know we are going

2250
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,920
to be providing gen zero clones we have

2251
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:41,799
a library it's almost 600 cultivar clone

2252
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:45,679
only deep and it's growing fast that's

2253
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:47,719
the thing that you know um talk a little

2254
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:50,279
bit about is that the the part that's

2255
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:53,359
snowballing the fast is the library you

2256
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:55,920
know because of the reputation I think

2257
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:58,399
that some of us have that that we have

2258
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,359
individually it's kind of a it's kind of

2259
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:03,039
added

2260
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:05,158
to the kind of the the validity of the

2261
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:08,359
mission that we're on when it comes to

2262
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:10,158
cannabis and the you know genetic we're

2263
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:12,039
we're genetic dealers basically you know

2264
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:15,719
like that's what we do we collect and

2265
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:17,519
deal genetics that's what we do and um

2266
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:19,000
there's a lot of people doing that and

2267
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,360
there's a lot of people doing it just to

2268
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,479
quickly make that quick dollar without

2269
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:26,000
any regard of you know tomorrow or seven

2270
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:27,799
days down the road or seven years down

2271
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,479
the road and I think that we kind of

2272
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:32,279
have a for some for various reasons we

2273
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:33,678
have a little bit of a vision of that

2274
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:35,880
and I think that we're able to kind of

2275
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,239
apply that to what we're doing today and

2276
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,760
that's what I'm involved with this

2277
01:27:37,238 --> 01:27:41,079
because I see a lot of that you know I

2278
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:43,239
don't have to make excuses for people

2279
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:44,840
they're already on the right page from

2280
01:27:43,238 --> 01:27:48,718
for from my point of view you know what

2281
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:50,440
I mean so um you know it's it's growing

2282
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:53,319
fast and it's going to be it's going to

2283
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:55,279
be big we have already I would probably

2284
01:27:53,319 --> 01:27:58,759
guess the biggest

2285
01:27:55,279 --> 01:28:00,559
genetic repository of clones forget

2286
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:02,159
about gen zero forget about tissue

2287
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:05,880
culture forget about the remediation

2288
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:09,479
forget about all that just in globally

2289
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:12,159
and um we're going to be able to sell

2290
01:28:09,479 --> 01:28:14,279
these clones legally to basically

2291
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:17,638
anybody uh the way we have it set up

2292
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:19,920
with our licensing here um not going to

2293
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:22,639
get too much into that but we are

2294
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,960
basically able to sell clones to anybody

2295
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,520
that has a phytosanitary

2296
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,639
certification

2297
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:33,000
agreement um globally and certainly

2298
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:34,920
anyone in the United States so the way I

2299
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,560
described it is if we can legally sell

2300
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:39,639
you a clone we're GNA you can buy a

2301
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:41,520
clone for us and our library is

2302
01:28:39,639 --> 01:28:45,840
extensive so our first drop is going to

2303
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:48,280
be um it's between 40 and 60 we had 60

2304
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:51,319
pulled for it 60 different cultiv ours

2305
01:28:48,279 --> 01:28:52,960
pulled um it's a matter of production

2306
01:28:51,319 --> 01:28:55,000
about if we meet that number and we're

2307
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,359
getting we're getting some feedback and

2308
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,719
data on that this week um but I think

2309
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:00,880
it's closer to 60 uh we just want to

2310
01:28:59,719 --> 01:29:02,719
make sure we have the numbers we're only

2311
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,840
going to have about a th clones

2312
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:07,480
available on the first drop these are

2313
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:10,079
all gen zero they're partially

2314
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:11,718
acclimated so when you receive your

2315
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,559
clone you're not going to have a lot of

2316
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:16,359
work to do acclimating it um it's pretty

2317
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,920
straightforward we have a nice sop for

2318
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:20,319
that we're going to have we're going to

2319
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,639
surround you with instruction just in

2320
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:26,118
case just to give you the best possible

2321
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:28,199
uh outcome but it's um it's going to be

2322
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:30,319
they're going to be rooted viable there

2323
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:32,359
just needs to be some small acclamation

2324
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:34,880
these are stero plants coming out of

2325
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:36,960
each row with roots you just got to you

2326
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,239
know it's going to be specific light

2327
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,000
requirements specific feeding

2328
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:43,479
requirements and specific um you know

2329
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,158
humidity requirements for the first

2330
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:47,879
seven to 10 days you know um I I

2331
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:49,079
couldn't be more excited I'm so pumped

2332
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,639
about it I feel like I'm part of

2333
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:52,920
something bigger than myself and I love

2334
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:55,520
it you know that's awesome to hear how

2335
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,359
excited you are I mean there's so many

2336
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,400
uh interesting follow-up questions I

2337
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:01,880
want to ask you I guess the first one is

2338
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:04,198
as you mentioned there's this like vast

2339
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:06,760
library of genetics contributed by the

2340
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:08,559
various people you just mentioned uh

2341
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:10,039
who's handling the lab side of it are

2342
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,960
you guys doing it in house are you

2343
01:30:10,039 --> 01:30:14,118
partnering with someone you trust who's

2344
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:16,719
going to be doing the culturing and

2345
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:19,799
making the Clones the culturing has

2346
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:24,079
already been going on for years now um

2347
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:27,320
the intake is uh ongoing and it will

2348
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:30,039
always be ongoing um because we're going

2349
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:31,599
to be trying we're we're trying to not

2350
01:30:30,039 --> 01:30:34,279
just take existing libraries but we're

2351
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,639
trying to find ways to leave the door

2352
01:30:34,279 --> 01:30:38,039
open to new cultiv ours you know some

2353
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,239
sometimes you know as you've noticed I'm

2354
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:41,679
sure most people in C know it's like the

2355
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:44,879
next greatest thing doesn't always come

2356
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:47,000
from the biggest known breeder you know

2357
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:48,679
you know oftentimes it's freaking bag

2358
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,158
scene that someone finds in their their

2359
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:54,199
Garden you know it's just the reality of

2360
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:57,238
it so we're developing ways to make part

2361
01:30:54,198 --> 01:31:00,279
parterships with breeders known and

2362
01:30:57,238 --> 01:31:01,839
unknown alike to make sure that we leave

2363
01:31:00,279 --> 01:31:05,039
the door open for that material to come

2364
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:07,719
in and also that that person who

2365
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:10,719
provides that material is compensated

2366
01:31:07,719 --> 01:31:12,439
properly for the material you know um

2367
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:14,319
and those are things that we're

2368
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:15,759
developing we don't have any like we

2369
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:17,960
don't have anything to discuss about

2370
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:20,199
that yet but that is like at the

2371
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:23,359
Forefront of what we're doing it's it's

2372
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:25,519
not so much what we have we do have that

2373
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:27,960
and it's it's that's the the wheel

2374
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,800
that's turning now but it's the future

2375
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,439
you know like the next thing the next

2376
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:34,360
genetics the next big thing the next

2377
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:37,559
Trend you know the ne and then you know

2378
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:38,479
on top of keeping like the old school

2379
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:41,159
the

2380
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:43,238
classics um around and available to

2381
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:44,638
people who some people have never

2382
01:31:43,238 --> 01:31:47,279
experienced and now they will have an

2383
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:51,920
opportunity experience now as far as the

2384
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:54,279
lab goes um one of the things about uh

2385
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,800
collecting genetics I think the key word

2386
01:31:54,279 --> 01:31:58,279
for collecting genics is called is

2387
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,239
redundancy right that's how I've kept

2388
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:02,519
things alive and available all these

2389
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:05,519
years and and somewhat healthy state is

2390
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,760
redundancy so we don't we have a main

2391
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,239
lab we're going to be working out at

2392
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:12,800
Connecticut because of the laws there uh

2393
01:32:09,238 --> 01:32:14,158
they're very favorable um as far as

2394
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:17,679
working

2395
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:19,519
under so we're not we're not under FDA

2396
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,600
regulations the Food and Drug

2397
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,199
Administration of the United States but

2398
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,360
they're the ones that set the rules for

2399
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:26,399
hemp

2400
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:30,359
uh regulation in the United States hemp

2401
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:33,439
is is uh legal 100% in the United States

2402
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:36,079
um states have the opportunity to do

2403
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:38,479
nothing about that and then if that's

2404
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:41,960
the case the fda's regulations which are

2405
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:43,678
strict um they Su they they take place

2406
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,920
they they um they go into effect you

2407
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,440
know that that's the rules that you're

2408
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:51,760
going to be working with when you

2409
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:54,519
propagate sell hemp or hemp products um

2410
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:57,239
if you are in a state that most States

2411
01:32:54,520 --> 01:33:00,560
United States have added on top of rules

2412
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:02,439
of the FDA hemp guidelines um and so

2413
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,159
Connecticut is one of those states that

2414
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:07,839
has um but however they've they've been

2415
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:09,479
very favorable to hemp in that state

2416
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:12,000
there's some states that are you know

2417
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:15,599
more concerned about synthetic uh choid

2418
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,600
and are trying to overregulation

2419
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,158
kind of overstepped a lot of their

2420
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:31,319
regulation uh mandates to try to

2421
01:33:29,158 --> 01:33:33,920
regulate things that aren't really just

2422
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:35,238
him you know so Connecticut is one of

2423
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:38,719
those states where they've been very

2424
01:33:35,238 --> 01:33:41,718
friendly so we do have a lab there um

2425
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:43,960
and it's it that that lab works with a

2426
01:33:41,719 --> 01:33:46,679
lot of different plant cultivars but

2427
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:49,039
they've housed remediated and stored and

2428
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:51,039
multiplied the cult the LI the existing

2429
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:53,238
library that we have like I said intake

2430
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:56,439
is ongoing so the next step for the

2431
01:33:53,238 --> 01:33:59,238
grateful head is redundancy meaning you

2432
01:33:56,439 --> 01:34:00,759
know um we're we're developing other

2433
01:33:59,238 --> 01:34:03,638
labs we're thinking about here in

2434
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:05,639
Montana here at lucky dog but we're also

2435
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:07,239
thinking about you know maybe it would

2436
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:09,800
be a good idea to have our Connecticut

2437
01:34:07,238 --> 01:34:11,959
lab St place it's there that's like the

2438
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,960
main spot but then our redundancy could

2439
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:18,000
be a West Coast you know a mountain Zone

2440
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:21,079
a central zone um so that way we can cut

2441
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,960
down on shipping time to uh have higher

2442
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:24,039
success rates through shipping you know

2443
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,679
a lot of times when you you send the

2444
01:34:24,039 --> 01:34:27,000
Clone through the mail there's you know

2445
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,920
you never know what's going to happen

2446
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,719
you know like someone could just leave

2447
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:33,359
the shipment in a in a van and it could

2448
01:34:31,719 --> 01:34:36,239
get cooked there's not much you can do

2449
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:39,319
about that so if you can do what you can

2450
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:42,839
to cut down those shipping um Lanes

2451
01:34:39,319 --> 01:34:46,039
times you know and also have uh

2452
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:47,360
redundancy in your in your project um I

2453
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:49,519
think that would be useful so that's our

2454
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:52,198
next step you know so the lab is in

2455
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,960
Connecticut and you know we don't really

2456
01:34:52,198 --> 01:34:57,479
talk about much more it is it's kind

2457
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:59,279
like the safe house as so to speak and

2458
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:01,359
the thing that we're focusing on now is

2459
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:02,719
the redundancy like where's the next Lab

2460
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:04,519
going to be where's the next lap going

2461
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:07,840
to be and you know how do we build it

2462
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,880
you know how do we make like a um you

2463
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:12,079
know like what plan would wait that like

2464
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:14,199
work here here and here you know like

2465
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,000
what do we really need to get it going

2466
01:35:14,198 --> 01:35:18,198
what do we really need to have it in

2467
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,118
operation and production and let's focus

2468
01:35:18,198 --> 01:35:22,118
on that you know so that's we're already

2469
01:35:20,118 --> 01:35:24,639
at that point where that's the next step

2470
01:35:22,118 --> 01:35:26,799
you know um I said it's growing a lot

2471
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:30,840
faster we expect it's going to be a

2472
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:32,719
pretty big um demand once we release and

2473
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,719
people start to see the product that

2474
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:37,319
we're providing and the library the

2475
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,800
extensive library and so we're already

2476
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:41,439
trying to think about the next step

2477
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,800
because we can already see that we're

2478
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:44,359
we're going to outgrow ourselves pretty

2479
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,679
quick here you

2480
01:35:44,359 --> 01:35:49,399
know okay so you do you plan to always

2481
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:52,158
just have all the labs in house so you

2482
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:54,359
can have like your own Sops and keep the

2483
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:59,158
sort of consistency High

2484
01:35:54,359 --> 01:36:01,759
yeah um the IP is shared with you know

2485
01:35:59,158 --> 01:36:03,399
our our lab that's been developed it's

2486
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:06,360
been shared with us to a degree we're

2487
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:08,439
developing you know basically our own IP

2488
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:11,639
based off of that and and a lot of other

2489
01:36:08,439 --> 01:36:14,719
input and that will be something that

2490
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:16,920
belongs to the Grateful head um but yeah

2491
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:18,359
there won't I think I think there's been

2492
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:21,279
a lot of discussion about that and I

2493
01:36:18,359 --> 01:36:23,559
think going forward we've realized that

2494
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,158
a partnership is great but it's just a

2495
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:27,039
stepping stone to what we really need to

2496
01:36:25,158 --> 01:36:29,559
do and that is exactly what you said we

2497
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:32,479
needed to be inhouse you know full

2498
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:37,280
control of the IP full control of the

2499
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:38,759
the process um you know from from A to B

2500
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:41,719
A to Z I mean you know what I mean like

2501
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:43,079
the whole thing um I don't we've you

2502
01:36:41,719 --> 01:36:44,880
know it makes sense to have those

2503
01:36:43,079 --> 01:36:46,519
Partnerships and we're going to be we'll

2504
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,719
have those Partnerships along the way

2505
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:50,280
but you know we've we've come across we

2506
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:54,039
actually know a lot of you know we we

2507
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:57,960
have a lot of resources in that space in

2508
01:36:54,039 --> 01:37:01,679
the uh you know biotech space uh plant

2509
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:04,399
Tech space and so like as we've kind of

2510
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:06,118
let this idea Blossom we've realized

2511
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:08,759
like we have a lot of resources to where

2512
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:11,599
we can kind of build a team inhouse like

2513
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:13,840
you say and let and rely on that to do

2514
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:17,280
the production and Remediation and and

2515
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:19,920
so forth so yes we we plan on keeping it

2516
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:23,319
inhouse right now we're in Partnerships

2517
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:24,760
good Partnerships you know but um but I

2518
01:37:23,319 --> 01:37:27,198
think think going forward we're going to

2519
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,639
be the next step and the next step after

2520
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:31,000
that we're going to be inh house you

2521
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:32,960
know that's exciting and look as you

2522
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,760
referenced earlier sounds like there's

2523
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:36,198
going to be a huge amount of demand for

2524
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:39,920
this and it's probably going to sell out

2525
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:42,039
quickly I've heard mentions of August

2526
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,719
being when the first drop might occur I

2527
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:46,439
took a look on the website there wasn't

2528
01:37:43,719 --> 01:37:48,679
any real specific info when can people

2529
01:37:46,439 --> 01:37:53,719
expect to be able to get their hands on

2530
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:55,760
these our targeted date is August 5th um

2531
01:37:53,719 --> 01:37:58,800
we think that you know there'll be like

2532
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:01,520
a twoe period between August 5th and um

2533
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:04,119
you know August 20th 21st where the

2534
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:06,159
plants will be available uh that's a

2535
01:38:04,118 --> 01:38:08,118
pretty Sol that's that's a set in stone

2536
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:09,759
time frame like we can't get around that

2537
01:38:08,118 --> 01:38:12,319
you know whatever we have when that

2538
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:16,039
happens that's what's for sale uh that's

2539
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:18,759
what's available so um that is the time

2540
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:22,279
now as far as the website goes like we

2541
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:24,039
the grateful Head the the hyen grateful

2542
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:25,840
hyen head.

2543
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:28,960
I believe is what it is I don't think

2544
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,400
yeah and uh so that is the place where

2545
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,198
you'll be able to order your clones

2546
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:36,079
we're going to have all the forms of

2547
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:38,158
payment available and um the list is not

2548
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:40,319
up yet like I said we want to make sure

2549
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:42,719
we have a hard number before we offer

2550
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:43,799
anything on the list we have thought

2551
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:46,399
about doing a

2552
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:49,320
pre-sale um that may or may not still

2553
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:50,879
happen I'm not sure um generally speak

2554
01:38:49,319 --> 01:38:52,759
generally I don't think that's going to

2555
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,359
be something that's going to be you know

2556
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:56,239
a reality

2557
01:38:54,359 --> 01:38:59,238
and we're going to have a deal on this

2558
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:02,359
first drop if you buy four then you'll

2559
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:03,638
get a fifth for free um so that's going

2560
01:39:02,359 --> 01:39:05,759
to be kind of sweet we think that's

2561
01:39:03,639 --> 01:39:08,880
going to be a nice kickoff to it the

2562
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:13,520
Clones are going to be priced this round

2563
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:15,800
$250 for one gen zero clone sent to you

2564
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:19,199
we're not selling plants we're selling

2565
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:20,960
genetics we if and we are going to spend

2566
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:23,079
plenty of time explaining and showing

2567
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,399
and demonstrating why that's an amazing

2568
01:39:23,079 --> 01:39:27,639
deal you know like uh one little trip to

2569
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:29,319
our lab with a with a phone camera and

2570
01:39:27,639 --> 01:39:31,520
you can see exactly why that's going to

2571
01:39:29,319 --> 01:39:33,599
be an incredible deal you know and

2572
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:36,000
that's only if you can't IM if you can't

2573
01:39:33,599 --> 01:39:37,800
you know put you know imagine all the

2574
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,279
things that have gone into this cultivar

2575
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:44,119
being safe and clean and ready to go uh

2576

brought to your door um besides that you

2577
01:39:44,118 --> 01:39:48,279
know so that's kind of the deal so yeah

2578
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,960
right now we're going to have a pre-sale

2579
01:39:48,279 --> 01:39:51,759
but all the every when the list is

2580
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:54,399

2581
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,039
Instagram the website everywhere we can

2582
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:57,679
to make sure everyone knows you know

2583
01:39:56,039 --> 01:40:00,479
where they can go grab their their

2584
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:02,279
clones you know sure and look the

2585
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:05,118
question that I'm sure everyone has on

2586
01:40:02,279 --> 01:40:07,198
their mind is will people be able to get

2587
01:40:05,118 --> 01:40:10,118
their own chem 91 or are there some

2588
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:12,799
plants that will remain off the list

2589
01:40:10,118 --> 01:40:16,198
nothing from my libraries off the list

2590
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:18,760
um you know there was never a point once

2591
01:40:16,198 --> 01:40:21,079
I once I went to the flip the switch in

2592
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:22,880
my head you know it was never going to

2593
01:40:21,079 --> 01:40:25,599
be so we're going to be doing fun things

2594
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:27,440
like we're gonna you know have like a a

2595

2598
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:38,599
you know uh drops down the road we'll be

2599
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:41,519
doing that we're going to have clusters

2600

2603
01:40:45,599 --> 01:40:50,000
Market basically your library your

2604
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,960
existing Library your existing sales

2605
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:56,359
your cultivars and then we can provide

2606
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:57,719
you clusters of plant to kind of hit um

2607
01:40:56,359 --> 01:41:00,399
you know different

2608
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:03,760
zones uh in cannabis you know like you

2609
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:05,399
know like candy gas you know those types

2610
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,400
of things you know we can break them up

2611
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:11,279
for you um you know Legacy we'll throw a

2612
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:12,559
legacy in there for your connoisseurs

2613
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:13,719
that kind of thing so we're going to you

2614
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,520
know one of the things that we're going

2615
01:41:13,719 --> 01:41:18,560
to be doing is for commercial customers

2616
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:20,440
we're going to be kind of helping them

2617
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:22,280
you know kind of guiding them through

2618
01:41:20,439 --> 01:41:24,479
their own Market space to help them

2619
01:41:22,279 --> 01:41:28,719
figure out what will work and what won't

2620
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:32,399
work with you know with trying to to you

2621
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:35,439
know um limit any kind of

2622
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:38,559
uh um you know Conformity like any kind

2623
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:40,238
of uh redo like you know try not to

2624
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,360
saturate too much candy you already got

2625
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,158
enough that try this this will work in

2626
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:46,319
your candy Market Watch What Happens you

2627
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:47,719
know like you know we we all one of the

2628
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:49,399
things that we all have is we have like

2629
01:41:47,719 --> 01:41:51,639
a sense of that like we kind of been

2630
01:41:49,399 --> 01:41:54,000
around long enough to see the trends

2631
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:56,118
come and go and so it's not that

2632
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,679
difficult for us to identify them when

2633
01:41:56,118 --> 01:41:59,759
we're giving the data when we're

2634
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,239
presenting the data and you know of

2635
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,440
course we have accessors we work with

2636
01:42:01,238 --> 01:42:07,319
that can help with that too so um no the

2637
01:42:04,439 --> 01:42:10,238
Kim 91 will be available uh right from

2638
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:12,679
my library um not on this first drop

2639
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:14,519
just because uh there's a there's a

2640
01:42:12,679 --> 01:42:17,079
process to this and the pipeline was

2641
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:18,800
already going but there's going to be a

2642
01:42:17,079 --> 01:42:20,519
lot of cool [ __ ] like my whole library

2643
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,560
is going to be there one of the cool

2644
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:24,920
things is is um one of the best things

2645
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:26,599
about being in with this as a breeder is

2646
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:29,359
this is going to free up a lot of

2647
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:32,279
resources for me to get back to

2648
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:33,719
selecting seeds something I you know I

2649
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:35,039
never have enough time with it's always

2650
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:36,319
on the back of my mind it's always in

2651
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:39,880
the front of my mind it's something I

2652
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:42,679
think about when I wake up is how you

2653
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:44,239
know it's what's I mean isn't it like

2654
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:45,880
what's more fun than feno hunting I

2655
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:47,238
don't think really anything is when it

2656
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:48,920
comes to cannabis that's the most

2657
01:42:47,238 --> 01:42:51,279
interesting thing about growing cannabis

2658
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,960
to me is when you get to go feno hunting

2659
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:55,279
I rarely get to do that you know um so

2660
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:57,599
I'm looking forward to that when I get

2661
01:42:55,279 --> 01:43:00,000
this Library buttoned up and it's not

2662
01:42:57,599 --> 01:43:02,119
100% my responsibility financially and

2663
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,198
otherwise to take care of it then I it

2664
01:43:02,118 --> 01:43:05,598
allows me to free up so that means

2665
01:43:04,198 --> 01:43:06,719
there's going to be a lot more to cultiv

2666
01:43:05,599 --> 01:43:09,360
ours there's going to be a lot more

2667
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:11,560
genetics for us to go fine and present

2668
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:13,598
to people those will all be included too

2669
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:15,000
you know um there's a lot of things that

2670
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:16,719
the world hasn't seen that are in our

2671
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
libraries that are going to be available

2672
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:21,279
right off the bat you know that's really

2673
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,520
exciting and I guess if I push you you

2674
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:25,479
still can't let us know any of those 40

2675
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:27,440
ones that might be up front I want to I

2676
01:43:25,479 --> 01:43:30,319
want to throw my guess in the ring I

2677
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:33,079
reckon TK's got to be in there we have

2678
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:35,719
two TKS in there

2679
01:43:33,079 --> 01:43:38,880
oh guess we got the swamp boys we got

2680
01:43:35,719 --> 01:43:40,760
you know Ricky's TK and then we got the

2681
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:45,000
the the traditional

2682
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:46,960
TK so the Swamp Boy TK and then the

2683
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,319
original TK I guess or whatever you call

2684
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,760
that one huh I wonder what that is cuz I

2685
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:51,679
thought Ricky was the one who found it I

2686
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,880
would have thought his would have been

2687
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:55,399
the original that was one of the

2688
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:57,639
questions I had when I saw the list I've

2689
01:43:55,399 --> 01:43:59,839
learned a lot about stuff I didn't know

2690
01:43:57,639 --> 01:44:01,440
about coming AC you know about clone

2691
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,679
only's being involved with these guys

2692
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:06,598
like I'm getting schooled daily I have

2693
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:07,639
to listen you know I that was one

2694
01:44:06,599 --> 01:44:10,840
question I asked I like wait a minute

2695
01:44:07,639 --> 01:44:13,319
there's two yeah there is and uh you

2696
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:15,599
know uh I I can't wait to check out the

2697
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:17,439
Ricky TK because the Swamp Boy TK

2698
01:44:15,599 --> 01:44:19,239
because I've heard great things these

2699
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:21,519
guys are telling me it's like a they've

2700
01:44:19,238 --> 01:44:23,799
seen people getting 3.8 pounds of light

2701
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,760
from it and I'm like what that's not the

2702
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:28,360
one I got you know so yeah I can't wait

2703
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:30,480
to grow some shill in this Library too

2704
01:44:28,359 --> 01:44:32,799
that's another thing being involved is

2705
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:35,799
like having having all these different

2706
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:37,639
clones that you know maybe I've heard of

2707
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:40,199
maybe I've dreamed of but right there my

2708
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:41,880
fingertips I'm I'm [ __ ] excited as

2709
01:44:40,198 --> 01:44:43,238
someone who likes to you know make

2710
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:45,520
crosses and do a little breeding here

2711
01:44:43,238 --> 01:44:47,519
and there you know it just opens up a

2712
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:49,440
whole new world just for me myself and I

2713
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,800
you know and that's that's a great

2714
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:52,839
example right

2715
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,320
there yeah and that was going to be one

2716
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:55,760
of my my questions you know given you've

2717
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:58,439
got this new collaboration where you've

2718
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:01,159
got access to this range of genetics are

2719
01:44:58,439 --> 01:45:02,759
there any clones now available to you

2720
01:45:01,158 --> 01:45:05,118
that you were sort of always eyeing off

2721
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:07,039
going oh I would love to have run that

2722
01:45:05,118 --> 01:45:08,479
oh my God there's so many of them man

2723
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:09,840
like I should have a list in front me to

2724
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:13,000
answer that but yeah there's a lot of

2725
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:15,239
them um there's one that caught my eye

2726
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,760
that that they have is uh that I don't

2727
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:18,079
know who brought it to the table so to

2728
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:21,480
speak and you know that's the other

2729
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:24,000
thing we don't really um right now we

2730
01:45:21,479 --> 01:45:25,638
have it all bunched up into one list and

2731
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,238
you know we're still trying to sort it

2732
01:45:25,639 --> 01:45:29,319
out in different ways you know kind of

2733
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:31,759
like how many different ways can we

2734
01:45:29,319 --> 01:45:34,039
organize this to where someone can click

2735
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:37,119
on a link and they can go oh yeah you

2736
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:38,960
know because it's so extensive it

2737
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:41,198
doesn't it's not very useful just to

2738
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,840
scroll through it you know like you need

2739
01:45:41,198 --> 01:45:44,359
different ways to kind of filter it out

2740
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,520
so we're working on that with the

2741
01:45:44,359 --> 01:45:48,920
website so ways you can filter it out

2742
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:51,840
with all these different categories um

2743
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:54,279
but there's one I think it's an nl2 the

2744
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:57,119
red fenale that I cannot wait to check

2745
01:45:54,279 --> 01:45:58,599
that out I don't know where it came from

2746
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:01,479
but I believe it came from Seattle at

2747
01:45:58,599 --> 01:46:03,159
some point of course but uh um but I'm

2748
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:04,238
looking that one caught my eye and I

2749
01:46:03,158 --> 01:46:06,079
that's the only one that comes to my

2750
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:07,879
mind when you ask me that you know

2751
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:10,679
there's a lot though there it's it's

2752
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:13,039
extensive it's insane you know it's like

2753
01:46:10,679 --> 01:46:14,639
you gotta like you got to sit down with

2754
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:17,198
this list when you look at it because

2755
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:19,079
it's a lot you know and it's growing con

2756
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:22,319
it's growing at like a pace that none of

2757
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:24,920
us expected you know so and and like how

2758
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:26,559
quickly do you estimate your ramp up to

2759
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:28,520
full production where you're offering

2760
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:32,639
say a good majority of the

2761
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:35,599
library right now uh the the plan that

2762
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:39,480
we have in place will be producing for

2763
01:46:35,599 --> 01:46:42,880
sale for uh a thousand clones a month

2764
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:44,598
right now and that may change upwards

2765
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,440
depending on demand but right now that's

2766
01:46:44,599 --> 01:46:48,239
what we're to of this you know the

2767
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:51,399
process to get these out of tissue

2768
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:53,519
culture multiplied rooted partially

2769
01:46:51,399 --> 01:46:55,679
acclimated on time

2770
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,960
it's a it's a pretty you know long

2771
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:59,880
process so you know it's a it's

2772
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:02,800
basically on the production side like a

2773
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:04,039
three-month lead time you know so these

2774
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,480
are the ones that we're going to put on

2775
01:47:04,039 --> 01:47:07,679
the on you know on the list in three

2776
01:47:05,479 --> 01:47:11,718
months okay now let's start the process

2777
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:16,118
you know so um the goal right now is a

2778
01:47:11,719 --> 01:47:18,319
th clones a month starting in August wow

2779
01:47:16,118 --> 01:47:20,279
that's exciting and and like I got to

2780
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:23,000
ask do you think you might ever foresee

2781
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:25,359
a day where you would consider shipping

2782
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,800
like the marem in the AAR or do you

2783
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:32,519
think it'll always be like a clone

2784
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:36,079
that's a good question um yes so we want

2785
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:38,520
to be able to provide our material to

2786
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:41,000
you know people in many different ways

2787
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,400
um we're going to have males you know

2788
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
breeding males we're going to have males

2789
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:47,279
that are we already have plenty in the

2790
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,840
library uh there'll be more um I'm going

2791
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:51,559
to be committing some males to that part

2792
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,039
of the library as well and then you know

2793
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:55,840
one of the things that we would

2794
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:58,960
encourage people to do is take your

2795
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:01,000
clone and then put it back in you know

2796
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:04,840
culture it put it back in a subculture

2797
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:07,158
right um and if we do get enough um so

2798
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:09,920
what that means is like so I don't want

2799
01:48:07,158 --> 01:48:12,319
to take this clone out and expose it to

2800
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:15,079
to the world of pathogens I want to keep

2801
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:17,759
it in vitro so I can at my own house or

2802
01:48:15,079 --> 01:48:19,198
my own facility I can keep this going

2803
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,280
well you could take this clone put it

2804
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:24,919
back in the vitro it's barely out of it

2805
01:48:22,279 --> 01:48:26,960
um and then you can continue to to uh

2806
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:28,800
multiply it and then you can provide

2807
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:32,399
yourself with clean clones constantly

2808
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:34,719
clean gen one clones all the time uh so

2809
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:36,920
if we find interest in that yes we will

2810
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:39,000
be providing cultures on on plates

2811
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:40,480
actually uh for people who have that

2812
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,279
skill level in order to know what to do

2813
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:44,759
with those and how to handle those um

2814
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:46,198
every which way we can think of to

2815
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:48,880
provide these we're we're going to

2816
01:48:46,198 --> 01:48:51,079
implement uh like I said even males you

2817
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:53,239
know like breeding males that people may

2818
01:48:51,079 --> 01:48:54,960
want to breed with like we're not

2819
01:48:53,238 --> 01:48:58,118
the door is going to be completely open

2820
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:01,560
that's the idea like this is a

2821
01:48:58,118 --> 01:49:03,319
decentralized um genetic repository like

2822
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:04,840
we're not holding back we're not we're

2823
01:49:03,319 --> 01:49:06,799
not interested in you being a returned

2824
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:09,960
customer we're only interested in you

2825
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,880
being a happy customer you know we know

2826
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:14,480
the joy people get when they've been

2827
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:16,760
looking for you know such and such

2828
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:18,839
cultivar they've they smoked it you know

2829
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:20,760
20 years ago 15 years ago or just the

2830
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:22,960
other day and they just want to grow it

2831
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:24,800
themselves we're here for you that's

2832
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,079
that's you're our you're our person you

2833
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:28,279
know we want to help you with that you

2834
01:49:26,079 --> 01:49:29,679
know like that's we know the joy of that

2835
01:49:28,279 --> 01:49:32,238
and we want to bring that joy and that's

2836
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:34,840
big part of what we're doing here and uh

2837
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:38,598
so if we find that there's people who

2838
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:41,039
want to have material provided to them

2839
01:49:38,599 --> 01:49:41,920
in vitro then certainly we'll do that

2840
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,960
you

2841
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:47,800
know that's exciting as well to also

2842
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:50,279
hear about the the males that will be on

2843
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:52,880
offer I guess soon enough you'll you'll

2844
01:49:50,279 --> 01:49:54,800
be offering absolutely everything I had

2845
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:57,279
a I had a really good fan submitted

2846
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,560
question that I wanted to ask you and

2847
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:01,158
they were sort of thinking look I'm

2848
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:03,360
planning to buy one of these clones do I

2849
01:50:01,158 --> 01:50:05,839
need to scrub my medium first you know

2850
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:08,319
because obviously some of these viruses

2851
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,920
and endites can exist within soil and

2852
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:11,960
other mediums do you think if you're

2853
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:13,920
going to go to the effort of getting one

2854
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:15,679
of these clones it's worth just cleaning

2855
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,639
shop getting a new medium or do you

2856
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,560
think oh looky probably safe just to put

2857
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:23,840
a clean clone

2858
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:25,039
in you can certainly well I mean you it

2859
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,039
depends on what we're talking about I

2860
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:28,118
mean if we're just talking about a

2861
01:50:26,039 --> 01:50:30,479
regular grow room there's no reason why

2862
01:50:28,118 --> 01:50:32,399
you can't just put it in there um once

2863
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:35,238
you take a clone out of vro and you

2864
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:37,519
start multiplying it outside of uh

2865
01:50:35,238 --> 01:50:39,439
aseptic conditions whatever's going to

2866
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:41,480
happen is going to happen however dirty

2867
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:44,559
or clean your girl room it's going to

2868
01:50:41,479 --> 01:50:46,879
happen it's not it's basically like it's

2869
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:48,320
like hitting a reset button you know

2870
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,279
like you're going to hit the reset

2871
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:52,158
button but that doesn't mean you're

2872
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:53,439
going to be golden forever Still Life

2873
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:55,719
Goes On

2874
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:57,118
um I always I when I think about in my

2875
01:50:55,719 --> 01:50:59,679
mind I think about it like cassette

2876
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:01,198
tapes this may be I might be too old for

2877
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:03,039
your audience here when I come to this

2878
01:51:01,198 --> 01:51:05,479
but back in the day when we had Grateful

2879
01:51:03,039 --> 01:51:08,599
Dead tapes you would get the recording

2880
01:51:05,479 --> 01:51:11,959
on a DAT a digital audio recording right

2881
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:13,719
digital um that would come from a taper

2882
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:15,439
that was tapped into the soundboard or

2883
01:51:13,719 --> 01:51:17,078
even their own microphone then they

2884
01:51:15,439 --> 01:51:19,238
would take that tape and they would

2885
01:51:17,078 --> 01:51:21,719
record that onto a cassette tape that's

2886
01:51:19,238 --> 01:51:23,678
gen one right then if you did it again

2887
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:25,239
it's gen two you can hear the sound

2888
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:27,399
quality diff you can hear the difference

2889
01:51:25,238 --> 01:51:30,078
between gen one and gen two and then we

2890
01:51:27,399 --> 01:51:31,479
would put gen one gen two you know

2891
01:51:30,078 --> 01:51:33,000
however many gens it was from the

2892
01:51:31,479 --> 01:51:35,198
digital recording we would put that on

2893
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,479
the tape and we would uh you know put

2894
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:38,359
that on the tape so the listener would

2895
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:40,238
know what the quality is that they're

2896
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:43,279
listening to so I kind of related to

2897
01:51:40,238 --> 01:51:46,359
that in my mind um you know the data is

2898
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:48,479
still there you know the information the

2899
01:51:46,359 --> 01:51:50,719
genetic information is still there but

2900
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:53,319
the further away you get from gen zero

2901
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:55,279
no matter what it also of course it has

2902
01:51:53,319 --> 01:51:56,799
to do with how clean your space is how

2903
01:51:55,279 --> 01:51:59,719
clean your practices are those are

2904
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:01,719
always going to be in in play but it's

2905
01:51:59,719 --> 01:52:03,760
going to pick up things along the way no

2906
01:52:01,719 --> 01:52:05,560
matter what you know now if you think

2907
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:09,000
about like the Kim dog I've had it for

2908
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:11,320
30 years now so if you think about that

2909
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,840
how much crap has the Kim dog picked up

2910
01:52:11,319 --> 01:52:16,238
along the way I mean 30 years is a long

2911
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:18,599
time but then you hit the reset button

2912
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:20,598
and so tomorrow with the with the the

2913
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:22,719
Gen zero clone that you get from the

2914
01:52:20,599 --> 01:52:25,400
Grateful head now you started off off

2915
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:26,920
you're 30 years ago right potentially 30

2916
01:52:25,399 --> 01:52:28,679
years ago so now you have a whole we

2917
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:30,639
already know what 30 years of can do to

2918
01:52:28,679 --> 01:52:34,520
the Kim dog we still got it we still

2919
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:36,920
love it um we love it so much and so

2920
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:38,880
much times but we can't we can't say for

2921
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:40,679
sure that it's changed the whole bunch

2922
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,199
since day one but we know it has you

2923
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:45,000
know um so it's the same thing it's just

2924
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:47,118
like hitting the reset button you just

2925
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:50,719
erase all that time in between and it's

2926
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:51,839
literally just that you know um so I

2927
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:53,760
wouldn't say you have to do anything

2928
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,639
special the only thing special you have

2929
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:58,000
to do is follow this sop and the

2930
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:01,000
instructions we're going to have a nice

2931
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,679
little video we're going to have the

2932
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,238
information that comes with your clone

2933
01:53:02,679 --> 01:53:05,719
it's going to be on the website we're

2934
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:07,198
going to beat you in the head with it

2935
01:53:05,719 --> 01:53:09,480
just because we want to make sure you

2936
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:11,039
have success I've sold you know I've

2937
01:53:09,479 --> 01:53:12,959
been around people who've sold clones a

2938
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:14,760
lot and I've seen some of the issues

2939
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:17,319
that come up with just traditional

2940
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:21,320
clones being shipped and and provided to

2941
01:53:17,319 --> 01:53:23,198
people on mass and you know it it's like

2942
01:53:21,319 --> 01:53:24,519
you have to be aware like when you're

2943
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:25,960
been doing this as long as I've been

2944
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:28,000
doing it there's a lot of things you

2945
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:29,920
just don't think about that a person who

2946
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,960
hasn't been doing this long comes across

2947
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:33,359
right like just things that are second

2948
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:35,239
nature to me like things that are

2949
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:36,359
obvious you know they're only obvious to

2950
01:53:35,238 --> 01:53:38,000
me because I've been doing it for so

2951
01:53:36,359 --> 01:53:39,799
long and so someone who hasn't they're

2952
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,238
not so we're just trying to make sure

2953
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:44,159
that all the things that should be

2954
01:53:41,238 --> 01:53:46,519
obvious to you will be you know part of

2955
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:47,879
your plan once you receive your clone

2956
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:49,760
and what to go forward like I said it's

2957
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:52,078
just a matter it basically think of it

2958
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:53,280
like this you have a rooted clone but

2959
01:53:52,078 --> 01:53:55,920
you're going to treat it like it's an

2960
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:57,920
unrooted clone for seven 7 to 10 days

2961
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,800
you're going to acclimate it slowly over

2962
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:03,960
7 to 10 days even though it's Got Roots

2963
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:06,679
um you can also you know you can also

2964
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:09,319
treat it with trichoderma and other um

2965
01:54:06,679 --> 01:54:11,520
beneficials to kind of inoculate its own

2966
01:54:09,319 --> 01:54:12,880
immune system these plants are babies

2967
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,239
they come out they don't really have an

2968
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,199
immune system that's why we have to

2969
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:17,799
acclimate them you can speed the process

2970
01:54:16,198 --> 01:54:20,638
up we'll have the instructions in there

2971
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:22,199
you can you know put some basic you know

2972
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:24,078
stuff you can get at any grow store

2973
01:54:22,198 --> 01:54:27,118
sometimes at a hardware

2974
01:54:24,078 --> 01:54:30,078
store to inoculate the root Zone to kind

2975
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:34,598
of defend it you know the theory with

2976
01:54:30,078 --> 01:54:39,198
inoculation is if you occupy the state

2977
01:54:34,599 --> 01:54:42,159
the space with beneficial you know fungi

2978
01:54:39,198 --> 01:54:43,960
bacteria then that's a space that a

2979
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:46,679
pathogen that's detrimental can't exist

2980
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:48,639
in so even on that basic level right

2981
01:54:46,679 --> 01:54:52,118
there you know we can we have ways that

2982
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:54,520
we can avoid any problems um but these

2983
01:54:52,118 --> 01:54:56,639
are partially acclimated which is

2984
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:58,480
beneficial and you'll have about seven

2985
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:02,560
or 10 days where you have to keep high

2986
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:05,078
humidity low light low EC feeds and lots

2987
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,599
of observation you know but this your

2988
01:55:05,078 --> 01:55:07,880
baby so it shouldn't be no problem we're

2989
01:55:06,599 --> 01:55:09,679
going to give you stepbystep

2990
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:12,880
instructions and lots of support along

2991
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:14,760
the way you know like as a followup uh

2992
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:18,078
it's sort of a similar question in a way

2993
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:20,639
but maybe a bit more um of a real issue

2994
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:23,399
where someone added a follow-up to that

2995
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:25,520
first fan question which was do you also

2996
01:55:23,399 --> 01:55:27,960
need to be wary of popping new seeds in

2997
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:30,280
your garden because you know like hoplon

2998
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:32,639
virus can be transmitted via seeds as

2999
01:55:30,279 --> 01:55:33,880
well do you think again you need to be

3000
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:36,359
careful of that if you're going to try

3001
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:37,599
to start clean with these clones I don't

3002
01:55:36,359 --> 01:55:39,799
really think you need to do anything

3003
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:42,119
different um you know than your normal

3004
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,320
protocol when you're avoiding that like

3005
01:55:42,118 --> 01:55:46,519
if you pop

3006
01:55:43,319 --> 01:55:48,039
seeds seeds have there's still the data

3007
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,679
is still out on hot plate and vibrate

3008
01:55:48,039 --> 01:55:52,560
transmission of seeds it certainly can

3009
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:54,960
be transmitted but we you know we don't

3010
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,400
have a we don't have an actual study yet

3011
01:55:54,960 --> 01:56:02,118
that we can refer to but the numbers

3012
01:55:57,399 --> 01:56:04,319
range between you know eight% to 40% I

3013
01:56:02,118 --> 01:56:06,198
think is the latest I've heard of

3014
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:08,960
transmission on seeds depending on if it

3015
01:56:06,198 --> 01:56:11,399
was the mother or the father I think if

3016
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,760
it was the mother I'm just I may not be

3017
01:56:11,399 --> 01:56:16,078
correct about all this like I said it's

3018
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:18,560
not all in concrete yet but I understand

3019
01:56:16,078 --> 01:56:20,679
that if the mother's infected the higher

3020
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,760
it's a higher rate of transmission than

3021
01:56:20,679 --> 01:56:26,118
if the father was infected

3022
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:28,039
of course more than likely you know uh

3023
01:56:26,118 --> 01:56:29,639
just you know of course the mother would

3024
01:56:28,039 --> 01:56:30,760
be the one that's more likely infected

3025
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:34,159
than the father but that doesn't mean

3026
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:37,079
it's always the case so um I would say

3027
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:40,839
that people who are conscious of hopl

3028
01:56:37,078 --> 01:56:44,679
and vroid and it's and it's damage um

3029
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:46,279
are already careful with their seedlings

3030
01:56:44,679 --> 01:56:47,800
you know making sure they're not

3031
01:56:46,279 --> 01:56:49,279
possibly transmitting anything that was

3032
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:51,639
on those seeds until they can get it to

3033
01:56:49,279 --> 01:56:53,840
testing which you know you can do as

3034
01:56:51,639 --> 01:56:55,199
soon as you have Ro fruits nowadays um

3035
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:57,480
we used to have to wait till we have

3036
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:59,000
true leaves with pedals and then we

3037
01:56:57,479 --> 01:57:00,399
could you know take the pedals and then

3038
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,118
test those but now we don't even test

3039
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:06,799
the pedals we're uh testing the roots

3040
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:09,799
now um so I think that if a Seedling had

3041
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:12,679
hopl and vroid you know in transmission

3042
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:13,880
when it was created I think that you as

3043
01:57:12,679 --> 01:57:16,840
soon as you have Roots you could find

3044
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:19,000
that out if you were concerned about

3045
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:20,599
popping seeds in hopl and vroid as long

3046
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,679
as you understand that you can test that

3047
01:57:20,599 --> 01:57:24,679
seedling pretty early on think there's

3048
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:25,639
much concern there you know as long as

3049
01:57:24,679 --> 01:57:28,880
you're willing

3050
01:57:25,639 --> 01:57:32,400
to follow your protocols if you have

3051
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:35,440
them if not you need them um once again

3052
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:37,598
you know that's bleaching your material

3053
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:40,000
I mean bleaching your uh your uh your

3054
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:42,840
tools scissors pruning scissors

3055
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,560
bleaching your hands 10% minimum for a

3056
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:48,039
minimum of 60 seconds so you keep your

3057
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:49,920
scissors in your bleach water 10% I like

3058
01:57:48,039 --> 01:57:52,719
to do like 15% just to give it a little

3059
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:56,039
extra why not um

3060
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:59,480
and you can go up to 20% and but the con

3061
01:57:56,039 --> 01:58:02,078
the uh contact time of 60 seconds is

3062
01:57:59,479 --> 01:58:03,919
crucial um and then another thing that

3063
01:58:02,078 --> 01:58:06,920
I've noticed a lot of people have not

3064
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:08,880
been you know privy to yet is the runoff

3065
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:11,199
water so you want to make sure that

3066
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:13,239
you're not sharing water from one

3067
01:58:11,198 --> 01:58:16,319
plantlet to the other regardless if it's

3068
01:58:13,238 --> 01:58:18,519
a Seedling a clone you know plants it

3069
01:58:16,319 --> 01:58:21,000
doesn't matter if you think I mean not

3070
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:23,239
even if you think you just don't want

3071
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,679
water from one plant plants run off

3072
01:58:23,238 --> 01:58:27,799
exposed to another plant's root system

3073
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:30,078
so when you're cloning that can be

3074
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:32,520
challenging if you have multiple strains

3075
01:58:30,078 --> 01:58:35,039
or if you're have seedlings uh in you

3076
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:37,320
know seedling trays same thing you know

3077
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:40,000
that that presents a problem that's very

3078
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:42,759
difficult so um one trick I've learned I

3079
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:46,800
should throw out there is uh you know

3080
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:48,440
those groan uh taller orange they use

3081
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,920
the a I don't know if you have those

3082
01:58:48,439 --> 01:58:51,439
there but anyone in the United States is

3083
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,679
going to know what I'm talking about

3084
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:56,519
they rise up above the the seedling flat

3085
01:58:54,679 --> 01:58:59,719
um and they keep them separated then you

3086
01:58:56,520 --> 01:59:03,040
space them out every other um cell

3087
01:58:59,719 --> 01:59:05,599
you'll use and this not a bulletproof

3088
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:07,599
you know solution the best thing to do

3089
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:09,078
is to keep each plant in its own tray

3090
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:11,279
but that's not always the you know even

3091
01:59:09,078 --> 01:59:13,679
here at the facility we we have

3092
01:59:11,279 --> 01:59:15,279
different strains in a single tray but

3093
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:17,239
then when you water them you know we

3094
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:19,840
used to like just flood the trays with

3095
01:59:17,238 --> 01:59:21,399
water easy enough drain it out you don't

3096
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,760
want to do that anymore you know it's

3097
01:59:21,399 --> 01:59:26,118
been years since I've done that it's

3098
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:28,520
been years since I've had that uh you

3099
01:59:26,118 --> 01:59:30,719
know that easy way of watering my clones

3100
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:33,239
so what I do now is you can take a

3101
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:36,399
turkey baster and water each one

3102
01:59:33,238 --> 01:59:38,319
individually um that takes that takes

3103
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:40,960
more time and all this takes more time

3104
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:43,238
of course um but one thing I've learned

3105
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:45,639
is you can take that tray out and I'll

3106
01:59:43,238 --> 01:59:48,238
put it like on a on a metal wire rack

3107
01:59:45,639 --> 01:59:51,880
over a sink or some other kind of catch

3108
01:59:48,238 --> 01:59:54,839
pan and then I'll Water it from top down

3109
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:57,000
with with a a drram seed waterer so

3110
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:59,239
that's like a a a shower head but a

3111
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,118
really small one meant for seedlings so

3112
01:59:59,238 --> 02:00:03,238
it's less pressure and then I'll just do

3113
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,319
a top down so all the runoff just goes

3114
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:07,078
right into the vessel that's a quick way

3115
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:09,439
of doing it use a lot more nutrient

3116
02:00:07,078 --> 02:00:10,960
solution but hey you know it's a lot

3117
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:12,279
cheaper than remediating for hop late

3118
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,359
and virid or even dealing with the

3119
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:16,719
nightmare of it um that's a trick I've

3120
02:00:14,359 --> 02:00:18,679
learned that I I can share but as far as

3121
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:20,480
what you're asking your your listener

3122
02:00:18,679 --> 02:00:21,760
asked about the seeds I don't really

3123
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:23,759
think there's anything special you need

3124
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:25,719
to do here you know I really don't you

3125
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:27,560
just you always want to have the

3126
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:30,399
protocol you want to always act like you

3127
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:31,599
have hop plate and virid even if you are

3128
02:00:30,399 --> 02:00:34,359
pretty sure you don't because you're

3129
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:36,800
never 100% sure you don't it can show up

3130
02:00:34,359 --> 02:00:39,799
in Plants weeks after you've tested you

3131
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:42,079
know like you can testing um you can

3132
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:43,840
test a plant hotl en virid it can be you

3133
02:00:42,078 --> 02:00:45,799
know plants can outgrow it it's a tricky

3134
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:48,599
thing it's not it's not something you

3135
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:50,239
can see it's not something you can you

3136
02:00:48,599 --> 02:00:52,239
know have any kind of sense of you just

3137
02:00:50,238 --> 02:00:53,879
have to assume it's there it's it's like

3138
02:00:52,238 --> 02:00:55,959
electricity you can't see it but you're

3139
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:57,480
not going to go touch that thing you

3140
02:00:55,960 --> 02:00:59,039
know you have to treat it the same way

3141
02:00:57,479 --> 02:01:01,479
you have to you have to develop your

3142
02:00:59,039 --> 02:01:02,920
protocol I mean I'll be happy to help

3143
02:01:01,479 --> 02:01:04,959
that's something I always think I remind

3144
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:09,319
myself I should do is kind of make one

3145
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:10,359
for people to share um but so you know I

3146
02:01:09,319 --> 02:01:11,519
don't think there's anything special

3147
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:14,479
about C you don't really have to do

3148
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,599
anything special you know just I guess

3149
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:17,238
the reason I say that is because you

3150
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:18,520
should already be doing whatever it is

3151
02:01:17,238 --> 02:01:20,359
that you have to do to keep your space

3152
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:24,520
clean you know you want the best chance

3153
02:01:20,359 --> 02:01:24,519
for Success you know like use

3154
02:01:25,078 --> 02:01:28,439
bleach you should be on top of it

3155
02:01:27,078 --> 02:01:30,198
already I like that I like that all

3156
02:01:28,439 --> 02:01:31,719
right well look I got one more question

3157
02:01:30,198 --> 02:01:33,319
before we jump into some of the final

3158
02:01:31,719 --> 02:01:35,198
ones before we wrap things up and I

3159
02:01:33,319 --> 02:01:37,198
think it's a good question actually one

3160
02:01:35,198 --> 02:01:39,879
of our listeners wanted to know do you

3161
02:01:37,198 --> 02:01:42,439
have any predictions on how the launch

3162
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:45,760
of the grateful Head might affect the

3163
02:01:42,439 --> 02:01:47,719
seed Market and I myself thought you

3164
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:50,079
know some people might have a knee-jerk

3165
02:01:47,719 --> 02:01:52,920
response and think oh everyone will be

3166
02:01:50,078 --> 02:01:54,920
able to do their own TK cross great but

3167
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:57,480
I also think the opposite is true as

3168
02:01:54,920 --> 02:02:00,000
well everyone now has access to a super

3169
02:01:57,479 --> 02:02:01,879
rare maloi that they maybe otherwise

3170
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,760
couldn't get and you could get some

3171
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:05,400
really unique offerings coming out

3172
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:07,320
because people have such a greater

3173
02:02:05,399 --> 02:02:08,879
access to genetics have you thought

3174
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:11,799
about this you have any predictions

3175
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:13,480
what's your thoughts well I'm you know

3176
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:15,440
as you know I make seeds it's you know

3177
02:02:13,479 --> 02:02:17,839
one of the things that I do so I have

3178
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:20,799
thought about a lot um even before the

3179
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:22,960
Grateful head and you know I've we've

3180
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:25,000
all seen this trend more and more clones

3181
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:27,439
becoming available maybe because of the

3182
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,439
hemp the farm bill act allowing plants

3183
02:02:27,439 --> 02:02:32,638
to not be cannabis anymore now it's hemp

3184
02:02:30,439 --> 02:02:35,919
um because you there's no THC in in

3185
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:37,760
Plants um but colone lonies have been

3186
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,719
you know I've seen the trend where more

3187
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,719
and more them are available like I was

3188
02:02:39,719 --> 02:02:44,920
saying earlier the thing is is um you

3189
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:47,319
know how are the producers doing it are

3190
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:51,279
they are they you know are they

3191
02:02:47,319 --> 02:02:52,799
selecting things to produce that are you

3192
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:56,319
know what they're supposed to be you

3193
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:57,960
know um are they are they using clean

3194
02:02:56,319 --> 02:02:59,920
practices you know to make sure they're

3195
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:02,000
not you know it's a big responsibility

3196
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:03,840
to start selling live plants to people

3197
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,560
because you could potentially wreck

3198
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,920
their world with a disease I mean you

3199
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:09,599
could you could really mess things up

3200
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:13,560
for humans and for you know regions of

3201
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:15,800
[ __ ] cannabis um so I I have thought

3202
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:17,280
about that so I would say that the

3203
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:20,239
availability of

3204
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:22,719
clones has definitely affected seed

3205
02:03:20,238 --> 02:03:24,959
sales I I've seen I've seen a few

3206
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:26,760
breeders kind of uh closing up shop I

3207
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,960
believe recently in the last few weeks

3208
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:32,840
you know I can't say that it's related

3209
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:34,480
but I assume it is um but on a larger on

3210
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:38,239
a larger picture I'd say that it's

3211
02:03:34,479 --> 02:03:41,198
actually going to help because you

3212
02:03:38,238 --> 02:03:43,519
know breeding is not centralized it's

3213
02:03:41,198 --> 02:03:46,558
there's not it's not Coke and Pepsi you

3214
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:48,800
know um breeding is is vast I mean

3215
02:03:46,559 --> 02:03:50,840
anybody can create amazing [ __ ] [ __ ]

3216
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:52,440
we see it all the time we see people all

3217
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:55,880
the time come out of the work with

3218
02:03:52,439 --> 02:03:58,000
amazing you know uh you know genetics to

3219
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:00,078
sell and Seed form uh things that

3220
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,920
they've created things that are unique

3221
02:04:00,078 --> 02:04:03,840
um so I think there's going to be more

3222
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,559
of that I think that the grateful Head

3223
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:09,279
is going to further

3224
02:04:05,559 --> 02:04:11,960
decentralize uh genetics um not only in

3225
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:14,279
Clone ones that we offer but also the

3226
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:16,198
Creations that come from people being

3227
02:04:14,279 --> 02:04:18,439
able to obtain clone only that were

3228
02:04:16,198 --> 02:04:20,799
previously unobtainable for them you

3229
02:04:18,439 --> 02:04:22,279
know that were unavailable to them uh

3230
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:24,119
for whatever reason

3231
02:04:22,279 --> 02:04:25,840
so I I've thought about this a lot and I

3232
02:04:24,118 --> 02:04:27,359
really do think that it's going to open

3233
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:30,078
up the doors

3234
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:33,198
to I mean I'm sure there's going to be a

3235
02:04:30,078 --> 02:04:34,840
lot of people who breed and sell seeds

3236
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:36,799
who are going to you know wish that this

3237
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:38,159
kind of thing wasn't happening but it's

3238
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:39,679
one of those things where you know the

3239
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:41,558
writing's already on the wall we didn't

3240
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:43,000
put it there it's already there and this

3241
02:04:41,559 --> 02:04:47,119
is where we're going this is just the

3242
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:49,520
next evolution in cannabis um you know

3243
02:04:47,118 --> 02:04:51,118
five six seven eight years ago you know

3244
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:52,599
people weren't sending clones like this

3245
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:54,920
they weren't doing that but now it's you

3246
02:04:52,599 --> 02:04:57,880
know you turn on Facebook or you turn

3247
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:59,679
you know Instagram or even Facebook you

3248
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:01,118
know I don't go on Facebook but uh I had

3249
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:02,760
a friend I had to wish happy birthday

3250
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:05,078
and I went on there and I was bombarded

3251
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:07,960
with uh you know clone selling

3252
02:05:05,078 --> 02:05:09,920
advertisements you know you know so it's

3253
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:12,800
like it's everywhere it's becoming

3254
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,239
mainstream and um I think as far as

3255
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:16,559
breeding goes this is going to open up

3256
02:05:14,238 --> 02:05:19,959
the door to more unique breeding

3257
02:05:16,559 --> 02:05:22,119
projects because you know from my

3258
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:25,118
perspective I I I guess I kind of appli

3259
02:05:22,118 --> 02:05:27,359
to that um you might have like a great

3260
02:05:25,118 --> 02:05:30,359
idea like you may have smoked a cult of

3261
02:05:27,359 --> 02:05:31,920
art you know a friend hat or you know

3262
02:05:30,359 --> 02:05:33,598
smelled some weed that someone had or

3263
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:35,039
whatever and you're like gez you know

3264
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:36,520
that kind of gives me an idea like if

3265
02:05:35,039 --> 02:05:38,519
you took this and did that and then

3266
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:40,199
crossed this that might be something

3267
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:41,719
amazing like that was that's the thing

3268
02:05:40,198 --> 02:05:43,839
I'm looking for that would make this

3269
02:05:41,719 --> 02:05:46,639
project that's kind of you know in the

3270
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:49,199
back of my head like in my dreams in the

3271
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:51,199
back of my dreams come to live but you

3272
02:05:49,198 --> 02:05:52,879
know to go get that cultivar or to hunt

3273
02:05:51,198 --> 02:05:54,598
it down to be part you know to get it

3274
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:57,520
into your life that could be a process

3275
02:05:54,599 --> 02:05:59,760
and along with that so I think that when

3276
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:02,400
you eliminate that part and you can

3277
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,840
allow someone just to Simply thumb

3278
02:06:02,399 --> 02:06:07,039
through a library their creativity can

3279
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:10,279
get sparked I know that like I said I

3280
02:06:07,039 --> 02:06:11,439
apply it to my own way of thinking and I

3281
02:06:10,279 --> 02:06:13,719
I think that it's just going to open up

3282
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:15,439
the door to more interesting I think you

3283
02:06:13,719 --> 02:06:19,520
know we have you know cannabis's you

3284
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:22,319
know is really kind of you know it's

3285
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:25,000
it's like you know we we we could use

3286
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:26,920
more variety I think you like it seems

3287
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,800
kind of weird to say that but but

3288
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:30,158
honestly even with all the different

3289
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:32,480
cold doors we have there's there's

3290
02:06:30,158 --> 02:06:34,558
really there's a there's some C there's

3291
02:06:32,479 --> 02:06:36,959
categories that kind of dominate this

3292
02:06:34,559 --> 02:06:38,719
the space and they're not that different

3293
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:40,158
you know they're there and then even the

3294
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:42,239
stuff that the older schools like the

3295
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:44,638
chem stuff like it's not that different

3296
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:46,279
from each other you know like um I think

3297
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:47,960
that it's going to kind of make a whole

3298
02:06:46,279 --> 02:06:49,158
new categories I really think that

3299
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:50,760
there's possible it's going to make

3300
02:06:49,158 --> 02:06:54,319
whole new categories of flavors out

3301
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:57,159
there you know but I think that the guy

3302
02:06:54,319 --> 02:06:59,319
you know who's passionate about cannabis

3303
02:06:57,158 --> 02:07:01,158
who's you know got the day job and he's

3304
02:06:59,319 --> 02:07:03,158
got the family to tend to he's got the

3305
02:07:01,158 --> 02:07:04,960
tent I talk to guys like this all the

3306
02:07:03,158 --> 02:07:06,359
time selling seeds to them you know I

3307
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:08,760
constantly am always emailing these

3308
02:07:06,359 --> 02:07:10,118
folks answering their questions and like

3309
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:12,639
to me they're the ones that have the

3310
02:07:10,118 --> 02:07:15,439
most passion you know they're the ones

3311
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:17,639
that have the most like you know heart

3312
02:07:15,439 --> 02:07:19,118
in it and I think that they're the ones

3313
02:07:17,639 --> 02:07:21,239
that are going to bring us the next

3314
02:07:19,118 --> 02:07:24,479
[ __ ] amazing thing and that's that's

3315
02:07:21,238 --> 02:07:26,078
why we're trying to keep a contact a

3316
02:07:24,479 --> 02:07:28,158
connection a relationship with those

3317
02:07:26,078 --> 02:07:29,158
fellas and ladies because they're the

3318
02:07:28,158 --> 02:07:30,519
ones that are going to bring the next

3319
02:07:29,158 --> 02:07:32,759
thing to the table and we want to be

3320
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:34,960
part of it you know we want to help them

3321
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:36,360
show what they do and what they're

3322
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:38,439
capable of and what they've done to the

3323
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:40,519
world you know so I don't think it's

3324
02:07:38,439 --> 02:07:43,319
gonna I think it's gonna change the seed

3325
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:45,320
game but not in a bad way I love that I

3326
02:07:43,319 --> 02:07:47,840
love that so now I'm going to turn the

3327
02:07:45,319 --> 02:07:49,799
tables on you you have to pick just

3328
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,559
three clones for the rest of your life

3329
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:55,599
from the Grateful head collection what

3330
02:07:51,559 --> 02:07:57,079
going to pick my God let me go just give

3331
02:07:55,599 --> 02:08:00,719
me a second all

3351
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:55,480
taste chem dog after being through

3352
02:08:54,319 --> 02:08:59,000
tissue

3353
02:08:55,479 --> 02:09:00,519
culture yes I have yep and it was

3354
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,078
different it was phenomenal it was

3355
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:04,639
really there was another layer that I

3356
02:09:03,078 --> 02:09:06,960
that I've been missing that I've missed

3357
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:08,440
over the years that was there you know

3358
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:10,239
and I mean that was a while ago that was

3359
02:09:08,439 --> 02:09:13,078
one of The Inspirations to get involved

3360
02:09:10,238 --> 02:09:15,879
with you know my own library before all

3361
02:09:13,078 --> 02:09:17,759
this stuff that's happening now um like

3362
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:19,239
wow this is real like I I've told you

3363
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:22,239
before like I started messing around

3364
02:09:19,238 --> 02:09:24,158
tissue culture in like 2006

3365
02:09:22,238 --> 02:09:26,718
we we had no idea the potential of it we

3366
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:27,679
just didn't know in cannabis you know

3367
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:31,719
and

3368
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:35,399
um um and that's where it's at that's

3369
02:09:31,719 --> 02:09:36,399
what's amazing um that that's uh that

3370
02:09:35,399 --> 02:09:37,879
that that's kind of one of The

3371
02:09:36,399 --> 02:09:39,158
Inspirations that was like man this has

3372
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:41,319
got to happen like there's something

3373
02:09:39,158 --> 02:09:43,598
more here you know when I first started

3374
02:09:41,319 --> 02:09:46,078
this like I never when I first dabbled

3375
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:48,599
into TSH I didn't even consider you know

3376
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:50,558
all the benefits to the plant's Health

3377
02:09:48,599 --> 02:09:51,920
you know it seemed to me more of a way

3378
02:09:50,559 --> 02:09:53,880
of a storing

3379
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:55,880
transporting you know simple [ __ ] you

3380
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:59,039
know stuff that it's really nothing to

3381
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:02,319
do with you know um tissue culture's

3382
02:09:59,039 --> 02:10:04,118
been around for over a hundred years um

3383
02:10:02,319 --> 02:10:06,039
every banana you eat comes from tissue

3384
02:10:04,118 --> 02:10:07,799
culture lots of the fruits you eat

3385
02:10:06,039 --> 02:10:09,279
strawberries you know all these things

3386
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:12,559
are propagated

3387
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:14,559
orchids um lot more and more things are

3388
02:10:12,559 --> 02:10:17,159
being you know house plants all house

3389
02:10:14,559 --> 02:10:19,960
plants are you know it's just a really

3390
02:10:17,158 --> 02:10:21,920
efficient way of propagating at the base

3391
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:24,639
and then more advanced there it's a way

3392
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:26,639
you know a lot of plants don't it's not

3393
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:29,039
necessary to keep them around forever

3394
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:30,800
you know like you know I I don't know

3395
02:10:29,039 --> 02:10:32,399
about bananas and strawberries and such

3396
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:35,599
but you could probably replace a lot of

3397
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:36,879
those things if you need to um cannabis

3398
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:39,760
isn't like that you know there's certain

3399
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:41,920
colds that you cannot replace and well

3400
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:45,520
none of them you can really replace and

3401
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:49,158
so the ones we love anyway and so when I

3402
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:51,840
discovered like the the Vigor the the

3403
02:10:49,158 --> 02:10:54,158
the the flavor coming back you know all

3404
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:56,480
that stuff the the aroma you know and

3405
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:58,359
Kim dog was the one that turned me on to

3406
02:10:56,479 --> 02:11:01,000
that of course because I have the most

3407
02:10:58,359 --> 02:11:04,279
experience in my life with Kim dog so in

3408
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:06,198
my mind's memory I have a timeline of

3409
02:11:04,279 --> 02:11:08,359
you know whether I can perceive it at

3410
02:11:06,198 --> 02:11:10,399
any given moment doesn't matter it's

3411
02:11:08,359 --> 02:11:12,598
there of like where we started at what

3412
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:14,719
we fell in love with and what we're what

3413
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:17,039
we have now you know so when I

3414
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:18,520
experienced that you know the Vigor of

3415
02:11:17,039 --> 02:11:21,519
of of a plant that came out of tissue

3416
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:23,320
cult have been cleaned up in such a way

3417
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:25,920
I mean it was night and day I mean it's

3418
02:11:23,319 --> 02:11:28,840
it's it's a big difference I mean it's

3419
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:30,118
you can't deny it it's unreal you know

3420
02:11:28,840 --> 02:11:31,719
and it's amazing it's like a time

3421
02:11:30,118 --> 02:11:34,039
machine it's like going back in time

3422
02:11:31,719 --> 02:11:36,279
you're like wow and what a miracle you

3423
02:11:34,039 --> 02:11:37,519
know like you can't do that with humans

3424
02:11:36,279 --> 02:11:39,039
you can't do that with animals you

3425
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:41,920
certainly can do with plants and that's

3426
02:11:39,039 --> 02:11:44,559
what we're doing yeah what a beautiful

3427

3457
02:12:53,078 --> 02:12:57,920
production part is going smoothly we're

3458
02:12:55,479 --> 02:12:59,479
at the part now where we have roots and

3459
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:01,880
we're beginning to do

3460
02:12:59,479 --> 02:13:03,198
acclamation um you know you want to get

3461
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:04,639
them to a certain size where they can

3462
02:13:03,198 --> 02:13:06,158
ship we're not we're not going to be

3463
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:07,960
sending you like little tiny plantless a

3464
02:13:06,158 --> 02:13:09,399
lot of people been ask me that question

3465
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:11,158
um I've been getting that a lot you know

3466
02:13:09,399 --> 02:13:13,479
they've gotten tissue culture plants

3467
02:13:11,158 --> 02:13:14,679
like little tiny like sprig of a plant

3468
02:13:13,479 --> 02:13:17,000
these won't be like that these are going

3469
02:13:14,679 --> 02:13:19,880
to be more substantial like clone type

3470
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:21,599
plants um tissue culture plants are

3471
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:23,118
coming from vitro stero condition so

3472
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:25,400
they're not exactly like a traditional

3473
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:27,279
clone but they're going to be more

3474
02:13:25,399 --> 02:13:30,558
substantial than a lot of times what

3475
02:13:27,279 --> 02:13:32,000
people have seen um but we're on track

3476
02:13:30,559 --> 02:13:33,840
and we're not going to say a date

3477
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,238
because these are plants we want to make

3478
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:38,119
sure that we don't stay to a timeline we

3479
02:13:36,238 --> 02:13:41,439
stick more to the plants you know the

3480
02:13:38,118 --> 02:13:43,078
needs of what the plants need so um I

3481
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:45,558
think in the next two weeks I don't want

3482
02:13:43,078 --> 02:13:47,078
to overstep my my boundary here but I

3483
02:13:45,559 --> 02:13:49,119
think in the next two weeks we'll be

3484
02:13:47,078 --> 02:13:52,238
announcing the list as we get the

3485
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:55,198
numbers counted in and then and and then

3486
02:13:52,238 --> 02:13:57,678
August 5th is still our Target date um

3487
02:13:55,198 --> 02:13:59,519
and then it'll be about a two- we period

3488
02:13:57,679 --> 02:14:01,319
uh before the plants are no longer

3489
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,079
viable for sale

3490
02:14:01,319 --> 02:14:07,319
